<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in one’s Google location data. It’s willingly shared with Google. <a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/224489.P.pdf">United States v. Chatrie</a>, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 16692 (4th Cir. July 9, 2024) (2-1):</p><div>
<p>Location History is turned off by default, so a user must take several affirmative steps before Google begins tracking and storing his Location History data. First, he must enable location sharing on his mobile device. Second, he must opt in to the Location History setting on his Google account, either through an internet browser, a Google application (such as Google Maps), or his device settings (for Android devices). Before he can activate the setting, however, Google always presents him language that explains the basics of the service. Third, he must enable the “Location Reporting” feature on his mobile device. And fourth, he must sign in to his Google account on that device. Only when a user follows these steps will Google begin tracking and storing his Location History data. Roughly one-third of active Google users have enabled Location History.</p>



<p>Even after a user opts in, he maintains some control over his location data. He can review, edit, or delete any information that Google has already obtained. So, for instance, he could decide he only wants to keep data for certain dates and to delete the rest. Or he could decide to delete everything. Google also allows him to pause (i.e., disable) the collection of future Location History data. Whatever his choice, Google will honor it. From start to finish, then, the user controls how much Google tracks and stores his Location History data.</p>



<p>Once a user enables Location History, Google constantly monitors his location through GPS, even when he isn’t using his phone. And if he has an Android phone, he can turn on another setting—”Google Location Accuracy”—that enables Google to determine his location using more inputs than just GPS, such as Wi-Fi access points and mobile networks. As a result, Location History can be more precise than other location-tracking mechanisms, including cell-site location information. But whether Google Location Accuracy is activated or not, Location History’s power should not be exaggerated. In the end, it is only an estimate of a device’s location. So when Google records a set of location coordinates, it includes a value (measured in meters) called a “confidence interval,” which represents Google’s confidence in the accuracy of the estimate. Google represents that for any given location point, there is a 68% chance that a user is somewhere within the confidence interval.</p>



<p>Google stores all Location History data in a repository called the “Sensorvault.” The Sensorvault assigns each device a unique identification number and maintains all Location History data associated with that device. Google then uses this data to build aggregate models to assist applications like Google Maps.</p>



<p>In 2016, Google began receiving “geofence warrants” from law enforcement seeking to access location information. A geofence warrant requires Google to produce Location History data for all users who were within a geographic area (called a geofence) during a particular time period. Since 2016, geofence requests have skyrocketed in number: Google claims it saw a 1,500% increase in requests from 2017 to 2018 and a 500% increase from 2018 to 2019. Concerned with the potential threat to user privacy, Google consulted internal counsel and law enforcement agencies in 2018 and developed its own three-step procedure for responding to geofence requests. Since then, Google has objected to any geofence request that disregards this procedure.</p>



<p>Google’s procedure works as follows: At Step One, law enforcement obtains a warrant [*8] that compels Google to disclose an anonymous list of users whose Location History shows they were within the geofence during a specified timeframe. But Google does not keep any lists like this on-hand. So it must first comb through its entire Location History repository to identify users who were present in the geofence. Google then gives law enforcement a list that includes for each user an anonymized device number, the latitude and longitude coordinates and timestamp of each location point, a confidence interval, and the source of the stored Location History (such as GPS or Wi-Fi). Before disclosing this information, Google reviews the request and objects if Google deems it overly broad.</p>



<p>At Step Two, law enforcement reviews the information it receives from Google. If it determines that it needs more, then law enforcement can ask Google to produce additional location coordinates. This time, the original geographical and temporal limits no longer apply; for any user identified at Step One, law enforcement can request information about his movements inside and outside the geofence over a broader period. Yet Google generally requires law enforcement to narrow its request for this more expansive location data to only a subset of the users pinpointed in Step One.</p>



<p>Finally, at Step Three, law enforcement determines which individuals are relevant to the investigation and then compels Google to provide their account-identifying information (usually their names and email addresses). Here, too, Google typically requires law enforcement to taper its request from the previous step, so law enforcement can’t merely request the identity of every user identified in Step Two.</p>
</div><p>Bloomberg: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/geofence-warrant-decision-exposes-hole-in-fourth-amendment-law">Geofence Warrant Decision Exposes Hole in Fourth Amendment Law</a> by Cassandre Coyer &amp; Tonya Riley (“A split appeals court opinion clearing the government’s acquisition of users’ mobile-device location data from Google of constitutional scrutiny will likely spark more friction between emerging technologies and the scope of law enforcement searches, attorneys warned. [¶] The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit’s ruling in US v. Chatrie concluded, over a dissent, that the use of such geofencing doesn’t constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.”)</p></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>BUTLER, Pa. (AP) — <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></span> was the target of an apparent assassination attempt Saturday at a Pennsylvania rally and said afterward that he was shot in the ear. The barrage of gunfire set off panic among thousands of attendees and a dramatic scene in which a bloodied Trump was surrounded by Secret Service and then escorted to his SUV as he pumped his first in a show of defiance. </p><p>Trump’s campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing “fine” after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p><p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place,” he wrote on his social media site.</p><p>Rallygoers screamed in panic. Shouts of “Get down!” rang through the crowd. At least one attendee was dead and two spectators were critically injured, authorities said. The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter — who it said attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue, a farm show in Butler, Pennsylvania — and that Trump was safe.</p><p>The attack was the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It came in a deeply polarized political atmosphere, just four months from the presidential elections and days before Trump is to be officially named the Republican nominee at <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/republican-national-convention">his party’s convention</a></span> — which his campaign said would proceed as planned. </p>
    


<p>“There’s no place in America for this type of violence,” President Joe Biden, who is running against Trump as the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in remarks. “It’s sick. It’s sick.”</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            </div><p>Two officials spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. They said the shooter was not an attendee at the rally and was killed by U.S. Secret Service agents. </p><p>The officials said the shooter was engaged by members of the U.S. Secret Service counterassault team. The heavily armed tactical team travels everywhere with the president and major party nominees and is meant to confront any active threats while other agents focus on safeguarding and evacuating the person at the center of protection.</p><p>Law enforcement recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene, according to a third person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.</p><p>Many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.”</p><p>There was no immediate information on the shooter or their motivations.</p>
    

    

    

<h2>A rally disrupted by gunfire</h2><p>Trump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the apparent shots began just after 6:10 p.m. It took two minutes from the moment of the first shot for Trump to be placed in a waiting SUV.</p><p>As Trump was talking, a popping sound was heard, and the former president put his right hand up to his right ear, as people in the stands behind him appeared to be shocked.</p>



<p>As the first pop rang out, Trump said, “Oh,” and grabbed his ear as two more pops could be heard and he crouched down. More shots were heard then.</p><p>Someone could be heard saying near the microphone at Trump’s lectern, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents tackled the former president. They piled atop him to shield him with their bodies, as is their training protocol, as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat.</p><div data-align-center="">

Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle. </p><h2>Witnesses heard multiple gunshots and ducked for cover</h2><p>“Everybody went to their knees or their prone position, because we all knew, everyone becoming aware of the fact this was gunfire,” said Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, who was sitting to Trump’s right on stage. </p><p>As he saw Trump raise his fist, McCormick said, he looked over his shoulder and noticed someone had been hit while sitting in the bleachers behind the stage. </p><p>Eventually, first responders were able to carry the injured person out of a large crowd so he could get medical care, McCormick said. </p><p>Reporters covering the rally heard five or six shots ring out and many ducked for cover, hiding under tables. After the first two or three bangs, people in the crowd looked startled, but not panicked. An AP reporter at the scene reported the noise sounded like firecrackers at first or perhaps a car backfiring.</p><p>When it was clear the situation had been contained and that Trump would not be returning to speak, attendees started filing out of the venue. One man in an electric wheelchair got stuck on the field when his chair’s battery died. Others tried to help him move.</p><div data-override-title="true" data-hide-title="false" data-align-center="" data-carousel-enhancement="">

        </div><p>Police soon told the people remaining to leave the venue and Secret Service agents told reporters to get “out now. This is a live crime scene.”</p><p>Two firefighters from nearby Steubenville, Ohio, who were at the rally told the AP that they helped people who appeared injured and heard bullets hitting broadcast speakers.</p><p>“The bullets rattled around the grandstand, one hit the speaker tower and then chaos broke. We hit the ground and then the police converged into the grandstands, said Chris Takach.</p><p>“The first thing I heard is a couple of cracks,” Dave Sullivan said.</p><p>Sullivan said he saw one of the speakers get hit and bullets rattling and, “we hit the deck.”</p><p>He said once Secret Service and other authorities converged on Trump, he and Takach assisted two people who may have been shot in the grandstand and cleared a path to get them out of the way.</p><p>“Just a sad day for America,” Sullivan said.</p><p>“After we heard the shots got fired, then the hydraulic line was spraying all around, you could see the hydraulic fluid coming out of it. And then the speaker tower started to fall down,” Sullivan said. “Then we heard another shot that, you could hear, you knew something was, it was bullets. It wasn’t firecrackers.”</p><h2>Political violence again shakes America</h2><p>The perils of campaigning took on a new urgency after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in California in 1968, and again in 1972 when Arthur Bremer shot and seriously hurt George Wallace, who was running as an independent on a campaign platform that has sometimes been compared to Trump’s. That led to increased protection of candidates, even as the threats persisted, notably against Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008.</p><p>Presidents, particularly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, have even greater layers of security. Trump is a rarity as both a former president and a current candidate.</p><p>Biden was briefed on the incident, the White House said. He received an updated briefing from Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall.</p><p>He told reporters after 8 p.m. that he hadn’t been able to reach Trump yet but was briefed that the former president was “doing well.”</p><p>“I hope I get to speak to him tonight,” he said. </p><p>Mayorkas, whose department oversees the Secret Service, said officials were engaged with the Biden and Trump campaigns and “taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.”</p><p>Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., posted a photo on X of Trump, his fist raised and his face bloody in front of an American flag, with the words: “He’ll never stop fighting to Save America.”</p><p>North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the three men on Trump’s shortlist for vice president, all quickly sent out statements expressing concern for the former president, with Rubio sharing an image taken as Trump was escorted off stage with his fist in the air and a streak of blood on his face along with the words “God protected President Trump.”</p><p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said in a statement on X that he had been briefed on the situation and Pennsylvania state police were on hand at the rally site.</p><p>“Violence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable. It has no place in Pennsylvania or the United States,” he said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Colvin, Balsamo and Price reported from New York. Long reported from Washington.

<p>The incident unfolded as Trump was giving a speech at the rally in Pennsylvania. Suddenly, he appeared to fall to the ground clutching his ear.</p><p>He was quickly surrounded by armed security and stayed down for around a minute. Screams from the audience rang out as the scene unfolded.</p><p>Trump then rose to his feet, pumped his fist in the air, and shouted "fight", before being whisked off stage and into a vehicle.</p><p>He was quickly driven away from the scene. Video appeared to show blood coming from his ear as he left the stage.</p><p>The US Secret Service said Trump was now "safe" and that it had implemented protective measures around him.</p>     <div data-component-name="sdc-article-strapline">

immutable. All API access is secured with mutual TLS (mTLS)
authentication.</p></div><div><h3>Predictability</h3><p>Talos eliminates configuration drift, reduces unknown factors by
employing immutable infrastructure ideology, and delivers atomic
updates.</p></div><div><h3>Evolvability</h3><p>Talos simplifies your architecture, increases your agility, and always
delivers current stable Kubernetes and Linux versions.</p></div></div></div><div><h2>Features</h2><div><div><h3>Minimal</h3><p>Talos consists of only a handful of binaries and shared libraries:
just enough to run containerd and a small set of system services.</p><p>This aligns with NIST's recommendation in the Application Container
Security Guide.</p></div><div><h3>Hardened</h3><p>Hardened by design:</p><ul><li>Built with the Kernel Self Protection Project configuration
recommendations.</li><li>All access to the API is secured with Mutual TLS.</li><li>Settings and configuration described in the CIS guidelines are
applied by default.</li></ul></div><div><h3>Immutable</h3><p>Talos improves security further by mounting the root filesystem as
read-only and removing any host-level such as a shell and SSH.</p></div><div><h3>Ephemeral</h3><p>Talos runs in memory from a SquashFS, and persists nothing, leaving
the primary disk entirely to Kubernetes.</p></div><div><h3>Current</h3><p>Delivers the latest stable versions of Kubernetes and Linux.</p></div></div></div><div><p><img width="142" src="https://www.talos.dev/images/certified-kubernetes-color.png" alt="Certified Kubernetes"></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

        <h2>This is a motherfucking website.</h2>
        
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It fucking works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>

        - 13th July 2024
        </p><p>
        
TL;DR: I created a patch called EmperorLauncher, which modifies Emperor: Battle for Dune to run well on modern systems, with:
</p><ul>
    <li>High resolution support</li>
    <li>Working online multiplayer with direct ip connection</li>
    <li>Coop Campaign mode</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download the patch <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/releases/download/v1.0/EmperorLauncher.v1.0.zip">here</a>, and the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher">on github</a>.</p>

<p>Me and a friend playing Coop Campaign in 4K</p>
<p>The rest of this blog post is a fairly technical explanation of how and why I made this thing.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="table_of_contents">Table of Contents</h2>
<h3 id="what_is_emperor">What is Emperor: Battle for Dune?</h3>
<p>Emperor: Battle for Dune is a 2001 realtime strategy game made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_Studios">Westwood Studios</a>, arguably the inventors of the RTS genre. It is a sequel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_2000">Dune 2000</a>, itself a remake of sorts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II">Dune II</a>, considered by many to be the original RTS. The Dune RTSes hold a special place in my heart, with Dune 2000 being the first PC game I ever bought, and my introduction to the Dune universe. Emperor followed up on Dune 2000, bringing 3D graphics, vastly improved UX, and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOxuQBe_cL8&amp;list=PL4E8A872850C1B3AB&amp;index=29">absolutely bangin' soundtrack</a>. All that said, it isn't that well known these days. I suspect this is because it was outshone by Westwood's other RTS series, the juggernaut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/cnc_vs_dune.jpg" title="RA2 came out in 2000, a year before before Emperor. Google trends doesn't go back further than 2004."></p><p>Google trends, 2004-2010</p>
<h3 id="whats_wrong">What's wrong with it?</h3><p>
A lot. The years have not been kind to Emperor:
</p><ul>
    <li>The game can't run at higher resolutions afforded by modern screens</li>
    <li>Game simulation speed is uncapped in multiplayer, rendering it unplayably fast</li>
    <li>Westwood Online (WOL) doesn't work anymore, so you can't play multiplayer except through LAN</li>
    <li>You can't play the campaign in coop mode at all, because that was an online-only feature not supported over LAN</li>
    <li>The installer included on the disk is broken</li>
    <li>And finally, many visual effects are broken by the high framerates of modern PCs</li>
</ul>

<p>Main menu in seizure mode</p>
<p>I love coop games, and I always wished more RTSes in particular had a coop mode. When I found out all these years later that Emperor had a coop mode that I'd never known about, and it was no longer playable - I knew in that moment, deep in my heart, that this was a cosmic injustice that must be put to rights. I also just had a hankerin' to do some reverse engineering, so...</p>
<h3 id="how_do_we_fix_it">How do we fix this mess?</h3>
<p>I started off with a modest initial goal. The "main" exe of the game is a misdirection: Emperor.exe is a thin wrapper that runs the real game executable, Game.exe. But if we run Game.exe directly, nothing happens. So my initial goal was to make a replacement for Emperor.exe, so I could control the launch of Game.exe. Later on, once I have this control, I can use it to inject a DLL containing my patches. More details on that later.</p>
<p>At this point I hopped into IDA to see what else Emperor.exe was doing other than calling CreateProcess.</p>
<details id="what_is_ida">
    <summary>What is IDA?</summary>
    <div>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Disassembler">IDA</a> is the industry standard reverse engineering tool. It is an incredibly powerful tool that operates on a database of knowledge about your executable. At its core it is a disassembler (IDA - Interactive DisAssembler), which turns machine code into slightly more readable textual assembly language.</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_runCommand_asm.jpg"></p><p>Part of a disassembled function from Emperor.exe</p>
            <p>It is also able to go one step further than that, and decompile the assembly into mostly-compilable C code. It will need some help from you, though. At the beginning, it will not know the types of anything. All the datastructures and typedefs are completely gone, everything is just an integer or int*, functions have been inlined, or optimised out entirely, and everything has names like sub_402E80 or a2.</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_runCommand.jpg"></p><p>The same code, decompiled into C</p>
            <p>As you browse through the code, you annotate things that you know. For example, in the function above I was able to look at the pointer that was being passed in, and see which offsets were being used. Since CreateProcessA is a known, documented Windows API function I was able to infer what was contained in some of those offsets. Using that knowledge, I was able to create a custom structure definition (ProcessRunData) with some fields filled in. Now I have a type for the parameter, so I can search for callers and annotate the type of the variable being passed to runCommand. And oh look, I'm using some of the fields in ProcessRunData with some other functions and variables, so now I know their type too. In this fashion, you could slowly flood-fill information through the whole binary until you had a full understanding of the whole program if you wanted to. That would of course be incredibly laborious for a game this size.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>This is probably a good time to mention that I am not a skilled reverse engineer. I'm definitely not a professional, and this is my first real foray into reverse engineering a binary like this. Cosmic justice aside, the main reason for this project was learning about reverse engineering for fun. So all that said, I spent the next couple of evenings reverse engineering a curious set of string manipulation functions that turned out to just be std::ostringstream.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_badnames.webp"></p><p>Behold, function names</p>
<p>Eventually I dug myself out of that rabbit-hole, and found out what Emperor.exe was doing that was so special. Before running Game.exe, it <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/EmperorLauncher.cpp#L40">creates a mutex, and an anonymous file mapping handle</a> - essentially just a chunk of allocated memory with a handle associated to it. It doesn't do much with the mutex, as far as I can tell just using it to make sure there is only one instance of the game running, but it does something odd with the file mapping. It launches Game.exe with bInheritHandles set to 1. This means the child process "inherits" our handles - it is able to use the same numeric value of the open file mapping handle, as though it had opened it itself. Emperor.exe then loads some data from the file Emperor.dat in the install directory, and does a bunch of manipulation to that data, presumably some sort of decryption. It then maps the mapping handle, and copies the decrypted data into the mapping.</p>
<p>So now we have some decrypted data in a mapping. The mapping handle is valid in both processes, so the child process can use the handle to retrieve the data that the launcher stored. But the child process doesn't know what the handle's value is. So the parent needs to send it somehow. Windows has an IPC message passing system where threads have <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/about-messages-and-message-queues">Message Queues</a>. This is used as the basis of window functionality - windows (HWNDs, actual window objects) use this queue to send and receive the messages that make them work.</p>
<p>The parent process tells the child the handle value by sending a message to the main thread of the child, using <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/EmperorLauncher.cpp#L124">0xBEEF</a> as the custom message ID, because why not. This works because CreateProcessA will actually tell the parent process the thread ID of the main thread of the newly created child process. I didn't really want to reverse engineer the decryption code, so I created a <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/tree/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/CommsDataDumper">dumping tool</a> that I could sub in in place of Game.exe, which reads the data sent to it and dumps it to disk.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/dumptruck.jpg"></p><p>Not that kind of dumping tool</p>
<p>Turns out the data was "UIDATA,3DDATA,MAPS", three strings that get passed to a bunch of asset loading code, making sure the game cannot work without them. From that point it was simple enough to write some code to perform the sequence myself, and I was able to start Game.exe successfully.</p>
<h3 id="patch_injection">Patch injection</h3>
<p>Now we get to the real meat and potatoes of this project - injecting our custom patches into Game.exe. We can force a process to load and run our code by using the ol' CreateRemoteThread &amp; LoadLibrary trick.</p>
<details id="createremote_loadlibrary">
    <summary>Excuse me, what trick is that?</summary>
    <div>
            <p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread">CreateRemoteThread</a> is a Windows API function that takes a "ThreadProc" function pointer, argument pointer, and process handle as arguments. The process handle is normally a handle representing the calling process, but not this time. When CreateRemoteThread is called, it creates a thread in the target process, which runs the passed function with the passed argument. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> is a Windows API function that takes a string path, and loads the DLL located at that path into the process. DLLs on windows can have a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dllmain">dllmain</a> function which will be called when the DLL is loaded.</p>
            <p>A function suitable to be passed to CreateRemoteThread must take a single pointer argument. LoadLibrary is a function that takes a single pointer argument. Do you see where this horror show is going?</p>
            <p>So the only remaining problem is that we need to get the path to our DLL into the memory space of our target process. Not a problem, we can use our friends <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex">VirtualAllocEx</a> (which takes a process handle parameter), and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory">WriteProcessMemory</a> to allocate a buffer in the target process' memory, and copy our DLL path into it. We then grab the address of LoadLibrary and pass it, along with our newly created DLL path buffer, to CreateRemoteThread. A new thread gets created in the target process, and loads our DLL. The dllmain function present in that DLL runs, and boom! We have code execution, from here we are free to do whatever nefarious things we like.</p>
            <p>Wait a minute, how do we know the address of CreateRemoteThread in the target process? Windows does have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">ASLR</a>, so DLLs are loaded at random addresses for security reasons. You would think this would make it impossible for us to know where CreateRemoteThread is located in another process. Well, bizarrely, we can just use the address of CreateRemoteThread in the current process. Windows does randomise DLL base addresses, but it will randomise on first load, then <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=93301">try to use the same address in every process after that</a>. Documentation on this is hard to find (if you do find something concrete, please let me know), and Raymond does only say the kernel will "try" to use the same address, but in practice there seems to be a special rule for some basic DLLs, like Kernel32.dll (which contains LoadLibrary), so they are always loaded at the same address on a given boot, to enable procedures like this one. Even if it isn't documented, this is a well known technique, which is used in <em>all sorts of things</em> out in the wild, including, I'm sure, some Microsoft products - so by now it's not something they could afford to break.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>So, if we start the process in a suspended state, then inject a dll, we get code execution in the target process before main is run. But what we really need is to modify existing functions in the Game.exe binary. How do we do that? In short, we use the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Detours">detours</a> library<a href="#foot-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<details id="what_is_detours">
    <summary>What is detours?</summary>
    <div>
            <p>Detours is the real black magic of this world. It is the arcane invocation that dispenses with arbitrary social constructs, and cuts straight to the fundamental truth of the machine. Types are an illusion. Data structures don't exist. There is only functions. And detours patches functions.</p>
            <p>Let's say we want to wrap a function from the standard library with some logging, in this example we'll use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-sendto">sendto</a>. We want to replace all calls to sendo with our modified function, which does some logging, and then calls the real sendto function. Something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/sendto_wrap.webp"></p><p>We can grab a pointer to the original sendto function pretty easily:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/sendto_load.webp"></p><p>Then comes the real magic. We can just edit the bytes of the original function, replacing the first instruction with the opcode for an unconditional jump to our patched function. It's a little bit more involved than just <code>memcpy(&amp;sendto, &amp;jumpCode, sizeof(jumpCode));</code> though. Memory pages containing functions are not writable for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX">security reasons</a>, so we need to set it writable with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect">VirtualProtect</a>, edit the function, then set it back. We then need to call <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache">FlushInstructionCache</a>, because otherwise we could end up with different instructions in cache vs memory which could cause a multitude of problems. And of course, we need to be sure that while we're doing all this, there isn't some other thread executing the code we're modifying. In our case we're executing our hooks before main runs, so we know there are no other threads to worry about.</p>
            <p>Ok, so now we've redirected the original function to our replacement, but there's one thing missing. If we want to wrap the original function, not just replace it, then we need a pointer we can call to run the original, unpatched code. But we've just stomped all over it by replacing random instructions with an unconditional jump. This is where the real genius of detours comes in. The library will take note of the instructions it ruined, copy them to a newly allocated chunk of memory somewhere, and set up a little wrapper function. That function contains the copied instructions, followed by a jump instruction that jumps back into the original code, just after the last broken instruction. As you can imagine, there is <em>a lot</em> of subtlety here, especially when dealing with an instruction set like x86, where not all opcodes are the same length. The end result is you can do something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/sendto_detour.webp"></p><p>sendto_orig now points at the magic generated chunk, so it behaves exactly like the original function, while the original sendto address is now set up to jump straight into our wrapper, leaving us free to call the original function from inside our wrapper.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>Now I can take the addresses of functions that I found and figured out in IDA, and wrap / replace them with detours. During my miscellaneous poking around in IDA, I noticed several calls that looked like some sort of debug logging function. When I looked at the function being called though, it was empty, just a return instruction. I hooked up a detour which forwarded the log message on to vprintf, but no luck, the process just crashes - a segfault inside vprintf.</p>
<p>The problem with this function is that it's not one function, it's many functions. My guess is that in the original source code, there were a bunch of debugging functions that were behind #ifdef DEBUG, and in release builds they were replaced with empty functions. This, combined with things like empty virtual functions to satisfy inheritance, means the final binaries end up with a lot of empty functions. They all compile to nothing but a single ret (return) instruction, and then the linker says "oh look, I have duplicated functions" and merges them into one location. Unfortunately, one of these empty functions is the debug logger.</p>
<p>My first attempt at solving this was to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/89df0a4378d62601681a389af5df703f1fb1ac29#diff-e404d91cbd33aed1d33216c0a473ac607f04d32ac4db75389a84131cb7a68396R23">use a heuristic</a> to detect if the parameters I've got look like a log string. The heuristic is pretty simple: if we interpret the first argument as a pointer to char, then we iterate a few bytes and check if those bytes are ASCII printable characters. If so - great, we have a log call, we can forward our parameters to vprintf. If not, then do nothing. There's also the obvious problem here that we can get all sorts of random values passed in here as a first parameter, and they're not all valid pointers at all, let alone pointers to null terminated strings. So, there's a pretty high chance we're going to segfault. But that's ok. Windows handles segfaults by throwing an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp?view=msvc-170">SEH exception</a>. We can catch and ignore the exception, then presume the call is not a logging call. Surprisingly, this actually worked pretty well.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/debug_log.webp" title="Digital Archaeology"></p><p>I wonder how long it's been since someone last read these log lines</p>
<p>That was cool, but not really enough. There were still false positives and false negatives, and false positives could still cause the game to crash. If I wanted to fix this for real, then I'd need to get in there and annotate every.&nbsp; single.&nbsp; call. I could give myself a bit of a head start though. I tightened up my heuristic to give no false positives (at the expense of some false negatives), and logged call sites by using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/intrinsics/addressofreturnaddress?view=msvc-170">AddressOfReturnAddress</a> intrinsic inside my detour.</p>
<p>What I really wanted was to separate the logging calls into a different function from the other empty function calls. Actually, two functions, because there were two variants of the logging function. IDA has a patching mode that allows you to make binary changes to the executable under analysis, without applying them to the real file on disk. It then uses those patches during disassembly and decompilation, so you get a virtualised view of how your patches will affect the binary. You can also dump the patches to a file, or apply them to the original binary.</p>
<p>The original empty function had a bunch of zeroed out padding bytes immediately following it, so I could patch in a few empty functions in that padding space by inserting ret instructions. Then I patch the actual logging calls to call one of the new empty functions, and later on I can detour that function to reenable logging. With an incomplete list of addresses from my heuristic dumper, I could use IDAs built in python scripting to patch known good call sites.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_patch_calls.png"></p><p>IDApython script to patch call sites with an offset</p>
<p>My heuristic worked pretty well for most of the call sites, but it was not all of them by a long shot. I wrote another python script to find unpatched call sites and apply some more heuristics, like looking for patterns of pushing a string constant before the call instruction. These got me another bunch of calls, but in the end I still had several hundred call sites that I just had to manually annotate. It took a few excruciatingly boring hours, but I got it done. I then exported the patch data, reformatted it as a C++ array, and <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchDebugLog.cpp">applied the patch at runtime</a>.</p>
<p>The reason I spent so long making sure the debug log was working so well, was that I had an intuition that it would end up being enormously helpful during the rest of the project. Actually, that's a lie, it was just a fun technical challenge and made me feel like a digital archaeologist. But hey - I had you fooled with that excuse right? Jokes aside, it really did help to have the original logs. For example, when I was working on getting multiplayer over WOL (Westwood Online) working, the client was hanging some time after receiving the game start command. By looking at the debug log, I could see a failed assert message: "MyId == INVALID_ID". I then searched IDA's strings view, jumped into the function where the assert was failing, and realised that it was the function which handles receipt of an SC_MESSAGE_YOUR_DETAILS message. A few lines above I saw that we had logged successfully receiving an SC_MESSAGE_YOUR_DETAILS message already. This tipped me off to look at my wireshark dumps, and I noticed that I was incorrectly sending a GAMEOPT command containing an SC_MESSAGE_YOUR_DETAILS message to all connected players instead of just the target. Without the debug log prompting me, I have no idea how long I would have taken to notice.</p>
<h3 id="patching_graphics">Patching graphics</h3>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/dx_overview.jpg"></p><p>Contemporary graphic design from the D3D7 era</p>
<p>Emperor was built with the then-current graphics API Direct3D 7. Broadly speaking, DirectX 8/9 is around when graphics APIs started to vaguely approximate the kind of feature set we expect today, moving away from a fixed-function pipeline and towards a modern shader-based world. DirectX 9 in particular, was still occasionally used up until quite recently, with some still-popular games still using it (for example CS:GO, which was only retired in 2023). I won't get into the weeds on graphics APIs here, but suffice it to say that Direct3D 7 support in modern windows is... patchy at best.</p>
<h4 id="window_management">High resolution windows</h4>
<p>One of the major issues is the resolution limit. From what I can tell, Direct3D7 on modern systems is implemented as some sort of wrapper layer that redirects to a more modern version of DirectX, like 9 or 11. Somewhere in that wrapper layer, the maximum texture size is being limited to 2048. Luckily, I was able to pull in some code from UCyborg's <a href="https://github.com/UCyborg/LegacyD3DResolutionHack/blob/master/d3dim.c">LegacyD3DResolutionHack</a> patch, which solved that problem for me<a href="#foot-2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>There was also another problem. The game cannot handle running at anything but a 4:3 ratio. Rendering works, but the UI is completely broken, like it's zoomed in way too far. Also the in-game mouse rendering has a broken offset, which varies depending on your distance from the centre of the screen<a href="#foot-3">[3]</a>.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/mouse_offset.mp4"></video>
<p>Mouse offset. The system cursor is where clicks really register.</p>
<p>So, we need some 4:3 letterboxing. This was actually surprisingly difficult. I tried just telling the game to render fullscreen at 2160x2880 (a 4:3 slice out of 4k), but it didn't like using arbitrary resolutions in fullscreen mode like that. The game does have a windowed mode though, accessible by passing -w in the command line args, and arbitrary resolutions are not a problem when windowed. But then we get an ugly floating window with a border, that doesn't cover up the taskbar. I tried <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/fc5538e8fa0c89208c112a4a6c0a4d1df37318f7#diff-e404d91cbd33aed1d33216c0a473ac607f04d32ac4db75389a84131cb7a68396R229">a bunch</a> of <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/abed24c94af91b28e8f42ce4c444a3c8c6ba34db#diff-e404d91cbd33aed1d33216c0a473ac607f04d32ac4db75389a84131cb7a68396R252">bad ideas</a>, but what worked in the end was a patch to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWindowManagement.cpp#L48">remove the border style, and reparent the game window</a> on top of a fullscreen black window. I also added <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWindowManagement.cpp#L155">mouse capture</a>, so edge scrolling isn't broken if you have multiple monitors, or want to play in windowed mode.</p>
<h4 id="patch_framerate_limit">Limiting framerate</h4>
<p>Next I <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/HookD3D7.cpp#L23">patched the IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene</a> method, to limit the FPS to 60.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/menu_calm.mp4"></video>
<p>Soooo much better</p>
<p>To limit the framerate to 60 FPS, we need to detect the current framerate, calculate the amount we need to delay, and then sleep the thread for that amount of time. To do that, we need to patch a function that is called once per frame, preferably at the very end of the frame. IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene fits the bill perfectly. But this was a little tricky, because IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene is not exported directly - it's a member function of a "lightweight COM" object created through a chain of COM method calls.</p>
<details id="what_is_lightweight_com">
    <summary>What is lightweight COM?</summary>
    <div>
            <p>COM is many things, but among other things it is a method of representing objects that allows us to have ABI stability. Lightweight COM (also known as nano COM) is a subset of COM concepts that focuses on that representation and ignores the rest.</p>
            <details id="what_is_abi_stability">
                <summary>What is ABI stability?</summary>
                <div>
                        <p>To understand ABI stability, let's take a step back and discuss API stability. API stability means that you provide a source-code level API that does not change, so consumers of that API can upgrade to new versions without having to change their code. ABI stability is taking this concept one step further for native code, and providing guarantees that consumers can upgrade your library <em>without recompiling</em>.</p>
                        <p>For example, if I add a new field to a struct that is part of my public interface, the API has not changed. Any code written against the old version can be successfully recompiled against the new version, and all is well. But an old <em>binary</em>, compiled against the old version will not work anymore. The compiler used information about the size of the struct, and the offsets of its members during compilation, and that information is now wrong. This binary interface is known as the ABI (Application Binary Interface). ABI stability is the practice of crafting updates to native code libraries without causing this kind of breakage.</p>
                    </div>
            </details>
            <p>Microsoft doesn't want to force everyone to recompile their DirectX apps every time they add a field to a class, so the COM object representation takes care of that. In essence, a COM object is a struct that contains, as its first member, a pointer to a table of functions (known as a vtable). Something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/com_lite.png"></p><p>When you're actually implementing a COM object in C++, Microsoft's MSVC compiler gives you a bit of help, but under the hood this is what you get. You could also implement a COM object in plain C, and in that case you would need to handle your layout manually. Under COM, you never access the members of a class directly, the consumer of your class only ever sees your vtable and a pointer to your class. This way, consumers never depend on the exact size or layout of the underlying struct, so you're free to change it.</p>
            <p>COM allows a single object to provide multiple interfaces, think of this like normal class inheritance, but with some extra possibilities. Each interface has its own base pointer, with its own vtable. You switch interface not by a simple cast, but by using a special QueryInterface function. There is also some reference counting going on, but that's not important to this discussion.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>To get a pointer to the IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene function, the application has to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Call DirectDrawCreateEx to get an IDirect3D7*</li>
    <li>Call IDirect3D7::CreateDevice to get an IDirect3DDevice7* </li>
    <li>Grab the function pointer from the vtable on the IDirect3DDevice7</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm confronted with a dilemma. I want to get the function pointer, but in order to do so I need to call a bunch of Direct3D functions that would create complicated objects, potentially interfering with the application. But maybe...</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/we_could_let_her_do_it.webp"></p><p>... maybe we could let the game create the objects</p>
<p>So in the end, what we do is the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Patch DirectDrawCreateEx on app start</li>
    <li>When DirectDrawCreateEx is called for the first time, before returning we use the IDirect3DDevice7 we just created to grab a pointer to IDirect3D7::CreateDevice, and patch that</li>
    <li>When IDirect3D7::CreateDevice is called for the first time, before returning we use the IDirect3DDevice7 we just created to grab a pointer to IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene and patch it to insert a frame rate limit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="patching_networking">Patching networking</h3>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/WOL.png"></p><p>It's got a 28.8 BPS modem</p>
<p>The next job is to get multiplayer working. What we want is a very basic version - no fancy lobbies, hosted servers or clan systems. Just forward ports and then copy/paste your friends IP to connect. Classic style, and most importantly requires no infrastructure so it won't break if I lose interest in maintaining it.</p>
<p>There's two roads we can go down here, patching LAN mode, or WOL (Westwood Online - the game's defunct online service). LAN mode is actually working, however it is not ideal for modern players. It depends on sending UDP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking)">broadcast</a> packets to announce servers, a commonly used trick in old LAN games. The idea is, when you host a game, you broadcast a special packet to all hosts on your LAN subnet, essentially announcing "I am running a game server". That lets the game show a list of lobbies in the LAN menu, so players can connect without having to open a cmd window and call out their IP address to eachother.</p>
<p>The downside is that, for obvious reasons, broadcast does not work online. And as the game has no way to specify an ip to connect to manually, there is no way to play with a friend online using this mode. I did initially work on allowing online play through LAN mode by <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/75618a09cc91cd2c9737e65b4b5b02e219f7105b">patching the LAN chat</a> to allow you to specify an IP to connect to, but once I realised there was a WOL-exclusive coop campaign mode I abandoned that approach.</p>
<p>There's two components to getting WOL working. We need to stand up a fake WOL master server so the game can figure out where to connect and what kind of game to start, and then we need to do some proxying of the game packets to make it work over a direct IP connection. Surprisingly enough, there is an master server running at <a href="https://xwis.net/">xwis.net</a>. From what I can tell, it's fan run, and at time of writing they have access to the original DNS entries used by the game (servserv.westwood.com). Emperor is not really working out of the box on xwis though, so despite them mentioning Emperor on their homepage, I think it's really only used for other Westwood games in the Command &amp; Conquer series. Still, it's enough to make and join a lobby so we'll start with the packet proxying and come back to the master server issue later. </p>
<h4 id="packets_must_flow">The packets must flow</h4>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/packets_must_flow.webp"></p><p>You're probably wondering "why the hell is he talking about proxying packets, I thought he wanted a direct connection". Well, I do. But there's a problem. Emperor uses a peer-to-peer networking model. Pairs (every pair? not sure) of players open direct connections to eachother. Critically, they open two connections for each pair one from A-&gt;B and one from B-&gt;A. This means every client in the game needs to have open ports so they can accept connections. Worse still, the game randomly chooses which ports to listen on. That's really not gonna fly, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Originally, the WOL master server was accompanied by a "mangler" server. "Mangler" here seems to refer to mangling packets for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking)">NAT punching</a>, a technique for allowing connections between two clients, both of whom are behind a NAT so direct connections are not normally available. This is unreliable at best, but more to the point, it needs an accessible server to coordinate the connection and the original is long gone. The game connection was just hanging at this stage, waiting forever for the mangler server to respond, so I <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWol.cpp#L75">patched out</a> the mangler call entirely.</p>
<p>Now we come to the real problem: the server will assign port ranges to each of the clients, send the ips and port ranges of each client to all the other clients, and they will attempt to open connections to one another. The meta communication about client list and port ranges takes place over IRC (yes, actual IRC, more on that later) hosted on the master server.</p>
<p>I solved this by completely co-opting all of winsock (winsock is the windows implementation of network sockets). I <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWol.cpp#L145">intercept</a> all the required functions, and tunnel all connections through a single client-&gt;server network connection. So when a client wants to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/WolProxyClient.cpp#L87">send a message</a> to the server, or even to another client, it is intercepted, wrapped in a header and pushed through the single network connection. There is a thread running on the server dedicated to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/WolProxyServer.cpp#L45">receiving messages</a>, and dispatching them to the appropriate destination. There are some subtleties around determining the appropriate destination based on port range, faking the correct sender ip, etc, but in the end it works quite well. The game still believes it's operating in a peer to peer fashion, but we get the benefit of being able to direct connect with only the server host needing to worry about their network config.</p>
<p>With all of that setup, I was able to start and join probably the first Coop Campaign game in over a decade.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/first_coop.jpg"></p><p>Atreides tutorial mission, immediately followed by a victory dance around my apartment</p>
<h4 id="irc_server">The part where I write an IRC server for some reason</h4>
<p>As mentioned before, the WOL master server is really just a glorified IRC server. There is some customisation though, so luckily the xwis server that's still running served as a great example to work from. There is even an <a href="https://github.com/pvpgn/pvpgn-server/blob/fcdf00fedfd79a041e1a7b2f20c8d15995b0a762/src/bnetd/handle_wol.cpp">open source WOL server implementation</a> for reference as well.</p>
<p>But wait a second, why write a server at all if there's one available online already? Well, because it won't be forever. My goal with this project is partly about just being able to play coop with my friend, yes, but it's also about cultural preservation. I want to craft a collection of bytes that ensures anyone who wants to play this game can do so, forever. If I rely on some server being up, I can't do that. As for why I didn't just use the pvpgn open source code - that project has very different goals to me. I want to provide the bare minimum needed to get a multiplayer game running, not run a competitive play community.</p>
<p>WOL is a weird mix of standard IRC stuff and custom bits. Game lobbies are special channels, they use standard IRC topics for game lobby info, but then use PAGE instead of PRIVMSG for sending messages in lobby chat, and synchronise game settings with GAMEINFO messages whose content isn't even ASCII. In the end, implementing a basic WOL server <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/WolIrcServer.cpp">wasn't too complicated</a>. It took some trial and error, and it definitely isn't robust if you wander off the happy path, but it works.</p>
<h3 id="packaging">Packaging</h3>

<h4 id="installer">Replacing the installer</h4>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the original installer for Emperor is broken. Westwood did release a workaround installer that you can use by copying the contents of the install CD to your hard drive and overwriting the setup exe, but honestly that's a mess. I'd prefer to provide a nice simple tool that can handle it for the user, and also deal with patching the game up to v1.09, the last official patch.</p>
<p>The basic install is pretty straightforward, just <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/Installer.cpp#L415">copying some files off the CD</a>, and extracting some others from a .cab file on the CD. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(file_format)">cab files</a> are just a basic archive format, like zip, and there is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fdi/">an interface</a> built into windows for extracting them.</p>
<p>The hard part was patching to v1.09. I was hoping I could just grab a copy of the patch file, EM109EN.EXE, right click -&gt; extract with 7zip and be presented with some shiny new up to date binaries, but alas no. The next thing I tried was checking for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_(Windows)">windows resources</a>. Windows resources are a standard method of embedding binary data into an executable file on windows, supported by the compiler and build system. Here, I actually got a hit. I didn't have any filenames, so I couldn't tell their types, but there were a few, mostly tiny files on the order of a few hundred bytes. One of the files was a few hundred kilobytes though. I opened it up in a hex editor and saw something I didn't expect.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/dosmode.png"></p><p>This program cannot be run in DOS mode</p>
<p>That's a windows executable file header!<a href="#foot-4">[4]</a> So we have an executable file embedded in the patch exe. I tried to start analysing the new binary, but none of my tools worked. "file", the unix magic number file identification tool couldn't tell what it was either. Clearly something wasn't right about this file. If I'd paid more attention and done some research on the windows PE format, I would have seen that that "MZ" bytes that should be at the very beginning of a PE file were offset by one word, and that was all that was wrong. But for now I decided to go back to the original patch binary and see if I could figure out what it was doing with the executable.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/rtpatch.png"></p><p>Loading &amp; running the DLL</p>
<p>I went searching for uses of LoadResource, a standard windows API that a program can use to get a pointer to a resource it has embedded, and I found this code. It is extracting the binary resource we found to a temporary file, then loading the temp file as a .DLL and running a function from inside it. We can also see here why we weren't able to load the executable before - the first four bytes of the resource are storing the size of the file, then the rest is the file itself. I'm not quite sure why they did this, as they could have just used the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-sizeofresource">SizeofResource</a> function instead.</p>
<p>I also noticed when running the patch program in a debugger, that all the actual file changes in the install directory were happening in the function pulled out of the embedded DLL. I had a look at the functions exported by the DLL to check out their names - the function that EM109EN.EXE calls is named "RTPatch32@12". RTPatch sounded like it might be some kind of patching tool, so I went searching and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231022172410/https://www.pocketsoft.com/rtpatch_binary_diff.html">sure enough</a>, it is.</p>
<p>I then went searching for any third party tools for working with RTpatch, and found the <a href="http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm#myrtp">myRTP</a> tool by Luigi Auriemma. Checking his source code, he straight up just loads and runs the DLL, with some arguments to tell it where to find the game. I tried the same, but noticed that it was just ignoring the directory I was passing in and fetching the Emperor install directory straight from the registry. I was able to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/Installer.cpp#L101">fake the registry</a> keys that it expected, pass in the same command string that EM109EN.EXE did, and that actually worked. This is kind of funny, as the embedded DLL is 168 KiB, while EM109EN.EXE is 5.5 MiB, meaning the actual patch data is about 3% of the file size. If they were willing to accept that kind of overhead, it makes me wonder if it was worth all the effort of using a binary diffing tool rather than just shipping the changed files whole.</p>
<h4 id="internet_components">Westwood Online Shared Internet Components</h4>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/Loading_ani.gif"></p><p>Loading the shared components was tricker than it seemed</p>
<p>I knew we would get back to COM eventually. When you use the original installer, there are two components - Emperor, and something called the "Westwood Online Shared Internet Components". Without this optional component installed, WOL doesn't work. Of course, I want to package this into my installer so the user doesn't need to worry about getting it set up.</p>
<p>The problem is that this component seems to live up to its name - it really is shared. I suppose the same installation of the shared internet components could be used by multiple Westwood games with WOL support. It's not installed in the Emperor directory, but in its own folder somewhere, and at first I didn't know how Emperor was finding it. I thought it might be through something saved in the registry? Well, it turns out that I was correct, but not in the way I expected.</p>
<p>The main thing installed is WOLAPI.DLL, and it is a COM class library. Emperor loads code from the library by using CoCreateClass to instantiate the various COM objects contained in WOLAPI.DLL, which were registered at install time.</p>
<details id="what_is_com_registration">
    <summary>Ok for real this time, WTF is COM?</summary>
    <div>
            <p>If you didn't read the previous section "<a href="#what_is_lightweight_com">What is lightweight COM?</a>", I suggest you go back and read it now.</p>
            <p>Again, I'm not going to give you a full explanation of all the subtleties of COM, mostly because I'm certain I'm not qualified to do so. But I can explain the process of registering a COM class library DLL.</p>
            <p>Let's say we have a chunk of functionality implemented as COM objects, and we want to make that code available as a library to be used by other processes. How do they find our DLL? How do they identify the objects they want to create? COM registration is a method for solving this problem.</p>
            <p>In COM, in addition to its human readable name, each class is identified by a unique identifier known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">GUID</a> (or more specifically, a class ID or CLSID). There is a standard COM function, CoCreateInstance, which is used to create instances of classes. You identify the class you want to create by passing in the CLSID of the class, and it gives you back a pointer to a new instance of that class. But where does it store the list of available classes?</p>
            <p>In the windows registry, under the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\<wbr>SOFTWARE\<wbr>Classes\<wbr>CLSID. So COM registration is essentially taking a DLL full of COM classes, and saving the CLSIDs of those classes, along with a path to the DLL implementing them into the windows registry at a system wide level.</p>
            <p>I've glossed over a lot of complexity here - for example COM has "out of process" servers, where the class is provided by an implementation that lives in a separate process, with automatic marshalling across process boundaries. But the part that matters here is just about telling CoCreateInstance where to find the WOL interfaces.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>Ok, so can we just copy WOLAPI.DLL into the install folder and do normal COM registration? Well, we could but it's not ideal. COM registration writes to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key, which requires admin access. Also, if at all possible I would like to keep things scoped to just affect our game process. Registering COM objects system wide seems unnecessarily messy.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it's not possible to register a class library for just one process<a href="#foot-5">[5]</a>, but it is possible to register a class for just one user by <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWol.cpp#L102">redirecting the registry</a>, and then using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-oaenableperusertlibregistration">OaEnablePerUserTLibRegistration</a> function, so that's what I did.</p>
<h4 id="launcher_ui">Launcher UI</h4>
<p>The last thing left to do was to make a basic launcher UI where players could type an ip to connect to, and tweak some basic settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/launcher.png"></p><p>UI design is my passion</p>
<p>In keeping with the very microsofty and quite retro theme of all the tech presented so far, I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/EmperorLauncher.cpp#L408">plain old win32</a>. It was my first time making a UI with raw win32 controls, and I gotta say - it's kinda rough. I can see why people generally don't use it anymore. But for something so simple and static like this, it was fine.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So with that, my goals were pretty much achieved. This blog post is getting long so I won't got into details about the last few bits of polish. If you made it this far, thanks for listening to my ramblings, and if you try playing it, I hope you enjoy the game.</p>

<p>•••</p>

<p id="foot-1">1: Detours actually takes care of the CreateRemoteThread &amp; LoadLibrary trick for us also.</p>
<p id="foot-2">2: It's actually a bit of a crazy hack, and probably not very resilient to change. What they're doing is searching for the bytes of a comparison to 2048, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/SetRenderTarget.webp"></p><p>Example from DIRECT3DDEVICEI::SetRenderTarget</p>
<p>They just search the whole binary for the pattern B8 00 08 00 00 39, and replace the 00 08 00 00 part (little endian / 2048 in decimal) with FF FF FF FF which makes the check an unconditional pass. B8 at the start is the mov opcode, and the 39 at the end is the start of the cmp opcode that follows. I had a scan through d3dim700.dll on my system, and it seemed like there weren't any false positives. Still though, this is not a super nice solution, and could be broken if Microsoft does ever decide to ship an update to Direct3D 7 for some reason. I would actually like to use a complete reimplementation of the D3D7 API on top of a more modern D3D, like <a href="https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper">dxwrapper</a>, but I tried a few, and none of them really worked well with Emperor.</p>
<p id="foot-3">3: Actually, it seems like the offset is always there, and always a little broken, even at 4:3. It's just small enough that it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p id="foot-4">4: Every windows executable actually starts with a DOS executable. Normally, this is just a small program that prints the message "This program cannot be run in DOS mode". This was a backwards compatability thing in the early days of windows. If a user tried to run a windows EXE from DOS, they would get a nice error explaining to them that they needed to use windows to run this file. Source <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2002/february/inside-windows-win32-portable-executable-file-format-in-detail#the-ms-dos-header">here</a>.</p>
<p id="foot-5">5: I did try using the DllGetClassObject function directly from the DLL, but it didn't work.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’m an AWS Serverless Hero, principal engineer at an AWS centric logistics company, and I build and maintain <a href="https://aws-news.com/" rel="nofollow">https://aws-news.com</a>. It’s fair to say that I am very interested in everything AWS does. But I fear AWS is no longer interested in what I do.</p>



<p>This post is about AWS’ obsession with Generative AI (GenAI) and how it pushes away everything that makes AWS, well, AWS. Of course it started with OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT, on November 30, 2022. Coincidentally, this date fell exactly in the middle of Re:Invent – Amazon’s yearly developer conference in Vegas. I was there and it was great. Werner Vogels had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfvL_423a-I">keynote</a> about event driven architectures and there were many sessions in areas like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/top-analytics-announcements-of-aws-reinvent-2022/">analytics</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-relational-database-reinvent-2022-recap/">relational databases</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/reinvent-2022-devops-and-developer-productivity-playlist/">devops</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/three-key-security-themes-from-aws-reinvent-2022/">security</a>, and very importantly, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/architecting-for-sustainability-at-aws-reinvent-2022/">sustainability</a>.</p>



<p>Fast forward one year, and the world couldn’t look more different. GenAI dominated Re:Invent 2023. Every topic was either about the infrastructure for GenAI, the integrations with GenAI, the data for GenAI, and how GenAI would make everything better, from customer interactions to content creation, from refactoring to operations. It was weird, but I dismissed it as peak hype cycle. And to be honest I too was pretty excited about all the opportunities GenAI would bring.</p>



<p>Then 2024 came around, and somehow AWS’ focus on GenAI took on hysterical proportions. It started with the global AWS summits, where at least 80% of the talks was about GenAI. Then there was AWS re:Inforce – the annual security conference – which was themed “Security in the era of generative AI”.</p>

<p>After re:Inforce came the flagship NYC summit. Corey Quinn wrote a great piece about the conference titled <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/amazon-genai-services/">Amazon GenAI Services</a>. A quote from his post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>However, the badge lanyards were GenAI branded, the keynote opening slide simply said “Generative AI,” and every single offering discussed during the ~98 minute keynote was centered around Generative AI. Nearly every expo hall booth was dripping with GenAI; Elastic even went so far as to rebrand itself as “The Search AI company.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I wasn’t at the NYC summit so I can’t speak for the in-person experience. But I did monitor the releases they announced during the event. I summarized my thoughts in this <a href="https://x.com/donkersgood/status/1811153913632149660">tweet</a>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="908" data-permalink="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/2024/07/13/dear-aws-please-let-me-be-a-cloud-engineer-again/image-17/" data-orig-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png" data-orig-size="1224,420" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=1024" tabindex="0" role="button" width="1024" height="351" src="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>And this is the crux: AWS is now focused so strongly on GenAI that they seem not to care about anything else anymore – including everything that made developers love them and made them the leading cloud provider on almost every metric.</p>



<h2>You need a business to benefit from GenAI</h2>



<p>Now don’t get me wrong. I like GenAI. I use it extensively at work and for the AWS News Feed. I use ChatGPT to shape new ideas, Copilot to speed up development, and Claude to generate summaries. The point is that all these features add to an existing business. This business has customers, data, business rules, revenue, products, marketing, and all the other things that make a business tick. And most businesses had these things before 2022. GenAI allows us to add new features, and often faster than before. <em>But GenAI has no value without an existing product to apply it to</em>.</p>



<p>And this is where my work, my interests, and my passions come in. I like building products. I like designing scalable infrastructure. I like developing maintainable applications. And I love AWS for the tools they provide me to do this.</p>



<h2>The implicit message</h2>



<p>But AWS and I are growing apart. I feel the things I value are no longer the things they value. By only talking about GenAI, they implicitly tell me databases are not important. Scalable infrastructure is not important. Maintainable applications are not important. Only GenAI is.</p>



<p>The same goes for feature releases. If the vast bulk of all new feature releases are geared towards GenAI, it implicitly means AWS is rerouting investments from classic infrastructure to shiny GenAI. It means that the products I love get smaller budgets. It means that the products I use will not get the next feature I want, or only at a slower pace.</p>



<p>In summary, AWS’ implicit messaging tells developers they should no longer focus on core infrastructure, and spend their time on GenAI instead. I believe this is wrong. Because GenAI can only exist if there is a business to serve. Many, if not almost all of us developers got into AWS because we want to build and support these businesses. We’re not here to be gaslighted into the “GenAI will solve every problem” future. We know it won’t.</p>



<h2>A better way</h2>



<p>I’m not saying there is no value in GenAI. I’m not even saying AWS shouldn’t be building GenAI products. What I’m saying is that AWS is not a <em>GenAI only</em> company and shouldn’t pretend to be. $22.8 billion of <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx">AWS operating income</a> in 2022 and $24.6 billion in 2023 is a hell of a user base to ignore. It is also a financial foundation that should allow them to focus on more than one thing.</p>



<p>I would love to see AWS un-ignore its roots. Show us you still value the businesses and products you supported in the past. Help developers build better applications by listening to them and solving their pain points. Educate them on the fundamentals of infrastructure: performance, reliability, cost efficiency, security, operational excellence, and sustainability.</p>



<p>Your first <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles">leadership principle</a> is customer obsession: “Leaders start with the customer and work backwards”. </p>



<p>I’m your customer, and I’m begging you: please let me be a cloud engineer again.</p>

<p>Hacktivist group NullBulge claims to have breached Disney, leaking 1.1 TiB of internal Slack data. The leak allegedly includes messages, files, code, and more. This comes amidst breaches affecting AT&amp;T and Ticketmaster.</p>


<p>A self-proclaimed hacktivist group named NullBulge, aiming to “protect artists’ rights and ensure fair compensation for their work,” claims to have breached Disney and leaked 1.1 TiB (1.2 TB) of the company’s internal Slack infrastructure. These claims were posted on the notorious cybercrime and hacker platform <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/breach-forums-return-clearnet-dark-web-fbi-seizure/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="117113" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breach Forums</a></strong> on July 12, 2024.</p>



<p>The breach, which is yet to be verified, allegedly contains a complete copy of the company’s Slack communications used by their development team including messages, files, and other data exchanged within the Slack workspace.</p>



<p>The hackers further claim the dump includes “almost 10,000 channels, every message and file possible, unreleased projects, raw images, code, logins, links to internal API/web pages, and more!”</p>

<p>NullBulge also used X (formerly Twitter) to <strong><a href="https://x.com/NullBulgeGroup/status/1811656487514546466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announce</a> </strong>the alleged hack, stating, “Disney has had their entire dev Slack dumped. 1.1 TiB of files and chat messages.

<p>As for Disney, in recent years, the company has faced criticism and legal issues regarding the payment of fair shares to artists and writers. Prominent figures like Neil Gaiman have <strong><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/623157/neil-gaiman-calls-out-disney-for-failing-to-pay-royalties-to-writers-and-artists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighted</a> </strong>that Disney has stopped paying royalties to some writers and artists for works that include novelizations and graphic novels of Disney-owned properties. This issue affected various creators who worked on popular franchises such as “Star Wars” and “Alien.</p>



<p>The problem came into the spotlight when author Alan Dean Foster publicly stated that he had not received royalties for his “Star Wars” and “Alien” novels after Disney acquired the respective franchises. </p>



<p>Despite some high-profile settlements, many writers and artists <a href="https://wdwnt.com/2022/05/writers-and-artists-still-fighting-to-receive-overdue-royalties-from-disney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>continue to struggle</strong></a> to get their due payments. Organizations like the Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) have been actively campaigning for these creators, forming task forces to pressure Disney into fulfilling its financial obligations​.</p>



<p>Hackread.com has reached out to Disney for comment. Meanwhile, VX-Underground, an online malware repository, <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1811783405127749647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>tweeted</strong></a> that if proven legitimate, the hack could be the work of infostealer malware. </p>


<p>Nevertheless, the alleged data breach is just another in a series affecting companies based in the United States. On July 12, 2024, <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/att-data-breach-hackers-steal-call-text-records/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AT&amp;T announced</a> </strong>that hackers had stolen call records and text message logs of “nearly all” customers, impacting over 110 million Americans.</p>

<p>13th July 2024</p>

<p>If you have a project, an idea, a product feature, or anything else that you want other people to understand and have conversations about... give them something to link to!</p>
<p>Two illustrative examples are ChatGPT Code Interpreter and Boring Technology.</p>
<h4 id="chatgpt-code-interpreter-is-effectively-invisible">ChatGPT Code Interpreter is effectively invisible</h4>
<p><strong>ChatGPT Code Interpreter</strong> has been one of my favourite AI tools for over a year. It’s the feature of ChatGPT which allows the bot to write <em>and then execute</em> Python code as part of responding to your prompts. It’s incredibly powerful... and almost invisible! If you don’t know how to use prompts to activate the feature you may not realize it exists.</p>
<p>OpenAI don’t even have a help page for it (and it very desperately needs documentation)—if you search their site you’ll find <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/code-interpreter">confusing technical docs</a> about an API feature and <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/how-can-i-access-the-code-interpreter-plugin-model/205304">misleading outdated forum threads</a>.</p>
<p>I evangelize this tool <em>a lot</em>, but OpenAI really aren’t helping me do that. I end up linking people to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">my code-interpreter tag page</a> because it’s more useful than anything on OpenAI’s own site.</p>
<p>Compare this with Claude’s similar Artifacts feature which at least has an <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them">easily discovered help page</a>—though <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">the Artifacts announcement post</a> was shared with Claude 3.5 Sonnet so isn’t obviously linkable. Even that help page isn’t quite what I’m after. Features deserve dedicated pages!</p>
<p>GitHub understand this: here are their feature landing pages for <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Codespaces</a> and <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">Copilot</a> (I could even guess the URL for Copilot’s page based on the Codespaces one).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It turns out there IS documentation about Code Interpreter mode... but I failed to find it because it didn’t use those terms anywhere on the page! The title is <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8437071-data-analysis-with-chatgpt">Data analysis with ChatGPT</a>.</p>

<p>This amuses me greatly because OpenAI have been oscillating on the name for this feature almost since they launched—Code Interpreter, then Advanced Data Analysis, now Data analysis with ChatGPT. I made fun of this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/17/open-questions/#open-questions.034.jpeg">last year</a>.</p>

<h4 id="boring-technology-an-idea-with-a-website">Boring Technology: an idea with a website</h4>
<p>Dan McKinley coined the term <strong>Boring Technology</strong> in <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">an essay in 2015</a>. The key idea is that any development team has a limited capacity to solve new problems which should be reserved for the things that make their product unique. For everything else they should pick the most boring and well-understood technologies available to them—stuff where any bugs or limitations have been understood and discussed online for years.</p>
<p>(I’m very proud that Django has earned the honorific of “boring technology” in this context!)</p>
<p>Dan turned that essay into a talk, and then he turned that talk into a website with a brilliant domain name:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boringtechnology.club</a></strong></p>
<p>The idea has stuck. I’ve had many productive conversations about it, and more importantly if someone <em>hasn’t</em> heard the term before I can drop in that one link and they’ll be up to speed a few minutes later.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to do this myself for some of my own ideas: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/">baked data</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">git scraping</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/">prompt injection</a> all have pages that I frequently link people to. I never went as far as committing to a domain though and I think maybe that was a mistake—having a clear message that “this is the key page to link to” is a very powerful thing.</p>
<h4 id="this-is-about-both-seo-and-conversations">This is about both SEO and conversations</h4>
<p>One obvious goal here is SEO: if someone searches for your product feature you want them to land on your own site, not surrender valuable attention to someone else who’s squatting on the search term.</p>
<p>I personally value the conversation side of it even more. Hyperlinks are the best thing about the web—if I want to talk about something I’d much rather drop in a link to the definitive explanation rather than waste a paragraph (as I did earlier with Code Interpreter) explaining what the thing is for the upmteenth time!</p>
<p>If you have an idea, project or feature that you want people to understand and discuss, build it the web page it deserves. <strong>Give people something to link to!</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <h3 id="who-should-read-this">Who should read this</h3> <p>Do you want to understand exactly how AlphaFold3 works? The architecture is quite complicated and the description in the paper can be overwhelming, so we made a much more friendly (but just as detailed!) visual walkthrough.</p> <p>This is mostly written for an ML audience and multiple points assume familiarity with the steps of attention. If you’re rusty, see Jay Alammar’s <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Illustrated Transformer</a> for a thorough visual explanation. That post is one of the best explanations of a model architecture at the level of individual matrix operations and also the inspiration for the diagrams and naming.</p> <p>There are already many great explanations of the motivation for protein structure prediction, the CASP competition, model failure modes, debates about evaluations, implications for biotech, etc. so we don’t focus on any of that. Instead we explore the <em>how</em>.</p> <p><em>How are these molecules represented in the model and what are all of the operations that convert them into a predicted structure?</em></p> <p>This is probably more exhaustive than most people are looking for, but if you want to understand all the details and you like learning via diagrams, this should help :)</p> <h3 id="architecture-overview">Architecture Overview</h3> <p>We’ll start by pointing out that goals of the model are a bit different than previous AlphaFold models: instead of just predicting the structure of individual protein sequences (AF2) or protein complexes (AF-multimeter), it predicts the structure of a protein, optionally complexed with other proteins, nucleic acids, or small molecules, all from sequence alone. So while previous AF models only had to represent sequences of standard amino acids, AF3 has to represent more complex input types, and thus there is a more complex featurization/tokenization scheme. Tokenization is described in its own section, but for now just know that when we say “token” it either represents a single amino acid (for proteins), nucleotide (for DNA/RNA), or an individual atom if that atom is not part of a standard amino acid/nucleotide.</p> <div> <p><b>Interactive Table of Contents</b></p> <figure> <div> <p><img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/full_arch_for_labeling.png" alt="Full Architecture" usemap="#image-map"></p>              </div> <map name="image-map"> <area shape="rect" alt="Tokenization" title="Tokenization" coords="0.58,50.38,8.35,74.06" href="#tokenization" data-target="overlay-1"> <area shape="rect" alt="Retrieval" title="Retrieval" coords="8.35,3.26,22.16,40.98" href="#retrieval-create-msa-and-templates" data-target="overlay-2"> <area shape="rect" alt="Create atom-level representations" title="Create atom-level representations" coords="8.35,41.48,22.16,68.92" href="#create-atom-level-representations" data-target="overlay-3"> <area shape="rect" alt="Atom Transformer" title="Atom Transformer" coords="22.23,23.43,28.16,69.80" href="#update-atom-level-representations-atom-transformer" data-target="overlay-4"> <area shape="rect" alt="Atom-Level to Token-Level" title="Atom-Level to Token-Level" coords="28.16,40.23,31.89,69.80" href="#aggregate-atom-level--token-level" data-target="overlay-5"> <area shape="rect" alt="Template module" title="Template module" coords="34.56,34.59,40.56,56.02" href="#template-module" data-target="overlay-6"> <area shape="rect" alt="MSA module" title="MSA module" coords="42.15,34.21,48.16,56.02" href="#msa-module" data-target="overlay-7"> <area shape="rect" alt="Pairformer" title="Pairformer" coords="49.67,34.21,63.52,69.80" href="#pairformer-module" data-target="overlay-8"> <area shape="rect" alt="Diffusion module" title="Diffusion module" coords="68.37,41.48,90.20,70.18" href="#diffusion-module" data-target="overlay-9"> <area shape="rect" alt="Confidence and Loss" title="Confidence and loss" coords="90.96,20.05,99.71,47.37" href="#4-loss-function-and-other-training-details" data-target="overlay-10"> <area shape="rect" alt="Other training details" title="Other training details" coords="90.96,47.37,99.71,66.17" href="#other-training-details" data-target="overlay-11"> <area shape="rect" alt="Input preparation" title="Input preparation" coords="8.35,87.84,23.46,97.74" href="#1-input-preparation" data-target="overlay-12"> <area shape="rect" alt="Representation learning" title="Representation learning" coords="38.76,87.84,58.97,97.49" href="#2-representation-learning" data-target="overlay-13"> <area shape="rect" alt="Structure prediction" title="Structure prediction" coords="71.69,88.22,89.37,96.74" href="#3-structure-prediction" data-target="overlay-14"> </map> </figure>   <p>Full architecture.

By aligning these together into a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), we can look at how an individual position in a protein sequence has changed throughout evolution. You can think about an MSA for a given protein as a matrix where each row is the sequence of the analogous protein from a different species. It has been shown that the conservation patterns found along the column of a specific position in the protein can reflect how critical it is for that position to have certain amino acids present, and the relationships between different columns reflect relationships between amino acids (i.e. if two amino acids are physically interacting, the changes in their amino acids will likely be correlated across evolution). Thus, MSAs are often used to enrich representations of single proteins.</p> <p> Similarly, if any of these proteins have known structures, those are also likely to inform the structure of this protein. Instead of searching for full structures, only individual chains of the proteins are used. This resembles the practice of homology modeling, in which the structure of a query protein is modeled based on templates from known protein structures that are presumed to be similar. </p> </details> <details> <summary>So how are these sequences and structures retrieved?</summary> First, a genetic search is done searching for any protein or RNA chains that resemble any input protein or RNA chains. This does not involve any training and relies upon existing Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based methods<d-footnote>Specifically, they use jackhmmer, HHBlits, and nhmmer</d-footnote> to scan multiple protein databases and RNA databases for relevant hits. Then these sequences are aligned to each other to construct an MSA with N<sub>MSA</sub> sequences.

The first step is to calculate a “reference conformer” for each amino acid, nucleotide, and ligand. While we do not yet know the structure of the entire complex, we have strong priors on the local structures of each individual component. A conformer (short for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/conformational-isomer#:~:text=Conformations%20or%20conformational%20isomers%20have,the%20same%20configuration%2C%20if%20chiral." rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">conformational isomer</a>) is a 3D arrangement of atoms in a molecule that is generated by sampling rotations about single bonds. Each amino acid has a “standard” conformer which is just one of the low-energy conformations this amino acid can exist in, which can be retrieved through a look-up. However, each small molecule requires its own conformation generation. These are generated with <a href="https://rdkit.org/docs/RDKit_Book.html#conformer-generation" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RDKit’s ETKDGv3</a>, an algorithm that combines experimental data and torsion angle preferences to produce 3D conformers.</p> <p>Then we concatenate the information from this conformer (relative location) with each atom’s charge, atomic number, and other identifiers.

Anytime AF3 applies attention at the atom-level, we use a module called the Atom Transformer. The atom transformer is a series of blocks that use attention to update <strong><span>q</span></strong> using both <strong><span>p</span></strong> and the original representation of <strong><span>q</span></strong> called <strong><span>c</span></strong>. As <strong><span>c</span></strong> does not get updated by the Attention Transformer, it can be thought of as a residual connection to the starting representation.</p> <p>The Atom Transformer mostly follows a standard transformer structure using layer norm, attention, then an MLP transition. However, each step has been adapted to include additional input from <strong><span>c</span></strong> and <strong><span>p</span></strong> (including a secondary input here is sometimes referred to as “conditioning”.) There is also a ‘gating’ step between the attention and MLP blocks. Going through each of these 4 steps in more detail:</p> <h3 id="1-adaptive-layernorm">1. Adaptive LayerNorm</h3>  <p>Adaptive LayerNorm (AdaNorm) is a variant of LayerNorm with one simple extension. Recall that for a given input matrix, traditional LayerNorm learns two parameters (a scaling factor gamma and a bias factor beta) that adjust the mean and standard deviation of each of the channels in our matrix. Instead of learning fixed parameters for gamma and beta, AdaNorm learns a function to generate gamma and beta adaptively based on the input matrix. However, instead of generating the parameters based on the input getting re-scaled (in the Atom Transformer this is <strong><span>q</span></strong>), a secondary input (<strong><span>c</span></strong> in the Atom Transformer) is used to predict the gamma and beta that re-scale the mean and standard deviation of <strong><span>q</span></strong>.</p> <h3 id="2-attention-with-pair-bias">2.

Like in self-attention, the queries, keys, and values all come from the same 1D sequence (our single representation, <strong><span>q</span></strong>). However, there are 3 differences:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Pair-biasing</strong>: after the dot product of the queries and keys are calculated, a linear projection of the pair representation is added as a bias to scale the attention weights. Note that this operation does not involve any information from <strong><span>q</span></strong> being used to update <strong><span>p</span></strong>, just one way flow from the pair representation to <strong><span>q</span></strong>. The reasoning for this is that atoms that have a stronger pairwise relationship should attend to each other more strongly and <strong><span>p</span></strong> is effectively already encoding an attention map.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Gating</strong>: In addition to the queries, keys, and values, we create an additional projection of <strong><span>q</span></strong> that is passed through a sigmoid, to squash the values between 0 and 1. Our output is multiplied by this “gate” right before all the heads are re-combined. This effectively forces the model to ignore some of what it learned in this attention process. This type of gating appears frequently in AF3 and is discussed more in the ML-musings section. To briefly elaborate, because the model is constantly adding the outputs of each section to the residual stream, this gating mechanism can be thought of as the model’s way to specify what information does or does not get saved in this residual stream. It is presumably named a “gate” after the similar “gates” in LSTM which uses a sigmoid to learn a filter for what inputs get added to the running cell state.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sparse attention</strong>:</p> </li> </ol> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> Because the number of atoms can be much larger than the number of tokens, we do not run full attention at this step, rather, we use a type of sparse attention (called Sequence-local atom attention) in which the attention is effectively run in local groups where groups of 32 atoms at a time can all attend to 128 other atoms.

These triangle-based layers were first introduced in AF2 are one of the pieces that not only remained in AF3, but now are even more present in the architecture, so they get quite a bit of attention.</p> <h3 id="why-look-at-triangles">Why look at triangles?</h3> <p>The guiding principle here is the idea of the triangle inequality: “the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than or equal to the third side”. Recall that each <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong> in the pair tensor encodes the relationship between positions i and j in the sequence. While it does not literally encode the physical distances between pairs of tokens, let’s think about it for a moment as if it did. If we imagine that each <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong> is the distance between two amino acids and we know <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong>=1 and <strong><span>z<sub>j,k</sub></span></strong>=1. By the triangle inequality <strong><span>z<sub>i,k</sub></span></strong> cannot be larger than \(\sqrt{2}\). Knowing two of the distances gives us a strong belief about what the third distance must be. The goal of triangle updates and triangle attention are to try to encode these geometric constraints into the model.</p> <p>The triangle inequality is not enforced in the model but rather, it is encouraged through ensuring each position <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong> is updated by looking at all possible triplets of positions (<strong>i</strong>,<strong>j</strong>,<strong>k</strong>) at a time. So <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong> is updated based on <strong><span>z<sub>j,k</sub></span></strong> and <strong><span>z<sub>i,k</sub></span></strong> for all other atoms k. Because <strong><span>z</span></strong> represents the complex physical relationship between these tokens, rather than merely their distance, these relationships can be directional. So for <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong>, we also want to encourage consistency with <strong><span>z<sub>k,i</sub></span></strong> and <strong><span>z<sub>k,j</sub></span></strong> for all atoms k. If we think of the atoms as a graph, with <strong><span>z</span></strong> as a directed adjacency matrix, it makes sense that AlphaFold calls these “outgoing edges” and “incoming edges”.</p> <p>Consider row i=0 of this adjacency matrix, and let’s say we want to update <strong><span>z<sub>0,2</sub></span></strong>, which has been highlighted in purple. The idea behind the update is that if we know the distances between 0→1 and 2→1, that gives us some constraints on what 0→2 can be. Similarly, if we know the distances between 0→3 and 2→3, this also gives us a constraint on 0→2. This would apply for all atoms k.</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/adjacency_matrix-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/adjacency_matrix-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/adjacency_matrix-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/adjacency_matrix.png" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>So, in the triangle updates and attention, we effectively look at all directed paths for 3 nodes in this graph (a.k.a triangles, hence the name!).</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/triangle_paths-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/triangle_paths-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/triangle_paths-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/triangle_paths.png" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3 id="triangle-updates">Triangle Updates</h3> <p>Having carefully looked at the triangle operations from a graph theory perspective, we can see how this is implemented with tensor operations.

Structure Prediction</h2> <h2 id="basics-of-diffusion">Basics of Diffusion</h2> <p>Now, with these refined representations, we are ready to use <strong><span>s</span></strong> and <strong><span>z</span></strong> to predict the structure of our complex. One of the changes introduced in AF3 is that entire structure prediction is based on atom-level diffusion. Existing posts more thoroughly explain the <a href="https://www.superannotate.com/blog/diffusion-models" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">intuition</a> and <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">math</a> for diffusion, but the basic idea of a Diffusion Model is to start with real data, add random noise to your data, then train a model to predict what noise was added. Noise is iteratively added to the data over a series of T timesteps to create a sequence of T variants of each datapoint. We call the original data point x<sub>t=0</sub> and the fully noised version x<sub>t=T</sub>. During training, at timestep t, the model is given the x<sub>t</sub> and predicts what noise was added between x<sub>t-1</sub> and x<sub>t</sub>. We take a gradient step on the predicted noise added compared to the actual noise that had been added.</p> <p>Then, at inference time, we simply start with random noise, which is equivalent to x<sub>t=T</sub>. For every time step, we predict the noise the model thinks has been added, and remove that predicted noise. After a pre-specified number of timesteps, we end up with a fully “denoised” datapoint that should resemble the original data from our dataset.</p> <p>Conditional Diffusion lets the model ‘condition’ these de-noising predictions on some input. Practically this means that for each step of the model, it takes three inputs:</p> <ol> <li>The current noisy iteration of our generation</li> <li>A representation of the current time step we are at</li> <li>The information we want to condition on (this could be a caption for an image to generate, or properties for a protein).</li> </ol> <p>As a result, the final generation is not just a random example that resembles the training data distribution, but should specifically match the information represented by this conditioning vector.</p> <p>With AF3, the data we learn to de-noise is a matrix <strong><span>x</span></strong> with the x,y,z coordinates of all the atoms in our sequences. During training, we add Gaussian noise to these coordinates until they are effectively fully random. Then at inference time, we start with random coordinates. At each time step, we first randomly rotate and translate our entire predicted complex. This data-augmentation teaches the model that any rotation and translation of our complex is equally valid, and replaces the much more complicated Invariant Point Attention used in AF2. <d-footnote>AF2 had developed a complicated architecture called Invariant Point Attention meant to enforce equivariance to translations and rotations. This led to a vigorous debate over the importance of IPA in AF2's success. In AF3, this is dropped in favor of a much simpler approach: applying random rotations and translations as data-augmentations to help the model learn such equivariances naturally. So here we simply randomly rotate all atoms' coordinates around the center of our current generation (the mean over all atoms' coordinates), and randomly sample a translation in each dimension (x, y, and z) from a N(0,1) Gaussian. It appears from the algorithm that the translation is universal, that is the same translation is applied to every atom in our current generation. This type of data augmentation was popularize with CNNs but in the past few years, equivariant architectures like IPA have been considered an more efficient and elegant approach to solve the same problem. Thus, when AF3 replaced equivariant attention with data-augmentation, it sparked a lot of internet discussions.</d-footnote> We then add a small amount of noise to the coordinates to encourage more heterogeneous generations.<d-footnote>It benefits us for the model to generate several slightly different variations. At inference time, we can score each using our confidence head, and return only the generation with the highest score.</d-footnote> Finally, we predict a de-noising step using the Diffusion Module.

It looks at all pairwise distances then includes additional terms to prioritize distances between nearby atoms and atoms involved in protein-ligand bonds.</li> <li> <strong>L<sub>confidence</sub></strong> which evaluates the model’s self-awareness about which structures are likely to be inaccurate</li> </ul> <h3 id="ldistogram">L<sub>distogram</sub> </h3> <p>The output of our model is atom-level coordinates, which can easily be used to create an atom-level distogram<d-footnote>Recall how the distograms were initially created by binning pairwise distances between atoms</d-footnote>. However, this loss evaluates a token-level distogram. To get the xyz coordinates for tokens, we just use the coordinate of the “center atom”. As these distogram distances are categorical, the predicted distogram is then compared to the true distogram via cross entropy.</p> <h3 id="ldiffusion">L<sub>diffusion</sub> </h3> <p>The diffusion loss itself is a weighted sum of three terms each computed over the atom positions, additionally scaled by the amount of noise<d-footnote>t<sup>^</sup>, the sampled noise level for the current time step, and σ<sub>data</sub>, the variance of the data which scales the amount of noise at each time step</d-footnote> added at the current time step: \(L_{\text{diffusion}} = (L_{\text{MSE}} + L_{\text{bond}} * \alpha_{\text{bond}}) * (\hat{t}^2 + \sigma_{\text{data}}^2)/(\hat{t}+\sigma_{\text{data}})^2 + L_{\text{smooth_lddt}}\)</p> <ul> <li> <strong>L<sub>MSE</sub></strong> is a version of the distogram loss we just discussed, but over all atoms rather just “center atoms” (and with DNA, RNA, and ligand atoms upweighted). Additionally, it looks at the mean squared error between positions, rather than binning them into a distogram.</li> <li> <strong>L<sub>bond</sub></strong> aims to ensure the accuracy of bond lengths for protein-ligand bonds by adding an additional MSE loss on the difference in predicted and ground-truth distograms for atom-pairs that are part of protein-ligand bonds.<d-footnote>There are various stages of training and α<sub>bond</sub> is set to 0 in the initial stages, so this term is only introduced later.</d-footnote> </li> <li> <strong>L<sub>smooth_LDDT</sub></strong> (smoothed local distance difference test) is yet another variant of the distogram loss that tries to capture the accuracy of local distances. An atom-pair’s predicted distance “passes the test” if it is within a given threshold of the atom-pair’s true distance. To make this metric smooth and differentiable, we pass the difference between predicted and ground-truth distograms through a sigmoid centered on the test’s threshold. We can think of this as generating a probability (between 0 and 1) that this atom-pair passes the test. We take the average of four “tests’’ with increasingly tight thresholds (4, 2, 1, and .5 Å). Using this loss encourages the model to reduce the probability of failing each test. Finally, to make the test “local”, we ignore the loss for an atom-pair if that atom-pair’s ground truth distance is large, as we only want the model to focus on accurately predicting an atom’s distances to nearby atoms<d-footnote>Specifically, for an atom-pair l,m, we ignore the loss for l and m if l and m are more than 30 Å away if atom m is part of a nucleotide. We ignore the loss for l and m if they are more than 15 Å away from each other and m is not a nucleotide (so is part of a protein or ligand).</d-footnote>.</li> </ul> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/smooth_lddt-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/smooth_lddt-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/smooth_lddt-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/smooth_lddt.png" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3 id="lconfidence">L<sub>confidence</sub> </h3> <p>The goal of this loss is not to improve the accuracy of the structure, but rather to teach the model to predict its own accuracy.

At a selected diffusion step t, the predicted coordinates <strong><span>r<sup>t</sup></span></strong> are used to update the single and pair representations created in the representation learning trunk. The predicted errors are then calculated from linear projections of the updated pair representation (for PAE and PDE) or this updated single representation (pLDDT and experimentally resolved). Then, the actual error metrics are calculated based on the same generated atom coordinates (process described below, if interested) for comparison.</p> <p>While these terms are included in the confidence head loss, gradients from these terms are only used to update the confidence prediction heads and do not affect the rest of the model.</p> <details> <summary>How are the actual error metrics calculated?</summary> <p><b>pLDDT:</b> The LDDT for atom l is calculated in the following way: in the current predicted structure, we calculate the distance between atom l and a set of atoms R that is indexed by m, and compare this to the ground truth equivalent. To be in this set, an atom m must be part of a polymer chain, within 15 or 30 Å of l depending on the molecule m is a part of, and the center atom of a token. We then calculate four binary distance tests with increasingly tight thresholds (4, 2, 1, and .5 Å) and take the average pass rate, and sum over the atoms in R. We bin this percentage into 50 bins between 0 and 1.</p> <p>At inference time, we have a pLDDT head. This head takes the single representation of a given token, repeats it out across all the atoms "attached" to this token<d-footnote>Technically, the max number of atoms attached to any token, so that we can stack tensors</d-footnote>, and projects all those atom-level representations to the 50 bins of our pLDDT_l. We treat these as logits across the 50 "classes", use a softmax to convert to probabilities, and take a multi-class classification loss across the bins.</p> <p><b>Predicted Alignment Error (PAE):</b> Every token is considered to have a frame, that is a 3D coordinate frame created from three atoms (called a, b, c) involved in that token. Atom b within those three atoms forms the origin in this frame. In cases where each token has a single atom "attached", the center atom of the frame is the single atom of the token, and the two other nearest tokens of the same entity (e.g., same ligand) form the basis of the frame. For every token pair (i,j) we re-express the predicted coordinates of the center atom for token_i using the frame of token_j. We do the same for the ground-truth coordinates of the center atom of token_i. The euclidean distance between these transformed true and predicted coordinates of the center atom of token_i is our alignment error, binned into 64 bins. We predict this alignment error from the pair representation <b><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></b>, projecting it to 64 dimensions that we treat as logits and convert to probabilities with a softmax. We train this head with a classification loss, which each bin as a class. See <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/inputs-and-outputs/evaluating-alphafolds-predicted-structures-using-confidence-scores/pae-a-measure-of-global-confidence-in-alphafold-predictions/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a> for additional details.</p> <p>Third, AF3 predicts the distance error (PDE) between tokens. The true distance error is calculated by taking the distance between center atoms for every token pair, and binning these distances over 64 uniformly-sized bins from 0 Å to 32 Å. The predicted distance error comes from projecting the pair representation <b><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></b> plus the pair representation <b><span>z<sub>j,i</sub></span></b> into 64 dimensions that we again treat as logits, and again convert to probabilities with a softmax.</p> <p>Finally, AF3 predicts whether each atom was experimentally resolved in the ground-truth structure. Similar to the pLDDT head, we repeat the <b><span>s<sub>i</sub></span></b> single representation out for the number of atoms this token represents, and project to 2 dimensions and use a binary classification loss.</p> </details> <hr> <h2 id="other-training-details">Other Training Details</h2> <p>Now that the architecture is covered, the last pieces are some of the additional training details.</p> <h3 id="recycling">Recycling</h3> <p>As introduced in AF2, AF3 recycles its weights; that is, rather than making the model deeper, the model weights are re-used and inputs are run through the modules multiple times to continually improve the representations. Diffusion inherently uses recycling at inference time, as the model is trained to incorporate the timestep information and use the same model weights for every time step.</p> <h3 id="cross-distillation">Cross-distillation</h3> <p>AF3 uses a mix of synthetic training data generated by itself (via self-distillation) but also by AF2, via <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-024-02002-0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cross-distillation</a>. Specifically, the authors note that, by switching to the diffusion-based generative module, the model stopped producing the characteristic “spaghetti” regions that allowed users of AF2 to visually identify low-confidence and likely disordered regions. Just visually looking at the diffusion-based generations, all regions appeared equally high in confidence, making it more difficult to identify potential hallucinations.</p> <p>To solve this problem, they included generations from AF2 and AF-Multimer in the training data for AF3, allowing the model to learn that, when AF2 was not confident in its prediction, it should output these unfolded regions and to “instruct” AF3 to do the same.<d-footnote>Nucleic acids and small molecules in distillation datasets had to be removed as they could not be processed by AF2 and AF-multimer. However, once previous models generated new predicted structures, and these structures got aligned to the originals, the removed molecules were added back in. If adding these back in created new atom clashes, the whole structure was excluded, to avoid accidentally teaching the model to accept clashes.</d-footnote></p> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/cross_distillation-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/cross_distillation-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/cross_distillation-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/cross_distillation.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>(Diagram from AF3 paper)</p> </div> <h3 id="cropping-and-training-stages">Cropping and Training Stages</h3> <p>While no part of the model has an explicit restriction on the length of the input sequences, the memory and compute requirements increase significantly with sequence length (recall the multiple O(N<sub>tokens</sub><sup>3</sup> operations)). Thus, for efficiency the proteins get randomly cropped. As introduced in AF-multimer, because we want to model the interactions between multiple chains, the random cropping needs to include all of these. They use 3 methods for cropping and all 3 of these are used in different proportions depending on the training data (ex: PDB crystal structure vs disordered PDB complex vs distillation, etc.)</p> <ul> <li>Contiguous cropping: Contiguous sequences of amino acids are selected for each chain</li> <li>Spatial cropping: Amino acids are selected based on distance to a reference atom (typically this atom is part of a specific chain or binding interface of interest)</li> <li>Spatial interface cropping: Similar to spatial cropping, but based on distances to atoms that specifically at a binding interface.</li> </ul> <p>While a model trained on random crops of 384 can be applied to longer sequences, to improve the model’s ability to handle these sequences, it is iteratively fine-tuned on larger sequence lengths.

While switching to a diffusion-based structure module means the model could in theory predict two atoms to be in the same location, this seems to be minimal after training. That said, AF3 does employ a clashing penalty when ranking generated structures.</p> <h3 id="batch-sizes">Batch sizes</h3> <p>Although the diffusion process sounds quite involved, it is still significantly less computationally expensive than the trunk of the model. Thus, the AF3 authors found that it is more efficient from a training perspective to expand the batch size of the model after the trunk. So for each input structure, it gets run through the embedding and trunk, then 48 independent data-augmented versions of the structure are applied, and these 48 structures are all trained in parallel.</p> <p><strong>That’s it for the training process!</strong> There are some other small details but this is probably already more than you need, and if you’ve made it this far, the rest should be easy to pick up from reading the AF3 supplement.</p> <h2 id="ml-musings">ML Musings</h2> <p>Having walked so thoroughly through the architecture of AF3 and its comparisons to AF2, it is interesting how the choices made by the authors fit into broader Machine Learning trends.</p> <h3 id="alphafold-as-retrieval-augmented-generation">AlphaFold as Retrieval-Augmented Generation</h3> <p>At the time AF2 was released, it was not common to include retrievals from the training set at inference time. In the case of AF, utilizing an MSA and template search. MSA-based methods were being used for protein modeling, but this type of retrieval was less used in other areas of Deep Learning (i.e., ResNets do not embed relevant training images at inference time when classifying a new image in Computer Vision, for example). Although AF3 reduces the emphasis on the MSA compared to AF2 (it is no longer operated on and updated in the 48 blocks of the Evoformer/Pairformer), they still incorporate both the MSA and templates, even as other protein prediction models such as ESMFold have dropped retrieval in favor of fully parametric inference.</p> <p>Interestingly, some of the largest and most successful Deep Learning models now often include similar additional information at inference time. While the details of the retrieval systems are not always disclosed, Large Language Models routinely use Retrieval Augmented Generation systems such as a traditional web search at inference time to orient the model toward relevant information (even if that information was likely already in its training data) that should guide inference. It will be interesting to see how the use of directly relevant examples at inference time develops in the future.</p> <h3 id="pair-bias-attention">Pair-Bias Attention</h3> <p>One of the major components of AF2 that is even more present in AF3 is Pair-Bias Attention. That is, attention where the queries, keys, and values all originate from the same source (like in self-attention), but where there is a bias term added to the attention map from another source. This effectively acts as a light-touch version of information sharing, without full cross-attention. Pair-Bias Attention appears in almost every module. While this type of attention is now used in other protein modeling architectures, we have not seen this particular type of cross-biasing used in other fields (although that does not mean it hasn’t been done!). Perhaps it only works well here because the pair-representation is naturally analogous to a self-attention map already, but is an intriguing alternative to pure self or pure cross-attention.</p> <h3 id="self-supervised-training">Self-supervised training</h3> <p>Self-supervised models like ESM have been able to achieve impressive results at predicting protein structure by replacing the MSA embedding with a “probabilistic MSA” using self-supervised pre-training. In AF2, the model had an additional task that predicted masked tokens from the MSA, achieving a similar self-supervision, but that was removed with AF3. We have not seen commentary from the authors on why they did not use any self-supervised language modeling pre-training approach on the MSA, and in fact decreased the compute used to process the MSA. Three possible reasons self-supervised learning is not used to initialize the MSA embeddings are 1) they viewed the massive pre-training phase as a suboptimal use of compute 2) they tried it and found that including a small MSA module outperformed pre-trained embeddings and was worth the additional inference-time cost or 3) utilizing a mix of pre-trained embeddings for amino acid tokens and randomly initialized embeddings for DNA/RNA/ligands would not be compatible or underperformed fully supervised training on their hybrid atom-token structure. <d-footnote>By focusing on self-supervision tasks, models in the ESM family are also much more simple than AF3 (although they don't handle DNA/RNA/ligands and have slightly different goals.) It is interesting to watch that as some models aim to maximize architectural simplicity, AlphaFold remains this complicated! </d-footnote></p> <h3 id="classification-vs-regression">Classification vs. Regression</h3> <p>As in AF2, AF3 continues to use a mix of MSE and binned classification losses. The classification components are interesting as, if the model predicts a distogram bin that is only off-by-one, it gets no “credit” for being close rather than way off. It is unclear what informed this design decision, but perhaps the authors found the gradients to be more stable than working with several different MSE losses, and perhaps the per-atom losses saw so many gradient steps that the additional signal from a continuous loss would not have proven beneficial.</p> <h3 id="similarities-to-recurrent-architectures-eg-lstms">Similarities to Recurrent Architectures (e.g LSTMs)</h3> <p>AF3’s architecture incorporates several design elements reminiscent of recurrent neural networks that are not typically found in traditional transformers:</p> <ul> <li>Extensive Gating: AF3 uses gating mechanisms throughout its architecture to control information flow in the residual stream. This is more akin to the gating in LSTMs or GRUs than the standard feed-forward nature of normal transformer layers.</li> <li>Iterative Processing with Weight Reuse: AF3 applies the same weights multiple times to progressively refine its predictions. This process, involving both recycling and the diffusion model, resembles how recurrent networks process sequential data over time steps using a shared set of weights. It differs from standard transformers, which typically make predictions in a single forward pass. This approach allows AF3 to iteratively improve its protein structure predictions without increasing the number of parameters.</li> <li>Adaptive Computation: The recycling is also similar to the iterative updating used in diffusion and quite related to the idea of adaptive compute time <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08983" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(ACT)</a>, originally introduced to dynamically determine how much compute to use for RNNs and more recently used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02258" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mixture-of-Depths</a> to achieve a similar goal with transformers. This contrasts with the fixed depth of standard transformers and theoretically would allow the model to apply more processing to challenging inputs.</li> </ul> <p>It was shown in the AF2 ablations that the recycling was important, but there was little disucssion on the importance of gating. Presumably it helps with training stability as in LSTMs but it is interesting that it is so prevalent here yet not in many other transformer-based architectures.</p> <h3 id="cross-distillation-1">Cross-distillation</h3> <p>The use of AF2 generations to re-introduce its distinctive style specifically for low-confidence regions is very interesting. If there is a lesson here, it may be the most practical of all: If your previous model is doing one specific thing better than your new model, you can try cross-distillation to get the best of both worlds!</p> <hr> <p>If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading and hope it was helpful!!

<p dir="auto">If you need to store some state in the processor thread which is neither <code>Send</code> nor <code>Sync</code>, e.g. a <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code>, then you can create a closure for initializing that state and pass it along with the processing closure when you build the Disruptor. The Disruptor will then pass a mutable reference to your state on each event. As an example:</p>

<p dir="auto">Everything in the library is about low-latency and this heavily influences all choices made in this library.
As an example, you cannot allocate an event and <em>move</em> that into the ringbuffer. Instead, events are allocated on startup to ensure they are co-located in memory to increase cache coherency.
However, you can still allocate a struct on the heap and move ownership to a field in the event on the Ringbuffer.
As long as you realize that this can add latency, because the struct is allocated by one thread and dropped by another.
Hence, there's synchronization happening in the allocator.</p>
<p dir="auto">There's also no use of dynamic dispatch - everything is monomorphed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h2><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The SPSC and MPSC Disruptor variants have been benchmarked and compared to Crossbeam. See the code in the <code>benches/spsc.rs</code> and <code>benches/mpsc.rs</code> files.</p>
<p dir="auto">The results below of the SPSC benchmark are gathered from running the benchmarks on a 2016 Macbook Pro running a 2,6 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7. So on a modern Intel Xeon the numbers should be even better. Furthermore, it's not possible to isolate cores on Mac and pin threads which would produce even more stable results. This is future work.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have any suggestions to improving the benchmarks, please feel free to open an issue.</p>
<p dir="auto">To provide a somewhat realistic benchmark not only burst of different sizes are considered but also variable pauses between bursts: 0 ms, 1 ms and 10 ms.</p>
<p dir="auto">The latencies below are the mean latency per element with 95% confidence interval (standard <code>criterion</code> settings). Capturing all latencies and calculating misc. percentiles (and in particular the max latency) is future work. However, I expect the below measurements to be representative for the actual performance you can achieve in a real application.</p>

<p dir="auto">There's clearly a difference between the Disruptor and the Crossbeam libs. However, this is not because the Crossbeam library is not a great piece of software. It is. The Disruptor trades CPU and memory resources for lower latency and higher throughput and that is why it's able to achieve these results. The Disruptor also excels if you can publish batches of events as
demonstrated in the benchmarks with bursts of 10 and 100 events.</p>
<p dir="auto">Both libraries greatly improves as the burst size goes up but the Disruptor's performance is more resilient to the pauses between bursts which is one of the design goals.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
Earlier today Stephen Johnson, in a mailing list run by the
<a href="http://www.tuhs.org/">The Unix Heritage Society</a>,
described the birth of the <em>standard error</em> concept:
the idea that a program's error output is sent on a channel
different from that of its normal output.
Over the past forty years, all major operating systems and language libraries
have embraced this concept.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/blog/20131211/cat.png" alt="C/A/T phototypesetter">
The story starts with the Graphic Systems'
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAT_(phototypesetter)">C/A/T phototypesetter</a> used by the Bell Labs
in the 1970s.
This, washing-machine sized, equipment would typeset documents by
flashing a strobe to expose character glyphs
that were pre-installed on a rotating drum.
The drum supported four fonts (Times Roman, italic, bold, and Symbol);
a magnifying glass was used to change the font size.
The text input normally came from a paper tape, and the output was
rendered onto film,
which then required a cumbersome, dirty, and smelly development process.
<a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2013-December/002927.html">Brian Walden</a>
relates that "the chemical baths were nasty smelling and it
gummed up the rollers.
You'd needed to regularly take the developer roller and gear guts into
the janitor's closet and scrub it with a toothbrush in the slop sink
under running water."
</p>
<p>
As one might expect, Bell Labs didn't use the paper tape input.
<a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2013-December/002929.html">According to Doug McIlroy</a>,
"as soon as the machine arrived, Joe Ossanna [the author of troff]
bypassed the tape reader so the C/A/T could be driven
directly from the PDP-11. The manufacturer was astonished."
The connection was one-way only, so the corresponding device had
write-only permissions,
and there was no way to obtain status feedback from the phototypesetter.
Doug McIlroy also remembers that, amusingly,
"the first technical paper that came off
the C/A/T drew a query from the journal editor, who'd never seen a
phototypeset manuscript before: had it been published elsewhere?"
</p>
<p>
This ardous but cutting-edge phototypesetting process set the stage
for the invention of the standard error concept.
<a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2013-December/002933.html">Stephen Johnson describes the incident as follows</a>.
</p><blockquote>
"One of the most amusing and unexpected consequences of phototypesetting
was the Unix standard error file (!).   After phototypesetting, you had to
take a long wide strip of paper and feed it carefully into a smelly, icky
machine which eventually (several minutes later) spat out the paper with
the printing visible."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"One afternoon several of us had the same experience -- typesetting
something, feeding the paper through the developer, only to find a single,
beautifully typeset line: "cannot open file foobar"   The grumbles were
loud enough and in the presence of the right people, and a couple of days
later the standard error file was born..."
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a gem from the archive of the NY Times. One day in September 1976, NY Times food critic Mimi Sheraton and Colonel Harland Sanders <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/09/archives/for-the-colonel-it-was-fingerlickin-bad.html">stopped into a Manhattan Kentucky Fried Chicken</a>. The Colonel, then estranged from the company he founded, strolled into the kitchen after glad-handing some patrons and proceeded to tear into the quality of the food:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once in the kitchen, the colonel walked over to a vat full of frying chicken pieces and announced, ‘That’s much too black. It should be golden brown. You’re frying for 12 minutes — that’s six minutes too long. What’s more, your frying fat should have been changed a week ago. That’s the worst fried chicken I’ve ever seen. Let me see your mashed potatoes with gravy, and how do you make them?”</p>
	
<p>When Mr. Singleton explained that he first mixed boiling water into the instant powdered potatoes, the colonel interrupted. “And then you have wallpaper paste,” he said. “Next suppose you add some of this brown gravy stuff and then you have sludge.” “There’s no way anyone can get me to swallow those potatoes,” he said after tasting some. “And this cole slaw. This cole slaw! They just won’t listen to me. It should he chopped, not shredded, and it should be made with Miracle Whip. Anything else turns gray. And there should be nothing in it but cabbage. No carrots!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Sanders sold his company to an investment group in 1964, which took the company public two years later and eventually sold to a company called Heublein. After selling, Sanders officially still worked for the company as an advisor but grew more and more dissatisfied with it, as evidenced by the story above. When the company HQ moved to Tennessee, the Colonel was quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>This ain’t no goddam Tennessee Fried Chicken, no matter what some slick, silk-suited son-of-a-bitch says.</p></blockquote>

<p>And he got sued by a KFC franchisee after he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZskrsscU7HkC&amp;pg=SA4-PA17&amp;lpg=SA4-PA17&amp;dq=My+God,+that+gravy+is+horrible!+sanders&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zfKAaLx1Rx&amp;sig=iZUPCcCs3LlSlsdnEGKkbQzEJx0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTpZn_3t3OAhVMCsAKHaviCY8Q6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=My%20God%2C%20that%20gravy%20is%20horrible!%20sanders&amp;f=false">commented</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>My God, that gravy is horrible. They buy tap water for 15 to 20 cents a thousand gallons and then mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste. And I know wallpaper paste, by God, because I’ve seen my mother make it.</p>

<p>To the “wallpaper paste” they add some sludge and sell it for 65 or 75 cents a pint. There’s no nutrition in it and the ought not to be allowed to sell it.</p>

<p>And another thing. That new crispy chicken is nothing in the world but a damn fried doughball stuck on some chicken.</p></blockquote>
