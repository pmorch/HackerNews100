<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
    <p>Shipping large software to end-user devices is a complicated process. Shipping large software <em>securely</em> to end-user devices is even more complicated. Signing the things that ship to end-user devices is one of those complications, and it gets even more complicated when you sign thousands of artifacts per day.</p>

<p>Mozilla has been signing Firefox in some form beginning with Firefox 1.0. This began with detached GPG signatures for builds, and progressed to Authenticode signing for Windows installers in Firefox 1.0.1. Since then it has evolved over time to encompass other platforms, other types of files within our products, and other ways that we ship (such as our own update packages). This post will provide a overview of the what, when, why, and how of code signing at Mozilla over the past ~20 years.</p>

<h2>What, when, and why</h2>

<h3>Early GPG &amp; Authenticode Signing</h3>

<p>When we first began signing, it happened on a Windows machine. Late in the release process, after Windows installers had been built, we would download all of the release artifacts to this machine, sign the Windows installers, and generate detached GPG signatures for those before pushing the artifacts elsewhere.</p>

<p>At this time, the private keys and certificates were held on a USB stick that was kept removed from the machine at-rest. A Release Engineer needed to be physically present in Mountain View to perform this step. Once inserted, signing could be done via Remote Desktop rather than at the physical machine (but don't forget to remove the USB stick afterwards!).</p>

<p>GPG signing was done with the standard GPG tools, running in cygwin. Authenticode signing was also done with the standard (at the time) Microsoft 'signcode.exe' tool. An annoying fact about that tool, is that it only accepted the necessary passphrase from a GUI dialog. To work around this, we had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoIt">AutoIt</a> script running in the background that injected the passphrase into this dialog whenever it popped up. This interesting way of automating the process meant that mouse movements or keyboard interaction at the wrong time could interfere with the signing process.</p>

<p>This process was partly scripted, but there was still a series of ~15 commands someone had to run by hand (and not mess up) to get everything done. You can see these commands for yourself in our now-ancient <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Unified_Release_Process#Sign_builds">Unified Release Process</a> documentation.</p>

<h3>Windows internal file signing</h3>

<p>Careful readers may have noted that early Authenticode signing only covered the Firefox installer itself, not the EXEs and DLLs inside of it. At some point (I haven't gone to the effort of tracking down exactly where...) we started signing these inner files as well. This process seems to have been <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Unified_Release_Process#Signing_windows_files">lost to the sands of time</a>, but I seem to recall it worked very similarly to the installer signing process, but without the GPG parts.</p>

<h3>Improved signing on Windows</h3>

<p>The first notable improvement we had to this process was to automate most of the copy/pasting that was done from the wiki. This came in the form of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/build-tools/blob/dba69406faad0c8e7a016150a3f5761ef83914d2/release/signing/Makefile">a Makefile that with a few mere inputs</a>, would download, sign, and re-upload the signed builds. The main benefit of this was reduced opportunity for human error.</p>

<p>Not long after that, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=470146">we had our first real game-changing improvements</a>. Chris AtLee <a href="https://atlee.ca/posts/blog20090804faster-signing/">wrote a nice post about it back in 2009</a>, and how his changes took signing time from 8 hours all the way down to sub-15 minutes. This was accomplished through a combination of faster hardware, parallelized signing, in-process compression &amp; decompression, and better caching. His changes also introduced <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/build-tools/blob/c2e8e6f048db8990d629f169072d2a06b42e4759/release/signing/sign-release.py">a hefty amount of python</a> into the signing process, which paved the way for the next big improvement...</p>

<h3>Automatic signing</h3>

<p>Despite the signing process now being very quick once it gets started, it could still sometimes take hours or longer to begin the process. Typically this would happen if our build and repack processes finished at a time when no Release Engineer was around to begin signing. This was solved with what we called "autosign". Rather than require a Release Engineer to be around at the right moment, we adjusted our scripts to allow them to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=558464#c1">be started ahead of time</a>, and be smart enough to know when all of the files it needs to sign are ready. This work eliminated all wait time between builds being ready and signing running.</p>

<h3>Signing Windows builds...on Linux!</h3>

<p>In 2011, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=509158#c10">signing was rearchitected altogether</a>. In short, the idea was to move signing to a highly secured Linux server, and sign builds through an API as part of the build process. This allowed builds to be signed as they were produced, and reduced the number of times builds had to move from one server to another before they shipped.

An obvious question here is how we would manage to sign Windows binaries on Linux...as it turns out, the mono project had <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/mono-devel/signcode.1.en.html">its own version of signcode that ran natively on Linux</a> that we were able to make use of.</p>

<h3>MAR Signing</h3>

<p>Shortly after (and perhaps even motivating - I'm not sure at this point) the aforementioned signing server work, we <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699700">began signing our MAR (Mozilla ARchive) packages</a> that update users from an older version of Firefox to a newer version. Thanks to the earlier work, it was fairly trivial to use the same architecture to sign these files.</p>

<h3>macOS .app signing</h3>

<p>The idea of signing .app bundles for macOS was filed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400296#c0">all the way back in 2007</a>. There was <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400296#c25">some initial work on this</a> in 2010, but we were unable to land it at that time. Around the same time that MAR signing was happening in 2012, we <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400296#c68">picked up this work again</a> and managed to drive it home this time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were no tools available at the time to sign macOS builds on anything except a fairly modern macOS machine. For this reason, we had to run additional copies of our signing server on macOS and sign those builds with them. (If you've ever had to run macOS as a server you'll know just how unfortunate this was...)</p>

<h3>Taskcluster/signingscript/iscript</h3>

<p>In 2018, Mozilla migrated its CI and Release automation from our aging Buildbot systems to <a href="https://taskcluster.net/">Taskcluster</a>. As part of this, signing tasks moved to specialized Taskcluster workers known as "signingscript" and "iscript", used for signing non-macOS and macOS builds respectively. These specialized workers continued to outsource the actual work of signing to the previously discussed signing servers.</p>

<p>An important part of this change is the introduction of <a href="https://scriptworker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chain_of_trust.html">Chain of Trust</a>, a significant security enhancement that helps ensure that only authentic artifacts are signed to this day.</p>

<h3>Introducing...Autograph!</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph">Autograph</a> is Mozilla's modern code signing service. It was built specifically to provide a signing service that allowed us to keep private key material in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Migrating release signing to it was a huge improvement over the existing signing server where Release Engineers had direct access to such things. It was initially used for signing XPIs and APKs, but by the end of 2019 we had migrated all non-macOS signing to it and retired the old Linux signing servers.</p>

<p>In addition to the security enhancements it brought, we saw great performance wins with it as well, largely in thanks to it's support for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph/blob/main/docs/architecture.md#overview"> only requiring a hash of the bytes being signed to be sent over the wire</a>. (This requires that the client has some advanced knowledge of the file being signed, but it saves a <em>tremendous</em> amount of network traffic at our scale.)

</p>
<h3>Notarization with rcodesign</h3><p>

In 2023 we started making use of <a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/0.17.0/apple_codesign_rcodesign.html">rcodesign</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker-scripts/pull/714">notarize and staple our macOS builds</a>. While actual macOS code signing itself continues to happen on macOS machines, this allowed us to move at least some of our operations into the cloud and reduce our reliance on mac hardware.

</p><h2>Tools and tech</h2>

<p>I've mentioned a number of tools and technology that we use as part of signing, but I've purposely glossed over some details in the interest of brevity. The following section is a glossary of sorts, and introduces some more under the hood tools that we use as part of signing. If you're interested in the gory details, the links below should be enough to find them for yourself! Or you can stop by <a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#firefox-ci:mozilla.org">#firefox-ci on Matrix to ask questions!</a></p>

<h3>osslsigncode</h3>
<p>osslsigncode is a <a href="https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode">tool that implements parts of Microsoft's signtool.exe</a>. In the past, we used it to directly sign PE files. These days, we use it's support for attaching the signatures that Autograph makes to them.</p>

<h3>winsign</h3>
<p>Winsign is a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-releng/winsign">python library for signing and manipulating Authenticode signatures</a>. It relies on osslsigncode for writing signatures, and supports signing directly with a private key, or outsourcing the signing process to a passed in function. The latter is what we use, and it's how we inject a call to Autograph into the signing process.</p>

<h3>msix-packaging</h3>
<p>In 2021 we began shipping Firefox as an MSIX package. As part of this we discovered that osslsigncode does not support signing MSIX packages. Luckily for us, Microsoft's MSIX packaging tools are open source and run on Linux, and we found a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/msix-packaging/issues/340#issuecomment-620797067">fork that contained most of what was needed</a> to support signing. With a few additional modifications, we were able to support signing these packages in our existing systems.</p>

<h3>apple-codesign</h3>
<p><a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/0.17.0/index.html">apple-codesign</a> is a very exciting project from Gregory Szorc which provides 3rd party tools capable of signing, notarizing, and stapling .app bundles and other Apple formats such as .pkg and .dmg. These tools run on Linux, and as noted above, we're already making use of them to notarize and staple our .app bundles.

We're extremely excited about this project, and grateful to Gregory Szorc for all the effort he's bit into it. In the future we're looking forward to migrating our actual code signing to these tools which would (finally) allow us to retire our dedicated macOS signing machines.</p>

<h3>mardor</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-releng/build-mar">mardor</a> is a python tool to manage, and most importantly, sign, MAR files. In the days before Autograph it was used to directly sign MAR files. These days we only use it to inject signatures made by Autograph into the files, similar to our usage of osslsigncode.</p>

<h3>signingscript</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker-scripts/tree/master/signingscript">signingscript</a> is the glue between our CI system (Taskcluster) and Autograph. Through a combination of the tools listed above, custom code in signingscript itself, and communication with Autograph it produces signed builds. It is additionally responsible for notarizing and stapling our macOS builds.</p>

<h3>iscript</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker-scripts/tree/master/iscript">iscript</a> is essentially a pared down version of signingscript (in fact their code is both derived from our early signing server code), and is responsible for signing our macOS builds. iscript runs on a small cluster of mac minis, which are a huge pain in the butt to manage.

</p>
<h3>autograph</h3><p>
As noted in an earlier section <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph">Autograph</a> is our modern code signing service. It has a simple HTTP API that accepts signing requests and returns signed data or files. In addition to signing various artifacts that we ship it also makes <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph/blob/main/signer/contentsignaturepki/README.md">Content Signatures</a> on behalf of addons.mozilla.org, aus5.mozilla.org/Balrog (our update server), and some other backend services that Firefox communicates with, helping to ensure the security and integrity of requests made between Firefox and Mozilla-run services.

</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What a ride it's been over the last 20 years! We've gone from signing nothing to signing nearly everything in some form. Signing started off as a very manual process, and now happens seamlessly thousands of times per day.</p>

<p>I don't think it would be possible to name everyone that contributed to this, but it took the ideas and efforts of tens, if not hundreds, of people to get to this point: release engineers, build system experts, security folks, and many others were all critical to getting us where we are today.</p>

But with more and more mail being sent,&nbsp;in 1963 the Postal Service decided to roll out the <strong>Zone Improvement Plan</strong> &nbsp;which transformed addresses to look like the following:</p><p><strong>Mr. John Smith<br>3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue<br>Minneapolis &nbsp;MN 55416</strong></p><p>The five digit code represents a part of the country (5_ _ _ _ ) &nbsp;a sectional center facility ( _ 5 4 _ _ ) &nbsp;and the associate post office or delivery area (_ _ _ 1 6). </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/66b9cffc5d14b6e5ca213d33_639c39c9c67f664c8539d8da_zip-first-digit.png" alt="First digit of every zip code" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>The first digit for every zip code for the states in the contiguous United States</p><p>By 1967 ZIP codes were made mandatory for bulk mailers and continued to be adopted by almost anyone sending mail in the US. Over time,&nbsp;the ZIP+4 was added to add more granularity to the zip code to denote specific locations &nbsp;even buildings for postal workers to deliver. The Postal Service even created a character,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._ZIP">Mr. Zip</a>,&nbsp;to promote the use of ZIP codes,&nbsp;who was featured on stamps,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf71PHyOfR0">commercials</a> &nbsp;and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojn6U2kP_pQ">songs</a>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f66731639d8de_mr-zip.jpeg" alt="Mr. Zip" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>ZIP codes themselves do not actually represent an area,&nbsp;rather a collection of routes:</p><p>Despite the geographic derivation of most ZIP Codes,&nbsp;the codes themselves do not represent geographic regions; in general,&nbsp;they correspond to address groups or delivery routes. As a consequence &nbsp;ZIP Code "areas" can overlap &nbsp;be subsets of each other,&nbsp;or be artificial constructs with no geographic area (such as 095 for mail to the Navy &nbsp;which is not geographically fixed). In similar fashion,&nbsp;in areas without regular postal routes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_delivery_service">rural route</a> areas) or no mail delivery (undeveloped areas) &nbsp;ZIP Codes are not assigned or are based on sparse delivery routes &nbsp;and hence the boundary between ZIP Code areas is undefined.</p><p>The US Census provides data for <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html">ZIP Code Tabulation Areas</a>,&nbsp;or geographic files:</p><p>ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are generalized areal representations of United States Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas.The USPS ZIP Codes identify the individual post office or metropolitan area delivery station associated with mailing addresses. USPS ZIP Codes are not areal features but a collection of mail delivery routes.</p><p>Here we find our first problem with ZIP Codes,&nbsp;that they do not represent an actual area on a map,&nbsp;but rather a collection of routes that help postal workers effectively deliver mail. They aren't designed to measure sociodemographic trends &nbsp;as a business would generally want to do. You can actually look up <a href="https://www.melissa.com/v2/lookups/mapcartzip/zipcode?zipcode=10009">individual delivery routes</a> &nbsp;like the one below:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f66975339d8e4_zip-route-nyc.png" alt="One zip code route in New York's East Village" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>One zip code route in New York's East Village</p><p>We are only scratching the surface of the issue here. Similar issues exist around the world,&nbsp;with postal codes representing strange boundaries</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f66abda39d8dc_global-zip-shapes.png" alt="Postal Codes in London  Toronto  and Sydney" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>Postal Codes in London,&nbsp;Toronto,&nbsp;and Sydney.</p><h3>Using ZIP codes for data analysis</h3><p>Fast forward to today,&nbsp;where many companies can easily look into their database and find a dataset with a zip_code column in it, which allows them to group and aggregate data to see trends and business performance metrics. As stated earlier,&nbsp;the problem with ZIP Codes is that:</p><ol role="list"><li>They don't represent real boundaries &nbsp;but rather routes</li><li>They don't represent how humans behave</li></ol><p>The later represents two specific issues in using spatial data: spatial scale of observations and spatial scale support (you can learn more about this in this lecture from UChicago's Luc Anselin, <a href="https://youtu.be/MmCYeJ27DsA?t=326">here</a>). The first is that humans don't behave based on <a href="https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/boundary-data">administrative units</a> such as zip codes,&nbsp;or even census units. Their behavior is influenced much more by their neighbors,&nbsp;or areas such as a neighborhoods or high activity areas (such as central business districts). The second is that spatial data is provided at multiple scales,&nbsp;and many times those boundaries are overlapping or nested within another boundary. </p><p>Let's look at an example of this in one specific area in Dallas.</p><p>In this map,&nbsp;we can see large white boundaries,&nbsp;which represent <a href="https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/browser/dataset/acs_sociodemogr_716c8567/">ZIP code boundaries</a>,&nbsp;and below them are boundaries for <a href="https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/browser/geography/tigr_blockgroup_688551c7/">US Census Block Groups</a>. The darker green represents higher income,&nbsp;as provided by the US Census. You can access both of these datasets - with associated sociodemographic data - via our <a href="https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/browser">Spatial Data Catalog</a>.</p><p>When we look at one specific ZIP Code we can see that income data in even more detail:</p><p>What we can see is that 12 month median household income in this single zip code (75206) ranges from $9,700 to $227,000 when we look at block groups that completely or partially fall within this single ZIP Code,&nbsp;which the Census lists as having a median household income of $63,392.</p><p>Median Income is one way to evaluate the range of values within a ZIP Code (keep in mind these are ZCTA boundaries) but we can likely see variance like this in population,&nbsp;employment,&nbsp;and other relevant metrics for data analysis. </p><p>Sticking with median household income,&nbsp;we decided to expand this analysis to the entire United States,&nbsp;to see which areas are the least and most in-equal when you look at ZIP Codes and the Census Block Groups that intersect with the ZCTA Boundaries.</p><p><strong>The most unequal zip code is 33139 in Miami Beach &nbsp;FL</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>33139: Miami &nbsp;FL ($241,344 Difference)</li><li>44120: Cleveland &nbsp;OH ($237,501 Difference)</li><li>10013: New York &nbsp;NY ($233,559 Difference)</li><li>10023: New York &nbsp;NY ($233,157 Difference)</li><li>11201: Brooklyn &nbsp;NY ($233,031 Difference)</li><li>10601: White Plains &nbsp;NY ($232,813 Difference)</li><li>33141: Miami &nbsp;FL ($232,633 Difference)</li><li>92648: Huntington Beach &nbsp;CA ($231,290 Difference)</li><li>98105: Seattle &nbsp;WA ($230,906 Difference)</li><li>33143: Miami &nbsp;FL ($230,626 Difference)</li></ol><p><strong>The most similar* zip code is in Chesapeake &nbsp;WV</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>25315: Chesapeake &nbsp;WV ($2 Difference)</li><li>79357: Cone &nbsp;TX ($4 Difference)</li><li>65052: Linn Creek &nbsp;MO ($9 Difference)</li><li>73093: Washington &nbsp;OK ($12 Difference)</li><li>68370: Hebron &nbsp;NE ($13 Difference)</li><li>19541: Mohrsville &nbsp;PA ($15 Difference)</li><li>05340: Bondville &nbsp;VT ($18 Difference)</li><li>12958: Mooers &nbsp;NY ($26 Difference)</li><li>19941: Ellendale &nbsp;DE ($37 Difference)</li><li>54896: Loretta &nbsp;WI ($38 Difference)</li></ol><p><em>* similar where the difference is greater than 0</em></p><p>We can quickly use <a href="https://carto.com/workflows">CARTO Workflows</a> to perform this analysis for all of the United States without code.

Next, the <a href="https://docs.carto.com/carto-user-manual/workflows/components/joins#spatial-join">Group By</a> component was used to calculate the minimum and maximum income for each zip code, after which the Create Column component was used to calculate the difference between the two. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/66b9cffc5d14b6e5ca213d37_65609c448a3c55d4b787852c_zip_codes_workflow.png" loading="lazy" alt="A screenshot of CARTO Workflows being used to analyze zip codes "></p></figure><p>After creating this as a new table we can see that the majority of the most unequal zip codes tend to be in cities or larger metro areas and more equal zip codes tend to be in rural areas around the country.</p><p><a href="https://clausa.app.carto.com/map/29fd0873-64cb-42a6-a90d-c83a8840bbfe">Check out the full map.</a></p><p> <a href="https://carto.com/signup/" target="_blank">Sign me up for a FREE account</a></p><p>Learn more about how organisations are changing the way they perform spatial analysis with our FREE ebook <a href="https://go.carto.com/state-spatial-data-science-2024">The State of Spatial Data Science 2024</a>!</p><figure><a href="https://go.carto.com/state-spatial-data-science-2024" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/66b9cffc5d14b6e5ca213d1b_66b9cfe8dd3bc64e0fcb225b_State%2520of%2520Spatial%2520Data%2520Science%2520202%2520-%2520Email%2520620x280.png" loading="lazy" alt="A promotional imagefor the report"></p></a></figure><h3>So why do we use ZIP Codes?</h3><p>In practice,&nbsp;it is easy to use zip codes as a geospatial unit. As we stated earlier,&nbsp;almost any e-commerce or delivery service,&nbsp;or app that uses location or needs to locate their users in any way will collect a zip code. Additionally &nbsp;everyone is familiar with zip codes &nbsp;as they are part of any address in most countries. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f669fdb39d8db_zip-lookup.png" alt="'Find A Store' on Target.com" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>'Find A Store' on Target.com</p><p>Terms like Census Block Group or Tract are less familiar to those who don't work with geospatial data on a regular basis &nbsp;and they can be more difficult to find and harder to work with &nbsp;especially if you aren't familiar with terms like Shapefile, FTP,&nbsp;and ETL. Even then you have to go through the US Census FTP website,, download geographic files state by state &nbsp;and join those files to census measures.</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;most people know &nbsp;without looking at a map that zip codes represent a smaller area than a city,&nbsp;but larger than say a neighborhood. Conceptually,&nbsp;they feel small enough to get a very focused view of the world,&nbsp;and big enough to capture enough of a sample size of trends.</p><p><strong>The short answer is that zip codes are easy to find,&nbsp;familiar,&nbsp;and provide a granular enough view of the world (or so we thought).</strong></p><p>With that said there are real world problems that arise from using zip codes in geospatial analysis. One example is in real estate where,&nbsp;in many cities or areas,&nbsp;there are homes listed in a &nbsp;zip code &nbsp;even though as we know those boundaries are arbitrary. <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/04/research-when-airbnb-listings-in-a-city-increase-so-do-rent-prices">This article</a> from the Harvard Business Review also describes a similar phenomenon with Airbnb listings and rising rent prices.</p><p>In simple terms &nbsp;we argue that if a zip code is "touristy," meaning it has a lot of restaurants and bars,&nbsp;and if awareness of Airbnb increases &nbsp;which we measure using the Google search index for the keyword "Airbnb," then any jump in Airbnb supply in that zip code is likely driven by an increase in demand for short-term rentals through Airbnb &nbsp;rather than local economic conditions.</p><p>More importantly,&nbsp;using zip codes for analysis can mask serious conditions that are taking place at a different spatial scale. The Flint water crisis was one of these cases. This article by Richard Casey Sadler,&nbsp;an Assistant Professor at Michigan State University describes the problem in great detail and raises similar points about zip codes (the full article is well worth reading):</p><p>Dr. Tony Grubesic,&nbsp;an Arizona State University professor &nbsp;has called them "one of the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038012106000516">quirkier 'geographies'</a> in the world." Dr. Nancy Krieger,&nbsp;a Harvard University professor &nbsp;and colleagues have called out their <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447194/">unacceptability</a> for small-area analyses.</p><p>Ultimately the state used zip codes to analyze the blood lead statistics in aggregate,&nbsp;which effectively masked the actual issue. This is because:</p><p>In Flint's case,&nbsp;the state's error was introduced because "Flint ZIP codes" do not align well with the city of Flint or its water system. The city and water system are almost 100 percent coterminous – that is &nbsp;they share the same boundaries… &nbsp;In total,&nbsp;Flint ZIP codes used in the state's analysis blanket parts of eight different municipalities (seven townships and one city) surrounding Flint.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f66616a39d8e1_flint-zip-misallignment.jpeg" alt="'Map by Richard Casey Sadler" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>Map by Richard Casey Sadler</p><p>In the case of Flint &nbsp;simply looking at a different spatial scale or analysis may have shown the problem more clearly. For fields like public health and critical services &nbsp;understanding and using appropriate spatial scale is critically important.</p><h3>What else can we do?</h3><p>So if you are compelled to do away with zip code analysis,&nbsp;the good news is that there are several different options available.</p><h4>Use Addresses</h4><p>The first and foremost recommendation would be to use real world addresses. When you know an address string,&nbsp;you can use a geocoder - or the service that Google or other map search engines use to take an address and transform it into latitude and longitude. Most every major service offers an API and wrappers for different languages to do this. Keep in mind there are generally some <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/address-geocoding-format-guide/">best practices</a> for cleaning your data &nbsp;and you will need valid address strings to do so. Other tools like <a href="https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal">Libpostal</a> can help you normalize and parse your address strings.</p><h4>Use Census Units</h4><p>You can also use Census units such as a Census Block Group or Tract. As I mentioned it has not always been easy to find and collect this data at scale &nbsp;but there are many new tools that are becoming available to use. <a href="https://github.com/cenpy-devs/cenpy">CenPy</a> is a Python library that allows you to connect and find Census data (good <a href="https://medium.com/@mswhitetoyou/scraping-us-census-data-via-cenpy-9aeab12c877e">tutorial here</a>) where you can find measures from the decennial census or American Community Survey. CARTO also provides Census and ACS through the <a href="https://carto.com/developers/data-observatory/">Data Observatory</a> &nbsp;which was used in the notebook for the full US analysis.</p><p>You can also find out Census geometry IDs for a specific address location using the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/Geocoding-services.html">US Census Geocoder</a>. You can pass in a variety of parameters via the API or use it in Python with the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/censusgeocode/">censusgeocode</a> package.</p><p>As your gather address data,&nbsp;you can easily add in a Census Tract or Block Group ID to that entry &nbsp;and use that rather than the zip code field in your data. This will allow you to do the same aggregation you were doing &nbsp;except at a more appropriate geographic scale.</p><h4>Use your own Spatial Index</h4><p>Finally -&nbsp;and arguably the best option - is to use a Spatial Index.</p><p>Spatial Indexes like <a href="https://eng.uber.com/h3/">H3</a> and <a href="http://s2geometry.io/%3ES2%20cells%3C/a%3E%20%20you%20can%20use%20%3Ca%20href=">quadkey</a> are global, multi-resolution grid systems which are geolocated by a short reference ID, rather than a complex geometry. This makes them super lightweight to store and lightning-fast to analyze. The grid cells have the same shape (although their size varies by latitude), meaning data is evenly geographically distributed - avoiding boundary and visual bias which is often caused by irregular grids like zip code; read&nbsp;more <a href="https://carto.com/blog/hexagons-for-location-intelligence">here</a>. </p><p>‍</p><p>A key benefit here is the anonymization of sensitive data. Given that address data can be sensitive &nbsp;you can create a data pipeline that simply reads incoming addresses &nbsp;geocodes them,&nbsp;assigns a spatial index,&nbsp;then passes that indexed data into a separate table,&nbsp;then you can store or delete the address data as needed.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f66ae7839d8df_uber-h3-cells.png" alt="Uber H3 Cells" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>Want to learn more about Spatial Indexes?

For now it clusters a mesh (meshlets), then groups adjacent clusters into a group, merges the mesh (shared vertices), performs mesh simplification to half the triangles in the mesh (max 128) and finally it splits it into 2 (should be N/2).</p>

<p dir="auto">Regular expressions is a great tool for searching patterns in text. But I always found it unnatural for text editing. The <em>group</em> logic works as a post-processor and can be complicated. Here I propose an extension to the regular expression language for pattern matching and text modification. I call it <strong>transductive regular expressions</strong> or simply <strong><code>trre</code></strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It  introduces the <code>:</code> symbol to define transformations. The simplest form is <code>a:b</code>, which replaces a with b. I call this a <code>transductive pair</code> or <code>transduction</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To demonstrate the concept, I have created a command line tool <strong><code>trre</code></strong>. It feels similar to the <code>grep -E</code> command.</p>

<p dir="auto">You can also use the star in the left part to "consume" a pattern infinitely:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ echo 'catcatcat' | trre '(cat)*:(dog)'

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Language specification</h2><a id="user-content-language-specification" aria-label="Permalink: Language specification" href="#language-specification"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Informally, we define a <strong><code>trre</code></strong> as a pair <code>pattern-to-match</code>:<code>pattern-to-generate</code>. The <code>pattern-to-match</code> can be a string or regexp. The <code>pattern-to-generate</code> normally is a string. But it can be a <code>regex</code> as well. Moreover, we can do normal regular expression over these pairs.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can specify a smiplified grammar of <strong><code>trre</code></strong> as following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="TRRE    <- TRRE* TRRE|TRRE TRRE.TRRE
TRRE    <- REGEX REGEX:REGEX"><pre><code>TRRE    &lt;- TRRE* TRRE|TRRE TRRE.TRRE
TRRE    &lt;- REGEX REGEX:REGEX
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Where <code>REGEX</code> is a usual regular expression, and <code>.</code> stands for concatenation.</p>
<p dir="auto">For now I consider the operator <code>:</code> as non-associative and the expression <code>TRRE:TRRE</code> as unsyntactical. There is a natural meaning for this expression as a composition of relations defined by **<code>trre</code>**s. But it can make things too complex. Maybe I change this later.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why it works</h2><a id="user-content-why-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: Why it works" href="#why-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Under the hood, <strong><code>trre</code></strong> constructs a special automaton called a <strong>Finite State Transducer (FST)</strong>, which is similar to a <strong>Finite State Automaton (FSA)</strong> used in normal regular expressions but handles input-output pairs instead of plain strings.</p>
<p dir="auto">Key differences:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong><code>trre</code></strong> defines a binary relation between two regular languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">It uses <strong>FST</strong>s instead of <strong>FSA</strong>s for inference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">It supports on-the-fly determinization for performance (experimental and under construction!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To justify the laguage of trunsductive regular expression we need to prove the correspondence between <strong><code>trre</code></strong> expressions and the corresponding <strong>FST</strong>s. There is my sketch of a the proof: <a href="https://github.com/c0stya/trre/blob/main/doc/theory.pdf">theory.pdf</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are tons of decisions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Associativity of <code>:</code>. The <code>:</code> symbol is non-associative, meaning a:b:c is invalid in the current version. There is a natural meaning of transducer composition but it could make things too complicated. Alternative syntaxes (e.g., &gt; and &lt;) could be explored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Precedence of <code>:</code>. The priority of : in expressions needs clarification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Implicit Epsilon: should there be an explicit symbol?</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong><code>trre</code></strong> supports two modes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Scan Mode (default)</strong>: Applies transformations sequentially.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Match Mode</strong>: Checks the entire string against the expression (use <code>-m</code> flag).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>-a</code> to generate all possible outputs.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>? modifier makes </code>*<code>, </code>+<code>, and </code>{,}` operators non-greedy:</p>

<p dir="auto">The important part of the modern regex engines is determinization. This routine converts the non-deterministic automata to the deterministic one. Once converted it has linear time inference on the input string length. It is handy but the convertion is exponential in the worst case.</p>
<p dir="auto">For <strong><code>trre</code></strong> the similar approach is possible. The bad news is that not all the non-deterministic transducers (<strong>NFT</strong>) can be converted to a deterministic (<strong>DFT</strong>). In case of two "bad" cycles with same input labels the algorithm is trapped in the infinite loop of a state creation. There is a way to detect such loops but it is expensive (see more in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/twins.pdf" rel="nofollow">Allauzen, Mohri, Efficient Algorithms for testing the twins property</a>).</p>

    <p>All known human languages display a surprising pattern: the most frequent word in a language is twice as frequent as the second most frequent, three times as frequent as the third, and so on. This is known as Zipf’s law. </p>

<p>Researchers have hunted for evidence of this pattern in communication among other species, but until now no other examples have been found.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adq7055">new research</a> published today in Science, our team of experts in whale song, linguistics and developmental psychology analysed eight years’ of song recordings from humpback whales in New Caledonia. Led by Inbal Arnon from the Hebrew University, Ellen Garland from the University of St Andrews, and Simon Kirby from the University of Edinburgh, We used techniques inspired by the way human infants learn language to analyse humpback whale song. </p>

<p>We discovered that the same Zipfian pattern universally found across human languages also occurs in whale song. This complex signalling system, like human language, is culturally learned by each individual from others.</p>

<h2>Learning like an infant</h2>

<p>When infant humans are learning, they have to somehow discover where words start and end. Speech is continuous and does not come with gaps between words that they can use. So how do they break into language? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.274.5294.1926">Thirty years of research</a> has revealed that they do this by listening for sounds that are surprising in context: sounds within words are relatively predictable, but between words are relatively unpredictable. We analysed the whale song data using the same procedure.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, using this technique revealed in whale song the same statistical properties that are found in all languages. It turns out both human language and whale song have statistically coherent parts.</p>

<p>In other words, they both contain recurring parts where the transitions between elements are more predictable within the part. Moreover, these recurring sub-sequences we detected follow the Zipfian frequency distribution found across all human languages, and not found before in other species. </p>

<p>How do the same statistical properties arise in two evolutionarily distant species that differ from one another in so many ways? We suggest we found these  similarities because humans and whales share a learning mechanism: culture.  </p>

<h2>A cultural origin</h2>

<p>Our findings raise an exciting question: why would such different systems in such incredibly distant species have common structures? We suggest the reason behind this is that both are culturally learned. </p>

<p>Cultural evolution inevitably leads to the emergence of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0707835105">properties that make learning easier</a>. If a system is hard to learn, it will not survive to the next generation of learners. </p>

<p>There is <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027722000269">growing evidence</a> from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-56152-9">experiments with humans</a> that having statistically coherent parts, and having them follow a Zipfian distribution, makes learning easier. This suggests that learning and transmission play an important role in how these properties emerged in both human language and whale song.</p>

<h2>So can we talk to whales now?</h2>

<p>Finding parallel structures between whale song and human language may also lead to another question: can we talk to whales now? The short answer is no, not at all. </p>

<p>Our study does not examine the meaning behind whale song sequences. We have no idea what these segments might mean to the whales, if they mean anything at all. </p>

<p>It might help to think about it like instrumental music, as music also contains similar structures. A melody can be learned, repeated, and spread – but that doesn’t give meaning to the musical notes in the same way that individual words have meaning.</p>

<h2>Next up: birdsong</h2>

<p>Our work also makes a bold prediction: we should find this Zipfian distribution wherever complex communication is transmitted culturally. Humans and whales are not the only species that do this. </p>

<p>We find what is known as “vocal production learning” in an unusual range of species across the animal kingdom. Song birds in particular may provide the best place to look as many bird species culturally learn their songs, and unlike in whales, we know a lot about precisely <a href="https://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1298.026">how birds learn song</a>. </p>

<p>Equally, we expect not to find these statistical properties in the communication of species that don’t transmit complex communication by learning. This will help to reveal whether cultural evolution is the common driver of these properties between humans and whales.</p>

<p>Emails discussing torrenting prove that Meta knew it was "illegal," authors alleged. And Bashlykov's warnings seemingly landed on deaf ears, with authors alleging that evidence showed Meta chose to instead hide its torrenting as best it could while downloading and seeding terabytes of data from multiple shadow libraries as recently as April 2024.</p>
<h2>Meta allegedly concealed seeding</h2>
<p>Supposedly, Meta tried to conceal the seeding by not using Facebook servers while downloading the dataset to "avoid" the "risk" of anyone "tracing back the seeder/downloader" from Facebook servers, an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.9.pdf">internal message</a> from Meta researcher Frank Zhang said, while describing the work as in "stealth mode." Meta also allegedly modified settings "so that the smallest amount of seeding possible could occur," a Meta executive in charge of project management, Michael Clark, said in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.8.pdf">deposition</a>.</p>
<p>Now that new information has come to light, authors claim that Meta staff involved in the decision to torrent LibGen must be deposed again, because allegedly the new facts "contradict prior deposition testimony."</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, for example, claimed to have no involvement in decisions to use LibGen to train AI models. But unredacted messages show the "decision to use LibGen occurred" after "a prior escalation to MZ," authors alleged.</p>
<p>Meta did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment and has maintained throughout the litigation that AI training on LibGen was "fair use."</p>
<p>However, Meta has previously addressed its torrenting in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-motion-to-dismiss-1-31-25.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> filed last month, telling the court that "plaintiffs do not plead a single instance in which any part of any book was, in fact, downloaded by a third party from Meta via torrent, much less that Plaintiffs’ books were somehow distributed by Meta."</p>
<p>While Meta may be confident in its legal strategy despite the new torrenting wrinkle, the social media company has seemingly complicated its case by allowing authors to expand the distribution theory that's key to winning a direct copyright infringement claim beyond just claiming that Meta's AI outputs unlawfully distributed their works.</p>
<p>As limited discovery on Meta's seeding now proceeds, Meta is not fighting the seeding aspect of the direct copyright infringement claim at this time, telling the court that it plans to "set... the record straight and debunk... this meritless allegation on summary judgment."</p>

<p dir="auto">I am labelling this as a <strong>bug</strong> because this behavior is unexpected and undocumented.</p>
<p dir="auto">I guess you might be embarrassed by what your AI says when it autocompletes gender related matters since it is probably trained on biased datasets. However disabling autocompletion is not a great solution since gender can be very present in :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>translations in many languages (not much in English though), such as latine languages where nouns do have genders</li>
<li>sentences generation (for documentation, games, etc.) in those languages</li>
<li>medical, administrative or demographics works</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For which Copilot shutting down on most of the files is deceptive and pretty annoying.</p>
<p dir="auto">I don't have any elegant solution in mind and I know this seems like an edge case, but I hope this will be taken into account someday.</p>

Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree.</p><p>It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China.</p><p>But Yatai, She Zhijiang's company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos – as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich.</p><p>The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades.</p><p>She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited.</p><p>But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Tall buildings in Myanmar's Myawaddy seen from Thailand's border, where armed guards stand on a bridge  " loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1504/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 976w" width="1504" height="847.0107526881721"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Jonathan Head/BBC</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>New high-rises on the Myanmar side are visible from Thailand's border</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Publicity about the scams is also hurting Thai tourism – Thailand is shutting down power to compounds over the border, toughening its banking rules and promising to block visas for those suspected of using Thailand as a transit route.</p><p>Shwe Kokko has been left marooned in post-coup, war-wracked Myanmar, unable to bring in the flow of investment and visitors it needs to keep going.</p><p>Yatai is trying to fix the city's sinister image by allowing journalists to see it, holding out hope that more favourable reporting might even get She Zhijiang out of jail.</p><p>So they invited the BBC to Shwe Kokko.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Getting there is tricky.</p><p>Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors.</p><p>As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country's commercial hub Yangon – through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols.</p><p>She Zhijiang's colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees – "Mr She believes in making a green city," they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants.</p><p>At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city.

"Rich people, from many countries, they rent the villas," they told us. And what about the businesses? "Many businesses. Hotels, casinos."</p><p>However, most of the people we saw were local Karen, one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities, who come into Shwe Kokko every day to work. We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos.</p><p>Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that "online businesses" should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running.</p><p>Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar's border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State.</p><p>The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings.</p><p>Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work. Those who have escaped have told harrowing stories of torture and beatings.

He lives with Wang Fugui in a sprawling villa they have built on the banks of the Moei River, overlooking Thailand, and guarded by massive Chinese bodyguards. There they play mahjong, eat the finest food and drink, and keep an eye on business.</p><p>Mr He has a slightly different explanation from his boss for the scams still operating under their noses. "We are just property developers," he said. "I can guarantee that this kind of thing does not happen here. </p><p>"But even if it does, the local people have their own legal system, so it is their job to deal with it. Our job is just to provide good infrastructure, good buildings and supporting industries."</p><p>But there is no legal system in this part of Myanmar, nor any government. It is ruled by the various armed groups which control different bits of territory along the Thai border. </p><p>Their commanders decide who can build or run a business, taking their cut to help fund their wars against the Myanmar military, or against each other. Many of them are known to be hosting scam compounds.</p><p>Mr He admitted that it was the war which had allowed Yatai to obtain the land so cheaply. Karen human rights groups have accused Saw Chit Thu of driving the original inhabitants off their land, with minimal compensation, though it is clear Yatai is also providing badly needed jobs for the locals.</p><p>It is the lawlessness of Karen State which makes it so appealing to illegal businesses – and that doesn't help the image of Shwe Kokko.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="He Yingxiong who is running Shwe Kokko stands in front of a wooden fence with a field and city in the background" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/999/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 976w" width="999" height="562.4369999999999"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Jonathan Head/BBC</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>He Yingxiong is runnning Shwe Kokko in She Zhijiang's absence...</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="A view of the villa that is being used by He Yingxiong who is currently running Shwe Kokko.

        <p>Today we released our <a href="https://source.coop/repositories/harvard-lil/gov-data/description">archive of data.gov</a> on Source Cooperative. The 16TB collection includes over 311,000 datasets harvested during 2024 and 2025, a complete archive of federal public datasets linked by data.gov. It will be updated daily as new datasets are added to data.gov.</p>

<p>This is the first release in our new <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2025/01/30/preserving-public-u-s-federal-data/">data vault project</a> to preserve and authenticate vital public datasets for academic research, policymaking, and public use.</p>

<p>We’ve built this project on our long-standing commitment to preserving government records and making public information available to everyone. Libraries play an essential role in safeguarding the integrity of digital information. By preserving detailed metadata and establishing digital signatures for authenticity and provenance, we make it easier for researchers and the public to cite and access the information they need over time.</p>

<p>In addition to the data collection, we are releasing <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/data-vault">open source software and documentation</a> for replicating our work and creating similar repositories. With these tools, we aim not only to preserve knowledge ourselves but also to empower others to save and access the data that matters to them.</p>

<p>For suggestions and collaboration on future releases, please contact us at lil@law.harvard.edu.</p>

<p>This project builds on our work with the <a href="https://perma.cc/">Perma.cc</a> web archiving tool used by courts, law journals, and law firms; the <a href="https://case.law/">Caselaw Access Project</a>, sharing all precedential cases of the United States; and our research on <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/century-scale-storage/">Century Scale Storage</a>. This work is made possible with support from the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.</p>

  <div><p><span>If you’re fed up with Meta right now, you’re not alone. Google searches for deleting Facebook and Instagram </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/google-searches-for-deleting-facebook-instagram-explode-after-meta-ends-fact-checking/"><span>spiked last week</span></a><span> after Meta announced its latest policy changes.

Meta tracks your activity across millions of websites and apps, regardless of whether you use its platforms, and it profits from that data through targeted ads. If you want to limit Meta’s ability to collect and profit from your personal data, here’s what you need to know.</span></p>
<h3><span>Meta’s Business Model Relies on Your Personal Data</span></h3>
<p><span>You might think of Meta as a social media company, but its primary business is </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/save-news-we-must-ban-surveillance-advertising"><span>surveillance advertising</span></a><span>. Meta’s </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/11/after-facebook-leaks-here-what-should-come-next"><span>business model</span></a><span> relies on collecting as much information as possible about people in order to sell highly-targeted ads. That’s why Meta is </span><a href="https://duckduckgo.github.io/tracker-radar-wiki/"><span>one of the main companies</span></a><span> tracking you across the internet—monitoring your activity far beyond its own platforms. When Apple introduced changes to make tracking harder on iPhones, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2021/11/06/apples-new-iphone-privacy-features-cost-facebook-10-billion/"><span>Meta lost billions in revenue</span></a><span>, demonstrating just how valuable your personal data is to its business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How Meta Harvests Your Personal Data</span></h3>
<p><span>Meta’s tracking tools are embedded in </span><a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Facebook-Pixel"><span>millions</span></a><span> of </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/newsletter/hello-world/facebooks-pervasive-pixel"><span>websites</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://privacyinternational.org/report/2647/how-apps-android-share-data-facebook-report"><span>apps</span></a><span>, so you can’t escape the company’s surveillance just by avoiding or deleting Facebook and Instagram. Meta’s tracking pixel, found on </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/newsletter/hello-world/facebooks-pervasive-pixel"><span>30% of the world’s most popular websites</span></a><span>, monitors people’s behavior across the web and can expose sensitive information, including </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/04/28/applied-for-student-aid-online-facebook-saw-you"><span>financial</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-ban-betterhelp-revealing-consumers-data-including-sensitive-mental-health-information-facebook"><span>mental</span></a> <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/proposed-ftc-order-will-prohibit-telehealth-firm-cerebral-using-or-disclosing-sensitive-data"><span>health</span></a><span> data. </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/newsletter/hello-world/facebooks-pervasive-pixel"><span>A 2022 investigation by </span><i><span>The Markup</span></i></a><span> found that a third of the top U.S. hospitals had sent sensitive patient information to Meta through its tracking pixel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meta’s surveillance isn’t limited to your online activity. The company also </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1142103235885551?id=565900110447546"><span>encourages businesses</span></a><span> to send them data about your offline purchases and interactions. Even deleting your Facebook and Instagram accounts won’t stop Meta from harvesting your personal data. Meta in 2018 admitted to </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/20/17254312/facebook-shadow-profiles-data-collection-non-users-mark-zuckerberg"><span>collecting information about non-users</span></a><span>, including their contact details and browsing history.</span></p>
<h3><span>Take These Steps to Limit How Meta Profits From Your Personal Data</span></h3>
<p><span>Although Meta’s surveillance systems are pervasive, there are ways to limit how Meta collects and uses your personal data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Update Your Meta Account Settings</span></h4>
<p><span>Open your Instagram or Facebook app and navigate to the </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span> page.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You’ll find a link to </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span> on the </span><b><i>Settings</i></b><span> pages of both apps. If you have trouble finding </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span>, check Meta’s help pages for </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/247395082112892?cms_platform=www&amp;helpref=platform_switcher"><span>Facebook</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/245100253430454"><span>Instagram</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>If you use a web browser instead of Meta’s apps, visit </span><a href="http://accountscenter.facebook.com/"><span>accountscenter.facebook.com</span></a><span> or </span><a href="http://accountscenter.instagram.com/"><span>accountscenter.instagram.com</span></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/01/17/metaaccountscenteroutlined.png" width="2154" height="1120" alt="A screenshot of the Meta Accounts Center page. " title="A screenshot of the Meta Accounts Center page. "></span></p>
<p><span>If your Facebook and Instagram accounts are linked on your </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span> page, you only have to update&nbsp;the following&nbsp;settings once. If not, you’ll have to update them separately for Facebook and Instagram. Once you find your way to the </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span>, the directions below are the same for both platforms.</span></p>
<p><span>Meta makes it harder than it should be to find and update these settings. The following steps are accurate at the time of publication, but Meta often changes their settings and adds additional steps. The exact language below may not match what Meta displays in your region, but you should have a setting controlling each of the following permissions.</span></p>
<p>Once you’re on the “Accounts Center” page, make the following changes:</p>
<p><strong>1) Stop Meta from targeting ads based on data it collects about you on other apps and websites:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Click the <b><i>Ad preferences </i></b><span>option under Accounts Center, then select the </span><b><i>Manage Info</i></b><span> tab (this tab may be called </span><b><i>Ad settings</i></b><span> depending on your location). Click the </span><b><i>Activity information from ad partners</i></b><span> option, then </span><b><i>Review Setting</i></b><span>. Select the option for </span><b><i>No, don’t make my ads more relevant by using this information</i></b><span> and click the “Confirm” button when prompted.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/01/17/adpartnerinfo.png" width="2474" height="1538" alt="A screenshot of the &quot;Activity information from ad partners&quot; setting with the &quot;No&quot; option selected" title="A screenshot of the &quot;Activity information from ad partners&quot; setting with the &quot;No&quot; option selected"></span></p>
<p><strong>2) Stop Meta from using your data (from Facebook and Instagram) to help advertisers target you on other apps.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768">Meta’s ad network</a> connects advertisers with other apps through <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/online-behavioral-ads-fuel-surveillance-industry-heres-how">privacy-invasive ad auctions</a>—generating more money and data for Meta in the process.</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Back on the </span><b><i>Ad preferences</i></b><span> page, click the </span><b><i>Manage info</i></b><span> tab again (called </span><b><i>Ad settings</i></b><span> depending on your location), </span><span>then select the </span><b><i>Ads shown outside of Meta </i></b><span>setting, select </span><b><i>Not allowed</i></b><span> and then click the “X” button to close the pop-up.</span></p>
<p>Depending on your location, this setting will be called <b><i>Ads from ad partners </i></b>on the <b><i>Manage info </i></b>tab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/01/17/adsoutsidemeta.png" width="2490" height="1236" alt="A screenshot of the &quot;Ads outside Meta&quot; setting with the &quot;Not allowed&quot; option selected" title="A screenshot of the &quot;Ads outside Meta&quot; setting with the &quot;Not allowed&quot; option selected"></p>
<p><strong>3) Disconnect the data that other companies share with Meta about you from your account:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span>From the </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span> screen, click the </span><b><i>Your information and permissions</i></b><span> option, followed by </span><b><i>Your activity off Meta technologies</i></b><span>, then </span><b><i>Manage future activity</i></b><span>. On this screen, choose the option to </span><b><i>Disconnect future activity</i></b><span>, followed by the </span><b><i>Continue</i></b><span> button, then confirm one more time by clicking the </span><b><i>Disconnect future activity</i></b><span> button. </span><b>Note</b><span>: This may take up to 48 hours to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Note: </b>This will also clear previous activity, which might log you out of apps and websites you’ve signed into through Facebook.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/01/17/disconnectactivity.png" width="2448" height="1292" alt="A screenshot of the &quot;Manage future activity&quot; setting with the &quot;Disconnect future activity&quot; option selected" title="A screenshot of the &quot;Manage future activity&quot; setting with the &quot;Disconnect future activity&quot; option selected"></span></p>
<p><span>While these settings </span><i><span>limit</span></i><span> how Meta uses your data, they won’t necessarily stop the company from collecting it and potentially using it for other purposes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Install Privacy Badger to Block Meta’s Trackers</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://privacybadger.org/"><span>Privacy Badger</span></a><span> is a free browser extension by EFF that blocks trackers—like Meta’s pixel—from loading on websites you visit. It also replaces embedded Facebook posts, Like buttons, and Share buttons with </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/privacy-badger-puts-you-control-widgets"><span>click-to-activate placeholders</span></a><span>, blocking another way that Meta tracks you. The next version of Privacy Badger (coming next week) will extend this protection to embedded Instagram and Threads posts, which also send your data to Meta.</span></p>
<p><span>Visit </span><a href="https://privacybadger.org/"><span>privacybadger.org</span></a><span> to install Privacy Badger on your web browser. Currently, Firefox on Android is the only mobile browser that supports Privacy Badger.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Limit Meta’s Tracking on Your Phone</span></h4>
<p><span>Take these additional steps on your mobile device:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Disable your phone’s advertising ID</b><span> to make it harder for Meta to track what you do across apps. Follow EFF’s instructions for doing this on your </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-iphone-privacy-and-security-settings#disable-ad-tracking"><span>iPhone</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-android-privacy-and-security-settings#disable-ad-tracking"><span>Android</span></a><span> device.</span></li>
<li><b>Turn off location access for Meta’s apps</b><span>. Meta doesn’t need to know where you are all the time to function, and you can safely disable location access without affecting how the Facebook and Instagram apps work. Review this setting using EFF’s guides for your </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-iphone-privacy-and-security-settings#audit-your-privacy-permissions"><span>iPhone</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-android-privacy-and-security-settings#audit-your-privacy-permissions"><span>Android</span></a><span> device.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>The Real Solution: Strong Privacy Legislation</span></h3>
<p><span>Stopping a company you distrust from profiting off your personal data shouldn’t require tinkering with hidden settings and installing browser extensions. Instead, your data should be private by default. That’s why we need </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms#Legislation"><span>strong federal privacy legislation</span></a><span> that puts you—not Meta—in control of your information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Without strong privacy legislation, Meta will <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-apps-push-notifications-data-collection-report">keep</a> <a href="https://petsymposium.org/popets/2024/popets-2024-0086.pdf">finding</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/consent-or-pay-open-letter-edpb/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF-zi8O-D6A1dZPGbzlMH8M_d2Zl2b4EXKjC3wbwlYJ9BuGp_0wNdFm57oh3xyaEyTq8SVGrJv2QVO1uylN0roSaotvmBvW9gBLtFJK_kAcJnCQm7nouxWpLqSl6wEmuAp8uDYT3eaD8c71sXwPC9p-ZZPISupt7P3t7GdRmejbw">ways</a> to bypass your privacy protections and monetize your personal data. Privacy is about more than safeguarding your sensitive information—it’s about having the power to prevent companies like Meta from exploiting your personal data for profit.</span></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Self-play has powered breakthroughs in two-player and multi-player games. Here we show that self-play is a surprisingly effective strategy in another domain. We show that robust and naturalistic driving emerges entirely from self-play in simulation at unprecedented scale -- 1.6~billion~km of driving. This is enabled by Gigaflow, a batched simulator that can synthesize and train on 42 years of subjective driving experience per hour on a single 8-GPU node. The resulting policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on three independent autonomous driving benchmarks. The policy outperforms the prior state of the art when tested on recorded real-world scenarios, amidst human drivers, without ever seeing human data during training. The policy is realistic when assessed against human references and achieves unprecedented robustness, averaging 17.5 years of continuous driving between incidents in simulation.
