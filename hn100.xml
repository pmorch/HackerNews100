<p><b>Literate programming: Knuth is doing it wrong</b></p><p>
Literate programming advocates this: <em>Order your code for others to read,
not for the compiler. Beautifully typeset your code so one can curl up in bed
to read it like a novel. Keep documentation in sync with code.</em> What's not
to like about this vision? I have two beefs with it: the ends are insufficiently
ambitious by focusing on a passive representation; and the means were insufficiently
polished, by over-emphasizing typesetting at the cost of prose quality.
Elaboration, in reverse order:

<!-- more -->
<br>
</p><center><em>Canonizing typesetting over organization</em></center>

<p>
When I look around at the legacy of literate programming, systems to do
so-called semi- or quasi-literate programming dominate. These are systems that
focus on generating beautifully typeset documentation without allowing the
author to arbitrarily order code. I think this is exactly backwards; codebases
are easy to read primarily due to the author's efforts to orchestrate the
presentation, and only secondarily by typesetting improvements. As a concrete
example, just about every literate program out there begins with cruft like
this:<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>

</p><pre><span>// Some #includes</span>
</pre>

<p>
or:

</p><pre><span>-- Don't mind these imports.</span>
</pre>

<p>
I used to think people just didn't understand Knuth's vision. But then I went
and looked at his literate programs. Boom, #includes:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/advent.w.gz">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/adventure.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
The example Pascal program in <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">Knuth's
original paper</a> didn't have any imports at all. But when it comes to
organizing larger codebases, we've been putting imports thoughtlessly at the
top. Right from day one.

</p><p>
Exhibit 2:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sat12.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sat12.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
<em>“Skip ahead if you are impatient to see the interesting stuff.”</em>
Well gee, if only we had, you know, a tool to put the interesting stuff up
front.

</p><p>
Exhibit 3:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sham.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sham.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
This is the start of the piece. There's a sentence of introduction, and then
this:

</p><div>
<p><span>“</span>We use a utility field to record
the vertex degrees.

</p><p>
#define deg u.I
</p>
</div>

<p>
That's a steep jump across several levels of abstraction. Literally the first
line of code shown is a macro to access a field for presumably a struct whose
definition — whose <em>very type name</em> — we haven't even seen
yet. (The variable name for the struct is also hard-coded in; but I'll stop
nit-picking further.)

</p><p>
Exhibit 4: Zoom out just a little bit on the previous example:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sham.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sham2.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
Again, there's #includes at the top but I won't belabor that. Let's look at
what's in these #includes. "GraphBase data structures" seems kinda relevant to
the program. Surely the description should inline and describe the core data
structures the program will be using. In the immortal words of <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred
Brooks</a>:

</p><p><span>“</span>Show me your flowcharts [code]
and conceal your tables [data types], and I shall continue to be
mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts;
they’ll be obvious."
</p>

<p>
Surely a system to optimize order for exposition shouldn't be stymied by
<em>code in a different file</em>.

</p><p>
On the whole, people have failed to appreciate the promise of literate
programming because the early examples are just not that good, barring the
small program in Knuth's original paper. The programs jump across abstraction
layers. Problems are ill-motivated. There's a pervasive mindset of top-down
thinking, of starting from <span>main</span>, whether or not that's easiest to read. The
ability to change order is under-used, perhaps because early literate tools
made debugging harder, but mostly I think because of all the emphasis —
<a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">right from the
start</a> — on just how <em>darn cool</em> the typesetting was.<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>

</p><p>
All this may seem harsh on Knuth, but I figure Knuth can take it. He's, well,
Knuth, and I'm nobody. He came up with literate programming as the successor
to structured programming, meaning that he was introducing ordering considerations
at a time when most people were still using <em>gotos</em> as a matter of
course. There was no typesetting for programmers or academics, no internet, no
hyperlinking. No, these early examples are fine for what they are. They
haven't developed because <em>we programmers</em> have failed to develop them
over time. We've been too quick to treat them as sacred cows to be merely
interpreted (not noticing the violence our interpretations do to the original
idea anyway). I speculate that nobody has actually read anybody else's
literate programs in any sort of detail. And so nobody has been truly inspired
to do better. We've been using literate programming, like the vast majority of
us use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">TAOCP</a>,
as a signalling device to show that we are hip to what's cool. (If you have
spent time reading somebody else's literate programs, I want to hear about
your experiences!)

<br>
</p><center><em>Canonizing passive reading over interactive feedback</em></center>

<p>
I've been indirectly maligning typesetting, but it's time to aim squarely at
it. There's a fundamental problem with generating a beautifully typeset
document for a codebase: it's dead. It can't render inside just about any
actual programming environment (editor or IDE) on this planet, and so we can't
make changes to it while we work on the codebase. Everybody reads a pdf about
a program at most once, when they first encounter it. After that, re-rendering
it is a pain, and proof-reading the rendered document, well forget about it.
That dooms generated documentation to be an after-thought, forever at risk of
falling stale, or at least rendering poorly.

</p><p>
You can't work with it, you can't try to make changes to it to see what
happens, and you certainly can't run it interactively. All you can do,
literally, is curl up with it in bed. And promptly fall asleep. I mean, who
reads code in bed without a keyboard?!

</p><p>
What's the alternative? In the spirit of presenting a target of my own for
others to attack, I'll point you at some literate code I wrote <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">last
year</a> for a simple interpreter. A sample of what it looks like:

</p><pre>&nbsp;<span>// Programs are run in two stages:</span>
&nbsp;<span>//  a) _read_ the text of the program into a tree of cells</span>
&nbsp;<span>//  b) _evaluate_ the tree of cells to yield a result</span>
&nbsp;cell* run(istream&amp; in) {
&nbsp;  cell* result = nil;
&nbsp;  do {
&nbsp;      <span>// TEMP and 'update' help recycle cells after we're done with</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// them.</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// Gotta pay attention to this all the time; see the 'memory'</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// layer.</span>
&nbsp;      TEMP(form, read(in));
&nbsp;      update(result, eval(form));
&nbsp;  } while (!eof(in));
&nbsp;  return result;
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;
&nbsp;cell* run(string s) {
&nbsp;  stringstream in(s);
&nbsp;  return run(in);
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span>:(scenarios run)</span>
&nbsp;<span>:(scenario examples)</span>
&nbsp;<span># function call; later we'll support a more natural syntax for</span>
&nbsp;<span># arithmetic</span>
&nbsp;(+ 1 1)
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> 2
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span># assignment</span>
&nbsp;(&lt;- x 3)
&nbsp;x
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> 3
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span># list; deliberately looks just like a function call</span>
&nbsp;'(1 2 3)
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> (1 2 3)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span># the function (fn) doesn't have to be named</span>
&nbsp;((fn (a b)  <span># parameters (params)</span>
&nbsp;    (+ a b))  <span># body</span>
&nbsp;   3 4)  <span># arguments (args) that are bound to params inside this call</span>
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> 7
</pre>

<p>
A <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">previous post</a> describes
the format, but we won't need more details for this example. Just note that it
is simple plaintext that will open up in your text editor. There is minimal
prose, because just the order of presentation does so much heavy lifting.
Comments are like code: the less you write, the less there is to go bad. I'm
paying the cost of ‘<span>//</span>’
to delineate comments because I haven't gotten around to fixing it, because
it's just not that important to clean it up. You can't see it in this sample,
but the program at large organizes features in self-contained layers, with
later features hooking into the code for earlier ones. Here's <a href="http://akkartik.name/images/wart-layers/test.html">a
test harness</a>. (With, I can't resist pointing out, the includes at the
bottom.) Here's a <a href="http://akkartik.name/images/wart-layers/memory.html">garbage
collector</a>. <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/master/literate/030scope">Here</a>
I replace a flat namespace of bindings with dynamic scope. In each case, code
is freely intermingled with tests to exercise it (like the <span>scenarios</span>
above), tests that can be run from the commandline.

</p><pre>&nbsp;<span>$</span> build_and_test_until 029  <span># exercises the core interpreter</span>
&nbsp;<span>$</span> build_and_test_until 030  <span># exercises dynamic scope</span>
&nbsp;...
</pre>

<p>
Having built the program with just a subset of layers, you're free to poke at
it and run what-if experiments. <em>Why did Kartik write this line like
so?</em> Make a change, run the tests. <em>Oh, that's why.</em> You can add
logging to trace through execution, and you can use a debugger, because you're
sitting at your workstation like a reasonable programmer, not curled up in
bed.

</p><p>
Eventually I'd like to live in a world where our systems for viewing live,
modifiable, interactive code are as adept at typesetting as our publishing
systems are. But until that day, I'll choose simple markdown-like plain-text
documentation that the author labored over the structure of. Every single
time.

<br>
</p><center><em>footnotes</em></center>

<p>
<a name="f1">1.</a> Literate Haskell and CoffeeScript to a lesser extent allow
very flexible ordering in the language, which mitigates this problem. But then
we have their authors <a href="http://jashkenas.github.io/docco">telling
us</a> that their tools can be used with any language, blithely ignoring the
fact that other languages may need better tools. Everybody's selling mechanisms,
nobody's inculcating the right <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_mechanism_and_policy">policies</a>.

</p><p>
<a name="f2">2.</a> We've all had the little endorphin rush of seeing our
crappy little papers or assignments magically improved by sprinkling a little
typesetting. And we tend to take well-typeset documents <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/dont_make_the_d.html">more
seriously</a>. The flip side to this phenomenon: if it looks done <a href="http://blog.42floors.com/thirty-percent-feedback">you
won't get as much feedback on it</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> Broadcom has lost another large customer for its VMware platform: Austrian cloud provider Anexia has moved 12,000 VMs, some of them rented by major European businesses, to an open-source system based on the KVM hypervisor.</p>
<p>Anexia was founded in 2006, is based in Austria, and provides cloud services from over 100 locations around the world by placing equipment in third party datacenters. Clients include remote access and control vendor TeamViewer, and airline Lufthansa – plus plenty more outfits that need reliable hosting and service to match.</p>
<p>CEO Alexander Windbichler told <i>The Register</i> that after Broadcom acquired VMware, increased licensing costs, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/10/broadcom_ends_vmware_partner_program/">made big changes to its partner program</a>, Anexia remained eligible to operate a VMware-powered cloud.</p>

    

<p>But Windbichler felt he couldn’t afford to continue, because Broadcom offered new terms that saw the cost of VMware licenses rise sharply. The CEO preferred not to enumerate the increase precisely however <i>The Register</i> understands it exceeded 500 percent.</p>

        


        

<p>Whatever the actual figure, Windbichler said the cost increase “Would have been existential for us.”</p>
<p>“We used to pay for VMware software one month in arrears,” he said. “With Broadcom we had to pay a year in advance with a two-year contract.” That arrangement, the CEO said, would have created extreme stress on company cashflow.</p>

        

<p>“We would not be able to compete with the market,” he said. “We had customers on contracts, and they would not pay for a price increase.”</p>
<p>Windbichler considered legal action, but felt the fight would have been slow and expensive.</p>
<p>Anexia therefore resolved to migrate, a choice made easier by its ownership of another hosting business called Netcup that ran on a KVM-based platform. Another factor in the company’s favour was that it disguised the fact it ran VMware with an abstraction layer it called “Anexia Engine” that meant customers never saw Virtzilla’s wares and instead worked in a different interface to manage their VM fleets. The hosting company is also a big user of NetApp storage, so customer data was already stored in a resource independent of its VMware rig – any new VMs would just need to be pointed at existing volumes. A further fortuitous circumstance was that KVM can boot virtual machines created with VMware’s VMDK format.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/beeks_group_vmware_opennebula_migration/">Broadcom loses another big VMware customer: UK fintech cloud Beeks Group, and most of its 20,000 VMs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/16/ingram_micro_vmware_broadcom_deal_ends/">Ingram Micro to 'stop doing business' with Broadcom, downgrade to 'limited engagement' on VMware</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/13/broadcom_q4_fy_2024_vmware/">Broadcom says VMware is a better money-making machine than it hoped</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/28/broadcom_vmware_vcdx_snafu/">No, Broadcom did not just end VMware's flagship VCDX certification program</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Windbichler and his team felt that Netcup’s platform could be upgraded to meet the needs of Anexia’s clients, some of whom use it to host mission-critical realtime workloads that demand low latency, and that Anexia engine could be adapted to work with a KVM back end.</p>
<p>But the terms of Anexia’s licenses meant it had a handful of months to get the job done before price rises and a two-year subscription kicked in – and less time to convince customers who signed up for VMware-powered services that the new platform would do the job.</p>
<h3>‘Fighting for a cause’</h3>
<p>Windbichler felt customers would oppose the move, so created a presentation in which he pitched the move as more than a cost-saving migration.</p>
<p>“We said we are fighting for a cause,” he said. “I did not expect that customers would care about that, but they were happy to do it.”</p>

        

<p>Among the factors that he feels got customers over the line were media articles about Broadcom’s actions, including some from <i>The Register</i>.</p>
<p>Through early 2024, Anexia’s developer team worked to improve the Netcup platform and create a simple migration tool. The result was an agent that runs on a guest VM and presents info in Anexia engine that helps customers understand if a VM is ready to move from VMware to KVM.</p>
<p>If a customer agrees to migrate, it takes one click and a brief pause for a VM reboot – an act which maps a VM to storage and converted it to the appropriate virtual disk format– and workloads resume as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Windbichler said the migration tool was delivered in time for all Anexia customers, and their 12,000 VMs, to migrate by May 2024.</p>
<p>The process wasn’t easy, as the migration process meant that for a brief time two instances of a VM would exist, requiring more hardware capacity than the company might possess in some of its locations. Careful resource management planning was needed, as some customers could not easily find a change window and it was hard to ensure servers and storage would be ready for the move. Anexia pulled it off without having to alter its physical fleet, which given its widespread operations would have added enormous complexity to the project.</p>
<h3>Broadcom ‘lost all the trust’</h3>
<p>The CEO rates the project the most complex thing Anexia has done, and in conversation with <i>The Register</i> was full of praise for his team who he said did amazing work and now feel they were part of a once-in-a-lifetime effort.</p>
<p>That team is now growing, as without VMware bills – and all customers still aboard – Anexia’s balance sheet is in good shape.</p>
<p>“We have free budget to work on the open source solution and make us sovereign for us and our customers,” Windbichler said.</p>
<p>The CEO thinks more companies will move from VMware.</p>
<p>“I do not believe Broadcom will be successful,” he told <i>The Register</i>. “They lost all the trust. I have talked to so many VMware customers and they say they cannot work with a company like that.”</p>
<p>Regulators are also interested in Broadcom’s practices, he said. As Anexia tried to understand the impact of the VMware acquisition, it engaged with industry group Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), which was able to arrange meetings with EU officials. Windbichler believes those engagements led to some of Broadcom’s concessions to its channel. The CEO also found Austria’s competition authorities receptive. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="435"><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-origins-of-wokeness-1.gif" width="204" height="18" alt="The Origins of Wokeness"><span size="2" face="verdana">January 2025<p>The word "prig" isn't very common now, but if you look up
the definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:
</p><blockquote>
  A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if
  superior to others.
</blockquote>
This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and
its age is an important clue: it shows that although
wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an
instance of a much older one.<p>There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a
shallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates
his purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every
society has these people. All that changes is the rules they
enforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. In
Stalin's Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the
woke, it's social justice.</p><p>So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask
is not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs.
The question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about
these ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to
ask when and where wokeness began.</p><p>The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a
second, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which
started in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and
then returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally
peaking after the riots of 2020.</p><p>This was not the original meaning of woke, but it's rarely
used in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is
the dominant one. What <i>does</i> it mean now? I've often been
asked to define both wokeness and political correctness by
people who think they're meaningless labels, so I will. They
both have the same definition:
</p><blockquote>
  An aggressively performative focus on social justice.
</blockquote>
In other words, it's people being prigs about social
justice. And that's the real problem — the
performativeness, not the social justice.<p>Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on
the scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one.
I don't think any reasonable person would deny that. The
problem with political correctness was not that it focused
on marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in
which it did so. Instead of going out into the world and
quietly helping members of marginalized groups, the
politically correct focused on getting people in trouble for
using the wrong words to talk about them.</p><p>As for where political correctness began, if you think about
it, you probably already know the answer. Did it begin
outside universities and spread to them from this external
source? Obviously not; it has always been most extreme in
universities. So where in universities did it begin? Did it
begin in math, or the hard sciences, or engineering, and
spread from there to the humanities and social sciences?
Those are amusing images, but no, obviously it began in the
humanities and social sciences.</p><p>Why there? And why then? What happened in the humanities and
social sciences in the 1980s?</p><p>A successful theory of the origin of political correctness
has to be able to explain why it didn't happen earlier. Why
didn't it happen during the protest movements of the 1960s,
for example? They were concerned with much the same issues.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><span color="#dddddd">1</span></a>]</span><p>The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to
political correctness was precisely that — they were
student movements. They didn't have any real power. The
students may have been talking a lot about women's
liberation and black power, but it was not what they were
being taught in their classes. Not yet.</p><p>But in the early 1970s the student protestors of the 1960s
began to finish their dissertations and get hired as
professors. At first they were neither powerful nor
numerous. But as more of their peers joined them and the
previous generation of professors started to retire, they
gradually became both.</p><p>The reason political correctness began in the humanities and
social sciences was that these fields offered more scope for
the injection of politics. A 1960s radical who got a job as
a physics professor could still attend protests, but his
political beliefs wouldn't affect his work. Whereas research
in sociology and modern literature can be made as political
as you like.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><span color="#dddddd">2</span></a>]</span><p>I saw political correctness arise. When I started college in
1982 it was not yet a thing. Female students might object if
someone said something they considered sexist, but no one
was getting <i>reported</i> for it. It was still not a thing when
I started grad school in 1986. It was definitely a thing in
1988 though, and by the early 1990s it seemed to pervade
campus life.</p><p>What happened? How did protest become punishment? Why were
the late 1980s the point at which protests against male
chauvinism (as it used to be called) morphed into formal
complaints to university authorities about sexism?
Basically, the 1960s radicals got tenure. They became the
Establishment they'd protested against two decades before.
Now they were in a position not just to speak out about
their ideas, but to enforce them.</p><p>A new set of moral rules to enforce was exciting news to a
certain kind of student. What made it particularly exciting
was that they were allowed to attack professors. I remember
noticing that aspect of political correctness at the time.
It wasn't simply a grass-roots student movement. It was
faculty members encouraging students to attack other faculty
members. In that respect it was like the Cultural
Revolution. That wasn't a grass-roots movement either; that
was Mao unleashing the younger generation on his political
opponents. And in fact when Roderick MacFarquhar started
teaching a class on the Cultural Revolution at Harvard in
the late 1980s, many saw it as a comment on current events.
I don't know if it actually was, but people thought it was,
and that means the similarities were obvious.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><span color="#dddddd">3</span></a>]</span><p>College students larp. It's their nature. It's usually
harmless. But larping morality turned out to be a poisonous
combination. The result was a kind of moral etiquette,
superficial but very complicated. Imagine having to explain
to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the
phrase "people of color" is considered particularly
enlightened, but saying "colored people" gets you fired. And
why exactly one isn't supposed to use the word "negro" now,
even though Martin Luther King used it constantly in his
speeches. There are no underlying principles. You'd just
have to give him a long list of rules to memorize.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><span color="#dddddd">4</span></a>]</span><p>
The danger of these rules was not just that they created
land mines for the unwary, but that their elaborateness made
them an effective substitute for virtue. Whenever a society
has a concept of heresy and orthodoxy, orthodoxy becomes a
substitute for virtue. You can be the worst person in the
world, but as long as you're orthodox you're better than
everyone who isn't. This makes orthodoxy very attractive to
bad people.</p><p>But for it to work as a substitute for virtue, orthodoxy
must be difficult. If all you have to do to be orthodox is
wear some garment or avoid saying some word, everyone knows
to do it, and the only way to seem more virtuous than other
people is to actually be virtuous. The shallow, complicated,
and frequently changing rules of political correctness made
it the perfect substitute for actual virtue. And the result
was a world in which good people who weren't up to date on
current moral fashions were brought down by people whose
characters would make you recoil in horror if you could see
them.</p><p>One big contributing factor in the rise of political
correctness was the lack of other things to be morally pure
about. Previous generations of prigs had been prigs mostly
about religion and sex. But among the cultural elite these
were the deadest of dead letters by the 1980s; if you were
religious, or a virgin, this was something you tended to
conceal rather than advertise. So the sort of people who
enjoy being moral enforcers had become starved of things to
enforce. A new set of rules was just what they'd been
waiting for.</p><p>Curiously enough, the tolerant side of the 1960s left helped
create the conditions in which the intolerant side
prevailed. The relaxed social rules advocated by the old,
easy-going hippy left became the dominant ones, at least
among the elite, and this left nothing for the naturally
intolerant to be intolerant about.</p><p>Another possibly contributing factor was the fall of the
Soviet empire. Marxism had been a popular focus of moral
purity on the left before political correctness emerged as a
competitor, but the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Bloc
countries took most of the shine off it. Especially the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989. You couldn't be on the side of
the Stasi. I remember looking at the moribund Soviet Studies
section of a used bookshop in Cambridge in the late 1980s
and thinking "what will those people go on about now?" As it
turned out the answer was right under my nose.</p><p>One thing I noticed at the time about the first phase of
political correctness was that it was more popular with
women than men. As many writers (perhaps most eloquently
George Orwell) have observed, women seem more attracted than
men to the idea of being moral enforcers. But there was
another more specific reason women tended to be the
enforcers of political correctness. There was at this time a
great backlash against sexual harassment; the mid 1980s were
the point when the definition of sexual harassment was
expanded from explicit sexual advances to creating a
"hostile environment." Within universities the classic form
of accusation was for a (female) student to say that a
professor made her "feel uncomfortable." But the vagueness
of this accusation allowed the radius of forbidden behavior
to expand to include talking about heterodox ideas. Those
make people uncomfortable too.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><span color="#dddddd">5</span></a>]</span><p>Was it sexist to propose that Darwin's greater male
variability hypothesis might explain some variation in human
performance? Sexist enough to get Larry Summers pushed out
as president of Harvard, apparently. One woman who heard the
talk in which he mentioned this idea said it made her feel
"physically ill" and that she had to leave halfway through.
If the test of a hostile environment is how it makes people
feel, this certainly sounds like one. And yet it does seem
plausible that greater male variability explains some of the
variation in human performance. So which should prevail,
comfort or truth? Surely if truth should prevail anywhere,
it should be in universities; that's supposed to be their
specialty; but for decades starting in the late 1980s the
politically correct tried to pretend this conflict didn't
exist.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><span color="#dddddd">6</span></a>]</span><p>Political correctness seemed to burn out in the second half
of the 1990s. One reason, perhaps the main reason, was that
it literally became a joke. It offered rich material for
comedians, who performed their usual disinfectant action
upon it. Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against
priggishness of any sort, because prigs, being humorless,
can't respond in kind. Humor was what defeated Victorian
prudishness, and by 2000 it seemed to have done the same
thing to political correctness.</p><p>Unfortunately this was an illusion. Within universities the
embers of political correctness were still glowing brightly.
After all, the forces that created it were still there. The
professors who started it were now becoming deans and
department heads. And in addition to their departments there
were now a bunch of new ones explicitly focused on social
justice. Students were still hungry for things to be morally
pure about. And there had been an explosion in the number of
university administrators, many of whose jobs involved
enforcing various forms of political correctness.</p><p>In the early 2010s the embers of political correctness burst
into flame anew. There were several differences between this
new phase and the original one. It was more virulent. It
spread further into the real world, although it still burned
hottest within universities. And it was concerned with a
wider variety of sins. In the first phase of political
correctness there were really only three things people got
accused of: sexism, racism, and homophobia (which at the
time was a neologism invented for the purpose). But between
then and 2010 a lot of people had spent a lot of time trying
to invent new kinds of -isms and -phobias and seeing which
could be made to stick.</p><p>The second phase was, in multiple senses, political
correctness metastasized. Why did it happen when it did? My
guess is that it was due to the rise of social media,
particularly Tumblr and Twitter, because one of the most
distinctive features of the second wave of political
correctness was the <i>cancel mob</i>: a mob of angry people
uniting on social media to get someone ostracized or fired.
Indeed this second wave of political correctness was
originally called "cancel culture"; it didn't start to be
called "wokeness" till the 2020s.</p><p>One aspect of social media that surprised almost everyone at
first was the popularity of outrage. Users seemed to <i>like</i>
being outraged. We're so used to this idea now that we take
it for granted, but really it's pretty strange. Being
outraged is not a pleasant feeling. You wouldn't expect
people to seek it out. But they do. And above all, they want
to share it. I happened to be running a forum from 2007 to
2014, so I can actually quantify how much they want to share
it: our users were about three times more likely to upvote
something if it outraged them.</p><p>This tilt toward outrage wasn't due to wokeness. It's an
inherent feature of social media, or at least this
generation of it. But it did make social media the perfect
mechanism for fanning the flames of wokeness.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><span color="#dddddd">7</span></a>]</span><p>It wasn't just public social networks that drove the rise of
wokeness though. Group chat apps were also critical,
especially in the final step, cancellation. Imagine if a
group of employees trying to get someone fired had to do it
using only email. It would be hard to organize a mob. But
once you have group chat, mobs form naturally.</p><p>Another contributing factor in this second wave of political
correctness was the dramatic increase in the polarization of
the press. In the print era, newspapers were constrained to
be, or at least seem, politically neutral. The department
stores that ran ads in the New York Times wanted to reach
everyone in the region, both liberal and conservative, so
the Times had to serve both. But the Times didn't regard
this neutrality as something forced upon them. They embraced
it as their duty as a <i>paper of record</i> — as one of the big
newspapers that aimed to be chronicles of their times,
reporting every sufficiently important story from a neutral
point of view.</p><p>When I grew up the papers of record seemed timeless, almost
sacred institutions. Papers like the New York Times and
Washington Post had immense prestige, partly because other
sources of news were limited, but also because they did make
some effort to be neutral.</p><p>Unfortunately it turned out that the paper of record was
mostly an artifact of the constraints imposed by print.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><span color="#dddddd">8</span></a>]</span>
When your market was determined by geography, you had
to be neutral. But publishing online enabled — in fact
probably forced — newspapers to switch to serving markets
defined by ideology instead of geography. Most that remained
in business fell in the direction they'd already been
leaning: left. On October 11, 2020 the New York Times
announced that "The paper is in the midst of an evolution
from the stodgy paper of record into a juicy collection of
great narratives."
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><span color="#dddddd">9</span></a>]</span>
Meanwhile journalists, of a sort,
had arisen to serve the right as well. And so journalism,
which in the previous era had been one of the great
centralizing forces, now became one of the great polarizing
ones.<p>The rise of social media and the increasing polarization of
journalism reinforced one another. In fact there arose a new
variety of journalism involving a loop through social media.
Someone would say something controversial on social media.
Within hours it would become a news story. Outraged readers
would then post links to the story on social media, driving
further arguments online. It was the cheapest source of
clicks imaginable. You didn't have to maintain overseas news
bureaus or pay for month-long investigations. All you had to
do was watch Twitter for controversial remarks and repost
them on your site, with some additional comments to inflame
readers further.</p><p>For the press there was money in wokeness. But they weren't
the only ones. That was one of the biggest differences
between the two waves of political correctness: the first
was driven almost entirely by amateurs, but the second was
often driven by professionals. For some it was their whole
job. By 2010 a new class of administrators had arisen whose
job was basically to enforce wokeness. They played a role
similar to that of the political commissars who got attached
to military and industrial organizations in the USSR: they
weren't directly in the flow of the organization's work, but
watched from the side to ensure that nothing improper
happened in the doing of it. These new administrators could
often be recognized by the word "inclusion" in their titles.
Within institutions this was the preferred euphemism for
wokeness; a new list of banned words, for example, would
usually be called an "inclusive language guide."
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><span color="#dddddd">10</span></a>]</span><p>This new class of bureaucrats pursued a woke agenda as if
their jobs depended on it, because they did. If you hire
people to keep watch for a particular type of problem,
they're going to find it, because otherwise there's no
justification for their existence.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><span color="#dddddd">11</span></a>]</span>
But these
bureaucrats also represented a second and possibly even
greater danger. Many were involved in hiring, and when
possible they tried to ensure their employers hired only
people who shared their political beliefs. The most
egregious cases were the new "DEI statements" that some
universities started to require from faculty candidates,
proving their commitment to wokeness. Some universities used
these statements as the initial filter and only even
considered candidates who scored high enough on them. You're
not hiring Einstein that way; imagine what you get instead.<p>Another factor in the rise of wokeness was the Black Lives
Matter movement, which started in 2013 when a white man was
acquitted after killing a black teenager in Florida. But
this didn't launch wokeness; it was well underway by 2013.</p><p>Similarly for the Me Too Movement, which took off in 2017
after the first news stories about Harvey Weinstein's
history of raping women. It accelerated wokeness, but didn't
play the same role in launching it that the 80s version did
in launching political correctness.</p><p>The election of Donald Trump in 2016 also accelerated
wokeness, particularly in the press, where outrage now meant
traffic. Trump made the New York Times a lot of money:
headlines during his first administration mentioned his name
at about four times the rate of previous presidents.</p><p>In 2020 we saw the biggest accelerant of all, after a white
police officer asphyxiated a black suspect on video. At this
point the metaphorical fire became a literal one, as violent
protests broke out across America. But in retrospect this
turned out to be peak woke, or close to it. By every measure
I've seen, wokeness peaked in 2020 or 2021.</p><p>Wokeness is sometimes described as a mind-virus. What makes
it viral is that it defines new types of impropriety. Most
people are afraid of impropriety; they're never exactly sure
what the social rules are or which ones they might be
breaking. Especially if the rules change rapidly. And since
most people already worry that they might be breaking rules
they don't know about, if you tell them they're breaking a
rule, their default reaction is to believe you. Especially
if multiple people tell them. Which in turn is a recipe for
exponential growth. Zealots invent some new impropriety to
avoid. The first people to adopt it are fellow zealots,
eager for new ways to signal their virtue. If there are
enough of these, the initial group of zealots is followed by
a much larger group, motivated by fear. They're not trying
to signal virtue; they're just trying to avoid getting in
trouble. At this point the new impropriety is now firmly
established. Plus its success has increased the rate of
change in social rules, which, remember, is one of the
reasons people are nervous about which rules they might be
breaking. So the cycle accelerates.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><span color="#dddddd">12</span></a>]</span><p>What's true of individuals is even more true of
organizations. Especially organizations without a powerful
leader. Such organizations do everything based on "best
practices." There's no higher authority; if some new "best
practice" achieves critical mass, they <i>must</i> adopt it. And
in this case the organization can't do what it usually does
when it's uncertain: delay. It might be committing
improprieties right now! So it's surprisingly easy for a
small group of zealots to capture this type of organization
by describing new improprieties it might be guilty of. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f13n"><span color="#dddddd">13</span></a>]</span><p>How does this kind of cycle ever end? Eventually it leads to
disaster, and people start to say enough is enough. The
excesses of 2020 made a lot of people say that.</p><p>Since then wokeness has been in gradual but continual
retreat. Corporate CEOs, starting with Brian Armstrong, have
openly rejected it. Universities, led by the University of
Chicago and MIT, have explicitly confirmed their commitment
to free speech. Twitter, which was arguably the hub of
wokeness, was bought by Elon Musk in order to neutralize it,
and he seems to have succeeded — and not, incidentally, by
censoring left-wing users the way Twitter used to censor
right-wing ones, but without censoring either.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f14n"><span color="#dddddd">14</span></a>]</span>
Consumers have emphatically rejected brands that ventured
too far into wokeness. The Bud Light brand may have been
permanently damaged by it. I'm not going to claim Trump's
second victory in 2024 was a referendum on wokeness; I think
he won, as presidential candidates always do, because he was
more <a href="https://paulgraham.com/charisma.html"><u>charismatic</u></a>; but voters' 
disgust with wokeness must have helped.<p>So what do we do now? Wokeness is already in retreat.
Obviously we should help it along. What's the best way to do
that? And more importantly, how do we avoid a third
outbreak? After all, it seemed to be dead once, but came
back worse than ever.</p><p>In fact there's an even more ambitious goal: is there a way
to prevent any similar outbreak of aggressively performative
moralism in the future — not just a third outbreak
political correctness, but the next thing like it? Because
there will be a next thing. Prigs are prigs by nature. They
need rules to obey and enforce, and now that Darwin has cut
off their traditional supply of rules, they're constantly
hungry for new ones. All they need is someone to meet them
halfway by defining a new way to be morally pure, and we'll
see the same phenomenon again.</p><p>Let's start with the easier problem. Is there a simple,
principled way to deal with wokeness? I think there is: to
use the customs we already have for dealing with religion.
Wokeness is effectively a religion, just with God replaced
by protected classes. It's not even the first religion of
this kind; Marxism had a similar form, with God replaced by
the masses.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f15n"><span color="#dddddd">15</span></a>]</span>
And we already have well-established
customs for dealing with religion within organizations. You
can express your own religious identity and explain your
beliefs, but you can't call your coworkers infidels if they
disagree, or try to ban them from saying things that
contradict its doctrines, or insist that the organization
adopt yours as its official religion.<p>If we're not sure what to do about any particular
manifestation of wokeness, imagine we were dealing with some
other religion, like Christianity. Should we have people
within organizations whose jobs are to enforce woke
orthodoxy? No, because we wouldn't have people whose jobs
were to enforce Christian orthodoxy. Should we censor
</p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/02/17/roald-dahl-books-rewritten-offensive-matilda-witches-twits/"><u>writers</u></a> or 
<a href="https://x.com/KoustaStavroula/status/1562034502897106946"><u>scientists</u></a> whose work contradicts woke doctrines?
No, because we wouldn't do this to people whose work
contradicted Christian teachings. Should job candidates be
required to write DEI statements? Of course not; imagine an
employer requiring proof of one's religious beliefs. Should
students and employees have to participate in woke
indoctrination sessions in which they're required to answer
questions about their beliefs to ensure compliance? No,
because we wouldn't dream of catechizing people in this way
about their religion.
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f16n"><span color="#dddddd">16</span></a>]</span><p>One shouldn't feel bad about not wanting to watch woke
movies any more than one would feel bad about not wanting to
listen to Christian rock. In my twenties I drove across
America several times, listening to local radio stations.
Occasionally I'd turn the dial and hear some new song. But
the moment anyone mentioned Jesus I'd turn the dial again.
Even the tiniest bit of being preached to was enough to make
me lose interest.</p><p>But by the same token we should not automatically reject
everything the woke believe. I'm not a Christian, but I can
see that many Christian principles are good ones. It would
be a mistake to discard them all just because one didn't
share the religion that espoused them. It would be the sort
of thing a religious zealot would do.</p><p>If we have genuine pluralism, I think we'll be safe from
future outbreaks of woke intolerance. Wokeness itself won't
go away. There will for the foreseeable future continue to
be pockets of woke zealots inventing new moral fashions. The
key is not to let them treat their fashions as normative.
They can change what their coreligionists are allowed to say
every few months if they like, but they mustn't be allowed
to change what we're allowed to say.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f17n"><span color="#dddddd">17</span></a>]</span><p>The more general problem — how to prevent similar outbreaks
of aggressively performative moralism — is of course
harder. Here we're up against human nature. There will
always be prigs. And in particular there will always be the
enforcers among them, the 
</p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/conformism.html"><u>aggressively conventional-minded</u></a>.
These people are born that way. Every society has them. So
the best we can do is to keep them bottled up.<p>The aggressively conventional-minded aren't always on the
rampage. Usually they just enforce whatever random rules are
nearest to hand. They only become dangerous when some new
ideology gets a lot of them pointed in the same direction at
once. That's what happened during the Cultural Revolution,
and to a lesser extent (thank God) in the two waves of
political correctness we've experienced.</p><p>We can't get rid of the aggressively conventional-minded.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f18n"><span color="#dddddd">18</span></a>]</span>
And we couldn't prevent people from creating new
ideologies that appealed to them even if we wanted to. So if
we want to keep them bottled up, we have to do it one step
downstream. Fortunately when the aggressively
conventional-minded go on the rampage they always do one
thing that gives them away: they define new <a href="https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html"><u>heresies</u></a> to
punish people for. So the best way to protect ourselves from
future outbreaks of things like wokeness is to have powerful
antibodies against the concept of heresy.<p>We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms
of heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something
that we'd previously been able to say, our initial
assumption should be that they're wrong. Only our initial
assumption of course. If they can prove we should stop
saying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on
them. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent
something from being said will usually claim they're not
merely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some
form of "harm". And maybe they're right. But once again, the
burden of proof is on them. It's not enough to claim harm;
they have to prove it.</p><p>As long as the aggressively conventional-minded continue to
give themselves away by banning heresies, we'll always be
able to notice when they become aligned behind some new
ideology. And if we always fight back at that point, with
any luck we can stop them in their tracks.</p><p>The number of true things we </p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/say.html"><u>can't say</u></a>
should not increase. If it does, something is wrong.<p><b>Notes</b></p><p>[</p><a name="f1n"><span color="#000000">1</span></a>]
Why did 1960s radicals focus on the causes they did?
One of the people who reviewed drafts of this essay
explained this so well that I asked if I could quote him:
<blockquote>
  The middle-class student protestors of the New Left
  rejected the socialist/Marxist left as unhip. They were
  interested in sexier forms of oppression uncovered by
  cultural analysis (Marcuse) and abstruse "Theory". Labor
  politics became stodgy and old-fashioned. This took a
  couple generations to work through. The woke ideology's
  conspicuous lack of interest in the working class is the
  tell-tale sign. Such fragments as are, er, left of the old
  left are anti-woke, and meanwhile the actual working class
  shifted to the populist right and gave us Trump. Trump and
  wokeness are cousins.<p>The middle-class origins of wokeness smoothed its way
  through the institutions because it had no interest in
  "seizing the means of production" (how quaint such phrases
  seem now), which would quickly have run up against hard
  state and corporate power. The fact that wokeness only
  expressed interest in other kinds of class (race, sex,
  etc) signalled compromise with existing power: give us
  power within your system and we'll bestow the resource we
  control — moral rectitude — upon you. As an ideological
  stalking horse for gaining control over discourse and
  institutions, this succeeded where a more ambitious
  revolutionary program would not have.

It helped that the humanities and social sciences also
included some of the biggest and easiest undergrad majors.
If a political movement had to start with physics students,
it could never get off the ground; there would be too few of
them, and they wouldn't have the time to spare.<p>At the top universities these majors are not as big as they
used to be, though. A 
</p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major"><u>2022 survey</u></a> found that only 7% of
Harvard undergrads plan to major in the humanities, vs
nearly 30% during the 1970s. I expect wokeness is at least
part of the reason; when undergrads consider majoring in
English, it's presumably because they love the written word
and not because they want to listen to lectures about
racism.<p>[</p><a name="f3n"><span color="#000000">3</span></a>]
The puppet-master-and-puppet character of political
correctness became clearly visible when a bakery near
Oberlin College was falsely accused of race discrimination
in 2016. In the subsequent civil trial, lawyers for the
bakery produced a text message from Oberlin Dean of Students
Meredith Raimondo that read "I'd say unleash the students if
I wasn't convinced this needs to be put behind us."<p>[</p><a name="f4n"><span color="#000000">4</span></a>]
The woke sometimes claim that wokeness is simply
treating people with respect. But if it were, that would be
the only rule you'd have to remember, and this is comically
far from being the case. My younger son likes to imitate
voices, and at one point when he was about seven I had to
explain which accents it was currently safe to imitate
publicly and which not. It took about ten minutes, and I
still hadn't covered all the cases.<p>[</p><a name="f5n"><span color="#000000">5</span></a>]
In 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that creating a
hostile work environment could constitute sex
discrimination, which in turn affected universities via
Title IX. The court specified that the test of a hostile
environment was whether it would bother a reasonable person,
but since for a professor merely being the subject of a
sexual harassment complaint would be a disaster whether the
complainant was reasonable or not, in practice any joke or
remark remotely connected with sex was now effectively
forbidden. Which meant we'd now come full circle to
Victorian codes of behavior, when there was a large class of
things that might not be said "with ladies present."<p>[</p><a name="f6n"><span color="#000000">6</span></a>]
Much as they tried to pretend there was no conflict
between diversity and quality. But you can't simultaneously
optimize for two things that aren't identical. What
diversity actually means, judging from the way the term is
used, is proportional representation, and unless you're
selecting a group whose purpose is to be representative,
like poll respondents, optimizing for proportional
representation has to come at the expense of quality. This
is not because of anything about representation; it's the
nature of optimization; optimizing for x has to come at the
expense of y unless x and y are identical.<p>[</p><a name="f7n"><span color="#000000">7</span></a>]
Maybe societies will eventually develop antibodies to
viral outrage. Maybe we were just the first to be exposed to
it, so it tore through us like an epidemic through a
previously isolated population. I'm fairly confident that it
would be possible to create new social media apps that were
less driven by outrage, and an app of this type would have a
good chance of stealing users from existing ones, because
the smartest people would tend to migrate to it.<p>[</p><a name="f8n"><span color="#000000">8</span></a>]
I say "mostly" because I have hopes that journalistic
neutrality will return in some form. There is some market
for unbiased news, and while it may be small, it's valuable.
The rich and powerful want to know what's really going on;
that's how they became rich and powerful.<p>[</p><a name="f9n"><span color="#000000">9</span></a>]
The Times made this momentous announcement very
informally, in passing in the middle of an 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/business/media/new-york-times-rukmini-callimachi-caliphate.html"><u>article</u></a> about a
Times reporter who'd been criticized for inaccuracy. It's
quite possible no senior editor even approved it. But it's
somehow appropriate that this particular universe ended with
a whimper rather than a bang.<p>[</p><a name="f10n"><span color="#000000">10</span></a>]
As the acronym DEI goes out of fashion, many of these
bureaucrats will try to go underground by changing their
titles. It looks like "belonging" will be a popular option.<p>[</p><a name="f11n"><span color="#000000">11</span></a>]
If you've ever wondered why our legal system includes
protections like the separation of prosecutor, judge, and
jury, the right to examine evidence and cross-examine
witnesses, and the right to be represented by legal counsel,
the de facto 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/magazine/title-ix-sexual-harassment-accusations.html">parallel legal system</a>
established by Title IX
makes that all too clear.<p>[</p><a name="f12n"><span color="#000000">12</span></a>]
The invention of new improprieties is most visible in
the rapid evolution of woke nomenclature. This is
particularly annoying to me as a writer, because the new
names are always worse. Any religious observance has to be
inconvenient and slightly absurd; otherwise gentiles would
do it too. So "slaves" becomes "enslaved individuals." But
web search can show us the leading edge of moral growth in
real time: if you search for "individuals experiencing
slavery" you will as of this writing find five legit
attempts to use the phrase, and you'll even find two for
"individuals experiencing enslavement."<p>[</p><a name="f13n"><span color="#000000">13</span></a>]
Organizations that do dubious things are particularly
concerned with propriety, which is how you end up with
absurdities like tobacco and oil companies having higher ESG
ratings than Tesla.<p>[</p><a name="f14n"><span color="#000000">14</span></a>]
Elon did something else that tilted Twitter rightward
though: he gave more visibility to paying users. Paying
users lean right on average, because people on the far left
dislike Elon and don't want to give him money. Elon
presumably knew this would happen. On the other hand, the
people on the far left have only themselves to blame; they
could tilt Twitter back to the left tomorrow if they wanted
to.<p>[</p><a name="f15n"><span color="#000000">15</span></a>]
It even, as James Lindsay and Peter Boghossian
pointed out, has a concept of original sin: privilege. Which
means unlike Christianity's egalitarian version, people have varying
degrees of it. An able-bodied straight white
American male is born with such a load of sin that only by
the most abject repentance can he be saved.<p>Wokeness also shares something rather funny with many actual
versions of Christianity: like God, the people for whose
sake wokeness purports to act are often revolted by the
things done in their name.</p><p>[</p><a name="f16n"><span color="#000000">16</span></a>]
There is one exception to most of these rules: actual
religious organizations. It's reasonable for them to insist
on orthodoxy. But they in turn should declare that they're
religious organizations. It's rightly considered shady
when something that appears to be an ordinary business or
publication turns out to be a religious organization.<p>[</p><a name="f17n"><span color="#000000">17</span></a>]
I don't want to give the impression that it will be
simple to roll back wokeness. There will be places where the
fight inevitably gets messy — particularly within
universities, which everyone has to share, yet which are are
currently the most pervaded by wokeness of any institutions.<p>[</p><a name="f18n"><span color="#000000">18</span></a>]
You can however get rid of aggressively
conventional-minded people within an organization, and in
many if not most organizations this would be an excellent
idea. Even a handful of them can do a lot of damage. I bet
you'd feel a noticeable improvement going from a handful to
none.<span color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The 'cab' is hinged round the bottom of the box structure, probably released by Keaton at the appropriate moment, and very likely sprung to assist the demolition.</p>

<p>The rest is just balanced on top and will fall at the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>You only see it move about 6 feet, so it doesn't have to last long. As I can see no evidence of a rope to pull it [and I don't think painting techniques would be good enough to paint it out afterwards] let's assume someone pushed it from a few yards further back then ran out of frame. It has no engine, of course.</p>

<p>If you watch it frame by frame, it's easier to see...</p>

<p>In the first 2 frames, all is well so far - except the bonnet/hood isn't quite seated properly. Also note Keaton's hand on the bodywork - that may already be loose [or may be part of the release mechanism]. The wheel at camera right isn't quite straight either...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/6p3N5.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/6p3N5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>By frame 3, that wheel is already falling off, before it even hits the bump...<br>
Incidentally, the bonnet/hood has dropped back into its correct position momentarily.<br>
After further analysis, the release has been triggered by frame 3. There is a disconnect at the rear, camera left, and I'm now certain the front wheel, camera right, has a sprung steering mechanism to push it the right way.  </p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/eTw65.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/eTw65.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>by frame 4, the catch has been released and the bodywork is hinging outwards...
The seat is also being hinged backwards and downwards, but we can't see that yet.
[Further evidence of the steering being sprung is that the initial impact with the dirt ridge  momentarily pushes it back straight. The rear wheel is also off by this point and the axle has dropped, assisting the slew - better detail at the end]</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/VlVI6.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/VlVI6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Keaton lifts the steering wheel away and the front panel falls forwards - assisting the demolition of the engine bay and grille. One thing to keep track of over the next few frames is that the steering column stays in position relative to the car's chassis, which could be quite a hazard.<br>
[My 'sprung steering theory' is that the spring force has now overcome the bump and is back on track. It's hard to tell from this point if it is only the steering, or if the axle itself bends forwards. [From what little I know of cars from this era, that axle ought to be a solid bar, with steering at the ends.]<br>
Further evidence now shows the entire axle turns, see detail at the end of the post.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/i27oC.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/i27oC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Now we can see the seat tilting, preventing Keaton from sliding forwards into the loose debris and containing him within the relative safety of the hinged box. Throwing his legs upwards as the seat drops is a) comedic and b) safer.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/ldc2m.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ldc2m.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a>  </p>

<p>Now we get to see the steering column that didn't fall away ...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/M7SbO.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/M7SbO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Note he seems well aware that the steering column didn't fall away - construction error or design, we may never know. You can see him avoid it over the next few frames, even as the car takes a final lurch.<br>
You can also see the clear benefit in these final frames of the seat falling back to 45°, preventing him from sliding forwards.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/GLdFd.jpg" width="320"> <img src="https://i.sstatic.net/tKKOo.jpg" width="320"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/YFERy.jpg" width="320"> </p>

<p>And that's it. He's already stepping out of the car by frame 11.<br>
Note his exit route is a) planned and b) padded - the original car door.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/l9Swu.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/l9Swu.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>That is probably a clue as to why the camera right wheel went first, to slew the car in a specific direction.</p>

<p>Ten minutes and both he and the car could be ready for another take.</p>

<p>Re: the slewing - I've been trying to decide if this frame shows the front axle bending to ensure it goes in that direction. I can't decide.<br>
Perhaps the release mechanism also disconnected the steering on that side, or sprung it across, to push it in the correct direction.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/ejcNh.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ejcNh.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
<a href="https://i.sstatic.net/ebM33.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ebM33.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Last bit of evidence - from another source - the rear camera-left wheel drops first, assisting the slew, even as the front wheel is turning, before it hits the dirt at all...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/YNeql.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/YNeql.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a>
<a href="https://i.sstatic.net/84Pjh.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/84Pjh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>The front axle in its entirety turns too [on this better footage, there's no sign it bends, but it does turn as a whole piece.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/o66Vu.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/o66Vu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p><strong>One final note...</strong></p>

<p>The wheels never come off. They're tethered, like a modern Formula 1 car.<br>
They fall over but never fully detach from the axle ends.<br>
If they weren't, pure chance would say one of them wouldn't land right next to its own axle - especially the rear which we see come loose long before the rest.  </p>

<p>It would appear that the only totally free-to-fly items are the radiator grille and the two headlamps. Everything else, including the last-to-fall front wing/fender, is held firmly in place, at least by one end.</p>

						<p>When I was analysing the structures of CYOA works a few years back, I began to recognise some strong recurring design patterns. I came up with some home-brewed terminology, but didn’t ever lay it out in a nice clear way. This is a non-exhaustive look at some of the more common approaches, somewhat-updated (a lot has changed since then).</p>
<p>I should stress that these aren’t discrete categories: while a lot of works will fall very straightforwardly into a single pattern, many will involve elements of multiple patterns. (And yes, I’m aware that you can often simulate one using the mechanics of another. That’s mostly beside the point.) Also, the example diagrams I’m using are smaller and simpler than would be&nbsp;likely in actual works.</p>
<p><strong>Time Cave.&nbsp;</strong>A heavily-branching sequence. All choices are of roughly equal significance; there is little or no re-merging, and therefore no need for state-tracking. There are many, many endings.</p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>The time cave is the oldest and most obvious CYOA structure. It is often good for narratives about freedom and open possibility, adventures that could go&nbsp;<em>anywhere,</em>&nbsp;flights of fancy.&nbsp;Time caves tend to have relatively short playthroughs, but strongly&nbsp;encourage replay: they are broad rather than long. Even with multiple playthroughs, most players will probably miss a good deal of the content.</p>
<p>The time cave’s&nbsp;structure is both organised by chronological progression and detached from it.&nbsp;It’s ungrounded by regularity: possibility is&nbsp;<em>so</em> open that it often becomes fantastic or surreal, with different branches occupying wholly different realities. The player has velocity but little grasp, vast freedom but little&nbsp;ability to comprehend it.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>Edward Packard’s earlier work (<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/cyoa-structures-the-cave-of-time/">The Cave of Time</a><em>, </em><a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/cyoa-structures-more-packard/">Sugarcane Island</a>), Emily Short’s <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/cyoa-structure-if/">A dark and stormy entry</a>; <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/cyoa-structure-millennial-snark/">Pretty Little Mistakes</a><i>.</i></p>

<p><strong>Gauntlet.&nbsp;</strong>Long rather than broad, gauntlets have a relatively linear central thread, pruned by branches which end in death, backtracking, or quick rejoining. The Gauntlet generally tells one anointed story, which can be adorned with optional content or prematurely ended with failure; if there are multiple endings, they’re likely to derive from a Final Choice. Gauntlets rarely rely on state to any great extent (if they do, they are likely to evolve into a branch-and-bottleneck structure.)</p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>The player is likely to realise that they are on a constrained path, but the presentation of side-branches matters a great deal – do they mean death? incorrect answers? travel back in time? blocked paths, footnotes, &nbsp;or&nbsp;scenic details? Most often,<em>&nbsp;</em>the gauntlet creates an atmosphere of a hazardous, difficult or constrained world. Sometimes this can be punishing or depressing; sometimes it can be darkly comic; sometimes it’s a sign that you’re in a work heavily dependent on reflective or rhetorical choice. Perhaps the easiest structure to author, gauntlets can be conceived of in similar terms to&nbsp;linear stories, and ensure that most players will see most of the important content.</p>
<p>There are two major varieties of gauntlet: deadly and friendly. Deadly gauntlets mostly prune the tree with&nbsp;<em>failure</em>; friendly ones mostly do so with short-range rejoining, and look a bit more like simple <em>branch-and-bottleneck</em> structures. Friendly gauntlets have been vastly more common in recent years, making up a high&nbsp;proportion of Twine works.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em><a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/cyoa-structure-spin-offs/">Zork: The Forces of Krill</a><em>. </em><a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=qgyhzznz7r5p64eq">Our Boys In Uniform</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Branch and Bottleneck.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The game branches, but the branches regularly rejoin, usually around events that are common to all versions of the story. To avoid obliterating the effect of past choices, branch-and-bottleneck structures almost always rely on heavy use of state-tracking (if a game doesn’t do this, chances are you are dealing with a gauntlet).</p>
<p>Somewhat rarely, the bottlenecks may be invisible – the plot branches and never reaches an explicit rejoining node, but the choices at the end of each branch are the same or similar, creating an exquisite-corpse effect.</p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>Branch-and-bottleneck games tend to be heavily&nbsp;governed by the passage of time, while still allowing the player fairly strong grasp.<em>&nbsp;</em>The branch-and-bottleneck structure is most often used to reflect the growth of the player-character: it allows the player to construct a somewhat-distinctive story and/or personality, while still allowing for a manageable plot. There’s a tendency – not a necessary one, by any means – for playthroughs to be very similar in the early game, then diverge as the effects of earlier choices accumulate. In order for the approach to work, it has to be used in a fairly large piece; you need time to accumulate change before producing results that reflect it.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>This is pretty much how&nbsp;<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2014/12/13/long-live-the-queen/">Long Live the Queen</a> works, and is the guiding principle of <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/standard-patterns-in-choice-based-games/choiceofgames.com">Choice of Games</a> (Dan Fabulich uses the&nbsp;term <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/2011/07/by-the-numbers-how-to-write-a-long-interactive-novel-that-doesnt-suck/"><em>delayed branching</em></a>). It’s also a common plot structure in non-IF games that allow significant plot choices.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Quest.&nbsp;</strong>The quest structure forms distinct branches, though they tend to rejoin to reach a relatively small number of winning endings (often only one). The elements of these branches have&nbsp;a modular structure: small, tightly-grouped clusters of nodes allowing&nbsp;many ways to approach a single situation, with lots of interconnection within each cluster and relatively little outside it. Re-merging is fairly common; backtracking rather less so. Quests generally involve some level of state-tracking, and do poorly when they don’t. The minimal size for a quest is relatively large, and this category includes some of the largest CYOAs.</p>

<p><span><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>This mode is well-suited for journeys of exploration, focused on setting; the quest’s structure tends to be organised by geography rather than time. Indeed, most works of this kind involve a journey with a specific purpose in mind. Quests work well for grounded, consistent worlds, but within that context the player-character’s situation is constantly changing. The&nbsp;narrative&nbsp;tends to be fragmentary or episodic, like old-school D&amp;D encounters: little chunks of story which might not have any great significance for the big picture.</span></p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>The <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> books and their descendants (<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/cyoa-structures-cyo-rpg/">Lone Wolf</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/80-days-the-map-is-the-territory/">80 Days</a><em>).</em></p>
<p><span><b>Open Map.</b>&nbsp;Even though quests are structured by geography, time still plays an important part: there’s a built-in direction of travel. But take a&nbsp;CYOA structure, make travel between the major nodes reversible, and you&nbsp;have a static geography, a world in which the player can toodle about indefinitely. Often&nbsp;this is a&nbsp;<em>literal</em> geography and relies on extensive state-tracking both explicit and secret for narrative progress. But it’s not an uncommon mode for things with assumptions grounded in the hypertext-novel idiom – static but non-linear works like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.francoiscoulon.com/le_reprobateur.html">Le Reprobateur</a><em>.</em></span></p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>This is often used as an imitation of the default style of parser IF, although some may be parallel derivation from the former’s D&amp;D roots. As with classic map-based parser games, the narrative tends to become slower-paced and less directed; the player has more leisure to explore and grasp the world, but spends less of their time advancing the story.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;Duelmaster</em>;&nbsp;<a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=qfvfc6576i90py4w">Chemistry and Physics</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sorting Hat.&nbsp;</strong>The early game branches heavily and rejoins heavily (branch-and-bottleneck is a likely model here), ultimately determining which major branch the player gets assigned to. These major branches are typically quite linear&nbsp;– sometimes they look like gauntlets, but they might be choiceless&nbsp;straight-shots.&nbsp;Sorting Hats almost always rely substantially&nbsp;on state-tracking in the early game, and often bottleneck at the decision point.</p>
<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>The Sorting Hat&nbsp;is a compromise between the breadth of more open formats and the depth of linear ones. Sometimes&nbsp;the nature of the various branches is signaled to the player; this is kind of important, in fact, because the player is pretty likely to notice the linearity of the second half and might assume that&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>of their choices will ultimately get funneled&nbsp;into that particular thread. The player gets a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of influence over how the story goes; however, the author may end up effectively having to write several different games.</p>
<p><em>Examples: </em><a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/cyoa-structure-graphic-novels/">Katawa Shoujo</a><em>; </em><a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=es0sfij74uu4barv">Magical Makeover</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Floating&nbsp;Modules.</strong>&nbsp;A mode only really possible in computer-based works. There is no tree – or, while there may be scattered twigs and branches, there’s no trunk. No central plot, no through-line: modular encounters become available to the player based largely on state, or perhaps randomly.</p>
<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>This is a challenging&nbsp;style to write for, both because it’s difficult to intuitively grasp – writers tend to rebound quickly to a more unified structure – and because few assumptions can ever be made about prior events.&nbsp;Without a large amount of content, the method tends to collapse into a linear system. Because play mechanics are largely about altering stats in order to negotiate a world, there’s a strong incentive to expose those stats to the player; repeated events chosen only to affect a stat (grinding) may be a feature.</p>
<p>There are different approaches to&nbsp;floating-module: <a href="https://emshort.wordpress.com/2016/04/12/beyond-branching-quality-based-and-salience-based-narrative-structures/">Emily Short has a tentative categorisation here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>Pure examples of modular design are relatively rare. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040404061317/www.channelzilch.com/doug/battle.htm">King of Chicago</a>&nbsp;(hat-tip Sean Barrett)&nbsp;is an early example.&nbsp;<a href="http://storynexus.com/s">StoryNexus</a> and its conceptual relatives (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://varytale.com/books/book/short-bee/info/">Bee</a>) inhabit&nbsp;this space, though they&nbsp;generally impose some more linear-progression structure on it. (Alexis Kennedy uses the term <a href="http://www.failbettergames.com/storynexus-developer-diary-2-fewer-spreadsheets-less-swearing/">quality-based narrative</a> to describe the general approach: ‘pieces of story like mosaic tiles, not pipes or complex machinery.’)</p>

This is a very general pattern, and can co-exist with many others.&nbsp;<em>Trapped in Time</em>, for instance, is basically a cycle-and-growing Gauntlet;&nbsp;<em>Bee</em>&nbsp;tames its floating-module&nbsp;nature with a year-long loop structure.</p>
<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>Loop&nbsp;and Grow emphasizes the regularity of the world while retaining narrative momentum. A justification is needed for why whole sections of narrative can repeat: the player-character is often following routine activities in a familiar space, engaged in time-travel, or performing tasks at a certain level of abstraction. This regularity often comes at the price of openness: many stories with a strong Loop&nbsp;and Grow structure involve a struggle against confinement or stagnation.</p>
<p>An important variation&nbsp;of&nbsp;loop-and-grow structures is&nbsp;<strong>spoke and hub:&nbsp;</strong>the game has several major branches, but they all originate at and return to a central node or set of nodes. The player may go out along each spoke once, or many times.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;Bee</em>, <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=juj5b61griyoswn2">Trapped in Time</a>, <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=b6ljg2m07tmc2ffv">Solarium</a>.</p>

There’s a lot of great detail in Humpries’s write-up, and I recommend you read it directly in addition to this post.</p>



<h2>What happened at Canva</h2>



<h3>Trigger: deploying a new version of a page</h3>



<p>The trigger for this incident was Canva deploying a new version of their editor page. It’s notable <strong><em>that there was nothing wrong with this new version.</em></strong> The incident wasn’t triggered by a bug in the code in the new version, or even by some unexpected emergent behavior in the code of this version. No, while the incident was triggered by a deploy, the changes from the previous version are immaterial to this outage. Rather, <em><strong>it was the system behavior that emerged from clients downloading the new version that led to the outage</strong></em>. Specifically, it was clients downloading the new javascript files from the CDN that set the ball in motion.</p>



<h3>A stale traffic rule</h3>



<p>Canva uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> as their CDN. Being a CDN, Cloudflare has datacenters <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/">all over the world</a>., which are interconnected by a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-backbone-internet-fast-lane">private backbone</a>. Now, I’m not a networking person, but my basic understanding of private backbones is that CDNs lease fibre-optic lines from telecom companies and use these leased lines to ensure that they have dedicated network connectivity and bandwidth between their sites.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for Canva, there was a previously unknown issue on Cloudflare’s side: Cloudflare Wasn’t using their dedicated fibre-optic lines to route traffic between their Northern Virginia and Singapore datacenters. That traffic was instead, unintentionally, going over the public internet.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>[A] stale rule in Cloudflare’s traffic management system [that] was sending user IPv6 traffic over public transit between Ashburn and Singapore instead of its default route over the private backbone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The routes that this traffic took suffered from considerable packet loss. For Canva users in Asia, this meant that they experienced massive increases in latency when their web browsers attempted to fetch the javascript static assets from the CDN.</p>



<p>A stale rule like this is the kind of issue that the safety researcher James Reason calls a <em>latent pathogen</em>. It’s a problem that remains unnoticed until it emerges as a contributor to an incident.</p>



<h3>High latency synchronizes the callers</h3>



<blockquote>
<p>Normally, an increase in errors would cause our canary system to abort a deployment. However, in this case, no errors were recorded because requests didn’t complete. As a result, over 270,000+ user requests for the JavaScript file waited on the same cache stream. This created a backlog of requests from users in Southeast Asia.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first client attempts to fetch the new Javascript files from the CDN, but the files aren’t there yet, the CDN must fetch the files from the origin. Because of the added latency, this takes a long time.</p>



<p>During this time, other clients connect, and attempt to fetch the javascript from the CDN. But the CDN has not yet been populated with the files from the origin, that transfer is still in progress.</p>



<p>As Cloudflare notes in <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-concurrent-streaming-acceleration/">this blog post</a>, when all subsequent clients request access to a file that is in the process of being populated in the cache, they must wait until the file has been cached before they can download the file. Except that Cloudflare has implemented functionality called <em>Concurrent Streaming Acceleration</em> which permits multiple clients to simultaneously download a file that is still in the process of being downloaded from the origin server.</p>



<p>The resulting behavior is that the CDN now behaves effectively as a <em>barrier</em>, with all of the clients slowly but simultaneously downloading the assets. With a traditional barrier, the processes who are waiting can proceed once all processes have entered in the barrier. This isn’t quite the same, as the clients who are waiting can all proceed once the CDN completes downloading the asset from the origin.</p>

<h3>The transfer completes, the herd thunders</h3>



<blockquote>
<p>At 9:07 AM UTC, the asset fetch completed, and all 270,000+ pending requests were completed simultaneously. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>20 minutes after Canva deployed the new Javascript assets to the origin server, the clients completed fetching them. The next action the clients take is to call Canva’s API service. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the JavaScript file now accessible, client devices resumed loading the editor, including the previously blocked object panel. The object panel loaded simultaneously across all waiting devices, resulting in a thundering herd of 1.5 million requests per second to the API Gateway — 3x the typical peak load.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s one more issue that made this situation even worse: a known performance issue in the API gateway that was slated to be fixed.</p>



<h3>A problematic call pattern to a library reduces service throughput</h3>



<blockquote>
<p>The API Gateways use an event loop model, where code running on event loop threads must not perform any blocking operations.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Two common threading models for request-response services are <em>thread-per-request</em> and <em>async</em>. For services that are I/O-bound (i.e., most of the time servicing each request is spent waiting for I/O operations to complete, typically networking operations), the async model has the potential to achieve better throughput. That’s because the concurrency of the thread-per-request model is limited by the number of operating-system threads. The async model services multiple requests per thread, and so it doesn’t suffer from the thread bottleneck. Canva’s API gateway implements the <em>async</em> model using the popular <a href="https://netty.io/">Netty</a> library.</p>



<p>One of the drawbacks of the async model is the risk associated with the active thread getting <em>blocked</em>, because this can result in a significant performance penalty. The async model multiplexes multiple requests across an individual thread, and none of those requests can make progress when that thread is blocked. Programmers writing code in a service that uses the async model need to take care to minimize the number of blocking calls.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Prior to this incident, we’d made changes to our telemetry library code, inadvertently introducing a performance regression. The change caused certain metrics to be re-registered each time a new value was recorded. This re-registration occurred under a lock within a third-party library.</p>

<p>In Canva’s case, the API gateway logic was making calls to a third-party telemetry library. They were calling the library in such a way that it took a lock, which is a blocking call. This reduced the effective throughput that the API gateway could handle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the issue had already been identified and a fix had entered our release process the day of the incident, we’d underestimated the impact of the bug and didn’t expedite deploying the fix. This meant it wasn’t deployed before the incident occurred.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ironically, they were aware of this problematic call pattern, and they were planning on deploying a fix the day of the incident(!).</p>



<p>As an aside, it’s worth noting the role of telemetry logic behavior in the <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12/14/quick-takes-on-the-recent-openai-public-incident-write-up/">recent OpenAI incident</a>, and in the locking behavior of tracing library in a <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/08/01/reproducing-a-java-21-virtual-threads-deadlock-scenario-with-tla/">complex performance issue that Netflix experienced</a>. Observability giveth reliability, and observability taketh reliability away.</p>



<p>Canva is now in a situation where the API gateway is receiving much more traffic than it was provisioned to handle, is also suffering from a performance regression that reduces its ability to handle traffic even more. </p>



<p>Now let’s look at how the system behaved under these conditions.</p>



<h2>The load balancer turns into an overload balancer</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>Because the API Gateway tasks were failing to handle the requests in a timely manner, the load balancers started opening new connections to the already overloaded tasks, further increasing memory pressure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A load balancer sits in front of a service and distributes the incoming requests across the units of compute. Canva runs atop <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">ECS</a>, so the individual units are called <em>tasks</em>, and the group is called a <em>cluster</em> (you can think of these as being equivalent to <em>pods</em> and <em>replicasets </em>in Kubernetes-land).</p>



<p>The load balancer will only send requests to a task that is healthy. If a task is unhealthy, then it stops being considered as a candidate target destination for the load balancer. This yields good results if the overall cluster is provisioned to handle the load: the traffic gets redirected away from the unhealthy tasks and onto the healthy ones.</p>

<p>But now consider the scenario where all of the tasks are operating close to capacity. As tasks go unhealthy, the load balancer will redistribute the load to the remaining “healthy” tasks, which increases the likelihood those tasks gets pushed into an unhealthy state. </p>



<figure><a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png"><img data-attachment-id="5682" data-permalink="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12/21/the-canva-outage-another-tale-of-saturation-and-resilience/lb-unhealthy/" data-orig-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png" data-orig-size="2732,2048" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lb-unhealthy" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="767" src="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=1024 1024w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=2046 2046w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=150 150w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=300 300w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Redirecting traffic to the almost-overloaded healthy nodes will push them over</figcaption></figure>







<p>This is a classic example of a positive feedback loop: the more tasks go unhealthy, the more traffic the healthy nodes received, the more likely those tasks will go unhealthy as well.</p>



<h3>Autoscaling can’t keep pace</h3>



<p>So, now the system is saturated, and the load balancer is effectively making things worse. Instead of shedding load, it’s concentrating load on the tasks that aren’t overloaded yet.</p>



<p>Now, this is the cloud, and the cloud is <em>elastic</em>, and we have a wonderful automation system called the <em>autoscaler</em> that can help us in situations of overload by automating provisioning new capacity.</p>



<p>Only, there’s a problem here, and that’s that the autoscaler simply can’t scale up fast enough. And the reason it can’t scale up fast enough is because of another automation system that’s intended to help in times of overload: Linux’s OOM killer.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The growth of off-heap memory caused the Linux Out Of Memory Killer to terminate all of the running containers in the first 2 minutes, causing a cascading failure across all API Gateway tasks. This outpaced our autoscaling capability, ultimately leading to all requests to canva.com failing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Operating systems need access to free memory in order to function properly. When all of the memory is consumed by running processes, the operating system runs into trouble. To guard against this, Linux has a feature called the <a href="https://linuxhandbook.com/oom-killer/">OOM killer</a> which will automatically terminate a process when the operating system is running too low on memory. This frees up memory, enabling the OS to keep functioning. </p>



<p>So, you have the autoscaler which is adding new tasks, and the OOM killer which is quickly destroying existing tasks that have become overloaded.</p>



<p>It’s notable that Humphries uses the term <em>outpaced</em>. This sort of scenario is a common failure mode in complex system failures, where the system gets into a state where it can’t keep up. This phenomenon is called <em>decompensation</em>. Here’s resilience engineering pioneer <a href="https://www.profound-deming.com/profound-podcast/s4-e24-dr-david-woods-resilience-and-complexity-part-one">David Woods describing decompensation on John Willis’s <em>Profound</em> Podcast</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>And lag is really saturation in time. That’s what we call decompensation, right? I can’t keep pace, right? Events are moving forward faster. Trouble is building and compounding faster than I, than the team, than the response system can decide on and deploy actions to affect. So I can’t keep pace. – David Woods</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Adapting the system to bring it back up</h2>



<p>At this point, the API gateway cluster is completely overwhelmed. From the timeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>9:07 AM UTC – Network issue resolved, but the backlog of queued requests result in a spike of 1.5 million requests per second to the API gateway.</p><p>9:08 AM UTC – API Gateway tasks begin failing due to memory exhaustion, leading to a full collapse.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>When your system is suffering from overload, there are basically two strategies: </p>



<ol>
<li>increase the capacity</li>



<li>reduce the load</li>
</ol>



<p>Wisely, the Canva engineers pursued both strategies in parallel.</p>



<h3>Max capacity, but it still isn’t enough</h3>



<figure><a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png"><img data-attachment-id="5689" data-permalink="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12/21/the-canva-outage-another-tale-of-saturation-and-resilience/image-370/" data-orig-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png" data-orig-size="340,350" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png?w=291" data-large-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png?w=340" loading="lazy" width="340" height="350" src="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png?w=340" alt="" srcset="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png 340w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png?w=146 146w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png?w=291 291w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px"></a><figcaption>Montgomery Scott, my nominee for patron saint of resilience engineering</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;We attempted to work around this issue by significantly increasing the desired task count manually. Unfortunately, it didn’t mitigate the issue of tasks being quickly terminated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The engineers tried to increase capacity manually, but even with the manual scaling, the load was too much: the OOM killer was taking the tasks down too quickly for the system to get back to a healthy state.</p>



<h3>Load shedding, human operator edition</h3>



<p>The engineers had to improvise a load shedding solution in the moment. The approach they took was to block traffic the CDN layer, using Cloudflare.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;At 9:29 AM UTC, we added a temporary Cloudflare firewall rule to block all traffic at the CDN. This prevented any traffic reaching the API Gateway, allowing new tasks to start up without being overwhelmed with incoming requests. We later redirected canva.com to our status page to make it clear to users that we were experiencing an incident.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth noting here that while Cloudflare contributed to this incident with the stale rule, the fact that they could dynamically configure Cloudflare firewall rules meant that Cloudflare also contributed to the mitigation of this incident.</p>



<h3>Ramping the traffic back up</h3>



<p>Here they turned off all of their traffic to give their system a chance to go back to healthy. But a healthy system under zero load behaves differently from a healthy system under typical load. If you just go back from zero to typical, there’s a risk that you push the system back into an unhealthy state. (One common problem is that autoscaling will have scaled down multiple services due when there’s no load).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once the number of healthy API Gateway tasks stabilized to a level we were comfortable with, we incrementally restored traffic to canva.com. Starting with Australian users under strict rate limits, we gradually increased the traffic flow to ensure stability before scaling further.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Canva engineers had the good judgment to ramp up the traffic incrementally rather than turn it back on all at once. They started restoring at <em>9:45 AM UTC</em>, and were back to taking full traffic at <em>10:04 AM</em>.</p>



<h2>Some general observations</h2>



<h3>All functional requirements met</h3>



<p>I always like to call out situations where, from a <em>functional</em> point of view, everything was actually working fine. In this case, even though there was a stale rule in the Cloudflare traffic management system, and there was a performance regression in the API gateway, everything was working correctly from a functional perspective: packets were still being routed between Singapore and Northern Virginia, and the API gateway was still returning the proper responses for individual requests before it got overloaded. </p>



<p>Rather, these two issues were both <em>performance</em> problems. Performance problems are much harder to spot, and the worst are the ones that you don’t notice until you’re under heavy load. </p>



<p>The irony is that, as an organization gets better at catching functional bugs before they hit production, more and more of the production incidents they face will be related to these more difficult-to-detect-early performance issues. </p>



<h3>Automated systems made the problem worse</h3>



<p>There were a number of automated systems in play whose behavior made this incident more difficult to deal with.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-concurrent-streaming-acceleration/">Concurrent Streaming Acceleration</a> functionality synchronized the requests from the clients. The OOM killer reduced the time it took for a task to be seen as unhealthy by the load balancer, and the load balancer in turn increased the rate at which tasks went unhealthy. </p>



<p>None of these systems were designed to handle this sort of situation, so they could not automatically change their behavior.</p>



<h3>The human operators changed the way the system behaved</h3>



<p>It was up to the incident responders to adapt the behavior of the system, to change the way it functioned in order to get it back to a healthy state. They were able to leverage an existing resource, Cloudflare’s firewall functionality, to accomplish this. Based on the description of the action items, I suspect they had never used Cloudflare’s firewall to do this type of load shedding before. But it worked! They successfully adapted the system behavior.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re building a detailed internal runbook to make sure we can granularly reroute, block, and then progressively scale up traffic. We’ll use this runbook to quickly mitigate any similar incidents in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a classic example of <em>resilience</em>, of acting to reconfigure the behavior of your system when it enters a state that it wasn’t originally designed to handle. </p>



<p>As I’ve <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2021/05/31/transgressing-the-boundaries-rasmussen-and-woods/">written about previously</a>, Woods talks about the idea of a <em>competence envelope</em>. The competence envelope is sort of a conceptual space of the types of inputs that your system can handle. Incidents occur when your system is pushed to operate outside of its competence envelope, such as when it gets more load than it is provisioned to handle:</p>



<p>The competence envelope is a good way to think about the difference between <em>robustness</em> and <em>resilience</em>. You can think of robustness as describing the competence envelope itself: a more robust system may have a larger competence envelope, it is designed to handle a broader range of problems. </p>



<p>However, every system has a finite competence envelope. The difference between a <em>resilient</em> and a <em>brittle</em> system is how that system behaves when it is pushed just outside of its competence envelope.</p>



<figure><a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png"><img data-attachment-id="5702" data-permalink="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12/21/the-canva-outage-another-tale-of-saturation-and-resilience/competence-envelope-2/" data-orig-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png" data-orig-size="2220,1169" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="competence-envelope" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="539" src="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=2048 2048w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=150 150w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=300 300w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Incidents happen when the system is pushed outside of its competence envelope</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <em>resilient</em> system can change the way it behaves when pushed outside of the competence envelope due to an incident in order to extend the competence envelope so that it can handle the incident. That’s why we say it has <em><strong>adaptive capacity</strong>. </em>On the other hand, a <em>brittle</em> system is one that cannot adapt effectively when it exceeds its competence envelope. A system can be very robust, but also brittle: it may be able to handle a very wide range of problems, but when it faces a scenario it wasn’t designed to handle, it can fall over hard. </p>



<p>The sort of adaptation that resilience demands requires human operators: our automation simply doesn’t have a sophisticated enough model of the world to be able to handle situations like the one that Canva found itself in. </p>



<p>In general, action items after an incident focus on expanding the competence envelope: making changes to the system to handle the scenario that just happened. <a href="https://www.adaptivecapacitylabs.com/">Improving adaptive capacity</a> involves different kind of work than improving system robustness.</p>



<p>We need to build in the ability to reconfigure our systems in advance, without knowing exactly what sorts of changes we’ll need to make. The Canva engineers had some powerful operational knobs at their disposal through the Cloudflare firewall configuration. This allowed them to make changes. The more powerful and generic these sorts of dynamic configuration features are, the more room for maneuver we have. Of course, dynamic configuration is also dangerous, and is itself a contributor to incidents. Too often we focus solely on the dangers of such functionality in creating incidents, without seeing its ability to help us reconfigure the system to mitigate incidents.</p>



<p>Finally, these sorts of operator interfaces are of no use if the responders aren’t familiar with them. Ultimately, the more your responders know about the system, the better position they’ll be in to implement these adaptations. Changing an unhealthy system is dangerous: no matter how bad things are, you can always accidentally make things worse. The more knowledge about the system you can bring to bear during an incident, the better position you’ll be in to adaptive your system to extend that competence envelope.</p>

		<p>To that end, we’ve organized our best pens guide by category, and linked to more detailed guides so you can learn about competing pens. Take a look and try out our picks—who knows, you might find your personal best pen!</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/354">Uni Jetstream</a> is a versatile pen that can be used in almost any situation. It proves that ballpoint pens aren’t just low-quality writing instruments “borrowed” from restaurants and hotels. The Jetstream uses a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Low-Viscosity-Ballpoint-Pens/pt/160">low-viscosity ballpoint ink</a> that provides a smooth, vivid, and consistent writing experience. And like other ballpoint pens, the Jetstream can write on receipts and other surfaces that gel pens struggle with.
							</p><p>The Jetstream comes in several body styles, tip sizes, and ink colors. This includes the comfortable <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Alpha-Gel-Grip-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/655">Alpha Gel Grip</a>, as well as a shockingly fine <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/354?&amp;f=7c1b58e478515a91a04e42ce0a1eb746">0.28 mm</a> tip size that no other ballpoint pen can match. You can even get the Jetstream in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Multi-Pens/ct/858">multi pen form</a>, which includes several ink colors. Some even have mechanical pencil components!</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>The Jetstream is also available with <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/search?q=attr_categories_id%3A7464+OR+attr_categories_id%3A7463&amp;v=1">Lite Touch Ink</a>, which glides across the page with less pressure than the original Jetstream. You can learn more about the entire lineup in our <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Uni-Jetstream-A-Comprehensive-Guide/pt/758">guide</a>.</p>

									The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706">Pilot Metropolitan Fountain Pen</a> is the best beginner fountain pen, period. Its durable metal build and smooth stainless steel nib ensure that your first fountain pen is one you can be proud of. The Metropolitan comes in three nib sizes (<a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=4cb4dbdf7f3f31d2">fine</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=58abf2a2f635c8ec32ea692af29489e9">medium</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=6914ab5eaeccecd6039d36e7d078ad40b376adb49213ebba">medium italic</a>) and several body colors. It can be filled with Pilot’s proprietary <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Namiki-Fountain-Pen-Refill-Cartridges/ct/130">cartridges</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pen-Black-Plain-Fine/pd/12075/refills?&amp;f=64f61958cc42490f31a490a25ae468364ebf64e44e23854d">converters</a>—one is included!—which allows you to use any <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Fountain-Pen-Inks/ct/3250">bottled fountain pen ink</a>.
									</p><p>For those who like how the Metropolitan writes but would prefer a different body, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Kakuno-Fountain-Pens/ct/1984">Kakuno</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Penmanship-Fountain-Pens/ct/759">Penmanship</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Prera-Fountain-Pens/ct/410">Prera</a> all use the same swappable nibs. The Kakuno is especially charming thanks to the smiley face stamped on the nib, which reminds you which side should face up.</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>Most fountain pens are filled with cartridges or converters, but some have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Fountain-Pen-Filling-Systems-Explained/pt/912#Built-In%20Filling%20System">built-in mechanisms</a> that allow you to fill the pen barrel with ink. They’re not as convenient as cartridges, but they can be filled with far more ink. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-GO-Fountain-Pens/ct/5275">TWSBI GO</a> is a great place to start if you want to try out this type of filling system. Its spring-loaded piston mechanism is easy to use. Submerge the nib in ink, then press down and release the plunger to fill the pen.</p>
							
							<p>Are you still a little hesitant to try out fountain pens? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fountain-Pens/ct/5111">Platinum Preppy</a> is another beginner option. It has a budget-friendly price that won’t break the bank if you decide fountain pens aren’t for you. Plus, you can repurpose the pen by swapping out the nib for a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fluorescent-Highlighter-Pen-Tip-Refill-Pack-of-2/pd/2820">chisel tip</a> and the fountain pen ink cartridge for a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Highlighter-Ink-Cartridges/ct/3171">highlighter ink cartridge</a>. Now you have a refillable highlighter pen!</p>

									While most piston-filling fountain pens cost more than $100, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3">TWSBI ECO</a> is the best fountain pen under $50. It offers amazing value with its high quality piston-filler, and its sleek, clear body lets you see how much ink is left inside. It’s available in four nib sizes, including a fun <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=6914ab5eaeccecd6039d36e7d078ad40b376adb49213ebba_8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3">1.1 mm stub</a>.
									</p><p>You might be wondering, “Why should I pick the TWSBI ECO over the GO mentioned in the previous section?” It comes down to price, ink capacity, and style. The GO has a budget-friendly price, smaller ink capacity, and quirky design that might look a little childish to some. The ECO is a little more expensive, though its traditional piston mechanism can hold more ink. Additionally, it has a body design with more general appeal, including limited edition colors (<a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=b266f8e094c1bb7a35d80a8f3bed5d19">some of which</a> are over $50).</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>If the idea of a piston-filling pen makes you a bit nervous—or if you would prefer the convenience of cartridges—we wholeheartedly recommend the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Safari-Fountain-Pens/ct/1185">LAMY Safari</a>. This distinctively modern fountain pen has a triangular grip section that guides your hand into an ergonomic <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pen-for-Your-Hand-Grip/pt/454">tripod grip</a>. The Safari is made of durable ABS plastic. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-AL-Star-Fountain-Pens/ct/1184">AL-Star</a> is a little more expensive, but it’s made from lightweight aluminum.</p>

									The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-AL-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/1040?&amp;f=b266f8e094c1bb7a35d80a8f3bed5d19">Kaweco AL Sport</a> is the best fountain pen under $100. It’s a stylish option for anyone ready to venture into more interesting fountain pen styles and materials. It’s both vintage and modern thanks to an iconic octagonal body design that was first introduced in 1935. The Kaweco Sport’s slogan—”Small in the pocket, great in the hand”—describes its appeal perfectly. Although the pen is small enough to fit in a pocket for <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Everyday-Carry-Stationery-Items/pt/46">everyday carry</a>, the cap can be posted on the back of the barrel to extend it to a comfortable size.
									</p><p>The Kaweco Sport is available as an inexpensive <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/3402?&amp;f=bfc2ef6f965adaf41e7007fbf57bff50_8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3_b266f8e094c1bb7a35d80a8f3bed5d19">plastic pen</a>, but we like the AL Sport’s premium feel. The aluminum build gives the pen a good weight and durability without adding too much weight.</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Brass-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/2462">Brass Sport</a> is a good alternative for anyone who wants a heavier pen, though we should note that its raw <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Brass-Pens/pt/337">brass</a> construction can have a noticeable scent.</p>
							
							<p>We also want to mention the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=873a409ab1e24078cf6022af66aea815">LAMY Studio</a>. It features the same steel nib found on the Safari fitted to a sturdy metal body. The Studio’s subtle, curving design gives the pen a remarkably sophisticated look. If you like the Studio and are willing to spend more than $100, you can pick up the stealthy all-black <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=f0cf9d16b892f5cd0a0d2415a7dca11f">Lx</a> with a matching steel nib or a fountain pen with a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=1914fdb7b0902f3495804bc50c319a60">14k gold nib</a>.</p>

									Although there are many sophisticated pens that any professional would be proud to carry, we have to say that the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens/ct/3876">Pilot Vanishing Point</a> is the best luxury fountain pen for writing. This fountain pen’s elegance speaks for itself, but its retraction mechanism takes it to another level. Just press the button on the back of the barrel to extend the nib. When the nib is retracted, a “gate” inside the grip section seals the nib and prevents it from drying out.
									
									</p><p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens-Standard/ct/1225">Standard Vanishing Point</a> is best for those with larger hands and comes in a range of finishes, from the stealthy <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens/ct/3876?&amp;f=3e29cb29569d6320_9f666c7890582192">Black Matte</a> to the stunning <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Raden-Fountain-Pens/ct/6893">Raden</a> series inlaid with real abalone shell. The thinner and lighter <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Decimo-Fountain-Pens/ct/544">Decimo</a> is ideal for those with smaller hands, or anyone who intends to write for long periods of time.</p>
								</div>

							<p>Some writers may find that the Vanishing Point’s clip gets in the way of their fingers. For an alternative that’s no less exceptional, you can’t go wrong with the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-2000-Fountain-Pens/ct/1542">LAMY 2000</a>. This fountain pen balances a striking design with understated style. Because it’s a piston filler, it has a high ink capacity that allows you to write for pages and pages.</p>
							
							<p>Is the LAMY 2000’s design a little too modern for your taste? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-3776-Century-Fountain-Pens/ct/3830">Platinum 3776 Century</a> has a vintage appeal thanks to its classic, cigar-shaped design with rounded ends. Or are you searching for an option with plenty of colors to choose from? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sailor-Pro-Gear-Slim-Fountain-Pens/ct/4019">Pro Gear Slim</a> would be right up your alley. Sailor regularly releases new colors based on seasonal themes, Japanese festivals, and more. </p>

Like our top choice, it uses low-viscosity ink that flows smoothly. In our tests, we found that the Acroball felt a little more “textured” on paper than the Jetstream, which meant it was easier to control.
							</p><p>The Acroball’s body is made from recycled plastic, and it has a firm rubber grip that’s comfortable to hold. Other pens that use Acro ink have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acro-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/1211?&amp;f=24b4f2b5c0e9dfbf">metal</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acro-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/1211?&amp;f=6899e7f15372d0331e7007fbf57bff50">plastic</a> grips. We found them pleasant to hold, but writers with sweaty hands might notice their grasps slipping easily on the smooth surfaces.</p>
							<p>The Acroball also comes in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acroball-Multi-Pens/ct/2996">multi pen</a> form, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acroball-Multi-Pens/ct/2996?&amp;f=a19ed82aab4a28cce9773f43a7371a16">some versions</a> include mechanical pencil components.</p>

							The unique tip of the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Pulaman-JM20-Pens/ct/1547">Pentel Pulaman JM20 Pen</a> makes it especially well-suited for writing. Its plastic nib is expressive and creates different line widths depending on the angle and pressure that you write with. Over time, the tip wears down according to how you use it, creating an experience that’s entirely unique to you and your writing style. Its conventional body style also makes it comfortable to hold for long writing sessions.
							</p><p>For more color options, check out the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Staedtler-Triplus-Fineliner-Pens/ct/1313">Staedtler Triplus Fineliner Pen</a>. It has as 0.3 mm felt tip that’s reinforced with a metal sleeve. Its dry-safe feature keeps the pen from drying out if you leave it uncapped for a few days (but we still recommend keeping your pen capped!).</p>

							If you want your writing instrument to have the finest tip possible, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381">Pilot Hi-Tec-C</a> is the best gel pen for you. Its <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381?&amp;f=f1d84bb55a3b087ba04e42ce0a1eb746">0.25 mm</a> tip can write neatly in the tiniest spaces, from book margins to planner squares. The Hi-Tec-C is remarkably smooth considering the fineness of the tip, and it comes in a handful of bright colors.
							</p><p>However, we must warn that such fine tip sizes will feel more “scratchy” than those found on 0.38 mm or 0.5 mm pens. A smaller tip size has a smaller surface area that comes in contact with the paper, and it puts down less ink that would otherwise lubricate the tip. Additionally, the 0.25 mm Hi-Tec-C may need to be primed with a scribble on a piece of scratch paper to get the ink flowing.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<p>We find these minor flaws a reasonable exchange for such fine lines, but the slightly broader <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381?&amp;f=df8f74e215697aa1cd5fbcfbc64dc408">0.3 mm</a> tip tends to perform more reliably.</p>
					
					<p>Those who prefer ballpoint inks should reach for the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/5947?&amp;f=7c1b58e478515a91a04e42ce0a1eb746">Uni Jetstream Edge</a>. As with the Hi-Tec-C, its ultra fine tip doesn’t perform as consistently as the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/5947?&amp;f=6c955f272b074045a04e42ce0a1eb746">0.38 mm Jetstream</a>, but we’re still impressed by how well the pen writes. A 0.28 mm tip size is almost unheard of in ballpoint pens, and Uni managed to make a precise pen that still offers a smooth writing experience. You can even get it as a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-3-Color-Ballpoint-Multi-Pens/ct/6234">multi pen</a>!</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Dry-Gel-Pens/ct/3703">Zebra Sarasa Dry</a> is the fastest-drying gel pen. Even the largest and wettest <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Dry-Gel-Pens/ct/3703?&amp;f=98b97b6ae48ce49ecd5fbcfbc64dc408">0.7 mm</a> tip size dried in less than five seconds on Rhodia paper, a paper that inks tend to dry slowly on. The Sarasa Dry puts down a wonderfully saturated line, writes smoothly, and comes in three tip sizes. Like many other Sarasa pens, this gel pen has a hinged clip that opens wide so it slides easily over notebooks and pockets.
							</p><p>As with many water-based gel inks, the Sarasa Dry smears readily beneath highlighters. Color-coders should consider using ballpoint pens like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acro-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/1211">Pilot Acro and Acroball</a> instead. Oil-based ballpoint inks won’t react to water-based highlighter inks, so you can go over your notes without worrying about smudges.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>Additionally, Pilot’s Acro ink is a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Low-Viscosity-Ballpoint-Pens/pt/160">low-viscosity ballpoint ink</a>, so it writes smoothly without blobbing.</p>

							The most comfortable ergonomic pen will differ from person to person, with the best options depending on factors like hand size. Even so, we think the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-207-Premier-Retractable-Gel-Pen-0.7-mm-Silver-Body-Black-Ink/pd/8466">Uni-ball Signo 207 Premier</a> is the best ergonomic pen for most writers. It uses the same ink as other <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-Gel-Pens/ct/2576">Signo Gel Pens</a>, so it flows freely and glides across the page with little pressure. The pigmented ink is satisfyingly dark regardless of how lightly you write. If you <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pen-for-Your-Hand-Grip/pt/454">hold your pens tightly</a>, its squishy grip will relieve your achy fingers. In addition, the 207 Premier has a lightweight body with a low center of gravity that won’t tire your hand as you write.
							</p><p>If you prefer ballpoint ink, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Dr.-Grip-Ballpoint-Pen-Series/ct/857">Pilot Dr. Grip</a> is another excellent ergonomic pen. It has a carefully balanced barrel, and its double layer grip design is moderately soft without being too squishy or too hard.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>The Dr. Grip, which is also available as a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Dr.-Grip-4-1-Multi-Pens/ct/306">multi pen</a>, has even earned an “Ease-of-Use” Commendation from the Arthritis Foundation.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Gel-Pens/ct/2574">Pilot FriXion</a> is by far the best “erasable” pen. This remarkable pen offers the best combination of vibrancy, consistency, and “erasability.” It accomplishes this with a special thermosensitive ink that writes just like any other ink, yet disappears without a trace when rubbed with the hard “eraser” on the end of the pen. The friction generated by this rubbing action raises the temperature of the ink and turns it invisible.
							</p><p>The Pilot FriXion comes in several colors, tip sizes, and body designs so that you can find one that fits your style. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Series/ct/4201">FriXion ink technology</a> can be found in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Light-Erasable-Highlighters/ct/682">highlighters</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Colors-Erasable-Markers/ct/1123">markers</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Stamps/ct/2531">stamps</a>.</p>
							<p>FriXion inks are less saturated in color than standard gel inks. This is most noticeable with the black ink, which can appear gray.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Ball-Knock-Zone-Retractable-Gel-Pens/ct/6729">Ball Zone</a> improves the ink’s saturation so the black ink no longer has a green tint and the colored inks are more vibrant.</p>
					
					<p>It’s important to keep in mind that Pilot FriXion ink will “erase” with any heat, so don’t store your notebooks in hot cars or on top of radiators. Additionally, don’t use FriXion ink to take tests or write on important documents, especially those that need permanent signatures. If you accidentally make your writing disappear, you may be able to get it to reappear by placing the paper in a freezer that reaches below 14°F (-10°C).</p>

We found that it wrote smoothly with very little feedback. Amazingly, the ink dries almost instantly on copy paper, and it dries in under five seconds on high-quality papers like Rhodia. 
							</p><p>The Swirl’s name comes from the marbled print on its barrel, which matches the color of the ink inside. Choose from eight vibrant shades.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Propus-Window-Q-Dry-Highlighters/ct/3509">Uni Propus Window Q-Dry</a> is the best highlighter for left-handed writers. Highlighters are often prone to smudging because of their wet inks, but the Q-Dry dried within a single second on Rhodia paper in our tests. Inks dry slowly on Rhodia paper, so this quick dry time is an incredible feat! Left-handed writers can highlight pages without the risk of smears. Additionally, this highlighter has a window in the chisel tip, so you can see where you’re highlighting. A fine bullet tip on the other side is great for underlining or circling key terms.

	<p>The Best Pens for Journaling and Planning</p>
		
		<div>
				
					<div><p>
							Just about any pen can work well for journaling, but the JetPens team is especially fond of the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Clip-Gel-Pens/ct/262">Zebra Sarasa Clip</a>. Its vibrant pigment ink is smooth to write with and both water and fade resistant, so it won’t disappear if you accidentally spill a drink on your journal. 
							</p><p>If you keep a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Journals/pt/566">journal</a> like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Leuchtturm1917-Bullet-Journals/ct/4259">Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal</a> that you update with quick notations throughout the day, the Sarasa’s fast-drying ink will help prevent smudges. What really sets the Sarasa Clip apart, though, is its namesake clip. It opens wide to let you securely fasten the pen to a notebook so you’ll always be ready to make a new entry.</p>
							<p>The Clip comes in a wide variety of hues for color-coding as well as tip-sizes from 0.3 mm to 1.0 mm to suit anyone’s preferences. </p>
						</div>
					
					<p>There’s even a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Multi-Pens/ct/412">multi pen version</a> filled with Sarasa ink. Those who appreciate finer tip sizes should consider trying the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Nano-Gel-Pens/ct/6558">Sarasa Nano</a>. It uses an internal spring that allows the tip to retract slightly into the pen, reducing sideways force and preventing the tip from wiggling undesirably.</p>

							These <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kuretake-ZIG-Clean-Color-Dot-Markers/ct/5733">Kuretake ZIG Clean Color Dot Markers</a> bring fun and versatility to journaling and planning. We’re big fans of the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kuretake-ZIG-Clean-Color-Dot-Markers/ct/5733?&amp;f=cd4aa3cda9bd1548bd4cf76df45d38a1">double-sided version</a>, which features a 0.5 mm hard plastic tip on one end and a wonderfully squishy dot tip on the other.
							</p><p>Depending on the pressure you use, the dot tip can make marks from one to five millimeters wide, though we should warn that pressing very hard can put a lot of ink on the page and cause bleedthrough. It’s easy and fun to make quick flowers and other fun doodles, or—for a slightly more practical use case—to highlight important dates in your planner or calendar. You can even make expressive brush-like strokes with the dot tip by varying the pressure as you draw!</p>

No matter which you choose, ZIG Clean Color Dot Markers come in a variety of colors, including <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kuretake-ZIG-Clean-Color-Dot-Markers/ct/5733?&amp;f=ba2ad1cb79925347f016b234e8990fb2991ba285a8edabf6">metallic</a> options.</p>

							The best double-sided highlighter for journaling and planning is the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Mark-2-Way-Marker-Pens/ct/6133">Kokuyo Mark+ 2 Way Marker Pen</a>. It features a colored highlighter on one end and a complementary fineliner on the other. The highlighter end has a 4.0 mm chisel tip with ink that stands out without being overwhelmingly bright. The color of the fineliner end depends on which Mark+ you pick. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Mark-2-Way-Marker-Pens-Gray-Type/ct/6136">Gray Type Marker Pen</a> has a gray hue tinted to match the chisel color, while the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Mark-2-Way-Marker-Pens-Color-Type/ct/6137">Color Type</a> has a darker version of the chisel color.
							</p><p>The fineliner is dark enough to stand out even when highlighted over, allowing you to use the same pen to write and highlight notes in your schedule.</p>
							<p>Be sure to check out <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Mark-Highlighters/ct/5955?&amp;f=ba302fd9d40252ba59cb957d7dad431a">Kokuyo Mark+ Highlighters</a>, too. They have unique dual chisel tips so you can quickly switch between colors just by turning the highlighter in your hand.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Justfit-Mojini-Line-Highlighters/ct/5370">Zebra Justfit Mojini Line</a> is the most versatile student highlighter we’ve tried at JetPens. It didn’t smear the water-based or oil-based inks we <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Highlighter-Pens/pt/606#TEST%20RESULTS">tested it with</a>—and it didn’t smear inkjet-printed handouts, either. One caveat: we used specific pens and inks for our testing, so be sure to test the highlighter with your pens before you do a lot of highlighting.
							</p><p>The JustFit Mojini Line has a flexible chisel tip that follows the curves of book pages, so your highlighted lines stay neat. Choose from five vibrant colors. </p>

							</p><p>More importantly, the Ti Arto EDC can use almost any refill you want to try. An adjustable clutch mechanism in the nose cone securely holds refills in place, with no tip wiggle to district from your writing experience. The Ti Arto EDC also features a telescoping barrel that lets you adjust the length of the pen to match the refill inside.</p>

	<p>The Best Pens for Hand Lettering</p>

					<div><p>
							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910">Sakura Pigma Micron</a> is a fantastic fineliner for lettering (and art, too!). Its precise tip allows letterers to make consistent marks for drawing monoline styles and elaborate letterforms. Its rich, pigment-based ink delivers vivid color that is archival quality and waterproof, so your lettering will last for years. This iconic pen comes in several colors and fineliner tip sizes ranging from <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=90a21b8d54b00f7e9554f72d2b1a94e1">003</a> (0.15 mm) for intricate embellishments to <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=0c76cccd3a5f8bf6a04e42ce0a1eb746">12</a> (0.7 mm) for text that stands out. Pigma Micron tips can be a little delicate, so use a light hand and don’t press too hard while lettering. Otherwise, you might bend the tips.
							</p><p>Other tip types including <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=9337a404131b90fa7df047e3c29eae93">bullet tips</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=0ddcea6bf85d451d32091cb827bdb85a">plastic nibs</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=7dd55fcb7563d511">brushes</a> are also available.</p>

							The best dip pen for lettering is the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Rohrer-Klingner-Glass-Pens/ct/6105">Rohrer &amp; Klingner Glass Pen</a>. It’s a beautiful writing tool and a unique work of art at the same time. A <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/How-to-Use-a-Glass-Dip-Pen/pt/344">glass pen</a> has a tip with spiraling grooves that act as reservoirs. Dip the tip in ink to fill the grooves. As you write, ink travels down the grooves to the tip of the pen. When the tip feels like it’s running dry, turn the pen in your hand to allow ink from another groove to flow to the tip. Glass nibs will never rust, so they can last a lifetime as long as they’re cleaned of ink residue. Be sure to store them in a stable area like a pen cup or tray, too: after all, they’re made of glass, and can break if dropped!
							</p><p>If the designs offered by Rohrer &amp; Klingner don’t strike your fancy, browse the different glass pen colors offered by <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Herbin-Glass-Dip-Pens/ct/724">Herbin</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Guridrops-Glass-Pens/ct/6952">Guridrops</a>.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>All glass pens are handmade by artisans, so no two will look exactly alike.</p>
					
					<p>Since glass dip pens are made of fragile materials, some calligraphers may feel anxious about accidentally damaging them. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Teranishi-Guitar-Aurora-Glass-Pens-with-Cap/ct/7097">Teranishi Guitar Aurora Glass Pens</a> have acrylic barrels and come with screw-on caps to protect their glass tips. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kakimori-Dip-Pen-Nibs/ct/7197">Kakimori Metal Dip Pen Nibs</a> are made from durable brass or stainless steel (though you’ll need to pick up a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kakimori-Dip-Pen-Nib-Metal-Nib-Brass/pd/40028/compatible#index=1">nib holder</a>, too).</p>
					
					<p>You can also try a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Iro-Utsushi-Dip-Pens/ct/6648">Pilot Iro-Utsushi Dip Pen</a>, which has a barrel made of plastic or wood. The nib is made of stainless steel and has a rounded tip similar to a fountain pen nib, so they’re less “sharp” than typical dip pen nibs and feel smoother on paper. You should still be careful not to drop the pen on its nib, but you won’t have to worry about glass shards if an accident happens.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Parallel-Pens/ct/165">Pilot Parallel</a> is the best calligraphy pen for broad edge calligraphy scripts like italic or blackletter. This unique calligraphy pen features a nib made of two metal plates stacked on top of each other. This allows the ink to flow between the plates and along the entire width of the nib for a juicy and consistent line. Its cartridge-filled design makes the Parallel particularly easy and convenient to use, and its <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Parallel-Calligraphy-Pen-Refill-Cartridges/ct/603">mixable ink</a> allows for fun gradation effects. This pen comes in six nib sizes for projects of all sizes.

Their archival-safe, pigment-based inks dry very quickly. We were able to paint over them with watercolors immediately and saw no bleeding whatsoever. And since Multiliners are made by Copic, they’re compatible with alcohol-based <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Markers/ct/3075?&amp;f=1b8763b30df3730297f215786bb046761f4737d59d8d7acd">Copic Markers</a>.

They’re also available in ten colors, so you can line your artwork in a different color for visual appeal.</p>

							<p>Artists who do a great deal of inking should consider the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pens/ct/686">Multiliner SP</a>. They require a higher up-front investment than their disposable siblings, but they’re <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pen-Refills/ct/2357">refillable</a> and even have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pen-Replacement-Nibs-Accessories/ct/3427">replaceable tips</a>.</p>

							The best <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Technical-Drawing-Pens/pt/436">technical drawing pen</a> for art is the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/OHTO-Graphic-Liner-Needle-Point-Drawing-Pens/ct/1506">OHTO Graphic Liner</a>. Unlike traditional drawing pens with metal tips that must be held vertically, the Graphic Liner has a rollerball tip that can be used at your natural drawing angle. Since it’s made of metal rather than felt or plastic, the tip creates consistent lines without fraying or flexing. This makes it especially suitable for beginners, but even experienced artists can appreciate its natural feel and waterproof, Copic-proof, and archival pigment-based ink.

							The best <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Manga-and-Comic-Art-Supplies/pt/956"><em>manga</em> pen</a> for art combines a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Nikko-Comic-Pen-Nibs/ct/3065?&amp;f=a220e003961af2ce">Nikko G Nib</a> with a nib holder like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Tachikawa-T-40-Nib-Holder-Natural/pd/4573">Tachikawa Model 40</a>. A G Nib has a sharp tip that creates both broad and thin lines ideal for facial features, action-packed scenes, and more. We recommend that beginners start with the Nikko G because it’s relatively firm compared to other G nibs. This firmness makes it easy to control while still allowing a satisfying amount of flex.
							</p><p>For consistent lines, try Nikko’s <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Nikko-Comic-Pen-Nibs-Standard/ct/3794?&amp;f=add42f28e0d80e67dacb8f62f5adf3e49e6ad08b7a4ff724">Maru Nibs</a>. Also known as mapping nibs, these stiff nibs don’t flex at all. They work well for precise details.</p>
							<p>Comic pen nibs can’t be used on their own and must be paired with nib holders. The Tachikawa Model 40 is our favorite nib holder for <em>manga</em> artists.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>Its double rubber rings can hold a wide variety of nibs, and its rubber grip makes it comfortable to hold. It even comes with a plastic cap to protect nibs during transport.</p>

							As its name suggests, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Series/ct/4076">Faber-Castell PITT Artist Pen</a> is a great marker for art. It combines the permanence and vibrancy of India ink with the convenience of a marker. Other inks can fade when exposed to light, but the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Pens-A-Comprehensive-Guide/pt/309">PITT Artist Pen</a> uses ink that’s lightfast so you can confidently display your art. Because some colors are more lightfast than others, Faber-Castell prints a rating on each pen’s barrel to help you choose the right hues. A one-asterisk rating means the ink is lightfast for at least five years, while a three-asterisk rating is lightfast for more than 100 years!
							
							</p><p>Faber-Castell offers PITT Pens in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Pens/ct/3076">marker</a> and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Brush-Pens/ct/5181">brush pen</a> forms. And no matter which pen you prefer, it’s color-matched with other Faber-Castell products like <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-Polychromos-Colored-Pencils/ct/4107">Polychromos Colored Pencils</a> and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-Albrecht-Durer-Watercolor-Pencils/ct/5448">Albrecht Dürer Watercolor Pencils</a> for consistency in your multimedia projects.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Royal-Talens-Ecoline-Watercolor-Brush-Pens/ct/4166">Royal Talens Ecoline</a> is the best watercolor brush pen for art. Its soft felt tip puts down swaths of bright, juicy color with each stroke. This softness means that it takes some practice to learn how to control the Ecoline, but it makes such wonderful lines that it’s worth it for this excellent watercolor brush pen. The Ecoline contains highly <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Watercolor-Brush-Pens/pt/952">water-soluble ink</a> that blends easily and can continue to be layered and blended after it dries. We recommend pairing the Ecoline with thick <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Watercolor-Supplies/ct/2941?&amp;f=ca1f8d859dd3bdb2">watercolor paper</a> because heavy applications of ink can bleed through thinner papers.

							If you need a vibrant colored pen for drawing and coloring, you’ll want to check out the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Stabilo-Point-88-Fineliner-Pens/ct/1236">Stabilo Point 88</a>. This fineliner has a 0.4 mm tip that’s great for creating fine outlines and filling in details with bright, even color. It comes in over fifty hues and shades, and it even works well for journaling and taking color-coded notes. Its water-based ink is specially formulated to resist drying out when left uncapped, so it won’t dry out while you’re thinking about what to do next. Make sure you cap your pens for extended breaks, though—it’s the best way to make sure your writing instruments last as long as possible.
							</p><p>If you want to fill in big areas with color quickly, try the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Stabilo-Pen-68-Markers/ct/3600">Stabilo Pen 68</a>, which has a bold bullet tip. A <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Stabilo-Pen-68-Brush-Markers/ct/6125">brush pen version</a> is also available.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>We also want to shine a spotlight on <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Clickart-Knock-Sign-Pens/ct/5823">Zebra Clickart Knock Sign Pens</a>, which have convenient retractable tips. They don’t come in as many colors as the Stabilo Point 88, but all artists and doodlers can appreciate the variety they offer.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-One-Gel-Pens-Standard/ct/6100">Uni-ball One</a> might look simple, but it’s hands down the best gel pen for coloring. Its fast-drying, bleed-resistant ink is specially formulated with large pigment particles that stay on the surface of the paper instead of getting absorbed into the fibers. Dark inks look darker and bright inks look brighter, so your <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Coloring-Books/ct/3582">coloring books</a> will be packed with vibrant art. It comes in tons of different colors as well as three tip sizes, all of which are smooth to draw with. Its simple white barrel is accented by a detail near the clicker, which lets you know exactly what color is inside.
							</p><p>Fans of the Sarasa—another popular colored gel pen—can take a look at the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-R-Gel-Pens/ct/6253">Zebra Sarasa R</a>. Its ink has 27% more color density than standard Sarasa ink, so colors are more saturated.</p></div>

							If you want a simple effect that still grabs your attention, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Hybrid-Mattehop-Gel-Pens/ct/7072">Pentel Hybrid Mattehop</a> is the best matte gel pen for art. It features an opaque ink that dries to a matte, plastic-like finish. Our JetPens team members especially liked the way that the Mattehop performed on glossy papers, like those found in yearbooks. It even shows up on dark papers, so you can write over backgrounds without worry. However, we found that the gel pen does take a while to dry, so be careful not to smudge your writing.

						<p><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Sakura-Gelly-Roll-A-Comprehensive-Guide/pt/858">Sakura Gelly Roll Gel Pens</a> are beloved for their incredible ink effects, so it’s no wonder that we recommend the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Gelly-Roll-Stardust-Gel-Pens/ct/443">Stardust version</a> as our favorite glitter gel pen. Its ink is infused with glitter particles that twinkle when they catch the light. And like other Gelly Roll Gel Pens, the Stardust uses pigment-based, archival, waterproof, and fade-resistant. The ink shows up on dark paper, though we had better results with the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Gelly-Roll-Stardust-Gel-Pens/ct/443?&amp;f=761ee49294642dc6cd5fbcfbc64dc408">1.0 mm</a> tip size.

							Using the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Hybrid-Dual-Metallic-Gel-Pens/ct/4269">Pentel Hybrid Dual Metallic</a> is a fun way to add embellishments to holiday cards and art projects.

With its bold 1.0 mm tip, it feels buttery smooth and puts down a luscious line with every stroke.
							</p><p>The ink shows up well on both light- and dark-colored papers, making it suitable for paper crafts and fancy notes. Just be sure to give your writing plenty of time to dry.</p>

							Just like its glittery cousin, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Gelly-Roll-Moonlight-Gel-Pens/ct/510">Sakura Gelly Roll Moonlight</a> is packed with opaque ink that makes it the best pastel gel pen for art. It comes in three tip sizes, all of which put down smooth lines that stand out on light and dark papers. The water-based ink is archival quality, so you can rest assured that your projects won’t deteriorate over time.
							</p><p>We also want to recommend the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Souffle-Gel-Pens/ct/445">Sakura Souffle</a>, which has a unique ink with a three-dimensional effect! This finish isn’t as noticeable on porous surfaces like paper, so we recommend saving the Souffle for photos and glossy cards.</p>
							<p>For a brush pen option, try the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Milky-Brush-Pens/ct/6696">Pentel Milky</a>. You can use it to create lettering with line variation, or to quickly fill in large areas with ink. </p>
