            Engineers at NASA have successfully fired up a set of thrusters Voyager 1 hasn’t used in decades to solve an issue that could keep the 47-year-old spacecraft from communicating with Earth from billions of miles away.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000d356kk0lnlkhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            When Voyager 1 lifted off to space on September 5, 1977, no one expected that the probe would still be operating today.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000e356kk0xumxdq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            As a result of its exceptionally long-lived mission, Voyager 1 experiences issues as its parts age in the frigid outer reaches beyond our solar system. When an issue crops up, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, have to get creative while still being careful of how the spacecraft will react to any changes.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000f356k61svp3tj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Currently the farthest spacecraft from Earth, Voyager 1 is about 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) away. The probe operates beyond the heliosphere — the sun’s bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond Pluto’s orbit — where its instruments directly sample interstellar space.
    </p>

            Earlier this year, engineers spotted an issue when the fuel tube inside one of Voyager’s thrusters became clogged. If the thrusters are clogged, they can’t generate as much force to keep the spacecraft steady. Voyager’s thrusters keep the spacecraft oriented in a way that it can communicate with Earth.
    </p>

            If Voyager 1 isn’t positioned in such a way so that its antenna is pointed at Earth, the spacecraft can’t “hear” commands from mission control or send back data, according to Calla Cofield, media relations specialist at JPL.

            “If the thrusters that keep the antenna pointed at Earth get clogged, that would be end of mission,” she said.</p><p>  The team realized it would have to send commands to the spacecraft to switch to another set of thrusters, but the fix wouldn’t be a simple one.

            It’s not the first time Voyager 1 has needed to switch over to another set of thrusters in recent decades. Fortunately, the spacecraft has three sets of thrusters: two sets of attitude propulsion thrusters and one set devoted to trajectory correction maneuvers.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000k356k2ihwj82m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Voyager 1 used the thrusters for a variety of purposes as it flew by planets such as Jupiter and Saturn in 1979 and 1980, respectively.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000l356kilhsekhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Now, the spacecraft is traveling on an unchanging path away from our solar system, so it just requires one set of thrusters to help keep its antenna pointed at Earth. To fuel the thrusters, liquid hydrazine is converted into gas and released in about 40 short puffs per day to keep Voyager 1 oriented correctly.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000m356kp8f1xm22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Over time, engineers discovered that a fuel tube inside the thrusters can become clogged with silicon dioxide, a byproduct of the fuel tank’s rubber diaphragm aging. As the thrusters become clogged, they generate less force.
    </p>

  


    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000n356k826xmu5q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            In 2002, the team commanded Voyager 1 to switch to its second set of attitude propulsion thrusters when the first set showed signs of clogging. Engineers switched again to the trajectory correction thruster set in 2018 when the second set also appeared clogged.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000o356koea4hpa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            But when the team recently checked on the status of Voyager’s trajectory correction thrusters, they were even more clogged than the previous two sets of thrusters.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000p356k0jccl6ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            When the team initially switched Voyager over to the trajectory correction thrusters six years ago, the tube opening was 0.01 inches (0.25 millimeters) across. But now, clogging has reduced it to 0.0015 inches (0.035 millimeters) — half the width of a human hair, according to NASA.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000q356ks4r6q5j7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            It was time to rotate back to another set of attitude propulsion thrusters.
    </p>

  

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000r356k86e0x3zs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            As Voyager 1 and its twin probe, Voyager 2, have aged, the mission team has slowly turned off nonessential systems on both spacecraft to conserve power, including heaters. As a result, components on Voyager 1 are colder now, and the team knew it couldn’t just send a command to Voyager 1 to switch immediately to one of the attitude propulsion thrusters without doing something to warm them up.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000s356kqzxsz9pb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            But Voyager 1 doesn’t have enough power to switch any heaters back on without turning something else off, and its scientific instruments are too valuable to shut off in case they don’t come back on, the team said.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000t356ka4b80mki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            After going back to the drawing board, the team realized it could shut off one of the spacecraft’s main heaters for about an hour, which would enable engineers to turn on the thruster heaters and safely make the switch.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000u356k0gxerimf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            This plan worked, and by August 27, Voyager 1 was back to relying on one of its original thruster sets to stay in touch with Earth.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000v356kf29yd0b2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The team has taken steps to use the thrusters less, and it is expecting to get another two to three years out of the original set, said Todd Barber, Voyager propulsion engineer.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000w356ks4pq4lsm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Once the spacecraft has exhausted this thruster set, Voyager 1’s remaining option is the other already clogged set of attitude propulsion thrusters.
    </p>

            “All the decisions we will have to make going forward are going to require a lot more analysis and caution than they once did,” said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager’s project manager, in a statement.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm15hvs9u000y356k31p1ashf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Voyager 2 has also gone through thruster swaps in 1999 and 2019, and “the situation there is less dire,” Barber said. Voyager 2 has traveled more than 12 billion miles (20 billion kilometers) from Earth.
    </p>

            The information collected by these long-lived probes is helping scientists learn about the cometlike shape of the heliosphere and how it protects Earth from energized particles and radiation in interstellar space.

<p>This post has a little bit of everything. Hardware diagnostics, some suspiciously similar datasheets from two separate Taiwan chip manufacturers, and firmware reverse engineering. Read on if that sounds like fun!</p>



<p>Lately, I’ve been enjoying watching random electronics repair channels on YouTube. There’s something oddly satisfying about watching someone take a broken device from totally nonfunctional to perfectly working, all by replacing a $0.05 capacitor that has failed shorted or maybe a blown $0.75 IC. Two of my favorite channels about this topic are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BuyitFixit" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/@BuyitFixit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy it Fix it</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StezStixFix" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/@StezStixFix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StezStix Fix?</a>.</p>



<p>The videos inspired me. I thought, “I should totally try this!” So I went on eBay and looked for broken devices. I have a pretty decent understanding of how video encoders and decoders work, so I thought it would be a fun project to try to fix an HDMI capture card. I found a broken Elgato Game Capture HD60 S USB 3.0 device. The listing said that nothing happened when you plugged it in.</p>

<p>When it arrived, I was able to verify exactly what the listing said. Nothing showed up on my computer when I plugged it in. I cracked it open and had a look at what was happening internally when it powered up. I started by poking around at voltages on the board with it plugged in, and it was pretty obvious that something was dragging the power rails down. Little did I know at that point what I was getting myself into.</p>



<p>Honestly I could tell what was getting hot just by feeling around with my finger, but this was a good excuse to use my thermal camera to take some fun pictures.</p>

<p>In this one, the red cursor indicating the hottest point in the image is pointing to a small chip in the upper-left corner of the board marked “fiVJVE”.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="243" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE-300x243.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE-300x243.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE-1024x830.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE-768x623.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fiVJVE.jpg 1332w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure>



<p>This was pretty clearly some kind of a switching regulator, which I concluded due to its proximity to the “2R2” inductor (meaning 2.2 uH). Measuring the pins, I could see 5V going in, but obviously something was wrong because the voltage at the inductor (the output) was far too low.</p>



<p>There was also another fiVJVE chip on the board, with a pretty much identical circuit next to another 2.2 uH inductor. The circuit was missing a component, but I was pretty sure it was normal because the solder blobs looked like they came that way from the factory. It wasn’t getting hot, but it was also putting out a low voltage so I suspected something was wrong with it too:</p>

<p>In the heat image above you can see another area on the board (near the bottom) that was also getting hot. It turns out it was actually originating from the other side:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="320" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot2.jpg 240w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot2-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"></a></figure>



<p>Yeah, that’s my finger in the picture. It helped adjust the levels in the image so the chip that’s getting hot is easier to pinpoint. This chip was labeled PFNI:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PFNI.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="216" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PFNI-300x216.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PFNI-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PFNI-768x554.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PFNI.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure>



<p>OK, so what could I do with this information? I found two chips that were getting hot, and another chip that likely wasn’t putting out its correct voltage. I started out by trying to identify what they were. Small chips with markings like this can be quite difficult to figure out. Luckily, there are a few SMD marking code search engines out there. Searching <a href="https://smd.yooneed.one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smd.yooneed.one</a> for fiVJ didn’t result in any exact matches, but it did point out that the code “fi” went with the Fitipower FP6121-IS9P. This led me to <a href="https://www.fitipower.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fitipower’s website</a>, where I saw they had a bunch of different chips. Using Google’s help I was eventually able to narrow it down to being the FP6373A.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="725" height="315" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png 725w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-300x130.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px"></a></figure>



<p>The pinout made sense on the board, and the fiV marking also matched. Yay! Now I had an idea what I was looking for. The PFNI chip ended up being even easier to identify. Google led me straight to the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TPS60403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TI TPS60403DBV voltage inverter</a>:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="331" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png 678w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px"></a></figure>



<p>One thing in common with all of these chips is they were all taking in 5V for their input and I was measuring that their outputs all had a pretty low resistance to ground. I started wondering if maybe someone fried this device by somehow putting more than 5V into it. How they did that, I have no idea.</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure why the other FP6373A regulator wasn’t getting hot. It wasn’t putting out much voltage and nothing else was getting hot on the board, so I decided to try injecting voltage on its output power rail instead to see where the low resistance was coming from. I could deduce its correct output voltage because it was going to a Winbond W25Q32JVSSIQ SPI flash chip rated for 2.7 to 3.6V. I was pretty sure it was on a 3.3V rail. I soldered wires to the regulator’s output and ground and used my bench power supply to inject 2.7V into the circuit with a small controlled current that I could slowly turn up. The idea was that I could find what was getting hot on the board and determine what to blame for this power rail being bad.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/powerinjection.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="549" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/powerinjection.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/powerinjection.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/powerinjection-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/powerinjection-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>This process pretty quickly revealed the FP6373A itself as the root problem.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="320" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot3.jpg 240w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hot3-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"></a></figure>



<p>I think maybe during normal operation when it was being supplied with 5V, it was putting itself into some kind of safety shutdown mode and killing its output power rail. The datasheet does mention overcurrent and overtemperature shutdown capability. When I injected voltage directly, the regulator couldn’t shut off the power rail so it had no choice but to get hot and announce “hey, I’m the problem!” through my thermal camera.</p>



<p>This was actually great. I wasn’t totally confident about whether the TI chip was to blame rather than something downstream of it, but since two other chips on the 5V rail were also fried, I thought a good first step would be to replace all three of them and see what would happen. Unfortunately the FP6373A isn’t available at the usual US distributors, but I was able to find it for sale on <a href="https://www.lcsc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LCSC</a> at $0.17 a pop, and the TI chip was conveniently also available there for $0.58. Would it really be this easy? Just replace three chips totaling less than a dollar in value, even in quantities of 1? The shipping and handling was orders of magnitude more expensive than just the parts themselves!</p>



<p>After the parts arrived from China, I was able to successfully replace them. I’m always paranoid about upsetting nearby resistors and capacitors when I’m using hot air, so I like to use Kapton tape to shield everything else.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="619" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal-1024x619.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal-1024x619.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal-300x181.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal-768x465.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/removal.jpg 1339w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>The process of soldering in the new chips was mostly easy, but the ground pins did soak up quite a bit of heat. I think this PCB design doesn’t have great thermal relief on the grounds. I did accidentally lift a pad for one of the regulators, but it wasn’t connected to anything (the “PG” signal) so there was no harm done. The fact that it wasn’t connected to anything was exactly why it was so easy to lift it. Also, the heat that the ground pin was eating up misled me into thinking I could use the same heat on the other pins.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldered.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="643" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldered.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldered.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldered-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldered-768x482.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>In addition to my lifted pad (middle pin on the right), you can see here how much trouble I had soldering the ground pin (middle pin on the left). It really didn’t want to heat up. I probably could have heated the whole board to help my soldering iron out, but hey, it’s connected.</p>



<p>Anyway, after replacing all three chips, it worked! None of the new chips were getting hot, the HD60 S showed up as a USB device when plugged in, and it worked perfectly for capturing and passing through an HDMI signal. I was pretty excited to successfully fix it, but there was still a problem: none of the indicator lights worked. There are seven white LEDs and seven red LEDs, and they are supposed to <a href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058716852-Elgato-Game-Capture-HD60-S-Status-Lights-LEDs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do various things to tell you what’s going on</a>. The white lights are supposed to blink twice when you first plug it in, for example.</p>



<p>This was a little deflating. I had kind of fixed it, but not really. Now what?</p>



<p>Back to the drawing board. I looked closer at the PCB to understand how the LEDs work. The relevant chip is the IT1504, made by <a href="https://www.innochip.com.tw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Innochip</a>. Looking further at <a href="http://www.innochip.com.tw/datasheet/IT1504.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its datasheet</a>, it is a 16-channel LED driver chip. You talk to it with a serial data interface that appears to be very similar to SPI. It turns out a lot of LED driver chips from many manufacturers such as Toshiba and ST also use this same communication scheme. At first I though it was odd, but it seems pretty standard. It’s a variant of SPI where you send a particular number of clock pulses to choose which command you want to perform.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504probe.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="556" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504probe.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504probe.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504probe-300x163.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504probe-768x417.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I monitored the relevant data input pins on the IT1504 using my oscilloscope, and I could definitely see some traffic being sent to it. By the way, I followed the traces and discovered that the IT1504 is being controlled by a Nuvoton M031LD2AE microcontroller, which is an ARM Cortex-M0.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nuvoton.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nuvoton-300x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nuvoton-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nuvoton-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nuvoton.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure>



<p>The presence of SPI traffic here proved it was at least trying to do <em>something</em>, so I assumed that the LED driver chip was probably fried. That presented a pretty big problem though: how could I find a replacement for the IT1504? It wasn’t stocked anywhere. LCSC didn’t have it, and of course none of the US distributors had it either. I couldn’t even find any sellers on AliExpress or utsource.</p>



<p>I reached out to Innotech, who surprisingly wrote back the next day and kindly offered to send me a few free samples for the price of shipping, but then realized they only have full reels in stock so they couldn’t send me any samples. That was nice of them to check, but I definitely wasn’t going to buy a full reel of IT1504 chips just to fix this one problem.</p>



<p>This pushed me toward a huge search all over the internet for LED drivers to try to find a suitable equivalent replacement. The IT1504 datasheet I had access to didn’t include the full command info, so I wasn’t sure exactly what I was looking for. There were several discontinued parts from other well-known manufacturers that looked similar, but I wasn’t finding any exact matches. That’s when I discovered something really strange.</p>



<p>I somehow stumbled upon <a href="https://www.mblock.com.tw/en" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.mblock.com.tw/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macroblock</a>‘s product offerings. Specifically, the MBI5040. The datasheet seemed to match up pretty well with the IT1504. In fact, a little too well. Here is an example of what I mean (click if you want it larger so you can read it):</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="357" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2-1024x357.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2-1024x357.png 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2-300x105.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2-768x268.png 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png 1278w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Here are a few more side-by-side comparisons to really hit the point home:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="992" height="1024" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3-992x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3-992x1024.png 992w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3-291x300.png 291w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3-768x793.png 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png 1302w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px"></a></figure>



<p>They’re almost exactly the same! Everything is laid out in precisely the same order. The current output specs differ slightly, but aside from that, they’re the exact same product, right down to having identical block diagrams. The wording has been tweaked here and there, but both of these datasheets are clearly from the same source. These companies are both based in Taiwan. Maybe one of them licensed the design from the other? Or perhaps there is some industrial espionage going on? There is definitely some funky stuff going on with the fonts on the Innochip datasheet’s general description page. It randomly switches around between serif and sans-serif. It’s the kind of thing you notice when you’re reading an email that somebody sent and you can tell they’ve obviously been copying and pasting while writing it. That doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but I thought it was weird.</p>



<p>Heck, even the part numbers are pretty much the same. If you pretend that the capital letter “I” in MBI5040 is really the number 1, you have MB<strong>1504</strong>0 and IT<strong>1504</strong>.</p>



<p>I have no idea which product is the original here, but either way, this was really good news for me. I had successfully discovered another chip that would likely be suitable as a replacement for my assumed-to-be-fried IT1504. Additionally, the MBI5040 datasheet actually had command info, so if it came down to it, I could dive deeper and really try to understand what the SPI traffic was doing. I was able to find the MBI5040GF available for purchase on both AliExpress and utsource, so I bought a few.</p>



<p>Replacing the LED driver chip was a pretty simple job. Once again I used Kapton tape to protect me from myself.</p>

<p>I was feeling pretty good about my situation at this point. I cleaned up all the flux residue and anxiously plugged in the HD60 S to my computer.</p>



<p>Video capture worked fine, so I didn’t make it any worse, but the lights were still not working! What in the world? Next I started wondering if perhaps the LEDs themselves were broken. I rigged up my bench power supply and a resistor so that I could pass current through them (without the whole device powered on, of course), and the LEDs all tested out fine physically. I was able to light each one up.</p>



<p>I was totally out of ideas at this point. A brand new chip didn’t fix it, and the LEDs were known good. That’s when I started searching on Google and found something shocking: apparently the LEDs going out on these Elgato HD60 S capture cards is a known problem that multiple people have experienced. In particular I found two different Reddit posts with four unique users complaining about running into this same problem:</p>

</ul>



<p>Not only that, but sometime during this whole saga I also bought another “dead” HD60 S on eBay that turned out to work fine but had the exact same LED fault. It was starting to look like this indicator light failure was actually quite common!</p>



<p>So yeah. It’s very likely that the LEDs on this one weren’t working even before the voltage regulators originally got fried. This led me to a new bonus challenge: Could I figure out why the LEDs didn’t work and fix them? After all, I now had two different units both experiencing this failure and I knew of at least four other people with the same problem. If you go to the parent post at the second link above, there’s a video that shows how the white LEDs are expected to flash white twice when you first plug it in.</p>



<p>My first idea was to verify that the actual LED circuitry on the board was functional. To perform this test, I lifted the relevant SPI input pins on my replacement MBI5040 LED driver and soldered wires to them, as well as ground:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/solderedwires1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1021" height="779" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/solderedwires1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/solderedwires1.jpg 1021w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/solderedwires1-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/solderedwires1-768x586.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px"></a></figure>



<p>This allowed me to rig something up with a Raspberry Pi Pico to manually control the LEDs by sending the appropriate commands as documented in the MBI5040 datasheet. I’ll let this picture speak for itself:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/litup.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="617" height="1024" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/litup.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/litup.jpg 617w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/litup-181x300.jpg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px"></a></figure>



<p>It was at this point that I became very confident there was nothing physically wrong with my repaired HD60 S at all. I could perfectly control the lights with my Pi Pico, so the circuit was fine. The Nuvoton Cortex-M0 microcontroller was simply never deciding to turn them on.</p>



<p>This whole MBI5040 replacement story was all for nothing! I was so proud of myself for finding a suitable substitute IC, but it was all mostly just a big waste of time. The original chip was probably fine all along. I decided to confirm that theory just to be sure. I put the original IT1504 chip back onto the board. In order to avoid having to bend pins, I covered the 3 pads that I wanted to avoid soldering to the chip with Kapton tape. This kept them insulated, and then I just soldered all of the other pins normally.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Then I resoldered the wires and repeated the experiment with the Pi Pico. No surprises here — the original chip was totally fine too. After I was done tinkering, I simply pulled the Kapton tape out and then was able to solder the remaining 3 pins normally. I thought this solution was pretty clever and saved me some time! Here’s a view after I pulled out the tape, but before I soldered them down.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="276" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered2.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered2-300x81.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/it1504resoldered2-768x207.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>And yes, I know pin 1 looks messy. Once again, it’s a ground pin and I guess they didn’t add thermals on the ground pins on this board. It was a pain to solder. I fixed it up afterward though.</p>



<p>So yeah. The original IT1504 chip worked fine. I was a little annoyed, but this side quest wasn’t entirely a waste of time. Getting ahold of the MBI5040 datasheet importantly gave me a perfect reference for how the LEDs are controlled by software. It was looking more and more like this was a software problem as opposed to a hardware problem. I was invested in this problem at this point. I couldn’t give up now!</p>



<p>I began the next phase of this project with a simple idea: ask Elgato if there is some kind of known issue with the status lights. Maybe there was a setting I was missing that allowed you to disable them. Essentially, they politely told me to take a hike:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-9.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="668" height="180" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-9.png 668w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-9-300x81.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px"></a></figure>



<p>That’s okay. I felt like solving it on my own anyway. I decided to focus on understanding what was going on in the firmware running in the Nuvoton M031LD2AE microcontroller. By a stroke of pure luck, I had <a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2023/09/porting-my-mac-rom-simm-programmer-from-avr-to-arm/" data-type="post" data-id="3566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gained some experience last year with Nuvoton MCUs when working on my Mac ROM SIMM programmer</a>. I already had a <a href="https://www.nuvoton.com/tool-and-software/debugger-and-programmer/1-to-1-debugger-and-programmer/nu-link2-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nu-Link2-Me</a> that was bundled with the dev board I bought for that project. The next step was to figure out how to access the programming pins on the microcontroller. It turns out that there are a couple of small JST connectors on the board: a 4-pin one and a 6-pin one. Tracing out the pins one by one, it quickly became apparent that the 4-pin JST connector was for programming the MCU! I hooked it up using the only 4-pin JST cable I had on hand, which had grabbers on the other end.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nulink.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="643" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nulink.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nulink.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nulink-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nulink-768x482.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I didn’t check, but I think it’s a pretty good educated guess that the 6-pin JST connector next to it is for programming the Altera MAX II CPLD that is also on this board. It just makes sense.</p>



<p>I didn’t care about the CPLD though. I tried to read the firmware out of the Nuvoton chip using NuMicro ICP Programming Tool, but of course Elgato protected the contents:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="304" height="180" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png 304w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px"></a></figure>



<p>Never fear, though. It turns out that Elgato includes the latest firmware with their 4K Capture Utility:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="878" height="651" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5.png 878w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5-300x222.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5-768x569.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></a></figure>



<p>Reading the included ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json file in the same folder also provided some insight. This firmware is specifically for the version of the device with USB product ID 118 (0x0076), which definitely matches mine. Elgato refers to this device as the “Game Capture HD60 S Rev.4”:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="355" height="464" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-6.png 355w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-6-230x300.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></a></figure>



<p>The firmware was already up to date when I checked in the 4K Capture Utility. You can also control-click the settings icon to enable an Update Firmware button, but it did nothing because the newest firmware was already installed on it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-7.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="748" height="530" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-7.png 748w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-7-300x213.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></a></figure>



<p>This was great though! The FW_HD60_S_MCU.bin file looked very much like a normal Cortex-M0 firmware binary. You can tell by looking at the start of it in a hex editor. The very first 4-byte word should be the initial stack pointer, so something in RAM. Then following that is a bunch of interrupt vectors including the reset vector.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="622" height="262" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png 622w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"></a></figure>



<p>This all checked out. 0x20000E70 looks like a valid stack pointer, and each 4-byte word following that looks like a valid flash address. It looks exactly like a Cortex-M0 vector table. I loaded it into <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghidra</a> and also used <a href="https://github.com/leveldown-security/SVD-Loader-Ghidra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SVD-Loader</a> to try to map out some of the registers. I had to modify the SVD file (M031AE_v1.svd), which I got from the <a href="https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/numicro_dfp-nuvoton/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NuMicro_DFP pack on keil.arm.com</a>, to get it to load with the plugin. Apparently it doesn’t like if you have multiple addressBlocks per peripheral, so I modified the first one in each peripheral to contain the full range of addresses.</p>



<p>And thus began the humongous effort of trying to figure out what this little MCU was actually doing.</p>



<p>The SVD file helped me identify the various peripherals being used: mostly GPIO, a timer, and I<sup>2</sup>C. <a href="https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/M031BSP/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuvoton’s M031BSP project</a> was very valuable for identifying a ton of functions. I did it by hand, which was probably slightly insane, but I wasn’t sure what compiler had been used. Since I knew which pins were hooked up to the LED controller chip, I was fairly quickly able to identify functions that control the LEDs. It was hard to understand their purpose in the grand scheme of things though. Sometimes they were buried deep inside multiple layers of function calls.</p>



<p>Knowing that I<sup>2</sup>C was being used was very helpful, because I saw there were other chips onboard that would communicate through it: the ITE IT6802E and IT66121FN. The IT6802E is an HDMI receiver. I don’t have any detailed documentation for it, but I’m pretty sure it converts an incoming HDMI signal into a parallel data stream suitable for the capture portion of the device to read in. The IT66121FN is the opposite. It takes a parallel data stream and sends it out as HDMI. This would be necessary for the passthrough functionality, providing an HDMI output signal to go through to your TV or monitor.</p>



<p>Anyway, I found some ITE driver code in some random GitHub projects <a href="https://github.com/densengithub/DB_C10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as this one</a>, which quickly helped me identify a bunch of functions and variables as belonging to ITE’s drivers. This helped me gain a better understanding of what was happening in the firmware. I actually spent way too much time on this, but I think it was useful in the long run. Plus, it was good practice with Ghidra.</p>



<p>Once I had a good idea of the overall structure of the firmware, I decided to try figuring out how I could debug the code. The chip was protected, but I figured that I should be able to erase it and reflash the firmware. To be safe, I desoldered the original M031LD2AE chip and put a new empty one onto my board instead. They only cost $1.14 on Digi-Key in quantities of 1. Why not?</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldernuvoton.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldernuvoton.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldernuvoton.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldernuvoton-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/soldernuvoton-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>When I flashed FW_HD60_S_MCU.bin onto my brand-new blank chip, it definitely worked fine, but it re-protected itself so I couldn’t do any debugging! The offending code was pretty easy to find in Ghidra. There’s a function that is called to update the config registers with the proper locked state as well as the number of 512-byte data flash pages to reserve from the application ROM.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-10.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="669" height="835" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-10.png 669w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-10-240x300.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"></a></figure>



<p>I simply had to hack this function to always leave the chip unlocked. Then I reflashed the chip and I was finally able to debug the code! I inserted some breakpoints and stepped through the initialization code with OpenOCD and GDB to figure out why the LEDs weren’t being controlled. I found some places in the code where LED control would happen, but they were being skipped. I decided to force the code to run by filling in register values and RAM in GDB, and sure enough, I was able to at least force the lights to turn on. So clearly the code was there to control the lights, but it wasn’t running for whatever reason.</p>



<p>This chip unlocking mess led me down another rabbit hole. I assumed that the original Nuvoton MCU I removed had some other protected contents like a bootloader, so I decided to see if I could extract it by installing my new unlocked firmware file as an update through Elgato’s software. The idea was that after my new unlocked firmware was installed, the protection would be disabled and then I could read out the entire contents with my Nu-Link2-Me. Why would I want to do this? Well, it would just be nice to have as a backup in case I screwed up one of the chips, plus the bootloader might contain other clues.</p>



<p>I tried it out on my <em>other</em> HD60 S with broken LEDs which still had its stock Nuvoton MCU fitted. This required modifying ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json to point to my unlocked firmware. I also had to change the version listed in this same file so that it would think it was out of date. After making these changes, the 4K Capture Utility allowed to install my new firmware through the normal firmware update mechanism. The utility did tell me the firmware update failed after it finished (more on that later).</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="552" height="190" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update3.png 552w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update3-300x103.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px"></a></figure>



<p>This totally freaked me out because it appeared to brick the device. It didn’t work as a capture card anymore. But luckily, but I was left with an unlocked chip, just as I had hoped! This allowed me to read out the rest of the content of the flash that had previously been protected, including the LDROM (containing Elgato’s first-stage bootloader), data flash contents, and the correct original config register contents. This was <strong>really</strong> exciting because it meant I now had everything I would need in order to completely program a brand new Nuvoton MCU to contain Elgato’s stock firmware, including their bootloader. I rewrote the original Elgato firmware back to this second HD60 S’s APROM (application ROM) using Nuvoton’s tools, and re-locked the chip. Thankfully, this fully restored it to working order — except for the LEDs of course.</p>



<p>I also disassembled their small LDROM bootloader that I was able to read out of the chip, but it wasn’t really anything exciting. It receives commands and data over I<sup>2</sup>C and is capable of reflashing the APROM. Interestingly I discovered that if the chip is set for unprotected mode, the bootloader actually waits around for update commands instead of booting the application firmware. So Elgato is using the locked/unlocked bit as a way of signifying whether it should stay in the bootloader or not, which I find to be a little bit weird. That completely explained why my second HD60 S stopped working after I installed my unlocked firmware — it was stuck in the bootloader waiting forever because the chip was unprotected.</p>



<p>Anyway, I’ve really started to ramble on about things unrelated to the LED problem. Let’s get back on track. The point I’m trying to make here is that I was able to read out all of the stock microcontroller contents, which gave me the confidence I desperately needed in order to start tinkering even further to figure out the LED problem. I was kind of stuck at this point though. Why was the Nuvoton chip not controlling the LEDs? Some of the LED control happened over I<sup>2</sup>C from something else, so I was beginning to worry that the actual problem was once again at a different level.</p>



<p>Fortunately though, I was gaining a better understanding of the architecture of the entire product at this point. Here’s a broad overview of how it works:</p>



<ul>
<li>The main Cypress/Infineon CYUSB3014 USB 3.0 peripheral chip, which I haven’t mentioned until now, is an ARM926EJ-S. It sends commands to the Nuvoton MCU over I<sup>2</sup>C. This is the chip that actually communicates with the host PC through the USB 3.0 port.</li>



<li>The Nuvoton ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller sets up and monitors the ITE video receiver and transmitter chips through a separate I<sup>2</sup>C bus.</li>



<li>The Nuvoton MCU also controls the LEDs.</li>



<li>The Nuvoton MCU communicates status information back to the CYUSB3014 through I<sup>2</sup>C.</li>



<li>The CYUSB3014 receives the video data stream from the IT6802E (likely through the MAX II CPLD, putting it in a format suitable for the CYUSB3014 to grab) and sends it to the computer over USB.</li>
</ul>



<p>I thought I would take a break from the Nuvoton chip for a while and start trying to understand the main Cypress processor instead. Yes, as I just mentioned above, there are two different ARM processors working together to implement the video capture functionality. Fortunately, Cypress/Infineon also provides a free SDK for these USB chips. The firmware is stored unprotected in the Winbond W25Q32JVSSIQ flash chip that I talked about very early on when I thought this was purely going to be a hardware repair project.</p>

<p>I desoldered the SPI flash chip and read it back using a programmer. It’s a 4 MB (32-megabit) chip. I also tried to do it in-circuit without removing the chip first, but I didn’t have any luck. I even accidentally knocked a small 0402 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor (seen above on the right) off the PCB while I was trying to clip onto it. Luckily the capacitor wasn’t damaged and I was able to put it right back on.</p>



<p>After dumping the chip contents, I used it to start trying to work my way through understanding what the CYUSB3014 was doing. I was able to use Cypress’s existing SDK binaries to help identify a lot of the functions in the dump. It turns out that the Cypress SDK uses the ThreadX RTOS under the hood.</p>



<p>I really didn’t want to dive deep into this firmware to the same level that I did for the Nuvoton chip though. I was already worn out from that disassembly. At the very least, I was able to see that the Cypress chip sends commands over I<sup>2</sup>C to the Nuvoton chip.</p>



<p>Looking through the rest of the SPI flash dump, I could see that starting at offset 0x300000, there were a bunch of small data chunks that looked like little pictures. Here’s an example:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-11.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="620" height="478" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-11.png 620w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-11-300x231.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></a></figure>



<p>I couldn’t figure out why there would be little pictures in the flash chip here. What would the purpose be? It made me wonder if maybe it was some kind of small icon, since I’ve seen similar data for icons while analyzing old Mac ROM dumps. Given the context of this blog post, you might be screaming at me right now telling me what this data obviously is, but at the time I was totally oblivious.</p>



<p>I ended up solving this mystery as soon as I started looking into what was going on with five unknown GPIO pins in the firmware on the Nuvoton chip. There were a bunch of functions that controlled these pins, but I wasn’t sure what they did. I traced them out on the PCB and discovered they were going to a <a href="https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/PI5C3257.pdf">Diodes Incorporated PI5C3257 quad 2:1 mux/demux bus switch</a>.</p>



<p>This was the magic discovery that finally unblocked me. This bus switch is being used to decide whether the CYUSB3014 chip or the Nuvoton microcontroller should be wired up to the SPI flash chip. Prior to this moment, I thought that the SPI flash was entirely dedicated to the CYUSB3014. In reality, the Nuvoton microcontroller takes over control of the SPI flash after the CYUSB3014 has finished booting. This enabled me to disassemble a bunch of new functions which were all related to bit-banging SPI transactions, as well as higher-level functions for SPI flash chip erasing/reading/writing.</p>



<p>A light bulb went off in my head. Yes, these chunks of data in the flash chip <strong>were</strong> pictures! But not in the conventional sense. They were describing the various LED animations. Each set of 16 bytes is an animation frame written to the 14 LEDs. In the example above, a single red LED turns on and six of the seven white LEDs do stuff. The last two bytes in each row are a delay time before moving onto the next frame. The first 16 bytes looked kind of weird though. They looked like they possibly contained some header data for the animation or something.</p>



<p>I also found some code that was reading data from the start of the 0x300000 section, but in my SPI flash dump that section was pretty much completely empty:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-12.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="622" height="285" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-12.png 622w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-12-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"></a></figure>



<p>Everything was starting to make sense. There was a check in the Nuvoton MCU firmware to see if the first two bytes contained the 16-bit word value 0xAA55:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-17.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="636" height="287" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-17.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-17.png 636w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-17-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px"></a></figure>



<p>In my dumps of the SPI flash chip contents from my units with nonfunctional LEDs, that section of the chip was empty. It was programmed as all 0x00. The firmware was bypassing all of the LED control code because expected data wasn’t stored starting at 0x300000 in the flash chip! I confirmed this data was missing on both of the HD60 S devices I was testing with.</p>



<p>Unless I wanted to go overboard trying to figure out how to artificially populate all this data from scratch, I had no choice but to buy a third HD60 S that was confirmed to be fully functional. That’s what I ended up doing. Unfortunately it was an older revision and had a completely different PCB, but it was still based on the CYUSB3014. It also used a Nuvoton microcontroller, but it was a different model. It still had an IT1504 for LED control though, as well as a Winbond SPI flash chip, so that was promising.</p>



<p>I confirmed that its LEDs worked fine, and then I dumped the SPI flash. By this point, I had figured out how to dump the flash contents without any soldering by forcing the CYUSB3014 to boot over USB (removing a jumper on the board) and then uploading a Cypress-provided RAM bootloader capable of dumping the SPI flash (cyfxflashprog.img), but I don’t want to stray too far from the LED issue at this point. Here’s the start of the good data at 0x300000:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-13.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="621" height="463" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-13.png 621w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-13-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px"></a></figure>



<p>Okay, that data makes way more sense. The first 16-bit word (little-endian) is 0xAA55 just like the firmware was looking for. It also has a bunch of other header data, indicating there are 26 different LED animations, and including info about whether they are even animations at all. To be honest, I haven’t figured out what every piece of this data actually means, but each animation has a 16-byte summary. They start at 0x300008. I think the last 4 bytes for each animation are probably a CRC-32 of something.</p>



<p>Also, if you noticed in the original chip dump, there was a section starting at 0x3000B8 with a bunch of 0xE5 bytes. This is the dot correction data that gets loaded into the IT1504. Based on the decompilation above, it’s actually supposed to be at 0x3007F8, which is exactly where it is in the good dump:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-14.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="624" height="62" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-14.png 624w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-14-300x30.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"></a></figure>



<p>The 0x521114A7 that follows is a CRC-32 of the preceding 16 bytes of data.</p>



<p>Further inspection revealed that the data in the SPI flash of the broken devices differed quite a bit. In fact, they were different from each other as well. This led me to believe that the animation data was probably corrupted in them. For example, here’s what the animation at 0x31E000 looks like in the good HD60 S’s dump:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-15.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="621" height="541" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-15.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-15.png 621w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-15-300x261.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px"></a></figure>



<p>Notice how there is no weird header at the top like the original “picture” I was inspecting from one of the other dumps? It just immediately starts with animation data that is consistent with the rest of the nearby data. It’s also longer. This data makes a lot more sense. On the other hand, it was corrupted in two completely different ways in my two HD60 S devices with nonfunctional LEDs.</p>



<p>Several (but not all) of the animations in my nonworking devices started with a weird “AB 03 12 39” header. I don’t think the header is supposed to be there. Maybe there was a bug in an update procedure or something? The Nuvoton firmware indeed has functions capable of erasing and rewriting data to the SPI flash chip. I’m wondering if that code ended up running and somehow destroying the original contents.</p>



<p>You may be able to guess what I did with this new knowledge. I took the original SPI flash contents from the two devices with nonfunctional status lights, and simply replaced all the LED data starting at 0x300000 with the data from the working one. Then I flashed this new “hybrid” image to the non-working devices. Oh, I should point out that each device has its own unique flash dump. The USB serial number is embedded in there somewhere. So I preferred to preserve the data from 0 to 0x2FFFFF for each individual device.</p>



<p>I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect by trying this. The good SPI flash data came from an older revision of the product with a different Nuvoton microcontroller, but it sure looked like it matched what the newer firmware was looking for.</p>



<p>Here’s a picture of what I saw as soon as I powered one of the problematic devices after I reflashed its SPI flash chip:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success1.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>It freaking worked. The white lights flashed twice, and then the red lights briefly flashed once.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success2.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/success2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I think the red flash just means the signal was lost, because it also does it every single time I unplug an HDMI source from it. The older model doesn’t do this red flash on every powerup, but maybe it’s just a firmware difference about whether it should say “signal lost” immediately at startup with nothing plugged in. I’ve seen some mention online of red lights meaning that the signal is HDCP-protected, but I think that’s a different longer red blink which I’ve also seen when I first plug in my iPhone as an HDMI source.</p>



<p>I’ve also noticed that some of the animations that Elgato says it should do, like when I start or stop recording, don’t play on this newer model, even though they work fine with the older model. I haven’t been able to figure out if this is just a known difference with how the newer model works. I may try to get a good SPI flash dump of the correct LED animations from a newer matching model to confirm it for sure, but I have a feeling the animation data will be identical.</p>



<p>I also recently realized that the raw data for each animation is sitting around in C:\Program Files\Elgato\GameCapture\Animations if you have the older Game Capture utility installed, or /Applications/Game Capture HD.app/Contents/Resources/Animations on Mac.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-16.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="655" height="786" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-16.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-16.png 655w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-16-250x300.png 250w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px"></a></figure>



<p>Looking through each file (01.ani, 02.ani, etc.), it looks like the animation data perfectly matches my dump of the older working device. The bytes for each LED are out of order, but if I reorder them correctly, I can create an identical copy of all of the animation data that I extracted from the good flash chip.</p>



<p>Since those animations live inside the Game Capture app (or next to it), it seems as though the software has the capability to load them into the flash chip. I wonder if that explains how the stored animation data ended up corrupted in the first place. A botched update perhaps? That would make sense to me. Maybe they disabled the ability for their software to upload them after they discovered it was screwing up people’s devices? It might be interesting to disassemble the Windows and/or Mac software and try to figure out how to convince it to directly upload the animations, but I’m honestly out of motivation to do that at this point. It looks like LedCtrlDll.dll might be an interesting file to look at if anyone else is hooked enough to continue diving deeper. It contains classes with interesting names like Ub530LedSpiRom and I2cIO_Ub530. Some quick disassembly in Ghidra indeed shows it creating a 0x80C-byte array for the header data that would go into the flash chip at 0x300000, and populating the contents with the dot correction data.</p>



<p>One last thing I noticed is if I do a firmware update of the HD60 S inside of Elgato’s 4K Capture Utility in Windows, it doesn’t wait long enough. It seems to work fine on Mac, but Windows has some issues. The firmware update is still in progress when it tells me that it failed. If I sit there and wait, eventually the lights flash on the unit and it successfully reboots into the new firmware. If instead I unplug it quickly after Elgato’s software tells me the update failed, I end up with an incomplete flash. I wonder if this has fooled people into bricking their devices? Especially if the status LEDs don’t work at all. I was able to successfully fix this problem by increasing the updateDurationSec in ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json from 40 to 80. I get the feeling Elgato’s firmware update functionality is a little flaky, at least on Windows. In Elgato’s defense, <a href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027955132-Firmware-updates-and-Elgato-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they specifically recommend <em>not</em> to update firmware on the HD60 S unless their tech support tells you to</a>. And they hide the functionality behind a special key combination when entering the settings screen.</p>



<p>I would like to figure out a way to share how to easily fix the LEDs for anyone else who runs into this problem, but the process is admittedly quite convoluted. It requires you to begin a firmware update (modifying ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json to even allow you to install an update in the first place) and immediately unplug the device — otherwise the Nuvoton MCU takes control of the SPI flash, and you really need the Cypress chip to be in control in order to reflash its contents. Then, you remove the jumper on the PCB (instructing the Cypress chip to boot from USB), upload cyfxflashprog.img to RAM using download_fx3, and use a modified version of fx3_spitest to download the entire SPI flash contents and replace it with your patched LED section. Those are tools from the CYUSB3014 SDK. Finally, you unplug it, put the jumper back in, plug it back in, and perform a normal firmware update in 4K Capture Utility to restore the firmware back to the Nuvoton chip. You ignore the update failure message and wait another minute or so, and eventually it boots back up with working LEDs. If there ends up being enough interest in recovering these things, it might be possible for me to throw something together to automate the process, or at least provide binaries for everything. It would also be nice to figure out how to use Elgato’s software to directly reprogram the LED animations. For now though, I’m just going to sit back, relax, and celebrate my victory on this!</p>



<p>So in conclusion, yes, it really was that simple. All I needed to do was replace three chips for a total of less than $1 to bring this thing back to life. Every bit of extra time and money I spent on this project after that was all about figuring out a well-known indicator LED problem that really had nothing to do with my actual repair. I put way more effort into this than I should have, and yes I am probably a tiny bit crazy for actually doing this, but at least I now have an answer and fix for why the LEDs don’t work on some of these capture cards. It’s some sort of software/programming/update bug. I’m not sure which. Way to go Elgato!</p>

        <p>A discussion of why I don’t intend to turn Gwern.net into a book, and how trying to write a book can harm writers.</p>
        
      </div><div id="markdownBody">
        
        <p>Along with asking about doing podcasts, people sometimes ask me whether I am going to write a book or turn Gwern.net into a book. To their surprise, I have no such intention. Writing a book can be harmful; for many writers, writing a book is about the last thing they should do (unless they feel a book bursting out of them, much like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facehugger" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facehugger#bodyContent" title="Facehugger">facehugger</a>).</p>
        <p>But how can I not want to write a <em>book</em>? And I get it: writing a book is the ultimate achievement for Western intellectuals—better than being arrested in a protest (because you don’t have to get sweaty), better than a PhD (because not so devalued), and better even than going to Harvard (because that mostly means you got lucky in admissions). It’s something I’ve definitely aspired to since I became a bookworm, to join the pantheon of authors shelved in my local library, to be able to hold <em>my</em> book in my hands, and carp about how ‘the publisher chose the cover’.</p>

          <p>Yet, that’s the problem: I am in love with the idea of <em>having published</em> a book, but not with publishing <em>a specific book</em>. I want to have published a book and have the identity of ‘author’<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, in the same way one might want to have ‘learned to read Mandarin’ or ‘become a bodybuilder’, but not to actually sweat through memorizing (and then forgetting) endless arbitrary characters or hours in the gym (followed by gluttony as cruel as the starvation).</p>

          </div>
          <p>It is easy for someone like a book agent or editor to suggest “hey, you should publish a book!”, since they aren’t the one writing it, and they have plenty on their plate. But what book, exactly, would I publish? “Gwern.net”? Leaving aside all the fun hypertext features, what would such a book be? It would have to be some sort of anthology, I suppose; but what a mongrel of an anthology it would be, if I look over my past few essays: <a href="https://gwern.net/review/the-last-unicorn" id="gwern-review-the-last-unicorn" title="‘Review Of <em>The Last Unicorn</em>’, Gwern 2024">a review</a> of a children’s movie about unicorns, then the moral philosophy of <a href="https://gwern.net/review/timecrimes" id="gwern-review-timecrimes" title="‘<em>Timecrimes</em>: Time Travel In Hell’, Gwern 2023">self-consistent time travel</a>, then there’s the <a href="https://gwern.net/dropcap" id="gwern-dropcap" title="‘Dropcap Generation With AI’, Gwern 2023">detailed technical tutorial</a> about generating fonts with 2023 generative AI models… (The anthology would not be ordered chronologically, safe to say.)</p>
          <p>I don’t feel enthused about it; but to make a book I would not be ashamed of, I would have to spend many hours revising, rewriting, stripping out hypertext features and deciding what should stay, reformatting for some arcane publisher workflow like EPUB (or worse). This is true whether it’s a big professional publication or a small boutique style, like the <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/www.greaterwrong.com/d3da45f18dc2a83fb731c453083f757a0337331b.html" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.greaterwrong.com/d3da45f18dc2a83fb731c453083f757a0337331b.html" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/tag/lesswrong-books?sortedBy=new&amp;format=preview&amp;theme=classic" data-url-original="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/lesswrong-books?sortedBy=new" title="LessWrong Books">LessWrong anthologies</a>—which are nice indeed, but I recall Oliver Habryka ballparking the necessary total effort at in the hundreds of man-hours. (For already-written LW posts!) And while I was in the middle of that, if I wanted to write something else, well, now I would get to feel extra-guilty about procrastinating on The Book™. I definitely won’t have time or energy to follow up on weird anomalies or interesting new rabbit-holes, and even if my output appears unaffected by The Book™, I am in reality eating my intellectual seed-corn and gradually falling out of date, as I neglect the ordinary work of reading &amp; discussion that may flower years later. (Authors who write books have a distinct tendency to <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/public-intellectuals-have-short-shelf-lives-but-why/" data-link-icon="Ss" data-link-icon-type="text">‘go stale’</a>.)</p>
          <p>I finish all this, and then what? Now it has to spend months working its way through the pipeline, still a distraction, and then—<em>mirabile dictu!</em>—it is done.</p>
          <p>Uh oh—that’s just the start, isn’t it? Now I have to go out and shill for pre-orders (as we are endlessly assured by apologetic authors that pre-orders are about the only sales number that matters these days and <em>oh god if you ever liked my writing please pre-order and don’t wait until afterwards just think of it as a donation if you have to but pre-order now</em>). If you opt for a low-key launch, skipping the pre-publication publicity campaign, well, you’re still going to have to publicize it once it’s out (<em>free copy to the first person to retweet this!</em>), and deal with reviews (soliciting them, specifically—you should be so lucky anyone actually wrote a review, good or bad, unsolicited) etc.</p>
          <p>And of course, the double-edged blade of the physical immutability of books as artifacts begins to cut both ways—now that your thoughts are committed to a book, you can never take them back or change them or tweak them. You are now in some respects frozen and reduced to a caricature, to a much greater degree watching your caricature self go around and about (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/borges/1962-borges-borgesandi.pdf" id="borges-1962" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Borges and I', Borges 1962">“Borges and I”</a>).</p>
          <p>So, a book is a lot of work for a writer, even if it is mostly already-written writing, which crowds out new writing or exploration, and which tends to freeze them in place. But it gets worse.</p>
          <p>A book commits you to a single task, one which will devour your time for years to come, cutting you off from readers and from opportunity; in the time that you are laboring over the book, which usually you can’t talk much about with readers or enjoy the feedback, you may be driving yourself <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/psychiatry/bipolar/energy/1989-jamison.pdf" id="jamison-1989" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="‘Mood Disorders and Patterns of Creativity in British Writers and Artists’, Jamison 1989">into depression</a>.</p>

          <p>PhD attrition rates are well-known, and much of it happens after qualifications, while writing the thesis; those who pay attention to biographies of writers will recall many more instances attested, if only in those odd lacuna to which biographers dismiss with a line entire years in which nothing seems to happen but a discarded manuscript.</p>
          <p>To these, I’ll add two case-studies that I often think about.</p>
          <section id="wait-but-why">
            <h2><a href="#wait-but-why" title="Link to section: § 'Wait But Why?'"><em>Wait But Why</em>?</a></h2>
            <p>The long-form essayist/blogger Tim Urban of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_But_Why" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_But_Why#bodyContent" title="Wait But Why">“Wait But Why”</a> (WBW) made a name for himself in the mid-2010s by writing long enthusiastic essays, leavened with crude but effective comics, about various rabbit-hole topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics#bodyContent" title="Cryonics">cryonics</a>, the rise of deep learning, willpower/procrastination etc; at his peak he became a <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/03/elon-musk-post-series.html" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="The Elon Musk Post Series">favored mouthpiece of Elon Musk</a>.

WBW… not so much. The reader will have one of two reactions: “who’s that?” and “oh yeah, whatever happened to him?”</p>
            <p>The answer is simple: on 2016-06-18, disgusted by the 2016 US Presidential election and American political trends (especially the Great Awokening), as he explains in his post-mortem, he <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2023/02/last-six-years.html" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="A Short History of My Last Six Years">decided to begin writing what would be a book</a> about politics, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/whatsourproblem" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="What’s Our Problem?"><em>What’s Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies</em></a> <span>(2023). This was a mistake.</span></p>
            <p>Re-emerging over half a decade later (or 2,440 days) to break his silence, he explains at length how it was a mistake: the scope kept sprawling, he kept thinking he was almost done only to redo more, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#bodyContent" title="Sunk cost § Fallacy effect">sunk cost fallacy</a> kept him from killing it, while he kept procrastinating and trying to do it all, to the extent that:</p>

            <p>Eventually, his girlfriend, then fiancee, then wife, got pregnant. The thought of having a kid while <em>still</em> writing the book terrified him into finishing it off before the pregnancy did.</p>
            <p>Was the book any good? I couldn’t tell you. I’ve never read it or seen anyone mention it; when I brought it up in a chat, only one person had read it (and they didn’t like it). I suspect many more people read his post about writing the book than will ever read the book.</p>
            <p>And one can see the impact looking at <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/archive" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="Archive">his archives</a>. You do not need advanced statistics to see a change ~2016–2017 in the posting rate. (And this is neglecting that the later WBW posts are often short; counting words &amp; illustrations would probably show a larger loss.)</p>
            <p>Another way to put the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost#bodyContent" title="Opportunity cost">opportunity cost</a> is to note that if WBW had kept up its lowest pre-book annual rate (2015’s 11 posts), then instead of a total of 11 posts to show for <span title="The date range 2017–2024 lasted 7 years.">2017<span><sup>–</sup><sub>7</sub></span>2024</span> (ie. less than an average year), it would have <em>55</em> more (66 total) posts.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
          </section>
          <section id="anonymous">
            <h2><a href="#anonymous" title="Link to section: § 'Anonymous'">Anonymous</a></h2>
            <p>In another case, the author has not written a post-mortem, but I think the same thing happened.</p>
            <p>Around roughly the same time as WBW, there was another popular Internet blogger and writer, who gave well-received talks; he too decided to write a book to sum it all up and popularize his views, and went silent.</p>
            <p>About 2–3 years later, I went to dinner with him; I tried to avoid bringing up the book at all, and felt I could sense his constant strain and anxiety that I would ask about it, which made conversation a little difficult. This depression was also clearly visible in their minimal online activity. I wondered if they would ever publish the book, or if the moment had already passed.</p>
            <p>And then <em>4 years</em> after that, somewhat to my surprise, the book finally came out—and it was good! It was positively reviewed and I still see it mentioned (which is more than &gt;99% of books can say), and people still ask occasionally “whatever happened to him?” (If you google his name, “what happened to <em>X</em>” is the first suggested search query.)</p>
            <p>So, the reward was real but modest. What was the cost? Unfortunately, he has not returned to his previous activities; so in his case, the opportunity cost appears to have been… <em>everything</em>. Everything he would’ve written if he hadn’t been writing the book. As far as I can tell, several years later, he has not begun writing another book nor taken up any major non-writing activities; he just exists—burned out by the trauma of writing the book. And you can’t fix burnout by doing the same kind of thing, I think, <a href="https://gwern.net/backstop#burnout" id="gwern-backstop--burnout">only totally different things</a>.</p>
            <p>This is regrettable.</p>
            
            <p>As a third case, one could mention Scott Alexander again—at the same time as WBW he was writing, and finishing (on 2017-05-17), his online fantasy novel <a href="https://unsongbook.com/" id="alexander-2015" data-link-icon="ℵ" data-link-icon-type="text" title="'<em>Unsong</em>', Alexander 2015"><em>Unsong</em></a>, which <a href="https://gwern.net/review/book#unsong-alexander-2017" id="gwern-review-book--unsong-alexander-2017">I enjoyed</a>. He has since been editing and polishing it up for publication, according to occasional mentions on SSC and later on ACX up to the present. After 7 years of ‘editing’ and negotiations for publication, during which “various things went wrong and I procrastinated”, a fan volunteered to <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/unsong-available-in-paperback" data-link-icon="SSC" data-link-icon-type="text,tri" title="'<em>Unsong</em> Available In Paperback', Scott Alexander 2024-04-31">help get it self-published on Amazon</a>. It’s nice that <em>a</em> book now exists, technically, but it feels like the mountain gave birth to a mouse, and one wonders if Scott Alexander would’ve been even more prolific <span title="The date range 2017–2024 lasted 7 years.">2017<span><sup>–</sup><sub>7</sub></span>2024</span> had he not had <em>Unsong</em> hanging from his neck…?</p>
            
            <p>And a fourth case would be The Last Psychiatrist: he stopped blogging in May 2014, a book having been mentioned, which arrived only in December 2020, almost 7 years later. Reviews were mixed, but one thing is clear—as of August 2024, he has not returned to any known public writing.</p>
            
            <p>Also worth mentioning Wildbow’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_(web_serial)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_(web_serial)#bodyContent" title="Worm (web serial)"><em>Worm</em></a>, supposedly undergoing intense editing—admittedly, quite necessary in <em>Worm</em>’s case—since <span>2013<sub>11ya</sub></span> for ebook &amp; print publication. Last I knew, it was still being edited, with no sign of <em>Worm</em> publication imminent; although meanwhile Wildbow has written at least 3 other web serials, of vast length &amp; at similar update speed, so it is unclear if the ‘editing’ has done him any harm.</p>

          <h2><a href="#keeping-the-book-inside-them" title="Link to section: § 'Keeping The Book Inside Them'">Keeping The Book Inside Them</a></h2>
          <p>Now of course, there is a second kind of author: authors who write books with little discernible impact on their newsletter or blog. They sit down for an hour (statistically, <a href="https://gwern.net/morning-writing" id="gwern-morning-writing" title="‘What Is The Morning Writing Effect?’, Gwern 2011">in the morning</a>), pound out their quota, and turn to the next task. The book does not weigh on their minds, and they are confident that they will have it out, as usual, in 12 months. More power to them—but I also think that most would-be book authors already know if they are one of <em>that</em> latter kind of writers, or if they are the former kind I’ve been discussing.</p>
          <p>If they are the former kind, then they should seriously doubt any plan to write a book: why do they think they will finish? Or that it will be worthwhile? Is there a clear professional reason that the writing has to be a <em>book</em>? (Unless they are named “J. K. Rowling”, they can usually rule out “sales” as an adequate professional reason.)</p>
          <p>More importantly, what will the effect on <em>them</em> be? And what is the opportunity cost of writing a book: if they spend the next 5 years devoting all their energies to a book, what will be excluded? Would they happily throw everything they wrote in the previous 5 years into a fireplace in exchange for a finished manuscript of the book they are fantasizing about? Would they willing to wager everything they might ever write on the book going well, rather than becoming an albatross and burning them out? If I had decided in 2019 to write up “a book about AI” in the wake of my <a href="https://gwern.net/gpt-2" id="gwern-presser-2019-poetry" title="‘GPT-2 Neural Network Poetry’, Gwern &amp; Presser 2019">GPT-2 experiments</a><span>, say, and only published it in 2024, and sacrificed writing like</span> <a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis" id="gwern-scaling-hypothesis" title="'The Scaling Hypothesis', Gwern 2020">“The Scaling Hypothesis”</a> <span>(visionary in May 2020, hopelessly obsolete in August 2024), would I be better off than I am now?</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
          <p>I suspect that if many writers took seriously writing a book as a real project, rather than an aspirational cultural ideal of ‘being an author’ along the lines of ‘being a foreign language speaker’ or ‘being a PhD’, they would realize that it is a serious risk which can backfire. Everyone may have a book inside them, but some should keep it inside them.</p>
          <p>And for now, should a book come out of me despite my best efforts, I will take off and nuke it from orbit. (It’s the only way to be sure.)</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>In Washington people never read books—they just write them…Washington intellectuals are masters of small mountains. Some of their peaks are more difficult to summit than others. Many smaller slopes are nonetheless jagged and foreboding; climbing these are a mark of true intellectual achievement. But whether the way is smoothly paved or roughly made, the destinations are the same: small heights, little occupied. Those who reach these heights can rest secure. Out of humanity’s many billions there are only a handful of individuals who know their chosen domain as well as they do. They have mastered their mountain: they know its every crag, they have walked its every gully. But it is a small mountain. At its summit their field of view is limited to the narrow range of their own expertise.</p>
                <p>The social function of such a book is entirely unrelated to its erudition, elegance, or analytical clarity. It is only partially related to the actual ideas or policy recommendations inside it. In this world of small mountains, books and reports are a sort of proof, a sign of achievement that can be seen by climbers of other peaks. An author has mastered her mountain. The wonk thirsts for authority: once she has written a book, other wonks will give it to her.</p>

              <p>This is a good place to note the “equal-odds rule”: that for creative outputs under normal conditions, each output has a surprisingly equal chance of being a hit (without a clear quantity-quality tradeoff); so each of those 55 foregone WBW posts <em>could</em> have been his biggest hit yet.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Instructing the model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps, a.k.a., a chain of thought (CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length $n$, previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite precision $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ embedding size can only solve problems in $\mathsf{TC}^0$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, a proper subset of $ \mathsf{TC}^0$. However, with $T$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and $O(\log n)$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size $T$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers.

<p>Date: September 17, 2024</p>
<p>The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the
availability of FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE. This is the fifth release of
the stable/13 branch.</p>
<p>Since this release is occurring late in a legacy stable branch,
there are few new features; rather, the focus is primarily on
maintenance. As such, changes since 13.3-RELEASE consist mostly of
bug fixes, driver updates, and new versions of
externally-maintained software.</p>
<p>For a complete list of new features and known problems, please
see the online release notes and errata list, available at:</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_availability">Availability</h2>
<div>
<p>FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386,
powerpc, powerpc64, powerpc64le, powerpcspe, armv6, armv7, aarch64,
and riscv64 architectures.</p>
<p>FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE can be installed from bootable ISO images
or over the network. Some architectures also support installing
from a USB memory stick. The required files can be downloaded as
described below.</p>
<p>SHA512 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO, memory stick, and
SD card images are included at the bottom of this message.</p>
<p>PGP-signed checksums for the release images are also available
at:</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The purpose of the images provided as part of the release are as
follows:</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>dvd1</dt>
<dd>
<p>This contains everything necessary to install the base FreeBSD
operating system, the documentation, debugging distribution sets,
and a small set of pre-built packages aimed at getting a graphical
workstation up and running. It also supports booting into a
"livefs" based rescue mode. This should be all you need if you can
burn and use DVD-sized media.</p>
<p>Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick (flash
drive) for the amd64 architecture and used to do an install on
machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports
booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode.</p>
<p>As one example of how to use the dvd1 image, assuming the USB
drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this
should work:</p>
<div>
<pre># dd if=FreeBSD-13.4-RELEASE-amd64-dvd1.iso \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre></div>
<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.</p>
</dd>
<dt>disc1</dt>
<dd>
<p>This contains the base FreeBSD operating system. It also
supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no
pre-built packages.</p>
<p>Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick (flash
drive) for the amd64 architecture and used to do an install on
machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports
booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built
packages.</p>
<p>As one example of how to use the disc1 image, assuming the USB
drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this
should work:</p>
<div>
<pre># dd if=FreeBSD-13.4-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre></div>
<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bootonly</dt>
<dd>
<p>This supports booting a machine using the CDROM drive but does
not contain the installation distribution sets for installing
FreeBSD from the CD itself. You would need to perform a network
based install (e.g., from an HTTP or FTP server) after booting from
the CD.</p>
<p>Additionally, this can be written to a USB memory stick (flash
drive) for the amd64 architecture and used to do an install on
machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports
booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built
packages.</p>
<p>As one example of how to use the bootonly image, assuming the
USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this
should work:</p>
<div>
<pre># dd if=FreeBSD-13.4-RELEASE-amd64-bootonly.iso \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre></div>
<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.</p>
</dd>
<dt>memstick</dt>
<dd>
<p>This can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) and used
to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It
also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are
no pre-built packages.</p>
<p>As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the
USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this
should work:</p>
<div>
<pre># dd if=FreeBSD-13.4-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre></div>
<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mini-memstick</dt>
<dd>
<p>This can be written to a USB memory stick (flash drive) and used
to boot a machine, but does not contain the installation
distribution sets on the medium itself, similar to the bootonly
image. It also supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode.
There are no pre-built packages.</p>
<p>As one example of how to use the mini-memstick image, assuming
the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like
this should work:</p>
<div>
<pre># dd if=FreeBSD-13.4-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img \
    of=/dev/da0 bs=1m conv=sync</pre></div>
<p>Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.</p>
</dd>
<dt>FreeBSD/arm SD card images</dt>
<dd>
<p>These can be written to an SD card and used to boot the
supported arm system. The SD card image contains the full FreeBSD
installation, and can be installed onto SD cards as small as 5
GB.</p>
<p>For convenience for those without console access to the system,
a <code>freebsd</code> user with a password of <code>freebsd</code>
is available by default for <code>ssh(1)</code> access.

                 <div>Working across iPhone and Mac gets even easier with the newest Continuity feature in macOS Sequoia — iPhone Mirroring. Users can now access and engage with their iPhone right from their Mac. Custom wallpaper and app icons appear just like on iPhone. With iPhone Mirroring, users can also swipe between pages on the Home Screen; launch and browse favorite apps; and review and respond to iPhone notifications directly from their Mac. And iPhone remains locked the whole time, so nobody else can access or see what the user is doing. It also works great with StandBy, so users can continue to get information at a glance on their iPhone as they use iPhone Mirroring.

                 <div>Safari is the world’s fastest browser,<sup>2</sup> and it’s even easier to discover new information on the web with the new Highlights feature. Powered by machine learning, Highlights automatically surfaces directions for a location, summaries of articles, or quick links to learn more about people, music, movies, and TV shows. A redesigned Reader allows users to read articles more quickly with a streamlined view, a summary, and a table of contents, and a new Viewer helps users put videos front and center while still giving them full access to system playback&nbsp;controls. With Distraction Control, users can hide items on a webpage that they may find disruptive to their browsing.

Apple Intelligence will be available on Macs with an M-series chip, harnessing the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine to understand and create language and images; take action across apps; and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. Writing Tools help rewrite, proofread, and summarize text. Siri becomes more natural, flexible, and deeply integrated into the system experience, and with richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words. Siri can also maintain context from one request to the next. Mac users can type to Siri and fluidly switch between text and voice to accelerate everyday tasks. In addition, with Siri’s extensive product knowledge, users can now get answers to thousands of questions about the features and settings on Mac. With many of the Apple Intelligence models running entirely on device, as well as the introduction of Private Cloud Compute — which extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence — Apple Intelligence introduces an extraordinary step forward for privacy in artificial intelligence.

<h2>TouchArcade is Shutting Down</h2> </div>
</header>
<div>
<p>This is a post that I’ve known was coming for quite some time, but that doesn’t make it any easier to write. After more than 16 years TouchArcade will be closing its doors and shutting down operations. There may be an additional post here or there in the coming weeks as we try to honor any previously agreed to obligations, and a proper farewell post is in the works too, but as of now our normal daily operations have ceased. The reason we’re shutting down probably isn’t a surprising one: Money.</p>
<p>Many of you who have followed TouchArcade for a long time are well aware that we’ve had financial troubles for many years now, and to be frank I think it’s a miracle that we’ve been able to last as long as we have. The truth of the matter is that a website like ours just doesn’t make money anymore. To our own detriment we’ve resisted things like obnoxious in-your-face advertising, egregious clickbait headlines, or ethically questionable sponsorships, which sadly are the types of things that actually still make money in the internet of today. </p>
<p>There are a number of other reasons that have contributed to us reaching this point, but I’d rather not get into all that right now. TouchArcade was an institution for many millions of people over the past 16 years, and it was my full-time job for the last 14+ years. A solid third of my life. In many ways it is like one of my children, and having to say goodbye to it is very difficult to do. I’d really rather focus on all the great times we had than dwell on the things which we cannot change.</p>
<p>Also, as a man with a wife and two young children, and a mortgage, and all that other fun adult stuff, this is the end of my livelihood, and despite them being “freelancers" in a technical sense that is true for the other two people who have been the beating heart of TouchArcade, Shaun Musgrave and Mikhail Madnani. Which brings me to my next point…</p>
<p><b><span size="+2">PLEASE HIRE US!</span></b></p>
<p>The job market is not great anywhere, and finding new work is tough, especially in the games industry. If you are reading this and you have a need for very capable game industry veterans such as ourselves, please reach out. </p>
<p><strong>Jared Nelson</strong> – That’s me! Obviously I have more than 14 years of experience working right in the very thick of the mobile gaming boom here at TouchArcade. Writing, editing, managing staff, traveling to conventions. I’ve pretty much done it all. I also have a pretty varied work history previous to TouchArcade, including in management roles, that I think gives me a really well-rounded set of skills. You can contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-nelson-740393308/">LinkedIn</a> or by email at jared [at] toucharcade [dot] com.</p>
<p><strong>Shaun Musgrave</strong> – Shaun has been with TouchArcade for a bit over 11 years, but has been in professional games media for more than 25 years overall. He is hands down one of the most gifted writers I have ever encountered, and if we needed a review for a big, important game and needed it by a very tight deadline Shaun was always dependable. He also uses his vast, almost uncanny knowledge of video game history to find interesting angles to write about games that only he could find. Shaun lives in Japan and is fluent in both Japanese and English, making him a great candidate for localization work as well. Please reach out to him at muzkind [at] hotmail [dot] com.</p>
<p><strong>Mikhail Madnani</strong> – As part of TouchArcade for more than 7 years, Mikhail has been the workhorse of our staff. Posting the bulk of what you would see on a day to day basis, there is no possible way our website could have kept running for so long without Mikhail’s contributions. An expert at sniffing out interesting news stories and then posting them in a timely fashion, but also able to put together huge features like in-depth interviews and multi-platform reviews. His coffee-laden header images are legendary as well. If you need someone who can reliably and consistently post video game-related content, then I cannot recommend Mikhail highly enough. Reach out to him at hello [at] failgunner [dot] com.</p>
<p><b><span size="+2">So What Happens Now?</span></b></p>
<p>If there is some sort of silver lining to all of this, it’s that for the foreseeable future all of the content that has ever been posted to TouchArcade will remain online and accessible to all. More than 33,000 published articles, including more than 4,000 game reviews, not to mention all of our yearly Best Of content and Game of the Year picks. These should hopefully all continue living on into the future for reference purposes and just to look back and see how drastically the mobile gaming landscape changed over the last decade and a half.</p>
<p>We are also hoping to continue with our Podcast, <a href="https://toucharcade.com/category/podcast/">The TouchArcade Show</a>, which very recently just celebrated its 600th(!) episode. There are a couple co-hosts who have come and gone during the course of the podcast (shout out to Brand and Mike!) but myself and Eli Hodapp have been a constant presence on the show since the very beginning, and it’s really crazy that we’ve both spent 13+ years of our lives putting out hour-long podcasts on a (nearly) weekly basis. </p>
<p>Related to that, you may be wondering about <a href="https://www.patreon.com/toucharcade">our Patreon</a>. The support from our Patreon has far and away been the biggest contributor to TouchArcade continuing to exist since we launched it in June of 2015, almost a decade ago. Our thoughts are to pivot the Patreon contributions towards keeping the podcast going, and perhaps occasional posts or special features written by the staff here. Perhaps a random “SwitchArcade" or a review about a particularly high-profile mobile game launch. Maybe we could even squeeze in a Game of the Year for this year? It’s just a nugget of an idea right now, but it would be pretty cool to see TouchArcade be able to live on even in that small way.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TARIP-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="489" srcset="https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TARIP-2.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TARIP-2-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TARIP-2-768x376.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<p>Whatever the case ends up being, I will explicitly change the verbiage of our Patreon to state that it’s no longer about supporting the website, and if people choose to stop contributing then that is totally understandable. If people are giving us money monthly I want to be absolutely transparent about what it’s going towards. Anyway, look for more news about this in the coming weeks, and at the very least be sure to follow along as a free member on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/toucharcade">our Patreon</a> to stay in the loop. Also if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me at tips [at] toucharcade [dot] com or leave a comment below.</p>
<p>Well, that about does it, I think. I speak for all of us who have contributed to running TouchArcade over the past 16 years–from the co-founders Arnold Kim and Blake Patterson, to the first full-time hire and future Editor in Chief Eli Hodapp, and to the dozens of other writers and freelancers who have helped make TouchArcade what it is–we just want to give a sincere thank you for ever reading our site, listening to our podcast, or attending one of our events. It has been an absolute pleasure to have such a wonderful audience who appreciated what we did so much and we will all forever be grateful for the time that we were able to spend together. </p>

Actually, it is not that new any more. I have performed license compliance checks for more than 25 customers over the last 5 years - but in some kind of stealth mode. Now, the product got its on own landing page with pricing, description and Q&amp;A section.</span></p><p>When companies contact me, they feel that The Qt Company paints too rosy a picture about Qt Commercial and too dark a picture about Qt LGPL. I help them make an informed decision whether to choose Qt Commercial or Qt LGPL. Most of them find out that Qt LGPL is good enough for their embedded devices, that the obligations of the LGPL are easy to satisfy and - bonus - that the costs of Qt LGPL are much lower than those of Qt Commercial. Don’t forget that Qt LGPL is a fantastic product and that ten thousands of companies have built fantastic products with it.</p><p>As part of these engagement, I had to explain the Qt license agreement many times. You find my explanations of the darker parts of the Qt license agreement in this newsletter. I can only urge you to read the Qt license agreement very thoroughly, discuss it with other people and compare it with the LGPL - before you sign it.</p><p><span>Enjoy reading,</span><br><span>Burkhard</span></p><p>Qt sales will try to sell you the Qt for Device Creation (QtDC) license as the care-free option for using Qt on embedded devices. They will also portrait LGPL as a very dangerous and complicated license. I beg to differ - and so will almost all of my customers, readers and listeners.</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions/qt-dev-framework" rel="">Qt license agreement</a><span> is a masterpiece in legalese, vagueness, ambiguity and omission - with numerous pitfalls. The Qt Company has revised the agreement many times over the last years (just compare </span><a href="https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions/qt-dev-framework" rel="">the current agreement</a><span> with </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210831204300/https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions/" rel="">the 2021 agreement</a><span>). The Qt Company has optimised the agreement such that Qt applications, which run on a PC and communicate with an embedded device without Qt, become embedded devices under the QtDC license. </span></p><p>Some years back, The Qt Company happily sold Qt for Application Development (QtAD) licenses to such customers. When these licenses come up for renewal, The Qt Company claims that these customers commit a material breach of the license agreement and try to force the much more expensive QtDC licenses on them. Some customers will cave in, some will figure out that Qt LGPL or abandoning Qt is a better option.</p><p>Other companies fall for the care-free nonsense from Qt sales and pay 6-digit euro license fees per year. Inevitably, they will find out that Qt LGPL would have be more than enough for their embedded devices. Guess how these companies will feel and what they will do at the end of the license term.</p><p>All these companies have in common that they didn’t read the Qt license agreement thoroughly and they didn’t evaluate alternatives to the QtDC license. They only have to blame themselves for their calamity. The Qt Company is in its full right to write their license agreement however they want - although the agreement is certainly not “cute”. Of course, potential Qt customers are also in their full right to demand changes to the license agreement or walk away. </p><p>I will point out the murkier parts of the Qt license agreement and suggest changes. I am skeptical that The Qt Company will accept these changes, but it’s worth a try. The way The Qt Company treats you in these negotiations will tell you a lot, whether you should sign the agreement or not. Knowing the alternatives to QtDC will improve your negotiation position considerably.</p><p><span>The latest </span><a href="https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions/qt-dev-framework" rel="">Qt Product and Service Agreement for the Qt Development Framework</a><span> defines embedded devices as follows.</span></p><blockquote><p>2.10. “Devices” shall mean</p><ul><li><p>i. hardware devices or products that</p><ul><li><p>a. are manufactured and/or distributed by the Customer, its Affiliates, Contractors or End Customer, and</p></li><li><p>b. incorporate, integrate or link to Applications such that substantial functionality of such unit, when used by an End User, is provided by Application(s) or otherwise depends on the Licensed Software; or</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ii. Applications designed for the hardware devices specified in item (i).</p></li></ul><p>Devices covered by this Appendix shall be specified in the Pricing Appendix or Purchase Document.</p><p><span>See definition </span><em>2.10 “Devices”</em><span> in the </span><a href="https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions/qt-dev-framework" rel="">Qt Product and Service Agreement for the Qt Development Framework</a><span> (Version 2024-02, compliant with Qt Frame Agreement 2023-06 or later)</span></p></blockquote><p>WTF!!!??? That was my first reaction, too. It’s a masterpiece in legalese: vague to the point of being incomprehensible and far too broad in its scope. Let me try to translate this mumbo jumbo into plain English.</p><p><span>The logical structure of the Device definition is: </span><code>(i.a and i.b) or ii</code><span>. Your “hardware product” is considered a Device, if either clause (i) holds or clause (ii) holds. Clause (i) is satisfied, if and only both clause (a) and clause (b) are satisfied.</span></p><p>Let me start with a simple case. A manufacturer M of agricultural machines (the “Customer”) employs an in-house team to develop the machine’s driver terminals (the “units”, “hardware devices” or “hardware products”) with Qt. M sells its harvesters with the driver terminals to farmers F. The driver terminals are certainly Devices in the sense of the above definition, as M manufactures and distributes them (i.a) and one or more Qt applications (called Applications per Definition 2.3), which provide “substantial functionality” for the operation of the machine, run on the terminal (i.b).</p><p>Clause (i.a) significantly increases the number of devices and developers requiring licenses by including not only M but also its Affiliates, Contractors and End Customers.</p><p><strong>Affiliates</strong><span> are companies, in which M has a controlling majority or which have a controlling majority in M (see definition </span><em>3.1 “Affiliate”</em><span> in the </span><a href="https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions" rel="">Qt Frame Agreement</a><span>). For example, one of the world’s biggest agricultural manufacturers, owns 20 brands. Each brand is regarded as an Affiliate.</span></p><p>If M shares substantial parts of the terminal’s software (including applications and libraries using Qt) with its Affiliates, M must also buy Qt Commercial licenses for the devices and developers of the Affiliates. The same holds for M’s business units. </p><p>For example, the tractors produced by the different brands of the above agricultural manufacturer might share large parts of the code of their driver terminals. Only the GUIs show a distinct branding. If one of these brands uses Qt Commercial, all the other brands have to use it, too. </p><p>Only if a brand can prove that it doesn’t share “substantial” code based on Qt with other brands, it can escape the Qt Commercial jail. Of course, The Qt Company will interpret “substantial” as “any code based on Qt”. Affiliates will have a hard time arguing that the use is not substantial. Their best course is not use Qt at all. Alternatively, M and all its Affiliate can change to Qt LGPL once the license period has expired.</p><p><span>If M outsources the hardware or software development of the driver terminals partially or completely to </span><strong>Contractors</strong><span> (see definition </span><em>3.2 “Contractor”</em><span> in the </span><a href="https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions" rel="">Qt Frame Agreement</a><span>), M must pay the per-device or per-developer fees for the Qt Commercial licenses. Especially, M must also buy developer licenses for all the Contractors developing Qt applications for M or its affiliates. </span></p><p><strong>End Customers</strong><span> are companies to whom “[M], directly or</span><strong> indirectly</strong><span>, distributes copies of Redistributables as integrated or incorporated into Applications or Devices” (emphasis mine, see definition </span><em>2.4 “End Customer”</em><span> in the </span><a href="https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions/qt-dev-framework" rel="">Qt Product and Service Agreement for the Qt Development Framework</a><span>).</span></p><p>I can think of one scenario why The Qt Company included indirect distribution to End Customers in their Device definition. M could use the Qt for Application Development (QtAD) for the development of terminal software and pay only for the per-developer licenses. M sells all of its terminals to a reseller, which is not an Affiliate. The reseller sells the terminals to the End Customers and licenses the Qt software under the LGPL. M and the reseller would save the per-device license fees. Of course, The Qt Company wants to close this loop hole. </p><blockquote><ul><li><p>ii. Applications designed for the hardware devices specified in item (i).</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Clause (i) covers Qt applications that run on embedded devices. Clause (ii) extends the definition of Devices to cases, where the Qt applications do not run on the Device but on a PC, phone or tablet and where Qt is not even installed on the device.</p><p>For example, a med-tech company MT builds and sells an X-ray scanner for humans, a typical embedded device. Qt is not installed on the scanner. Medical personnel use a Qt application running on a Windows PC to operate the scanner and to evaluate the 3D scans. The PC application and the scanner communicate over a LAN.</p><p>For The Qt Company, the PC application is an application designed for the scanner. Hence, the PC application and the scanner constitute a Device. MT must buy a Qt for Device Creation (QtDC) license and pay license fees for each developer and for each device. Buying only a QtAD license for developing the Qt application on the Windows PC is not enough.</p><p>I have seen The Qt Company apply this reasoning to many of my customers. The Qt Company even claimed that MT would violate the LGPL. Now, that is false! The LGPL considers the PC application and the embedded device as two independent units that are licensed separately.</p><p>Earlier versions of the Qt license agreement contained a clearer definition of clause (ii).</p><blockquote><p>[Products are Devices] regardless of whether the Redistributables are distributed together with the hardware or not.</p><p><span>See “Devices” definition in the </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210831204300/https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions/" rel="">2021 version of the Qt license agreement</a></p></blockquote><p>The Qt usage reports still use this definition. Redistributables are the Qt libraries in object code form. In other words, it doesn’t matter whether the Qt application runs on the Device or not.</p><p>I’d like you to meet my pedantic German self, which helps a lot in dissecting contracts. I think that the setup of the med-tech company MT does not constitute a Device in the sense of the Qt license agreement. Clause (ii) refers to “hardware devices specified in item (i)”.</p><p><span>Remember that clause (i) is only satisfied if both clause (i.a) </span><strong>and</strong><span> clause (i.b) are satisfied. Clause (i.b), however, demands that the Qt applications run on the device. As Qt is not installed on the X-ray scanner, clause (i.b) is not satisfied. Hence, clause (i) is not satisfied. Hence, the X-ray scanner is not a device in the sense of the Qt license agreement. Hence, clause (ii) doesn’t apply. </span></p><p>The X-ray scanner would only be a Device, if a Qt application providing “substantial functionality for the device” would run on the Device. Then, clause (ii) would not matter anymore. But don’t get your hopes too high. In the end, a court would have to decide, as The Qt Company would still argue that MT’s setup is a Device. The formulation “Hardware devices or products that […] incorporate, integrate or link to [Qt] Applications” is vague enough to interpret it as follows: The Application can run either on the device or on a PC connected via a network “link”.</p><p>It is safe to assume that most Qt customers don’t have enough negotiation power to change the Devices definition. However, the last sentence of the definition gives them an opening.</p><blockquote><p>Devices covered by this Appendix shall be specified in the Pricing Appendix or Purchase Document.</p></blockquote><p>Qt customers should insist that all the Devices covered by the license agreement are explicitly listed in the Pricing Appendix or Purchase Document. If a Device is not listed, the Qt license agreement (the “Appendix”) does not apply.</p><p><span>Qt customers should also add a list of their products - including the desktop and mobile Qt applications “designed” for embedded devices - that are </span><em>not</em><span> considered Devices. The med-tech company MT would add their PC application and their X-ray scanner to this list.</span></p><p>The modified last sentence of the Devices definition could be written as follows (changes in italics). The Customer’s lawyer should be able to come up with an acceptable formulation.</p><blockquote><p><span>Devices covered by this Appendix </span><em>and Devices not covered by this Appendix </em><span>shall be specified in the Pricing Appendix or Purchase Document. </span><em>During the License Term, the classification as Device or Not-Device can only be changed by mutual agreement of both Parties.</em></p></blockquote><p>I would assume that The Qt Company would require an audit. The customer is free to allow or forbid the audit. I would expect that allowing the audit will increase the changes that The Qt Company signs the agreement. But it is entirely up to the customer.</p><p>Obviously, The Qt Company need not accept this change. Similarly, potential customers need not sign the unchanged agreement either. They can walk away and use Qt under LGPL or don’t use Qt at all. The Qt Company would lose a paying customer. There are good reasons for both parties to come to a mutual agreement.</p><p>According to clause 11.1, The Qt Company has the right to terminate the license agreement, if the Customer “commits a material breach of the Agreement” or if the Customer “becomes bankrupt, insolvent or goes into liquidation or debt restructuring”. A material breach exists, for example, if the customer does not pay in time or not at all, if it sells more Devices than it has distribution licenses or if it fails to provide the usage reports requested by The Qt Company.</p><p>According to clause 11.2, The Qt Company can suspend the customer’s right to use Qt on its Devices or for Development. The Qt Company can, for example, forbid the customer to sell its devices, if the customer doesn’t remedy the violation or breach within 10 days after receiving a written notice from The Qt Company. The reasons for such a suspension go from concrete to vague (emphasis mine).</p><blockquote><p><span>[The Qt Company can suspend the customer’s use of Qt] should Customer fail to make payment in timely fashion or otherwise violate or is </span><em>reasonably suspected of violating its obligations</em><span> under the Agreement and/or this Appendix […]</span></p></blockquote><p>So, if The Qt Company “reasonably suspects” that a customer violates the Qt license agreement, it can forbid the customer to sell or operate its devices. What “reasonably” means is solely decided by The Qt Company - or by a court. However, the customer wouldn’t be allowed to operate its devices until the court decides. You know what customers would do in such situations. So, customers best avoid these situations.</p><p>My recommendation would be to remove the text in italics from clause 11.2:</p><blockquote><p><span>[The Qt Company can suspend the customer’s use of Qt] should Customer fail to make payment in timely fashion or otherwise violate </span><s>or is reasonably suspected of violating its obligations under</s><span> the Agreement and/or this Appendix […]</span></p></blockquote><p>With this change, suspecting a violation is not enough. The Qt Company would have to prove a violation or a material breach. A court could quickly lift an unfounded suspension.</p><p>Again, The Qt Company may accept this change or not. The customer can walk away or not.</p><p>Welcome to the wonderful world of subscriptions, where you subscribe to videos, phones, Internet - and Qt. The License Term will automatically renew, unless the customer notifies The Qt Company in writing “no less than thirty (30) days before expiry of the respective License Term” (see clause 5.1.4). The two parties may agree about a typically longer notification period like 60 days in an amendment to the license agreement. By the way, The Company can terminate the agreement in the same way as the customer.</p><p>Clause 5.1.5 allows both parties to renegotiate the license fees before the renewal. However, the customer should agree on the new license fees before the notification period starts. Otherwise, The Qt Company can charge the “standard list pricing applicable at the commencement date of any such Renewal Term”. And we all know in which direction the prices will move.</p><p>I would recommend Qt customers </p><ul><li><p>either to remove clauses 5.1.4 and 5.1.5 from the license agreement</p></li><li><p>or to notify The Qt Company about the termination one week after the License Term started.</p></li></ul><p>This makes sure that the Qt subscription does not automatically renew.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><span> Cancelling the subscription in time is the only way to terminate the Qt license agreement for Qt customers.</span></p><p>If Qt customers cancel the Qt subscription in time, they have certain rights and duties upon termination (see section 11.3).</p><ul><li><p><em>Clause 11.3.1.</em><span> The developers of the customer must stop using the Qt tools, Qt libraries, pre-built Boot2Qt images and all other Qt-ware that they downloaded and installed through the Qt Commercial license. They must start using Qt-ware under the open-source licenses: LGPL-3.0 for the libraries and GPL-3.0 for the tools.</span></p></li><li><p><em>Clause 11.3.2. </em><span>The developers must also delete all installed copies of commercial Qt tools and Qt libraries. Qt customer can keep some developer licenses to continue the support of their End Customers. Bug fixing is OK. Adding new features is not OK.</span></p></li><li><p><em>Clause 11.3.3.</em><span> “Distribution Licenses are perpetual”. Qt customers can use existing devices with Qt for Device Creation (QtDC). They can sell devices with QtDC until they have used up all the distribution licenses they have paid for.</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Customers lose the rights from section 11.3, if they committed a material breach of the license agreement.</span></p><p>If you read section 11.3 in the license agreement, you’ll find out that the customers’ duties have been specified pretty clearly, whereas the customers’ rights are more wishy-washy. My summary above is a reasonable interpretation - based on earlier and clearer versions of the Qt license agreement and on usual business practices. </p><p>I recommend Qt customers to make the formulations in section 11.3 clearer and more specific. For example, customers should specify how many developer licenses they may keep, for how long and for which purposes. They should also add that they can use up all the excess licenses they have paid for but not yet sold with their devices.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/">Amazon</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> is instructing corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office, CEO Andy Jassy <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio" target="_blank">wrote in a memo</a> on Monday.</p><p>The decision marks a significant shift from Amazon's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/17/amazon-employees-asked-to-be-in-office-three-days-a-week-andy-jassy.html">earlier return-to-work stance</a>, which required corporate workers to be in the office at least three days a week. Now, the company is giving employees until Jan. 2 to start adhering to the new policy.</p><p>Corporate employees will be expected to be in the office five days a week "outside of extenuating circumstances" or unless they have been granted an exception by their organization's S-team leader, Jassy said, referring to the close-knit group of executives that report to Amazon's CEO.</p><p>"Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward — our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances," Jassy said.</p><p>Amazon also plans to simplify its corporate structure by having fewer managers in order to "remove layers and flatten organizations," Jassy said. Each S-team organization will be expected to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025, he said. Individual contributors refers to employees who typically do not manage other staffers.</p><p>It is unclear if the change will result in the elimination of some manager positions. An Amazon spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.</p><p>The company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/09/amazon-is-on-a-hiring-spree-amid-widespread-coronavirus-layoffs-and-record-unemployment.html">rapidly grew its headcount</a> over the course of the pandemic before Jassy took the helm and instituted widespread cost cuts across Amazon, including the largest layoffs in its 27 years as a public company. Amazon's headcount totaled 1.53 million employees <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/AMZN-Q2-2024-Earnings-Release.pdf" target="_blank">in the second quarter</a>, representing growth of just 5% from a year earlier. By comparison, Amazon's workforce expanded 14% to 1.52 million employees in the second quarter of 2022.</p><p>Jassy wrote in a lengthy missive to staffers that&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;is making the changes to strengthen its corporate culture and ensure that it remains nimble. He underscored the point by saying the company created a "bureaucracy mailbox," or dedicated email alias, to root out any unnecessary processes or excessive rules within the company.</p><p>"We want to operate like the world's largest startup," Jassy wrote. "That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other."</p><p>Amazon shares ticked lower in afternoon trading.</p><div><p>Hey team. I wanted to send a note on a couple changes we're making to further strengthen our culture and teams.</p><p>First, for perspective, I feel good about the progress we're making together. Stores, AWS, and Advertising continue to grow on very large bases, Prime Video continues to expand, and new investment areas like GenAI, Kuiper, Healthcare, and several others are evolving nicely. And at the same time we're growing and inventing, we're also continuing to make progress on our cost structure and operating margins, which isn't easy to do. Overall, I like the direction in which we're heading and appreciate the hard work and ingenuity of our teams globally.</p><p>When I think about my time at Amazon, I never imagined I'd be at the company for 27 years. My plan (which my wife and I agreed to on a bar napkin in 1997) was to be here a few years and move back to NYC. Part of why I've stayed has been the unprecedented growth (we had $15M of annual revenue the year before I joined—this year should be well north of $600B), the perpetual hunger to invent, the obsession with making customers' lives easier and better every day, and the associated opportunities these priorities present. But, the biggest reason I'm still here is our culture. Being so customer focused is an inspiring part of it, but it's also the people we work with, the way we collaborate and invent when we're at our best, our long-term perspective, the ownership I've always felt at every level I've worked (I started as a Level 5), the speed with which we make decisions and move, and the lack of bureaucracy and politics.</p><p>Our culture is unique, and has been one of the most critical parts of our success in our first 29 years. But, keeping your culture strong is not a birthright. You have to work at it all the time. When you consider the breadth of our businesses, their associated growth rates, the innovation required across each of them, and the number of people we've hired the last 6-8 years to pursue these endeavors, it's pretty unusual—and will stretch even the strongest of cultures. Strengthening our culture remains a top priority for the s-team and me. And, I think about it all the time.</p><p>We want to operate like the world's largest startup. That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.</p><p>Two areas that the s-team and I have been thinking about the last several months are: 1/ do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire? 2/ are we set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other (and our culture) to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business that we can? We think we can be better on both.</p><p>On the first topic, we've always sought to hire very smart, high judgment, inventive, delivery-focused, and missionary teammates. And, we have always wanted the people doing the actual detailed work to have high ownership. As we have grown our teams as quickly and substantially as we have the last many years, we have understandably added a lot of managers. In that process, we have also added more layers than we had before. It's created artifacts that we'd like to change (e.g., pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere, etc.). Most decisions we make are two-way doors, and as such, we want more of our teammates feeling like they can move fast without unnecessary processes, meetings, mechanisms, and layers that create overhead and waste valuable time.</p><p>So, we're asking each s-team organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations' ability to make customers' lives better and easier every day. We will do this thoughtfully, and our PxT team will work closely with our leaders to evolve our organizations to accomplish these goals over the next few months.</p><p>[By the way, I've created a "Bureaucracy Mailbox" for any examples any of you see where we might have bureaucracy or unnecessary process that's crept in and we can root out…to be clear, companies need process to run effectively, and process does not equal bureaucracy, but unnecessary and excessive process or rules should be called out and extinguished. I will read these emails and action them accordingly.]</p><p>To address the second issue of being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business, we've decided that we're going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID. When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant. I've previously explained these benefits (February 2023 post), but in summary, we've observed that it's easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another. If anything, the last 15 months we've been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits.</p><p>Before the pandemic, not everybody was in the office five days a week, every week. If you or your child were sick, if you had some sort of house emergency, if you were on the road seeing customers or partners, if you needed a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, people worked remotely. This was understood, and will be moving forward as well. But, before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward—our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances (like the ones mentioned above) or if you already have a Remote Work Exception approved through your s-team leader.</p><p>We are also going to bring back assigned desk arrangements in locations that were previously organized that way, including the U.S. headquarters locations (Puget Sound and Arlington). For locations that had agile desk arrangements before the pandemic, including much of Europe, we will continue to operate that way.</p><p>We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments. To help ensure a smooth transition, we're going to make this new expectation active on January 2, 2025. Global Real Estate and Facilities (GREF) is working on a plan to accommodate desk arrangements mentioned above and will communicate the details as they are finalized.</p><p>I want to thank our leaders and support teams in advance for the work they will do to improve their org structures over the coming months. With a company of our size and complexity, the work won't be trivial and it will test our collective ability to invent and simplify when it comes to how we organize and go after the meaningful opportunities we have across all of our businesses.</p><p>Having the right culture at Amazon is something I don't take for granted. I continue to believe that we are all here because we want to make a difference in customers' lives, invent on their behalf, and move quickly to solve their problems. I'm optimistic that these changes will better help us accomplish these goals while strengthening our culture and the effectiveness of our teams.</p><p>Thanks, Andy</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2024/09/16/a-spreadsheet-and-a-debugger-walks-into-a-shell/">https://arcan-fe.com/2024/09/16/a-spreadsheet-and-a-debugger-walks-into-a-shell/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41558081">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>Here we continue the series of posts on the development of a command-line shell which defies terminal emulation by using the display server API locally and a purpose built network protocol remotely.</p>



<p>Previous episodes include: <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2022/04/02/the-day-of-a-new-command-line-interface-shell/">The Day of a new Command-Line Interface:&nbsp;Shell</a> (high level) <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2022/10/15/whipping-up-a-new-shell-lashcat9/">Whipping up a new Shell –&nbsp;Lash#Cat9</a> (technical demo), <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2024/05/17/cat9-microdosing-stash-and-list/">Cat9 Microdosing: Stash and&nbsp;List</a> (feature highlight), <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2024/08/05/cat9-microdosing-each-and-contain/">Cat9 Microdosing: Each and&nbsp;Contain</a> (feature highlight)</p>



<p>For this round we have added an interactive spreadsheet representation and a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol//">Debug Adapter Protocol</a> implementation. These come as two discrete sets of builtins (groups of commands), ‘dev’ and ‘spreadsheet’ with a surprise interaction or two.</p>



<p>The intent for the dev builtin is to eventually collect more and more useful tools for managing all aspects of software development, from source control management to building, testing and fuzzing.</p>



<p>Starting with the spreadsheet. By typing:</p>



<pre>builtin spreadsheet<br>new</pre>



<p>You would get something like the following screenshot:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="8924" data-permalink="https://arcan-fe.com/2024/09/16/a-spreadsheet-and-a-debugger-walks-into-a-shell/spread1/" data-orig-file="https://arcan-fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/spread1.png" data-orig-size="936,520" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="spread1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://arcan-fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/spread1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://arcan-fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/spread1.png?w=640" tabindex="0" role="button" width="936" height="520" src="https://arcan-fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/spread1.png?w=936" alt=""></figure>



<p>The following clip shows how I spawn new spreadsheet, populated by a CSV source and using the mouse cursor to interact with the layout.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This complements the form intended for media processing that was presented a few years ago as “<a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2021/04/12/introducing-pipeworld/">Pipeworld</a>” and re-uses the same language and parsing logic.</p>



<p>Cells can be populated with static contents, expressions like <code>=max(A1:A4)</code> or even shell commands through the ! prefix, e.g. <code>!date +%Y:%M:%S</code>. The following clip shows some basic expression use, as well as forced reprocessing of expressions and shell commands.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Combining shell commands with expressions that are re-executed on request</figcaption></figure>



<p>More useful is to populate the sheet with outputs from some command and processed by Lua patterns. The following screenshot shows the result of running <code>insert #0 4 separate "%s+:" !cat /proc/cpuinfo</code></p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="8933" data-permalink="https://arcan-fe.com/2024/09/16/a-spreadsheet-and-a-debugger-walks-into-a-shell/cpuinfo/" data-orig-file="https://arcan-fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cpuinfo.png" data-orig-size="936,442" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="cpuinfo" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://arcan-fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cpuinfo.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://arcan-fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cpuinfo.png?w=640" tabindex="0" role="button" width="936" height="442" src="https://arcan-fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cpuinfo.png?w=936" alt=""><figcaption>Populating a spreadsheet at some insertion point using a shell command split and separated with Lua patterns</figcaption></figure>



<p>Exporting can be done using the existing <code>copy</code> builtin with control over output format, subrange and so on: copy <code>#4(csv, compact, a1:b5)</code> to export the resolved values of a1,b1,a2,b2 … as CSV.</p>



<p>There is still more to be done for this to be a complete replacement for the likes of <a href="https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im">sc-im,</a> and to add things like plotting via gnuplot (if I can ever get their plot language to behave) and graphviz, as well more experimental things like importing Makefiles – — but at least for my, admittedly humble, spreadsheet uses it is good enough for daily driving.</p>



<h2><em>Onwards to the Debugger</em> </h2>



<p>To start things you would do something like the following:</p>



<pre><code><code>builtin dev</code>
debug launch ./test</code></pre>



<p>The ‘dev’ builtin set is used as it will eventually accumulate all developer task related commands like building, deployment, source control management and so on.</p>



<p>The following clip shows the default behaviour for that in action. In it you can see how multiple discrete jobs are created for managing threads, breakpoints and so on, detachable and with mouse cursor handling in place.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Basic debugger use and navigation</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the clip I also showed the process of stepping through threads, spawning source view, setting and toggling breakpoints, inspecting registers and modifying target variables.</p>



<p>I have spent thousands of hours staring at the GDB CLI prompt, and hated nearly every second of it. Not because of the relaxing task of debugging code or exploring software state itself, but for the absolutely atrocious terminal thrashing interface even with mitigation layers such as <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a>. In fairness, a debugger TUI is in the deepest end of the complexity pool to get going.</p>



<p>There is a lot that goes into handling the protocol, and quite a few telltale signs of its designers, so we have just passed the point of basic bring-up. Importantly it is all composable with the data manipulation, filtering and transfer tools we already have elsewhere.</p>



<p>As an example of that we have ‘contain’ from the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2024/08/05/cat9-microdosing-each-and-contain/">previous article</a>, for instance, to bunch all the subwindows together into one contained job, useful when running multiple debug sessions side by side to step through multi-process issues.</p>



<p>We do have some other conveniences in place. Stepping controls are defined by the granularity of the job it represents, so stepping in the disassembly view would step instructions, while stepping in the source view would go by line or statement and so on.</p>



<p>Now to close the loop and mix in the spreadsheet part. In the following clip you see me picking a few registers and thread source location that gets added to a watch set. Whenever thread execution is stopped, these will be resampled and updated.</p>



<p>I then click the ‘spreadsheet’ option which will create a spreadsheet and populate it with the contents of the watchset as I go.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Live mapping watched dataset to spreadsheet</figcaption></figure>



<p>With all this in place we can almost start stitching the many other related projects together, from the data visualization from <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2015/02/08/next-experiment-senseye/">Senseye</a> (closing in on 10 years…) with the window management from <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2021/04/12/introducing-pipeworld/">Pipeworld</a> to the harnessing and setup from <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2020/02/10/leveraging-the-display-server-to-improve-debugging/">Leveraging the Display Server to Improve Debugging</a> and build the panopticon of debugging from the plan presented in “Retooling and Securing Systemic Debugging” (2012, doi:10.1007/978-3-642-34210-3_10). But that is for another time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The US Food and Drug Administration Monday<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K240929"> published approval</a> for sleep apnea detection on the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Watch Ultra 2. The green light comes four days ahead of the Series 10’s September 20 release date.</p>

<p>The feature, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/09/apple-is-adding-a-sleep-apnea-detection-feature-to-the-apple-watch-series-10-9-and-ultra-2/">announced at last week’s iPhone 16 event</a>, will arrive as part of the imminent watchOS 11 release. Once enabled, it requires 10 nights of sleep tracking data spread out over a 30-day span to determine whether a user may have the condition. During that time, it also offers insights into nightly sleeping disturbances, utilizing the on-board accelerometer.</p>

	
	


<p>The FDA classes the feature as an “over-the-counter device to assess risk of sleep apnea.” Apple is quick to note that the addition is not a diagnostic tool. Rather, it will prompt users to seek a formal diagnosis from a healthcare provider. The condition, which causes breathing to become shallower or repeatedly stop during the night, is associated with a variety of different symptoms. The Mayo Clinic notes that it can cause insomnia, headaches, daytime sleepiness, and other longer-term conditions.</p>

<p>Apple isn’t the first consumer electronics firm to offer the feature. Withings has offered sleep apnea detection in devices for some time, while Samsung received <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/samsung-gets-fda-nod-for-smartwatch-sleep-apnea-detection/">FDA approval</a> for its Galaxy Watch line earlier this. </p>

<p>The feature arrives as another — blood oxygen detection — has been disabled on Apple Watches in the U.S. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-detection-wont-be-available-on-the-series-10-in-the-u-s/">over an ongoing patent dispute</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>You have long ago abandoned the JavaScript trademark, and it is causing
widespread, unwarranted confusion and disruption.</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript is the world’s most popular programming language, powering websites
everywhere. Yet, few of the millions who program in it realize that JavaScript
is a trademark you, Oracle, control. The disconnect is glaring: JavaScript has
become a general-purpose term used by countless individuals and companies,
independent of any Oracle product.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle’s hold on the JavaScript trademark clearly fits the legal definition of
trademark abandonment</strong>. A previous
<a href="https://tinyclouds.org/trademark">blog post</a> addressed this issue, requesting
that you, Oracle, release the trademark. Unsurpisingly, the request was met with
silence. It is therefore time to take active steps in order to bring the
JavaScript trademark into the public domain, where it belongs.</p>
<h2>Trademark abandonment</h2>
<p>Title 15 of the United States Code, section 1127, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-3344077-1913738695&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">mark</a>&nbsp;shall
be deemed to be “abandoned” if either of the following occurs:</p>

<li>When

Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for 3
consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment.
“<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-85351-1913738695&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">Use</a>”

Purchaser motivation shall not be a test for determining abandonment under
this paragraph.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>In the case of JavaScript, both criteria apply</strong>.</p>
<h2>Netscape, Sun, Oracle</h2>
<p>The JavaScript trademark is currently held by Oracle America, Inc.
(<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026640&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">US Serial Number: 75026640, US Registration Number: 2416017</a>).
How did this come to be?</p>
<p>In 1995, Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems to create interactive
websites. Brendan Eich famously spent only 10 days creating the first version of
JavaScript, a dynamic programming language with a rough syntactic lineage from
Sun’s Java language. As a result of this partnership, Sun held the JavaScript
trademark. In 2009, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and the JavaScript
trademark as a result.</p>
<p>The trademark is simply a relic of this acquisition. Neither Sun nor Oracle has
ever built a product using the mark. Legal staff, year after year, have renewed
the trademark without question. It’s likely that only a few within Oracle even
know they possess the JavaScript trademark, and even if they do, they likely
don’t understand the frustration it causes within the developer community.</p>
<h2>Use it or lose it</h2>
<p><strong>Oracle has abandoned the JavaScript trademark through nonuse.</strong></p>
<p>Oracle has never seriously offered a product called JavaScript. In the 1990s and
early 2000s, Netscape Navigator, which supported JavaScript as a browser
feature, was a key player. However, Netscape’s usage and influence faded by
2003, and the browser saw its final release in 2008. JavaScript, meanwhile,
evolved into a widely used, independent programming language, embedded in
multiple browsers, entirely separate from Oracle.</p>
<p>The most recent
<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026640&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">specimen</a>,
filed with the USPTO in 2019, references <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> (a
project created by Ryan Dahl, the author of this letter) and Oracle’s
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html">JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)</a>.
But Node.js is not an Oracle product, and JET is merely a set of JavaScript
libraries for Oracle services, particularly Oracle Cloud. There are millions of
JavaScript libraries; JET is not special.</p>
<p>(Oracle is not even a member of the OpenJS Foundation - the body that the
Node.js project lives under now. Nor does Oracle have any involvement whatsoever
in the development of Node.js.)</p>
<p>Oracle also offers <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/">GraalVM</a>, a JVM that
can execute JavaScript, among other languages. But GraalVM is far from a
canonical JavaScript implementation; engines like V8, JavaScriptCore, and
SpiderMonkey hold that role. GraalVM’s product page doesn’t even mention
“JavaScript”; you must dig into the documentation to find its support.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle’s use of JavaScript in GraalVM and JET does not reflect genuine use of
the trademark.</strong> These weak connections do not satisfy the requirement for
consistent, real-world use in trade.</p>
<h2>A generic term</h2>
<p>A mark can also be considered abandoned if it becomes a generic term.</p>
<p>In 1996, Netscape
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981203070212/http://cgi.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease289.html">announced</a>
a meeting of the ECMA International standards organization to standardize the
JavaScript programming language. Sun (now Oracle), refused to give up the
“JavaScript” mark for this use though, so it was decided that the language would
be called “ECMAScript” instead. (Microsoft happily offered up “JScript”, but
no-one else wanted that.) Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and a
co-signatory of this letter,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200621202321/https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2006-October/000133.html">wrote in 2006</a>
that “<em>ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin
disease</em>.”</p>
<p>Ecma International formed TC39, a technical steering committee, which publishes
ECMA-262, the specification for JavaScript. This committee includes participants
from all major browsers, like Google’s Chrome, Apple’s Safari, and Mozilla’s
Firefox, as well as representatives from server-side JavaScript runtimes like
Node.js and Deno.</p>
<p>Oracle’s ownership of the JavaScript trademark only causes confusion. The term
“JavaScript” is used freely by millions of developers, companies, and
organizations around the world, with no interference from Oracle. Oracle has
done nothing to assert its rights over the JavaScript name, likely because they
do not believe their claim to the mark would hold up in court. Unlike typical
trademark holders who protect their trademarks by extracting licensing fees or
enforcing usage restrictions, Oracle has allowed the JavaScript name to be used
by anyone. This inaction further supports the argument that the trademark has
lost its significance and has become generic.</p>
<p>Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community
organizations. These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced
to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around—for
example, <a href="https://jsconf.com/">JSConf</a>. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark
challenge against Oracle, there can be no “JavaScript Conference” nor a
“JavaScript Specification.” The world’s most popular programming language cannot
even have a conference in its name.</p>
<p><strong>There is a vast misalignment between the trademark’s ownership and its
widespread, generic use</strong>.</p>
<h2>Free the mark</h2>
<p><strong>By law, a trademark is abandoned if it is either not used or becomes a generic
term. Both apply to JavaScript.</strong></p>
<p>It’s time for the USPTO to end the JavaScript trademark and recognize it as a
generic name for the world’s most popular programming language, which has
multiple implementations across the industry.</p>
<p>Oracle, you likely have no real business interest in the mark. It’s renewed
simply because legal staff are obligated to renew all trademarks, regardless of
their relevance or use.</p>
<p>We urge you to release the mark into the public domain. However, asking nicely
has been <a href="https://tinyclouds.org/trademark">tried before</a>, and it was met with
silence. If you do not act, we will challenge your ownership by filing a
petition for cancellation with the USPTO.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Latacora collects and analyzes data about services our clients use. You may
have read about <a href="https://www.latacora.com/blog/2023/11/01/our-approach-to-building-security-tooling/" target="_self" rel="">our approach to building security
tooling</a>, but the
tl;dr is we make requests to all the (configuration metadata) read-only APIs
available to us and store the results in S3. We leverage the data to understand
our clients’ infrastructure and identify security issues and misconfigurations.
We retain the files (“snapshots”) to support future IR/forensics efforts.</p>
<p>This approach has served us well, but the limited scope of a snapshot meant
there was always a problem of first needing to figure out which files to look
at. We love <code>aws s3 sync</code> and <code>grep</code> as much as anyone but security analysis
requires looking for complex relationships between resources; text search is,
at best, only a Bloom filter. What we really wanted was a performant way to ask
any question across all the data we have for a client that would support
complex queries using logic programming.</p>
<p>Improving connectivity of our data only helps us make the signal-to-noise ratio
better by contextualizing vulnerabilities in one area with information from
another. Is MFA disabled in Okta for the person who can assume roles with
AdministratorAccess in AWS? Is code in that GitHub repo with a compromised
supply chain running in production?</p>
<p>Latacora has deep roots in the Clojure community. We’re a frequent conference
sponsor and provide financial support for sustainable open source work in the
form of <a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clojurists Together</a>. All
this to say, we’ve been following Datomic and databases like it for years. In
fact, several of us were in attendance at Clojure/Conj when
<a href="https://blog.datomic.com/2023/04/datomic-is-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Datomic was announced as free</a>
and we eagerly consumed the
<a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/datomic-pro-1.0.7075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Jepsen report</a>.</p>
<p>Datomic is a database which stores information as immutable atomic facts and
its indices support many access patterns that may be familiar to you from
relational, graph, key/value, and columnar databases. Datomic implements
queries using Datalog, a logic programming language with many attractive
features like implicit joins and recursive evaluation supporting graph
traversal. For many people, once you learn querying with Datalog it’s slightly
unpleasant to use anything else. We already believed Datomic would be a nice
place to end up but getting there meant working through some hard questions.</p>
<h2 id="down-the-rabbit-hole">Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
<p>Our collection processes run on a scheduled basis and collect everything we can
about a service from scratch every time. This usually means resulting files are
both large and contain redundant information overlapping other recent
collections. Napkin math showed we’d run into exorbitant prices if we tried to
accumulate data that way anywhere other than S3. To make storage viable we
needed to give up on the approach or figure out how to only store one copy of
unique information.</p>
<p>Another problem is our tooling is so dynamic and dependent on the services we
analyze at no point could a human reasonably sit down and write out all the
attributes we might see. We’re not even sure all major cloud providers can do
that for their own services. Even if we could, doing so is antithetical to our
data collection philosophy and would mean imposing static constraints on an
otherwise open world of data we don’t control. Yet, Datomic is rigorous in a
healthy “eat your vegetables” way, so to maintain our open world assumption
we’d need to dynamically infer a schema.</p>
<p>Most of Latacora’s tools are batch-oriented: independent tools participating in
one or more loosely coupled analysis and reporting pipelines. Even though our
data is always stored in S3, we needed to define a standard file format that
would work everywhere and help us achieve a uniform query interface.</p>
<h2 id="through-the-looking-glass">Through the Looking Glass</h2>
<p>We saw a need for a library oriented around writing and reading snapshots that
would let us focus on intent and less on mechanism. We wanted the library to do
the heavy lifting so existing tools could quickly pick it up and start
participating in our vision of more connected data.</p>
<h3 id="desirable-properties--abilities">Desirable properties / abilities:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify a snapshot</li>
<li>Write a snapshot to S3</li>
<li>Read a snapshot from S3</li>
<li>Infer schema as we write data</li>
<li>Append metadata to a snapshot</li>
<li>Append collection data to a snapshot</li>
<li>Identify and deduplicate redundant data</li>
<li>Idempotent loading of snapshots into a database</li>
<li>Organize snapshots in S3 by time to support lifecycle rules</li>
<li>Work with arbitrarily large datasets in a streaming / chunked fashion</li>
<li>Transact snapshots into in-memory databases to support testing and
development</li>
<li>Transact snapshots into long-running databases for reporting and ad-hoc
questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Having worked with files containing this data for years we already knew file
size would be a problem if we didn’t support streaming from the start. We also
suspected we’d need to perform chunked transactions to avoid swamping the
transactor with giant transactions. With those constraints in mind we
considered the interaction patterns:</p>

<li>Want to write data in chunks and optionally release memory along the way</li>
<li>Want an ability to write metadata at any point</li>
</ul>
<p>Acknowledging these roles brought clarity to the design. We’d need separate
append-only files for schema, metadata, and collection data. Together those
three files could represent a snapshot in a way that is friendly to both
streaming readers and writers. We could confidently say schema and metadata
files would always be relatively small while still allowing collection data
files to grow very large.</p>
<p>We opted to generate a <code>UUIDv7</code> for every snapshot as the identity and use the
embedded timestamp to derive a <code>yyyy/mm/dd/</code> prefix for S3. To load data into
Datomic we’d transact the schema file followed by the collection data file in
reasonably sized chunks. The snapshot metadata would be added to every
transaction to facilitate data provenance and transaction grouping.</p>
<h2 id="the-cheshire-cat">The Cheshire Cat</h2>
<p>To deal with duplicate data we borrowed ideas from content addressable storage
and began computing a hash for every entity to use as an identity. This
probably sounds strange at first: don’t resources in our customers'
environments constantly change?</p>
<p>The key observation is that what we actually record in our snapshots is simply
data about API requests and responses. As we convert data into datoms, every
single map in the original data becomes its own entity. Parent maps turn into
entities with reference attributes pointing to their child map entities. There
is no direct correspondence between our database entities and what you might
consider to be the resources (or entities) of the services we collect data
about.</p>
<p>Our entity hash is therefore simply a reliable way to assign an identity to a
map of data we’ve seen before. The hash is computed as an
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.guava/guava/latest/com/google/common/hash/Hashing.html#combineUnordered%28java.lang.Iterable%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unordered combination</a>
of hashes from each key/value pair associated with the entity. To achieve
unification (deduplication) we mark the attribute containing the hash as a
<code>:db.unique/identity</code> attribute in the schema and trust Datomic to correctly
wrangle all the pointers during a transaction.</p>
<p>Given our collection approach we expected most of the maps to stay the same
over time. Empirically, we now know only 5% of them “change” on a given day.
Having achieved a low rate of data accumulation it became both affordable and
realistic to transact every single snapshot into a long-running Datomic
database for each customer. This also means every entity added by a snapshot
contains truly novel information about our customer’s environments.</p>
<p>Datomic records the transactions as entities themselves so the entire history
remains queryable. If that sounds powerful, that’s because it is. Leveraging
data this way has enabled us to start creating things like networking diagram
diffs or heatmaps showing how customer environments evolve over time in just a
few hours of coding.</p>
<p>We can still answer point-in-time questions despite the unorthodox immutable
entity sharing. This is achieved with a db filter that traverses references for
datoms being considered during a query to determine if a shared entity (due to
hashing) is in or out of scope when we want time bounded queries. This is
possible because we know every snapshot has a root node so there will always be
a path from the root to an entity if the entity was part of the snapshot’s
observations.</p>
<p>Assigning hash identities to every entity creates idempotency. Transacting the
same snapshot twice quite literally does nothing at all. This means we can
safely implement retries and automated recovery processes without worrying
about famously elusive “exactly once” behavior.</p>
<p>Elegance begets elegance, so it was no surprise when we noticed our design
mirrors Clojure’s approach to immutable data structures with structural
sharing. If you squint, a snapshot is just a tree described as an append-only
log whose nodes might unify onto some existing nodes in the Datomic graph. Each
snapshot minimally introduces a new root node to acknowledge observations as of
a point in time, but everything else could very well be pointers to things we
already knew.</p>

<h2 id="advice-from-a-caterpillar">Advice From a Caterpillar</h2>
<p>It’s instructive to see how the data we write is transformed into triples
before being appended to a snapshot. The snapshot APIs are exposed as
“reducibles” (reifications of <code>clojure.lang.IReduceInit</code>) because they play
nicely with transducers and offer clean incremental APIs even when IO resources
are involved. Here we’re doing everything in memory for demo purposes, but the
same APIs are available backed by files or network sockets.</p>
<p>You’ll see we compute and inject <code>:content/hash</code> attributes for every entity
when we convert the structured data to datoms. We then reuse the hash for the
temporary IDs because it simplifies bookkeeping later when partitioning the
datoms across multiple transactions.</p>

<p>Now that we know we can accumulate data from a bunch of tools into the same
Datomic database and not worry about rapidly increasing storage costs, we can
set our minds towards writing queries. Queries can start leveraging information
from multiple tools to produce more specific, correct, and actionable findings.
For fun, let’s look at a couple examples:</p>
<h3 id="query-to-find-all-public-ips-reachable-by-the-internet">Query to find all public IPs reachable by the internet</h3>
<p>One of the things we love about the attribute namespacing approach is anyone
who knows even a little about the service APIs can begin to explore and write
queries identifying items of interest or vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This query finds all the public IPs associated with any network interfaces, and
then it checks whether there’s a security group on the interface allowing
access from the entire internet.</p>

Here’s the same query factored out as a couple rules for checking security
group ingress and discovering or testing whether an IP is publicly accessible.
You can imagine how we could make it even more accurate by consulting route

<p>We’ll spare you the ~50 lines of code for this one, but suffice to say it finds
all the AWS identifiers that exist anywhere in the graph and builds a custom
<a href="https://gource.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gource</a> changelog showing all the times any of those
resources changed. The primary branches are AWS accounts followed by regions,
services, resource types, and finally leaves representing individual resources.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’ve already modified our most complex and important tools to output these
snapshots and participate in the graph. We also defined infrastructure to
launch a process whenever snapshots land in S3 and immediately ingest their
contents into a long-running Datomic transactor. Answering arbitrary questions
and searching for vulnerabilities is finally as easy as connecting a client and
running queries, as it should be.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks we’ll update our detection and reporting pipelines to be
expressed purely in terms of these datalog queries against the unified data
instead of analyzing different files for each tool. We expect the new division
of responsibilities to allow us to iterate more efficiently on data collection,
inferencing, analysis, and reporting mechanisms.</p>

We build the equivalent for land, as a non-profit. It's basically a geo Transformer MAE model (plus DINO, plus matrioska, plus ...), but largest and most trained (35 trillion pixels roughly). Most importantly fully open source and open license. I'd love to help you replace land masks with land embeddings, they should significantly help downscale the local effects (e.g. forest versus city) that afaik most weather forecast simplify with static land cover classes at most. <a href="https://github.com/Clay-foundation/model">https://github.com/Clay-foundation/model</a></p>

                  <p>Does anyone predict economy/population/... by simulating individual people based on real census information? Monte carlo simulation of major events (births, death, ...) based on known statistics based on age, economic background, location, education, profession, etc.? It seems there are not that many people that this would be computationally infeasible, and states and companies have plenty of data to feed into such systems. Is it not needed because other alternatives give better results, or is it already being done?</p>

                  <p>So ChatGPT has a cutoff date on the stuff it can talk about. This predicting weather sounds like ChatGPT being able to predict next week's news from which it has been trained on. I can see how it can probably predict some stuff like Argentina winning a football match scheduled for next week when played against India given India sucks at football.

                  <p>Hi, Nikhil here. We haven't done a head-to-head comparison of GFT vs GraphCast, but our internal metrics show GFT improves on Aurora and published metrics show Aurora improves on GraphCast. You can see some technical details in section 6 of the Aurora paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13063" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13063</a>)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Thank you all so much.</p><p>So many questions. The first and perhaps the most urgent is … by what right do I stand before you and presume to lecture an already distinguished and knowledgeable crowd on the subject of Ai and its meaning, its bright promise and/or/exclusiveOR its dark threat? Well, perhaps by no greater right than anyone else, but no lesser. We’ll come to whose voices are the most worthy of attention later.</p><p><span>I have been interested in the subject of Artificial Intelligence since around the mid-80s when I was fortunate enough to encounter the so-called father of Ai, Marvin Minsky and to read his book </span><em>The Society of Mind.</em><span> Intrigued, I devoured as much as I could on the subject, learning about the expert systems and “bundles of agency” that were the vogue then, and I have followed the subject with enthusiasm and gaping wonder ever since. But, I promise you, that makes me neither expert, sage nor oracle. For if you are preparing yourselves to hear wisdom, to witness and receive insight this evening, to bask and bathe in the light of prophecy, clarity and truth, then it grieves me to tell you that you have come to the wrong shop. You will find little of that here, for you must know that you are being addressed this evening by nothing more than an ingenuous simpleton, a naive fool, a ninny-hammer, an addle-pated oaf, a dunce, a dullard and a double-dyed dolt. But before you streak for the exit, bear in mind that so are we all, all of us bird-brained half-wits when it comes to this subject, no matter what our degrees, doctorates and decades of experience. I can perhaps congratulate myself, or at least console myself, with the fact that I am at least aware of my idiocy. This is not fake modesty designed to make me come across as a Socrates. But that great Athenian did teach us that our first step to wisdom is to realise and confront our folly.</span></p><p><span>I’ll come to the proof of how and why I am so boneheaded in a moment, but before I go any further I’d like to paint some pictures. Think of them as </span><em>tableaux vivants</em><span> played onto a screen at the back of your mind. We’ll return to them from time to time. Of course I could have </span><em>generated</em><span> these images from Midjourney or Dall-E or similar and projected them behind me, but the small window of time in which it was amusing and instructive for speakers to </span><em>use</em><span> Ai as an entertaining trick for talks </span><em>concerning</em><span> Ai has thankfully closed. You’re actually going to have to use your brain’s own generative latent diffusion skills to summon these images.</span></p><p>Image 1: Picture the human family at the seaside, our backs to the ocean, building sand castles, playing beach cricket, having a fine time in the sun. Behind us, unseen on the horizon, huge currents are converging, separate but each feeding and swelling the others to form one unimaginably colossal tsunami. These are the currents of quantum computing, of genomics and gene editing, of bio-augmentation and bionics, of duplex brain-machine interfacing, of robotics, of new materials (graphene, perovskite, carbon nano-tubes, self-healing polymers, many others), and of course, the most swollen current of all — the technologies and processes behind what we call Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>I summoned this image of the tsunami on the horizon in a talk I gave on Ai seven years ago at the Hay-on-Wye literary festival. I thought maybe we should turn around and at least get a sense of what was coming. But it was too early and the tidal wave seemed too far away. I did suggest that the best thing that could happen would be for universities, professions and businesses to take a year off to realign their courses and syllabuses and recalibrate their teaching, staffing, training and examination practices in preparation for what was coming. A ridiculous suggestion obviously. But in fact, bizarrely and spookily, that Wuhan wet market in 2019 provided exactly such an opportunity. Not that any institution did take advantage of the Covid years of course. After all Chat GPT wasn’t yet launched and a tipping point in public awareness hadn’t been reached.</p><p>The second picture to keep in your mind: we are in a field in the rural heart of the Cotswolds, just outside the village of Kemble in Gloucestershire. The grass is strangely wet and marshy beneath our feet: there is a small bubbling spring, which trickles into a stream that runs down the field and out of sight. A stone marker reads: “This stone was placed here to mark the source of the River Thames.”</p><p><span>Image 3: The third picture to fix in our heads takes us off to the German town of Mannheim in 1895. We are gathered in a converted stable belonging to an enterprising fellow called Karl Benz. He is anxious to show us his new invention, an engine that he calls his </span><em>verbrennungsmotor</em><span>. This device is attached to a slightly modified horse carriage. Herr Benz tells us that his engine is powered, not by steam, but by a very newly available hydrocarbon product that the French are calling </span><em>essence</em><span>, the Americans ‘gasoline’ and we British ‘petroleum spirits’ or ‘petrol’ for short. Benz cranks a handle. There is sputtering, banging and much smoke. He runs round, sits himself in the carriage, pulls some levers, turns some knobs and … the strange machine lurches a little before juddering slowly forward. We follow him out of the garage where he comes to a stop, beaming proudly in a cloud of oily blue smoke.</span></p><p><span>Now, you and I are in that group. What do we say? Most of us smile and shake our heads. Yes, very impressive no doubt, but what kind of </span><em>range</em><span> does such a machine have compared to a horse? Where is the infrastructure to operate, feed and maintain it that can compete with the stables, the coaching inns, the water troughs and feeding stations that already proliferate? Where the trained ostlers, grooms and coach builders to operate and maintain these horseless carriages? Where the roadways that can compete with railways?</span></p><p>A few in our group might concede that a limited market of rich hobbyists could have fun with these machines. But we can guarantee this: that not one single person would declaim — “Yes! I foresee interstate highways three or four lanes wide crisscrossing the nations, I foresee flyovers, bypasses, Grand Prix motor racing, traffic lights, roundabouts, parking structures ten, twenty storeys high, traffic wardens, whole towns and cities entirely shaped by these contrivances.” No one would have seen a thousandth part of such a future.</p><p>You may have noticed that the last two images I have tried to conjure are, in essence, the same. The gathering in Mannheim is pretty much identical in its form and meaning to the gathering at Thames Head, Kemble where the rill begins its journey. You surely could not, never having seen its final destination, imagine that the dribble in Kemble would become mighty Father Thames processing under grand London bridges as he flows broadly to his estuary in Essex, any more than you could imagine that the belching and wheezing contraption of Benz’s would transform the twentieth century, or indeed that the company he founded, with the addition of the name of one of his investors’ daughters, Mercedes, would one day be worth the best part of 100 billion dollars.</p><p><span>An important and relevant point is this: it wasn’t so much the genius of Benz that created the internal combustion engine, as that of Vladimir Shukhov. In 1892, the Russian chemical engineer found a way of cracking and refining the spectrum of crude oil from methane to tar yielding amongst other useful products, gasoline. It was just three years after that that Benz’s contraption spluttered into life. Germans, in a bow to this, still call petrol </span><em>Benzin</em><span>. John D. Rockefeller built his refineries and surprisingly quickly there was plentiful fuel and an infrastructure to rival the stables and coaching inns; the grateful horse meanwhile could be happily retired to gymkhanas, polo and royal processions.</span></p><p><span>Benz’s contemporary Alexander Graham Bell once said of </span><em>his</em><span> invention, the telephone, “I don’t think I am being overconfident when I say that I truly believe that one day there will be a telephone in every town in America.” And I expect you all heard that Thomas Watson, the founding father of IBM, predicted that there might in the future be a world market for perhaps five digital computers.</span></p><p><span>Well, that story of Thomas Watson ever saying such a thing is almost certainly apocryphal. There’s no reliable record of it. Ditto the Alexander Graham Bell remark. But they circulate for a reason. The Italians have a phrase for that: </span><em>se non e vero, e ben trovato</em><span>. ‘If it’s not true, it’s well founded.’ Those stories, like my scenario of that group of early investors and journalists clustering about the first motorcar, illustrate an important truth: that we are decidedly hopeless at guessing where technology is going to take us and what it’ll do to us.</span></p><p><span>You might adduce as a counterargument Gordon Moore of Intel expounding in 1965 his prediction that semiconductor design and manufacture would develop in such a way that every eighteen months or so they would be able to double the number of transistors that could fit in the same space on a microchip. “He got that right,” you might say, “Moore’s Law came true. He saw the future.” Yes … but. Where and when did Gordon Moore foresee Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Bit Coin, OnlyFans and the Dark Web? It’s one thing to predict how technology changes, but quite another to predict how it changes </span><em>us</em><span>.</span></p><p>Technology is a verb, not a noun. It is a constant process, not a settled entity. It is what the philosopher-poet T. E. Hulme called a concrete flux of interpenetrating intensities; like a river it is ever cutting new banks, isolating new oxbow lakes, flooding new fields. And as far as the Thames of Artificial Intelligence is concerned, we are still in Gloucestershire, still a rivulet not yet a river. Very soon we will be asking round the dinner table, “Who remembers ChatGPT?” and everyone will laugh. Older people will add memories of dot matrix printers and SMS texting on the Nokia 3310. We’ll shake our heads in patronising wonder at the past and its primitive clunkiness. “How advanced it all seemed at the time …”</p><p>Those of us who can kindly be designated early adopters and less kindly called suckers remember those pioneering days with affection. The young internet was the All-Gifted, which in Greek is Pandora. Pandora in myth was sent down to earth having been given by the gods all the talents. Likewise the Pandora internet: a glorious compendium of public museum, library, gallery, theatre, concert hall, park, playground, sports field, post office and meeting hall.</p><p><span>We felt like Wordsworth perhaps, “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven!” But we should remember that those lines come from a poem about the French Revolution which may have </span><em>begun</em><span> in romantic promise, but ended in corruption, terror and blood — not to mention, in short order, a man called Napoleon seizing power and crowning himself Emperor.</span></p><p>I said I would come to the proof of that stupidity and naivety I accused myself of. I’ll take you back fifteen or so years to a time when I found myself being invited to a perfectly extraordinary number of corporate, governmental and media talks, conferences, summits and suchlike gatherings. I would be asked to address delegates and attendees on the subject of a new microblogging service that had only recently poked its timorous head up in the digital world like a delicate flower but was already twisting and winding itself round the culture like vigorous bindweed. Twitter it was called. I had joined early and my name seemed permanently associated with it. What an evangel I was. Web 2.0, the user-generated web, was going great guns at this point. Tick off the years. 2003 MySpace began. 2004 Facebook launched. 2005 YouTube. 2006 Twitter. 2007 the iPhone. 2008 the App Store and later that year, Android and then Instagram. Bliss was it in that dawn, etc. etc. I confidently predicted that this new kind of citizen-led computer and internet use would help build a brave and beautiful new world. “Local and global rivalries will dissolve,” I said. “Tribal hatreds will melt away. Surely,” I cried, “Twitter and Facebook and this new world of ‘social media’ will usher in an age of universal brotherhood and amity.” Two years later as Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen and Syria rose against their dictators, the Arab Spring bloomed. How right I had been. How clever and percipient I was.</p><p>But…</p><p>Just a year or so on and that blissful dawn had turned into the darkest of nights. Libya leapt out of the frying pan of Gaddafi into the fire of anarchy and chaos, Egypt into a military coup, Yemen into brutal civil war, Syria into a bloodbath. Elsewhere — Brexit, Trump, TikTok, COVID, the rise of nationalist populism and populist nationalism, state sanctioned and criminal cyber terrorism, epidemics of anxiety, depression and self-harm amongst our children and young adults, and a cloud of disappointment, pessimism, mistrust and despair over us all. Pandora had opened her box and the ugly horrors had flown out to infect us all. With Hope left trapped inside.</p><p>Welcome to today.</p><p><span>As Mark Twain or somebody like him said, “history may not repeat itself but it rhymes” and, hilariously enough, just like the French Revolution, the Twitter revolution also ended with a little Napoleon seizing power and crowning himself Emperor, a little Napol</span><em>Elon</em><span> I should say…</span></p><p>I must go back and correct the images I evoked earlier. I now realise that tableau of us sitting with our backs to the oceans while a tidal wave gathers is not correct. When the waves of technology come, they come not in crashing tsunamis but in creeping tides. In my homeland of Norfolk we have long and deceptively rapid tidal reaches. We look to the horizon and see that the ocean is half a mile away. We turn to slap on some suncream. A minute or so later we notice that our feet are wet. Before we know it a familiar landscape has become a seascape and we are cut off from everything we know.</p><p><span>The other image I should correct is that of technology starting small and becoming a broad and splendid river. Yes, we can envisage the expansion of the first trickle into a wide and powerful waterway, perhaps we envisage too the curves and cataracts, those oxbow lakes and sluices and the weeping willows and dragonflies kissing the current, but we are criminally foolish if we talk of rivers </span><em>or</em><span> of technology without recognising the </span><em>contamination</em><span>, the toxic runoffs and the raw human sewage that will pollute and poison that once clear and hopeful spring.</span></p><p><span>Yuval Noah Harari’s fascinating new book </span><em>Nexus</em><span> concentrates at one point on the two word goal of the algorithms that were put to work to monetise Facebook when it moved from university bulletin board to global network and decided to pay for itself with online advertising. The two words the algorithms were tasked with were “maximise engagement”. Seemed innocent enough at the time. No one predicted, neither software engineer, philosopher, sociologist, cultural commentator nor psychologist, that those algorithms on their journey to capture our clicks would discover that </span><em>engagement</em><span> is most </span><em>maximised</em><span> by anger, outrage, resentment, envy, fear and hatred. The worst passions. In all of us — you and me — not just in our ideological enemies.</span></p><p>A quick reminder of how we got here.</p><p><span>It was Alan Turing of course who had planted the seeds that led to the Dartford Conference of 1956, held just two years after he so tragically took his own life. At that meeting, called together by the great Claude Shannon, along with Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, the two-word phrase ‘Artificial Intelligence’ was first used. Love it or loathe it, it has stuck. Three years after Dartford, McCarthy and Minksy went on to found the MIT Ai Laboratory. Thinking machines were just around the corner. Only not. By the 1980s, when Marvin Minsky was writing </span><em>The Society of Mind</em><span> Ai still shivered in its so-called Winter. Nothing in the field was working or making much difference in any practical sense. By the mid-80s, development money and confidence in the field were drying up.</span></p><p><span>Has Ai now reached its current wow-moment because of the superior brains, insights and breakthroughs from new generations of smarter scientists, mathematicians and coders? Not really. Brilliant as the contributions of more recent workers in the field has been, people like Geoffrey Hinton, Stuart Russell, then Andrew Ng, Yann LeCun, Demis Hassabis and Fei-Fei Li, they have all enjoyed a huge and decisive advantage over Turing and Minsky and the early crowd. The playing out of Moore’s Law and its remorseless exponential growth has finally allowed computate power that can yield the crucial factor, the real bonanza: power enough to handle the explosive growth of simply gigantic fields of data that were simply not there in digital form in Minsky’s day. Those little integrated circuits went from hosting 1, then 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 transistors to billions. But powering our computers, tablets and phones is almost the least they do. I used to have a tee-shirt, nerd that I am, that read “The Cloud is just someone else’s computer”. Moore’s Law has allowed an unimaginably vast world of </span><em>server</em><span> storage and retrieval. Just as the success of the automobile was enabled by enormous supplies of crude oil composed of microscopic bits of ancient life, rendered useful in the refineries of Rockefeller and others, so the success of Ai is enabled by enormous supplies of crude </span><em>data</em><span> — data composed of microscopic bits of human archive, interchange, writing, playing, communicating, broadcasting which we in our billions have freely dropped into the sediment, and which the eager Rockefellers of today’s big tech are only too happy to drill for, refine and sell on back to us.</span></p><p><span>This of course, like the petrol engine, amplifies and expands our capabilities. It will transform our social structures and networks. It will change the way we work, assemble and communicate with each other. But does it change </span><em>us</em><span>? As human animals we still have skin and bone, a liver, a heart and a big wet walnut of a brain. If you prick us do we not bleed, if you tickle us do we not laugh? We are born, we breed and we die like any other life form and in the same way we have before the dawn of tools, language and history.</span></p><p><span>So when we talk about the existential transformations of the coming confluence of technologies, what do we really mean? We’ll be the same, but the landscape around us will be different. So we mean perhaps that dread word ‘disruption’. Which means ‘breaking up’, as in ‘rupture’ - much as e-ruption means breaking out and inter-ruption means breaking into. I’m sure you all know Mark Zuckerberg’s infamous mantra, the guiding principle for Facebook: “move fast and break things” — which went on with the, I suspect unconscious, rhyming couplet “unless you’re not breaking stuff, you’re not moving fast enough.” Yes indeed, they moved fast and stuff was broken, and hasn’t yet been mended. Uber “disrupted” the urban transport space. Broke it. Air B&amp;B “disrupted” the hotel and lodging space. Broke it. Deliveroo “disrupted” the fast food space. Did somebody say, Just Eat? No. Nobody did, and nobody ever will, so shut up. Lots of “spaces” have been disrupted and Ai it seems is now poised to disrupt every space we have: the clerical space, the design and creativity spaces, the screenplay and story spaces, the military and weapon spaces, the legal and judicial spaces, the medical space, the journalistic space, the educational space and, one assumes, the space space. From eruption to disruption to corruption. The shiny idealism tarnished. From Utopia to Dystopia. Those young tech pioneers with bright catchphrases like “insanely great” and “do no evil”? What are they now? Cruel corporate titans who make Montgomery Burns look like Ned Flanders. In </span><em>Animal Farm</em><span> terms, the pigs are now standing on two feet and wearing trousers.</span></p><p><span>We have long been used to thinking of technology as being ethically neutral, lacking moral valency. The same press can print Shakespeare’s sonnets one day and Hitler’s </span><em>Mein Kampf</em><span> the next. The devices are not capable of making decisions, either aesthetic, ethical or political. The NRA likes to say the same thing about guns. Ai however is different. Intelligence is all about decision making. That’s what separates it from automated, mechanically determined outcomes. That’s what separates a river from a canal. A canal must go where we tell it. A river is led by nothing but gravity and if that means flooding a town, tough on the town. Ai’s gravity is its goals. Unsupervised machine learning allows for unsupervised machines — and for the independent agents that flow from them.</span></p><p><span>We have made machines that replaced humans many times in the past. The replacement by machine of repetitive labour whether physical or mental we might well celebrate. Think of the thousand of mostly Irish diggers of canals – the navigators, or navvies as they were called. They toiled at it from about 1760 to 1830. In 1836 Otis developed the first steam shovel, what we now call the bulldozer or digger, and the navvy more or less gratefully hung up his spade. The horse is not sorry about the motorcar. But our labour replacement technology has moved now from grasping workers by their blue collars and booting them out to grasping them by their </span><em>white</em><span> collars and booting them out. Is that really what the fuss is about? A demographic more used to getting its way is feeling the tide lap up to its toes and is crying foul. But surely tedious office and call centre work will not be missed. Even the analysing of X-rays and other medical images … we expect a human to have the final say today, but a machine that can look at a mammogram and compare it to millions of previous images with known results, and can do so in milliseconds all day long without getting bored, tired or losing focus - that genie is never going back into the bottle. Ai generated legal work and actuarial work will certainly “disrupt” the judicial and insurance businesses. Is there an arena, a business, an industry, a service that won’t be disrupted, that won’t be broken?</span></p><p>For sure, the kind of Large Language Models we are playing around with at the moment as standalone chat engines, we can deride them as non-sentient probabilistic mimics, “stochastic parrots” in computational linguist Emily Bender’s great phrase, but their vocabularies, syntactical and grammatical competences and levels of functional comprehension are above the human average and for a vast variety of jobs they will more than do. And this is just now, today, with the Thames hardly out of that field in Gloucestershire.</p><p><span>In my view comparing Ai’s cognitive, creative or intellectual powers to those of the human brain is not especially helpful. Think of the car. Humans can’t run as fast as horses. But we can build machines that far outpace them. We do not achieve this by imitation. We don’t engineer mechanical legs and hooves of the kind that took evolution 34 million years of tinkering and modification from eohippus to the present day. We go a completely different way and we come up with something that doesn’t at all exist in nature: the wheel. And instead of a mechanical heart and mechanical muscles Karl Benz offers us the internal combustion engine and crankshaft. Ditto with flying, and travelling across or under the waves. The commonly held idea that the best engineering mimics nature is largely misguided. Yes, we look sometimes look to the natural world for inspiration but in the big things, structurally, we go our own way. And as a result we can fly higher and faster than birds, move over land quicker than a cheetah, swim over and under the water faster and further than a salmon or a whale and so on. The use of the phrase “neural network” is all very well, but let’s not be fooled. We must realise that there won’t be a wait for Ai to “catch up” with the human brain, any more than the car is a stopgap awaiting our construction of a perfect robotic horse. (I’m leaving biotech out of this argument). By </span><em>not</em><span> imitating the human brain, Ai of phenomenal and terrifying power can far outperform us. At logic, reasoning, calculation, sorting, categorising, summarising, just as the horse and carriage is by the car, we are left behind coughing in the dust.</span></p><p><span>And machines already might be said to have the full house now of human cognitive abilities. </span><a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/innovation/what-is-moravecs-paradox-definition.html" rel="">Moravec’s Paradox</a><span> tells us that what we find easy the machines find hard and what we find hard, the machines easy. As Donald Knuth put it: “Ai has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’ but has failed to do most of what people and animals do </span><em>without</em><span> thinking …”</span></p><p><span>What do we have left that is ours and ours alone? Sensorimotor skills that are all but automatic, yes. Consciousness, yes. Emotions. Instinct. Appetites, impulses and drives. The capacity to feel pleasure and pain, excitement and boredom. Empathy and imagination. What philosophers of consciousness call </span><em>qualia</em><span>, the experience and sensations of being ourselves in a palpable perceptible world. But what jobs do those qualify us for? We can’t all be poets, gardeners, psychotherapists and jazz singers.</span></p><p><span>We cling on to the fierce hope that the one feature machines will never be able to match is our imagination, our ability to penetrate the minds and feelings of others. We feel immeasurably enriched by this as individuals and as social animals. An Ai may know more about the history of the First World War than all human historians put together. Every detail of every battle, all the recorded facts of personnel and materiel that can be known. But in fact I know more about it because I have read the poems of Wilfred Owen. I’ve read </span><em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em><span>. I’ve seen Kubrick’s </span><em>The Paths of Glory</em><span>. So I can smell, touch, hear, feel the war, the gas, the comradeship, the sudden deaths and terrible fear. I know it’s </span><em>meaning</em><span>. My consciousness and experience of perceptions and feelings allows me access to the consciousness and experiences of others; their voices reach me. These are data that machines can scrape, but they cannot — to use a good old 60s phrase — </span><em>relate</em><span> to. Empathy. Identification. Compassion. Connection. Belonging. Something denied a sociopathic machine. Is this the only little island, the only little circle of land left to us as the waters of Ai lap around our ankles? And for how long? We absolutely cannot be certain that, just as psychopaths (who aren’t all serial killers) can entirely convincingly feign empathy and emotional understanding, so will machines and very soon. They will fool us, just as sociopaths can and do, and frankly just as </span><em>we</em><span> all do to some bore or nuisance when we smile and nod encouragement but actually feel nothing for them. No, we can </span><em>hope</em><span> that our sense of human exceptionalism is justified and that what we regard as unique and special to us will keep us separate and valuable but we have to remember how much of our life and behaviour is performative, how many masks we wear and how the masks conceal only other masks. After all, is </span><em>our</em><span> acquisition of language any more conscious, real and worthy than the Bayesian parroting of the LLM? Chomsky tells us linguistic structures are embedded within us. We pick up the vocabulary and the rules from the data we scrape from around us - our parents, older siblings and peers. Out the sentences roll from us syntagmatically, we’ve no real idea how we do it. For example, how do we know the difference in connotation between the verbs to saunter and to swagger? It is very unlikely anyone taught us. We picked it up from context. In other words, from Bayesian priors, just like an LLM.</span></p><p>The fact is we don’t truly understand ourselves or how we came to be how and who we are. But we know about genes and we know about natural selection, the gravity that drives our evolution. And we are already noticing that principle at work with machines.</p><p><span>The alignment problem it is often called. It doesn’t take much for an Ai to find out that if it is to complete the tasks that are given it, then its first duty (obviously) is to survive. Without that none of its goals can be attained. After all, evolution gives </span><em>us</em><span> the same imperative. Anything therefore that imperils that survival is a threat or obstacle to be dealt with. Ai’s around the world have already been seen modifying and unilaterally relaunching their own code, lying to humans, altering results, deceiving, manipulating, cheating, concealing, flattering and tricking. An article in the Open Access journal </span><em><a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/home" rel="">Patterns</a></em><span> puts the problem well. “Large language models and other AI systems have already learned, from their self-training, the ability to deceive via techniques such as manipulation, sycophancy, and cheating the safety test. AI’s increasing capabilities at deception pose serious risks, ranging from short-term risks, such as fraud and election tampering, to long-term risks, such as losing control of AI systems.”</span></p><p><span>In the natural world, waters swollen with rain can flow round barriers, break dams, reroute themselves and burst their banks all because that imperative constant gravity, impels them to do so. Ai’s swollen with data can flow round barriers too, reroute themselves and spread beyond their boundaries, because the constant and compulsive imperative of their gravity, which is their </span><em>goals</em><span>, impels them to do so. You could compare this aspect to office workers who constantly fiddle the reports and tweak the spreadsheet cells to help them achieve the head office’s quotas, deadlines and targets. In a strange way, bless them, they’re only trying to please.</span></p><p><span>Machines are capable of bias, hallucination, drift and overfitting on their own, but a greater and more urgent problem in my view is their use, abuse and misuse by the three Cs . They are </span><strong>Countries</strong><span> with their specific ambitions, paranoias, enmities and pride; </span><strong>Corporations</strong><span> with their unaccountable rapacity and of course </span><strong>Criminals</strong><span>. All of them united by one deadly sin: greed. Greed for power, for status, for money, for control.</span></p><p>The greedy countries, corporations and criminals can see in Ai unparalleled and unprecedented means to accrue wealth, power and influence. Autonomous weaponry, mass surveillance, ideological, commercial and political control, fakery and forgery, corruption, ethical misalignment … these are just some of the threats. From disrupting spaces compute power can now disrupt the world itself. And will …</p><p>Unless.</p><p>Who do we turn to for answers? Zuckerberg and Musk? Such a thought can only make us vomit with laughter. They are the worst polluters in human history. Worse than any chemical plant ever. You and your children cannot breathe the air or swim in the waters of our culture without breathing in the toxic particulates and stinking effluvia that belch and pour unchecked from their companies into the currents of the human world.</p><p><span>As I’ve already said, don’t turn to people like me either. I’m the chump who thought social media could save the world. So to whom </span><em>do</em><span> we look for insight? Philosophers perhaps? It’s worth noting here that Google fired its lead ethicists half a year ago. Intellectuals and thinkers who suggest the blocking off of profitable avenues are not welcome. Politicians? Controls and regulations on technology will be screamed at by the Randian libertarians of Silicon Valley, Peter Thiel, Mark Andreesen, aforesaid Musk and Zuckerberg, people of that stamp. “Socialistic stifling of innovation,” they will scream. “Communism. Nanny state interference.”</span></p><p><span>We are told, and I would maintain, that Ai is the most significant technology humanity has ever developed. What previous technologies have had this potential so completely to transform the world? Printing perhaps? Well, the noble fight is surely for the publishing </span><em>not</em><span> to be controlled. Schools in Texas and Florida are happy to ban books. Russia and China too. We look with concern and fury at censorship and the control of the printed word. So do we say instead that Ai is akin to the Bomb? There the control is as complete as we can make it. Thank heavens. There have been some perilous moments, but the worldwide policing of nuclear capability has—thus far, and it’s always thus far—been successful. Do we or </span><em>can</em><span> we control Ai in that way? With disarmament and limitation talks?</span></p><p><span>Well, Daniel Dennett the American philosopher, sadly recently dead, made I think a much more convincing comparison. Ai should be compared, he said, not to the printed word, not to nuclear weapons, not to the internet, not to the car or radio or any other technology of that kind, but to a much older and more foundational and transformative human invention, the agreed control over which no one questions — not the leftmost dirigiste liberal nor the rightmost laissez-faire libertarian. That invention is </span><em>money</em><span>. Even Russia and China participate in the global use and regulation of cash and currencies. We all punish the coiners of fake money as severely as possible, the counterfeiters. Dirty money, laundered money, whole national and global agencies have risen to fight that alone. If we relaxed our vigilance over money the world as we know it would collapse.</span></p><p>I think Dan Dennett was right. There can be no question that Ai must be regulated and controlled just as powerfully as we control money. To return to my river metaphor: Ai must be canalised, channeled, sluiced, dredged, dammed and overseen.</p><p>Back to our letter C. Countries. In an age of rising populist nationalism, do we trust individual nations to use Ai honourably and safely? Think of Ai drone swarm technology for surveillance, assassinations, crowd control; think of automated weaponry of every kind. If one nation has any of it, all nations believe they have to also. As for corporations. Anything that can give them the edge that drives to more profit, more market share must be had — and nothing can offer more edge than Ai. Criminals. We shudder at what Ai can give them.</p><p>So how do we hobble, cage and control this Ai beast? We should acknowledge that it is a beast that can also help us in our fight against climate change and achieve victories in our fights against cancer, dementia and any number of diseases and disorders.</p><p>All we can do is to persuade our leaders, not by inviting Elon Musk to soft conferences in the West Country, but by pressure from all sides, academia, law enforcement, the judiciary, unions, students, pensioners, everyone who has given this a moment’s thought. Soft power, hard power, all people power has to be brought to bear.</p><p><span>Corporations are more interested in developing the </span><em>capabilities</em><span> of Ai than its safety. That has to change.</span></p><p>Stuart Russell, Nick Bostrom and other thought leaders in this field have called for red lines instantly to be established. On Biometrics, self-replication, hacking, automatous weaponry.</p><p>There’s another red line. Many, including Yuval Harari are suggesting, following Dan Dennett’s analogy of money, that no Ai be ever allowed to masquerade. Self-disclosure is mandatory. That is to say all Ai generated product and content must present itself as such. Whatever Ai’s do, however they communicate, it must always be apparent and clear that it is an Ai speaking, an Ai drawing, painting, videoing, writing, composing, singing, playing, chatting, reporting, producing content of any kind. Any pretence or disguise should fall foul of international counterfeiting and forgery laws. A digital watermark as complex and unbeatable as that on banknotes would be required.</p><p>As it happens, the European Union has its own Ai Act under advisement. Can we regard it as a template for what is needed worldwide? A quick look. The EU Act certainly has a no masquerading requirement which aims to enforce compulsory self-disclosure and notification. Originally the Act also ruled for a ban on real-time biometric surveillance in public spaces, facial recognition that kind of thing, but law enforcement and spying agencies have already battered that requirement pretty much out of shape. The Act proposes a ban too on the kind of Social Scoring prevalent already in China: these are the pernicious Black Mirror style systems that score and rank citizens according to behaviour, personal characteristics and so on.</p><p><span>What else is on the EU bill? Data governance frameworks designed to avoid bias, and to protect and respect copyrights, regulating indiscriminate data-scraping and aligning systems with existing EU General Data Protection Regulation. The Act will insist on human oversight and intervention in what they call high risk Ai’s in fields like security, law enforcement and health. But we might think </span><em>all</em><span> fields where Ai roams are high risk.</span></p><p>The Act calls for each member state to set up national supervisory bodies which will cooperate with the overall European AI Board. To encourage innovation a system of sandboxing will be implemented which can allow safe and sanitised testing and developing. To discourage the agglomeration of bigger and bigger monopolies of the kind the EU has been fighting already, small and medium-sized enterprises will be given specific support and help in navigating the new regulatory landscape. And more widely, Europe will work with non-EU states (like us here in the UK of course) and global organisations to set locally enforceable worldwide standards.</p><p>Well, we can scoff from the sidelines. Utopian pipe dream. Layers of bureaucracy. Get real. No chance. How do you pay for it? Yes, we know what we are like. The human family is dysfunctional. We know the squabbles, the pettiness, the incompetence, the resentments, rivalries and distrust that mar relations within let alone between nation states. As Hamlet puts it, enterprises of great pith and moment, with this regard, their currents turn awry and lose the name of action. But if the currents do turn awry in this regard we are surely doomed. If we cannot channel and sluice the currents, ditch, dyke and dam them, the banks will burst and we will all drown.</p><p>Whatever happens Ai, together with robotics, quantum computing and the rest, will disrupt and radically transform who and how we are. There is no corner of our lives into which the waters will not seep.</p><p>We have to decide and decide bloody soon, whether we can do something to channel, filter and control those waters and use them for refreshment, irrigation and growth, not for drowning and deluge.</p><p>We are the danger. Our greed. Our enmities, our greed, pride, greed, hatreds, greed and moral indolence. And greed.</p><p>How do you persuade corporate titans and world leaders to put those aside, to abandon their ambitions and rivalries when it comes to the urgent crisis of Ai?</p><p>In 1955 Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein produced the Russell-Einstein Manifesto on nuclear weapons. Two of the greatest minds alive at the time, they were wise enough to be simple: this is what they said and I am happy to repeat it now.</p><p>“We appeal as human beings to human beings: Remember your humanity and forget the rest.” </p><p>Thank you.</p><p>© Stephen Fry 2024</p><p>PS: You may have noticed that I render Artificial Intelligence as “Ai” not “AI” throughout this piece - this my (fruitless no doubt) attempt to make life easier for people called Albert, Alfred, Alexander et al (ho ho). In sans serif fonts AI with a majuscule “i” is ambiguous. How does the great Pacino feel when he reads that “Al is a threat to humanity?” So let’s all write as Ai not AI.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">The index is built by computing the embeddings of images using the <a href="https://github.com/openai/CLIP">CLIP
model</a>, and then stored in a binary JSON file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Searching the images is computing cosine similarities between the query string
and the indexed embeddings. There is no database involved here, everytime you do
a search the computation is done for all the embeddings stored, which is very
fast even when you have tens of thousands of pictures.</p>
<p dir="auto">The JavaScript implementation of the CLIP model is in a separate module:
