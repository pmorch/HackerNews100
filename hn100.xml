      was inspired by the Maxwell's daemon of physics and thermodynamics.  (My background is Physics.)  Maxwell's daemon was an
      imaginary agent which helped sort molecules of different speeds and worked tirelessly in the background.  We fancifully began to use the
      word <i> daemon</i> to describe background processes which worked tirelessly to perform system chores.  I found a very good explanation

        <blockquote>
          <p><span color="#008000" face="Comic Sans MS">I am interested in the origin of the word <i>daemon</i>.  I work in
          information technology and I have always heard of system processes referred to as daemons.  I assumed that it is an older spelling of
          <i>demon</i>.  Can you shed some light on this point?</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><span color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Why certainly.  Someone give us some of those phosphorescent genes
        that have recently been spliced to mice DNA and we'll shed light like mad.
        <i>  Demon</i> and <i> daemon</i> were once used interchangeably.  The former
        came to English from medieval Latin, while the latter was from classical Latin.  The earliest use appears to have been in the phrase
        <i>daemon of Socrates</i>, which was his "attendant, ministering, or indwelling spirit; genius".  That was in the late 14th century.  It
        was a short time later that the term <i> demon</i> came to refer to "an evil
        spirit" by influence of its usage in various versions of the Bible. The Greek form was used to translate Hebrew words for "lords, idols"
        and "hairy ones (satyrs)".  Wyclif translated it from Greek to English <i>fiend</i> or
        <i>devil</i>.  This is how the evil connotation arose.  By the late 16th century, the general supernatural meaning was being distinguished
        with the spelling <i>daemon</i>, while the evil meaning remained with <i>demon</i>.
        Today <i> daemon</i> can mean "a supernatural being of a nature intermediate
        between that of gods and men" or "a guiding spirit".</span></p>
        <p><span color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">[Warning: This paragraph is about science so, if this topic causes you
        undue alarm, please close your eyes until you've finished reading it.] The 19th century scientist
        James Maxwell once daydreamed (the polite term is "thought experiment") about a problem in physics.  He imagined a
        closed container which was divided in half.  In the middle of the divider was a tiny gate, just large enough to admit one molecule of
        gas.  This gate, in Maxwell's imagination, was operated by a tiny daemon.  This daemon observed the speed (i.e. temperature) of the
        molecules heading for the gate and, depending on the speed, let them through.  If he let only slow molecules pass from side A to side B and
        only fast molecules pass from side B to side A, then A would get hot while B cooled.  Maxwell's daemon was only imaginary, of course, but
        as it seemed to evade the laws of thermodynamics it caused quite a stir.  Eventually, though, the theory of quantum mechanics showed why
        it wouldn't work.  [OK, you may open your eyes, now.]</span></p>
        <p><span face="Comic Sans MS"><span color="#000000">As you probably know, the "system processes" called
        <i> daemons</i> monitor other tasks and perform predetermined actions depending on their
        behavior.  This is so reminiscent of Maxwell's daemon watching his molecules that we can only assume that whoever dubbed these "system
        processes" had Maxwell's daemon in mind.  Unfortunately, we have found no hard evidence to support this.&nbsp;

    <p><span color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS">Professor Jerome H. Saltzer, who also worked on
    Project MAC, confirms the Maxwell's demon explanation.&nbsp; He is
    currently working on pinpointing the origin of the erroneous acronym
    etymology for <i>daemon</i> in this sense.&nbsp; [We have edited Issue 129
    to reflect this confirmation of our original assumption.&nbsp; Isn't it
    wonderful to be able to trace a word to its source so cleanly?]</span>

  <p><span face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">While <i>au jus</i> does mean literally "with juice", it is short for
  <i>sauce au

  glance.&nbsp; OK, so maybe I could be an anti-curmudgeon after all.  Is there some
  requirement out there that I be consistent?</span></p>

 <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">RE: "and etc." and Ken Williams' comment about "with au jus", close but no cigar.
 <i> Avec</i> is French for "with"; <i> au</i> is French for "in".&nbsp; But, silly me, I just learned that from a high
 school friend.</span>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p><span face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Fred, but in this case <i>au</i> is
 usually translated as "with".&nbsp; Look at <i>cafe au lait</i>.&nbsp;
 You don't say "coffee in milk", do you?&nbsp; Tell your high school
 friend to study a bit harder, and don't believe everything you hear (the
 cardinal rule of critical thinking).</span></p><p><span face="Comic Sans MS">From
 Richard Hershberger:</span>
 </p><blockquote>
  <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">In the <i> Sez You</i> page of issue 145,  Ken Williams
  comments on the waitress who asked if he wanted his roast beef sandwich "with au jus", to which you
  responded with "Aaargh!"  While the waitress clearly was not fluent in French, her English was impeccable.&nbsp;
  English syntax requires a preposition in that construction.  "Au jus" lacks an English preposition,
  so she provided the one.  The fact that there is a French preposition in the phrase is irrelevant, since
  the construction as a whole has been adopted into English and reanalyzed to fit English syntax.  This is
  a normal process which has occurred innumerable times in the past.  It only seems incongruous because it is
  recent and because some of us have enough knowledge of French to recognize the original syntactical
  structure.</span>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p><span face="Comic Sans MS">Again, Barb and Malcolm ask, do you say
 "apple pie with <i>a la mode</i>"?&nbsp; They don't agree that the
 presence of a French preposition is irrelevant.&nbsp; To be consistent with
 constructions like "apple pie <i>a la mode</i>", one should not add
 an English preposition.&nbsp; The phrase <i>au jus</i> should be treated as an
 adjective if it isn't going to be parsed as a prepositional phrase.</span>

 </p><blockquote>
  <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">Slightly off topic regarding the discussion "and etc" and Ken Williams's
  comment about "with au juice" I would like to contribute these "Canadianisms" for your enjoyment.</span></p><p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">In Canada all labels must be in both official languages. To save space,
  these labels often use one common word between a French and an English descriptive word. As a result I have heard people refer to  "The Jeux
  Canada Games"  (Jeux Canada being the French name for The Canada Games) Another more common one is "old fort cheese" which I admit to using. Old
  fort cheese has almost become legitimate now. It has been used on  the CBC national radio programme "This Morning" at least twice, and if the
  CBC sanctions it, it must be correct.&nbsp; Thanks for many amusing discussions.</span>

  <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">This reminds me of an old joke (from

    <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">A manie Schollers went to steale Conies, and by the

  <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">Out of curiosity, my dictionary indicates that

 </blockquote>
 <p><span face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, all of these rabbit words are related.&nbsp;
 The English and Welsh forms come from the Latin, and it is thought that Latin
 borrowed it from an ancient Iberian language.&nbsp; Good joke, by the way!</span></p>

 not an acronym.&nbsp; Read our discussion of its etymology.&nbsp; A very
 important rule of etymology which we cannot repeat often enough: few English
 words derive from acronyms (<i>sonar</i>, <i>radar</i>, <i>scuba</i> are some
 examples); very few derive from acronyms before the 20th century (don't even
 try to suggest <i>posh</i>!.&nbsp; We don't count <i>okay</i> as an acronym: if
 it were one, it would be pronounced "ock"). Read our <a href="https://www.takeourword.com/Issue063.html#Spotlight">past

          pippali.</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><span size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">The most widely spoken language in Kenya, other than English, is Swahili. It's been a long, long time since I learned Swahili in the Peace Corps, but I still remember that the word for "pepper" is
        <i>pilipili</i>. It's easy to see how that could become <i>piripiri</i>. However, the term does not seem to have originated in Kenya's Indian community.</span></p>
        <p><span size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">The grammar of Swahili is
        Bantu. Most of its vocabulary is also Bantu, but it borrows many words from Arabic, Persian, Portuguese, German, and English, reflecting the region's trading and colonial history. According to the Oxford "Standard Swahili-English Dictionary,"
        <i> pilipili</i> is derived from a Persian word that I transliterate (with some difficulty, because I don't know the alphabet, and initial, medial, and final forms of letters are different) as
        <i> plpl</i> (vowels are not shown). Persian is closely related to Sanskrit, and the similarity to Sanskrit
        <i> pippali</i> is clear.</span></p>
        <p><i><span size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">Plpl</span></i> <span size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F"> immediately reminded me of Hebrew pilpul, a form of Talmudic disputation that involves close examination of minute distinctions. Sure enough,
        <i> pilpul</i> is the Aramaic word, and cognate to the Hebrew word, for "pepper," from, I'm guessing, either the finely divided nature of the ground spice or its fiery taste.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>To start, if you haven’t heard about the <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%23wpdrama">#wpdrama</a> that’s taken over WordPress in the last month, congratulations 😊. I imagine you’ve had a comparatively stress-free October, and hopefully got to spend lots of time outdoors.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoTToRfM3iA&amp;t=1s">many</a>, <a href="https://ikius.com/blog/wordpress-drama">many</a>, <a href="https://bullenweg.com/">many</a> posts, videos, and commentaries about everything that’s happened. I won’t go into the full details, but <strong>here’s a condensed version</strong> for those of you who are new here.</p>

<h4 id="wordpress"><a href="#wordpress">#</a>WordPress</h4>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is an open-source software platform for building websites. It’s what this site is built with 🧡. <a href="https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/what-can-i-do-with-it/">WP Fusion</a> is a plugin (another piece of software) that runs on your WordPress website, and helps you connect your website with your email marketing software.</p>
<p>By some estimates WordPress powers 43% of websites, so it’s kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>WordPress was created in 2003, based on another older piece of blogging software, by two guys named Mike and <strong>Matt</strong>.</p>
<p>Matt <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/organization/">continues to oversee development of WordPress</a>. He chooses who is allowed to work on it, and what features are prioritized for development.</p>
<h4 id="the-wordpress-foundation"><a href="#the-wordpress-foundation">#</a>The WordPress Foundation</h4>
<p><a href="https://wordpressfoundation.org/">The WordPress Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2010. Its main goal is to protect open-source software and ensure that WordPress remains freely available and developed by a global community.</p>
<p><strong>The foundation holds the trademarks</strong> to the WordPress logo <a href="https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/">and the name “WordPress”</a>, as well as “<a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a>“. The stated goal of the Foundation is to maintain the open-source nature of WordPress, independent from commercial interests.</p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> is the home of the free and open-source WordPress project. It’s where anyone can go to download WordPress for free. It’s also where development on WordPress is organized, and conversations around WordPress happen <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">in the official Slack channel</a>, tied to each user’s account on WordPress.org.</p>
<p>WordPress.org is also the home of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin repository</a>, which is a directory of over 60,000 free plugins that anyone can download and install on their WordPress website.</p>
<p>WordPress.org plays a critical role in <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/">ensuring plugins are secure and follow the open-source principles of the WordPress project</a> (free to use, modify, and distribute).</p>
<p>When a plugin author releases an update to a plugin on WordPress.org (like we regularly do with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fusion-lite/">the free WP Fusion Lite</a>), WordPress.org sends the update out to everybody else’s WordPress sites. It’s like the <em>App Store</em> of WordPress.</p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> is a commercial website-building platform. It uses the free WordPress software, but it’s a hosted service. That means you don’t need to worry about setting up your own hosting or downloading the software—everything is managed for you. <strong>WordPress.com is run by a for-profit company called Automattic. </strong></p>
<p>Automattic is widely considered the largest hosting company in the WordPress space. It also <a href="https://automattic.com/about/">owns popular brands</a> such as <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="https://jetpack.com/">Jetpack</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, and (I was surprised to learn) <a href="https://longreads.com/">Longreads</a>.</p>
<p>Automattic is a privately held company, and is <strong>backed by private equity firms</strong> such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tigerglobal.com/">Tiger Global Management</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://salesforceventures.com/">Salesforce Ventures</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://insightpartners.com/">Insight Venture Partners</a>, and <a href="https://automattic.com/press/">others</a>. They generate about US$700 million per year in revenue, and <strong>have been valued at US $7.5 billion</strong>.</p>
<p>The founder and CEO of Automattic is, <strong>you guessed it, Matt.</strong></p>
<h3 id="conflict-of-interest"><a href="#conflict-of-interest">#</a>Conflict of interest</h3>
<p>Some have raised concerns about the legality of this business arrangement. I won’t get into those here.</p>
<p><strong>I think it’s enough to point out the inherent conflict of interest</strong> in having the same person: a.) act as the public face of the WordPress community, b.) protect the WordPress trademarks, and b.) guide the development of the open-source WordPress project, all while c.) his majority stake in the for-profit Automattic has given him a net worth <a href="https://andsimple.co/cases/matt-mullenweg-net-worth/">close to US$400 million</a>.</p>
<p>Matt has styled himself as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">Benevolent Dictator for Life</a>, and we’re expected to trust that his priorities are aligned with promoting open source, fostering community well-being, and ensuring a level playing field for independent companies to thrive—without the risk of preferential treatment for Automattic or any other affiliated entities.</p>
<p>The drama over the past month (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1frdo1m/why_gutenberg_was_added_to_the_wordpress_core/">some might say over the past six years</a>), basically comes down to this conflict of interest, and <strong>to what degree you trust Matt to do the right thing</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-this-affects-wp-fusion"><a href="#how-this-affects-wp-fusion">#</a>How this affects WP Fusion</h3>
<p>On October 12th, Matt <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-plugin-no-longer-available-on-wordpress-org/">shocked many people in the WordPress community</a> by forcibly taking over a popular plugin on the wordpress.org repository called Advanced Custom Fields, which was in use on over 2 million websites.</p>
<p>“ACF” is <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/">developed by WP Engine</a>, a <strong>competitor of Automattic</strong>.</p>
<p>The plugin was re-titled “<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/">Secure Custom Fields</a>“, but otherwise unchanged. The plugin code, URL, file names, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/#reviews">thousands of reviews</a>, and even links to documentation still referenced Advanced Custom Fields, which is <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98321164&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">trademarked by WP Engine</a>.</p>

<p>WP Fusion also has a free plugin on wordpress.org, called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fusion-lite/">WP Fusion Lite</a>. We also have a registered trademark for the name WP FUSION.</p>
<p><strong>We are committed to making this plugin free, forever</strong>, to anyone who wants to integrate their WordPress website with their CRM.</p>
<p>Seeing ACF forcibly taken from its rightful owners, in violation of community standards (and possibly trademark law), left us scrambling to make sure our intellectual property was properly protected.</p>

<p><strong>Yes!</strong> The beautiful thing about WordPress, open source, and the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPL license</a> is that everything we create is free to read, modify, and redistribute as you see fit. </p>
<p>We borrow lots of code and ideas from other plugins, many other plugins <a href="https://fusewp.com/" rel="nofollow">borrow code and ideas from us</a>.</p>
<p>This fosters a vibrant and competitive marketplace, allowing anyone with a good idea to launch a new product without having to worry about being similar to something that is copyrighted by an established player.</p>
<p>However, while our code is free to copy, <strong>our trademark protects our business in <em>trade</em></strong>.</p>
<p>It’s how, when you purchase from us, you know you are getting the real WP Fusion from the original company who created, maintains, and supports it.</p>
<p>Somebody could take our code, rename it “Awesome CRM Connector”, create their own website and documentation, and <strong>this would be perfectly legal</strong> ✅</p>
<p>However, if someone built a website at https://<em>better</em>wpfusion.com/ and sold our plugin using our name and logo, this would be a trademark violation, as it has the potential to deceive customers as to who they are purchasing from.</p>
<p>Our code is free, but the trademark protects the many years we’ve spent establishing a brand identity and a reputation as creators of <a href="https://verygoodplugins.com/">Very Good Plugins</a> (our company name 🤓).</p>
<p>As <strong>Matt</strong> has stated repeatedly, <a href="https://www.lodhs.com/blog/defend-your-trademark-or-you-could-lose-it/">you have to protect your trademarks</a>.</p>
<h3 id="trademark-confusion-at-wordpress-com"><a href="#trademark-confusion-at-wordpress-com">#</a>Trademark confusion at WordPress.com</h3>
<p>In September 2023 it came to our attention that WordPress.com (the for-profit hosting service) had copied all of the free plugins from WordPress.org and was now displaying them in a private directory, exclusive to WordPress.com hosting customers.</p>
<p>These pages were made public, indexed by search engines, and <strong>in some cases ranked higher than the free versions on WordPress.org</strong>.</p>

<figcaption>WP Fusion Lite was copied onto wordpress.com without permission, and used to sell premium hosting plans.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Further, it was no longer clear that the plugins were free. The text next to each plugin reads, “<em>Free on Business plan</em>“, and clicking the link prompts you to create an account at WordPress.com <strong>and sign up for premium hosting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This created confusion</strong> among users who would contact our support (for paying customers), and expect priority responses or premium features because they had “paid” for the plugin, when they hadn’t paid us anything— they’d only paid WordPress.com for hosting.</p>
<p>While we knew about this for some time, I didn’t quite know <em>what to do about it</em>.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to start a legal dispute with Automattic and possibly damage our reputation.</p>
<p>And, generally, <strong>I trusted Matt</strong>. I assumed he had a competent legal team that had already reviewed the legality of copying our plugins, and that he was acting in the best interest of the community.</p>
<h3 id="the-cease-and-desist"><a href="#the-cease-and-desist">#</a>The cease and desist</h3>
<p>The events of the past month have made me realize a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don’t trust Matt.</li>
<li>Matt doesn’t appear to be taking advice from legal counsel.</li>
<li>Always defend your trademarks.</li>
</ol>
<p>With those points in mind <a href="https://x.com/verygoodplugins/status/1845246925886353795">we sent a cease and desist letter to Automattic and WordPress.com</a> on October 12th, asking for WP Fusion Lite to be removed from WordPress.com due to the potential for confusion regarding the affiliation of the WP Fusion brand.</p>

<figcaption>Our letter to Automattic</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>This was a difficult decision to make, as Matt has been known to use the resources of WordPress.org <a href="https://bullenweg.com/">to personally retaliate</a> against perceived threats to Automattic.</p>
<p>There was a very real chance we would be removed from the free .org repository as well, blocked from the Make WordPress Slack, and/or banned from sponsoring future WordCamps (we sponsored WCAsia in 2024 and look forward to sponsoring WCEU in 2025).</p>
<p>Thankfully <strong>WP Fusion Pro <em>does not</em> require the free version</strong> to function, and we have been delivering updates to our paying customers via our own servers for many years.</p>
<p>We had a plan in place to begin delivering Lite updates via our own servers if the worst came to pass.</p>

<p>They have agreed to take down the listing from wordpress.com, and it is no longer available at <a href="https://wordpress.com/plugins/wp-fusion-lite">https://wordpress.com/plugins/wp-fusion-lite</a>.</p>
<p>The top result in searches for “WP Fusion Lite” is again the WordPress.org listing, <strong>where anyone can download the plugin for free</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s been a stressful week, but I’m glad we were able to resolve the situation amicably, and clear up any potential confusion for our users.</p>
<h3 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next">#</a>What’s next?</h3>
<p>It seems like every week there is another unexpected move from Matt that throws the WordPress community into chaos.</p>
<p>I wish it were all over, but it doesn’t show any sign of ending soon.</p>
<p>I would like to imagine a future where Matt is either the CEO of Automattic, <em><span>or</span></em> the champion of the open source project.</p>
<p>I have nothing against him personally— I hear that he’s a great person to work for, and I’m appreciative of all the things he’s done for the open source movement. But as long as Matt’s motivations with WordPress are tied to his profits at Automattic, he can’t be trusted.</p>

    <h2>A Reading Note</h2>
  </header>

  

  <section>
    <p>In <em>The Unaccountability Machine,</em> Dan Davies argues that organizations form “accountability sinks,” structures that absorb or obscure the consequences of a decision such that no one can be held directly accountable for it. Here’s an example: a higher up at a hospitality company decides to reduce the size of its cleaning staff, because it improves the numbers on a balance sheet somewhere. Later, you are trying to check into a room, but it’s not ready and the clerk can’t tell you when it will be; they can offer a voucher, but what you need is a room. There’s no one to call to complain, no way to communicate back to that distant leader that they’ve scotched your plans. The accountability is swallowed up into a void, lost forever.</p>

<p>Davies proposes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For an accountability sink to function, it has to break a link; it has to prevent the feedback of the person affected by the decision from affecting the operation of the system.</p>
  <cite><a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/unaccountability-machine">Davies, <em>The Unaccountability Machine</em>, page 17</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you start looking for accountability sinks, you see them all over the place. When your health insurance declines a procedure; when the airline cancels your flight; when a government agency declares that you are ineligible for a benefit; when an investor tells all their companies to shovel so-called AI into their apps. Everywhere, broken links between the people who face the consequences of the decision and the people making the decisions.</p>

<p>That’s assuming, of course, that a person <em>did</em> make a decision at all. Another mechanism of accountability sinks is the way in which decisions themselves cascade and lose any sense of their origins. Davies gives the example of the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Voting_Systems_v._Fox_News_Network">Dominion Systems vs Fox News</a>, in which Fox News repeatedly spread false stories about the election. No one at Fox seems to have explicitly made a decision to lie about voting machines; rather, there was an implicit understanding that they had to do whatever it took to keep their audience numbers up. At some point, someone had declared (or else strongly implied) that audience metrics were the only thing that mattered, and every subsequent decision followed out from that. But who can be accountable to a decision that wasn’t actually made?</p>

<p>It’s worth pausing for a moment to consider what we mean by “accountable.” Davies posits that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fundamental law of accountability: the extent to which you are able to change a decision is precisely the extent to which you can be accountable for it, and vice versa.</p>
  <cite><a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/unaccountability-machine">Davies, <em>The Unaccountability Machine</em>, page 17</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is useful. I often refer back to <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/on-accountability">Sidney Dekker’s definition of accountability</a>, where an account is <em>something that you tell.</em> How did something happen, what were the conditions that led to it happening, what made the decision seem like a good one at the time? Who were all of the people involved in the decision or event? (It almost never comes down to only one person.) All of those questions and more are necessary for understanding how a decision happened, which is a prerequisite for learning how to make better decisions going forward.</p>

<p>If you combine those two frameworks, you could conclude that to be accountable for something you must have the power to change it <em>and</em> understand what you are trying to accomplish when you do. You need both the power <em>and</em> the story of how that power gets used.</p>

<p>The comparisons to AI are obvious, inasmuch as delegating decisions to an algorithm is a convenient way to construct a sink. But organizations of any scale—whether corporations or governments or those that occupy the nebulous space between—are already quite good at forming such sinks. The accountability-washing that an AI provides isn’t a new service so much as an escalated and expanded one. Which doesn’t make it any less frightening, of course; but it does perhaps provide a useful clue. Any effort that’s tried and failed to hold a corporation to account isn’t likely to have more success against an algorithm. We need a new bag of tricks.<img width="10" height="10" alt="" src="https://aworkinglibrary.com/img/stop.gif"></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>QUIC is expected to be a game-changer in improving web application performance. In this paper, we conduct a systematic examination of QUIC's performance over high-speed networks. We find that over fast Internet, the UDP+QUIC+HTTP/3 stack suffers a data rate reduction of up to 45.2% compared to the TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 counterpart. Moreover, the performance gap between QUIC and HTTP/2 grows as the underlying bandwidth increases. We observe this issue on lightweight data transfer clients and major web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera), on different hosts (desktop, mobile), and over diverse networks (wired broadband, cellular). It affects not only file transfers, but also various applications such as video streaming (up to 9.8% video bitrate reduction) and web browsing. Through rigorous packet trace analysis and kernel- and user-space profiling, we identify the root cause to be high receiver-side processing overhead, in particular, excessive data packets and QUIC's user-space ACKs. We make concrete recommendations for mitigating the observed performance issues.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <div>
            <p>Despite the huge variation in how autistic people experience the condition, they can be divided into just four subgroups, according to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.15.24312078" target="_blank">preprint</a>. The people in these groups—who share similar traits and life outcomes—carry gene variants that implicate distinct biological pathways, the researchers found.</p>
<p>Each group is associated with specific genetic variants that influence gene expression at different stages of development, the investigation revealed. The work includes genetic and phenotypic data from more than 5,000 autistic children.</p>
<p>Identifying autism subtypes has been on the minds of autism researchers for many years, says <a href="https://www.jcu.edu/profile/thomas-frazier-phd" target="_blank">Thomas Frazier</a>, professor of psychology at John Carroll University, who was not involved in the work. “But what’s really cool is that they link that to the underlying biology. To my knowledge, this is the first study to do this in a comprehensive, replicable way.”</p>
<p>Autism traits vary dramatically from person to person, and that diversity is reflected in the hundreds of genetic variants linked to the condition. But in most cases, genetic differences haven’t been reliably mapped to autism traits, and two people with the same variant can show different phenotypes.</p>
<p>That lack of progress could stem from focusing on a single trait at the expense of the interactions among multiple genetic variants, says lead investigator <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/ogt" target="_blank">Olga Troyanskaya</a>, professor of computer science and integrative genomics at Princeton University and deputy director for genomics at the Flatiron Institute. “It’s not as simple as a single variant associated with a single phenotype. It’s a highly complex process,” she says. (The Flatiron Institute, and the datasets Troyanskaya’s team used in the study, are funded by the Simons Foundation, <em>The Transmitter</em>’s parent organization.)</p>


<p>Instead, Troyanskaya and her colleagues investigated the variants associated with a person’s collection of characteristics. They applied a statistical model to data on the traits and behaviors of 5,392 autistic people from the <a href="https://www.sfari.org/resource/spark/" target="_blank">SPARK</a> research cohort. By adjusting the number of groups, the team found the most significant similarities among participants when the model sorted the cohort into four autism subtypes.</p>
<p>The largest group—consisting of 1,976 people—shows mild challenges in core autism traits, whereas the smallest—554 people—has severe difficulties across those same traits. The other two subtypes are somewhere in between: One group specifically experiences social challenges and disruptive behavior, and the other shows developmental delay and difficulties in select traits.</p>
<p>
    T</p><p>
he algorithm organized data from an independent cohort, the <a href="https://www.sfari.org/resource/simons-simplex-collection/" target="_blank">Simons Simplex Collection</a> (SSC), in a similar way, the team found. Considering the differences in the data—clinicians gather information for the SSC, whereas SPARK consists of parent-filled questionnaires—the consistency “is a very good sign that we’re finding true, clinically relevant biology here,” Troyanskaya says.</p>
<p>People belonging to the same subtype often share the same co-occurring diagnoses, further analysis found. Those with social difficulties and disruptive behavior, for instance, are more likely than the other groups to have a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or anxiety, and those in the strongly affected group are more likely to show cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>People of the same subtype often harbor the same autism-linked common variants, according to a comparison of polygenic scores for 2,293 of the autistic children and 3,179 unaffected siblings from the SSC. And a search for rare mutations uncovered more spontaneous—or de novo—variants among the strongly affected group, whereas those with developmental delay harbor more inherited variants.</p>
<p>Variants associated with each subtype influence different biological pathways, hinting that distinct mechanisms underlie autism’s phenotypic differences. For example, the variants detected among the mildly autistic group alter histone methylation, whereas those identified in the developmental delay subtype affect neuronal action potentials.</p>
<p>
    T</p><p>
he variants contribute to changes in gene expression at different points in development, the study also found. The subtype characterized by developmental delay—which consisted of children diagnosed with autism at an early age—possesses variants that affect gene expression during fetal and neonatal development. And those with social problems and disruptive behavior—who are often diagnosed later in childhood—harbor variants that influence gene expression after birth.</p>
<p>The findings were posted on medRxiv in August.</p>
<p>The results suggest that a subtype’s genetic profile could—at least in part—determine clinical milestones, says study investigator <a href="https://lsi.princeton.edu/people/aviya-litman" target="_blank">Aviya Litman</a>, a Ph.D. candidate in Troyanskaya’s lab. Given more data, the team’s approach could inform parents and guardians of potential milestone delays, Litman and her colleagues say.</p>
<p>In fact, the researchers plan to train their model with more data as they become available, including noncoding and whole-genome sequences, says <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/natalie-sauerwald/" target="_blank">Natalie Sauerwald</a>, associate research scientist of computational genomics at the Flatiron Institute and an investigator on the study. More detailed genetic data could provide more insight into the mechanistic differences between autism subtypes, Sauerwald says.</p>
<p>And larger datasets may reveal more nuance between autism subtypes. “With more data and potentially even better phenotyping, there may be more than these four categories,” says <a href="https://anoushkajoglekar.com/" target="_blank">Anoushka Joglekar</a>, a computational biologist at the biotech company Immunai, who was not involved in the work. By analyzing whole genomes, the team may uncover important epigenetic mechanisms, she adds.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After several years of keeping it going in semi-retired, keep-the-lights-on (KTLO) mode, I’ve decided to officially fully retire this blog. The ribbonfarm.com domain and all links will remain active, but there will be no new content after November 13th, 2024, which happens to be my 50th birthday. There will be one final roundup post before then, and perhaps a shortish epitaph post. And the main page will switch to a static landing page. But after that date, this will effectively be a museum site.</p>



<p>I’m not <em>personally </em>retiring of course (I neither want to, nor can I afford to), but this WordPress blog is. Sometime in the next few months, I’ll figure out how to move it to a lower-cost archival hosting model, probably as a static non-WordPress site, simplify the design as befits a retiree, and put up some sort of museum-like landing page with self-guided tour maps, a little museum shop selling books, directions to the service entrance for AI scraper-bots, and so on. If you get your updates via the Mailchimp newsletter, that will be shutting down sometime in the next few weeks. So if you’d like to continue hearing from me, sign up for my <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/">substack</a> (fair warning: It’s not a blog, and both the contents and style are distinctly different from what you’ve been used to here).</p>



<p>But in the meantime, in what is going to be the last significant post on here, let’s look back on what has been a 17-year journey.</p>



<p>It’s been 17 eventful years, and this blog has been my home online through some very interesting times, both for me personally and for the world, but it feels like the time is finally <em>just </em>right for it to retreat gracefully to the shadows. Not too early, not too late.</p>



<p>There is no specific reason to retire the blog right now. While the recent minor civil war in the WordPress ecosystem (if you don’t know about it, you probably don’t need to) felt like the portent I was unconsciously waiting for, this decision has been brewing for a couple of years now. </p>



<p>***</p>



<p>I do think that the end really <em>is </em>here for the blogosphere though. This time it really <em>is</em> different. I’ve weathered many ups and downs in the blogosphere over my 17 years in it, but now it feels like the end of the blogging era. And what has emerged to take its place is not the blogosphere (and really shouldn’t try to be), even though parts of it have tried to claim the word.</p>



<p>I don’t think there is any single heir to the blog, or to the public social media landscape it dominated, anymore than there was a single heir to the Roman empire when it collapsed. And this is as things should be. Emerging media should emerge into their own identities, not attempt to perpetuate the legacies of sundowning media, or fight over baggage. And of course, many architectural elements of the blog will live on in newer media, just as many patterns we live with today originated in the Roman empire. Chronological feeds, and RSS-like protocols are part of our collective technological vocabulary. So at least in a technological sense, nothing is dying <em>per se</em>. But in a cultural sense, we are definitely witnessing the end of an era.</p>



<p>But there’s no denying that the legacy we’re talking about is a powerful one that will cast a long shadow. The cultural reign of the blog, roughly 2000-20 or so, coincided with the second full chapter of the internet. Far more than aggregators, photo-sharing services, or social feeds, the blog <em>was </em>“Web 2.0.” Blogs didn’t produce the <em>most </em>Web 2.0 bytes, but they produced the most <em>significant </em>ones.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s my blogocentric conceit, but it feels like the active lifespan of ribbonfarm in particular, 2007-24, coincides rather neatly with a very well-defined chapter in the grand narrative of civilization itself, with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the 2024 US Presidential election serving as neat bookends. Whatever the outcome of the election, when this blog officially retires on November 13, we’ll be in some sort of new era. An era blogs helped usher in, but won’t be a part of. </p>



<p>Conceit or not, it’s hard for me to see the story of ribbonfarm as merely <em>my </em>story, or even merely the marginal story of the few dozens of contributors, or of the little subculture of a few hundreds that coalesced around it for the better part of a decade. The story of ribbonfarm has been, in a small one-of-a-million threads way, the story of civilization itself, through the 2007-24 period.</p>



<p>That thought feels nice, in the way I imagine carving my initials onto an ancient monument might feel nice. <em>VENKAT WAS HERE.</em> Actually, <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/06/13/ten-years-of-refactoring/">I kinda did that</a>, with a friend’s help.</p>



<p>I’d argue that the blogosphere, and the public social media landscape, represented the spirit of this civilizational chapter in a much truer way than old media. Through this period, old media strongholds seemed increasingly like grand and sad old ruins of the past, falling into ever-greater dereliction. While they still exerted a certain baleful influence over the cultural landscape, there was something dead about the gaze of old media on the new world. But public social media… it was <em>alive. </em>Its gaze on the new world was not just lively, it was <em>constitutive</em>. It helped <em>make </em>the world it observed. It was where the real action was. Even the dying old media types knew it, as they increasingly turned to new media not just for informational sustenance, self-disruption ideas, and talent, but for what we might call a sort of life-energy. Journalists didn’t just trawl the old Twitter for stories to print on dead trees. They tapped into it like it was a life-giving elixir they needed to stay spiritually alive. The came for the leads and personalities, stayed for the <em>elan vital.</em> They’ll deny it furiously if you ask of course. They’re a stuffy lot. Nice, but stuffy. And snobby. They’ll pretend it was access to the corridors of power that was keeping them alive all this time. It wasn’t. It was us.</p>



<p>For a couple of decades, public social media, with blogs serving as a sort of network of fortresses scattered across that feudal landscape, was where the <em>world</em> happened. A public, grand sort of world. It wreaked havoc too of course, but a grand sort of havoc. The maturing <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">cozyweb</a> phase we’re in right now, while it has its own intimate charms, to be found in the warren of discords, slacks, and group DMs we all inhabit these days, lacks the raw grandeur of the public social media era.</p>



<p>Here on ribbonfarm, the era unfolded as a three-act story. The core 2012-2019 period, when <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/refactor-camp/">Refactor Camp</a> was an active event, is a good proxy for the “subcultural” phase of ribbonfarm. During those years, I had the social energy both to curate a lot of writing by others, and events of various sorts. I also tweeted up a storm. But perhaps more importantly, the zeitgeist itself had the right kind of energy to respond in a lively way to such curation. The periods before and after, 2007-12, and 2019-24 were more personal eras, defined by my own interests.</p>



<p>If you’ve been a long-time reader, you know that this three-act story corresponds roughly to my rather grandiose scheme of “Ages” for periodizing the ribbonfarm archives. The three ages of ribbonfarm (the Rust Age (2007-12), the Snowflake Age (2013-18), and the Charnel Age (2019-24)) constitute a story that’s perhaps 10% about me personally, perhaps 20% about the various intersecting milieus that gave rise to the short-lived subculture of the second act, and 70% about the world at large. </p>



<p>Throughout the life of this blog, an old world was dying, and a new world was struggling to be born. And this blog channeled the energy of that ongoing transformation for lulz and profit. Gramsci would have approved.</p>



<p>I have joked to friends, building on a very clever Drew Austin (an early ribbonfarm contributor) observation, that the entire three-age ribbonfarm story was a product of low interest rates. This blog was sponsored by ZIRP. The future historians who dive into these archives for archaeological research will likely be economic rather than cultural historians, trying to reconstruct the play-by-play impact of ZIRP. Many of the big hits of this blog, such as The Premium Mediocre Life of Maya Millennial, and The Locust Economy (a forgotten hit from 2013) had ZIRPy subtexts.</p>



<p>This is not an entirely flippant observation. The blog in its heyday was a product of open-source software, cheap hosting, and perhaps most importantly, essentially free global distribution. First through RSS, then through Twitter. This free distribution was in turn an artifact of cheap venture capital. It began to collapse when interest rates began to rise, forcing distribution deals with devils upon all of us, which only the most desperate and ambitious were willing to take. The rest of us began retreating to the cozyweb rather than pay up to the protection rackeeters who began taking over public distribution channels starting around 2017, culminating in Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022. </p>



<p>***</p>



<p>The young cozyweb era currently taking shape and replacing public social media is equally a product of higher interest rates and paid distribution, but is at least not a distribution-channel protection racket. </p>



<p>I coined the term <em><a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">cozyweb</a></em> in 2019 (appropriately enough in my substack, rather than here), which is around when it was born. It was perhaps my last major meme. Equally appropriately, that essay has ended up part of a rather <a href="https://darkforest.metalabel.com/dfc?variantId=1">cozy little book from a cozy little publishing startup</a>.</p>



<p>The cozyweb anchors an era that’s threatening to be as long-lived as the public social media era, so it might last till 2035 or so. In fact, I don’t think we’ll see really low/zero/negative interest rates again in my lifetime. Which means we may not see anything like the blogosphere or the public social media era either. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that the cozyweb is <em>already </em>5 years old. Maybe I should start a new periodization. I need a label for my own first age in the cozyweb, 2019-24. I ported over my old Breaking Smart list into what is now my main substack in 2019, started and finished the short-run Art of Gig newsletter as another substack, helped found the cozy Yak Collective Discord community,  got myself a 5-year Roam subscription, and (much to the dismay of some of you), went crypto-bro (crypto is a very cozyweb type part of the internet).</p>



<p>There have been structural signs of all this of course, and many of my tactical moves over the past few years, which I thought of in the moment as random acts of creative experimentation, were in hindsight preparations for an exit from both the blogosphere and the public social media landscape.</p>



<p>A few examples.</p>



<p>For example, in 2019, I deliberately shifted gears to writing what I’ve called blogchains, over stand-alone posts. These eschew theatricality and engagement farming, and adopt an intimate rhetorical style better suited to the cozyweb. They do not work well with blogs either structurally or thematically. They are really closer cousins to a much older medium: The monograph.</p>



<p>As another example, in 2020, I consciously stopped trying to write “viral hit” type posts, and even bent over backwards to try and write anti-viral posts. The <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">Internet of Beefs</a>, which I wrote in January 2020, was not just my last viral post, it was my last viral-<em>intent</em> post. I also kinda consciously intended it to serve as a sort of epitaph for the public social media era, which by that time I had come to see as being in irreversible decline. </p>



<p>Events since then have only strongly confirmed those early premonitions. Virality as such, is mostly dead as a cultural phenomenon in long-form writing. When it occurs these days, it feels somehow deadening and cheap. </p>



<p>The cozyweb zeitgeist favors a deeper, quieter sort of writerly ambition, with classier, more high-minded aspirations. Where the viral blog post of the last decade was something of a loud public-park pop-music performance, good 2024 longform feels more like chamber music performed for exclusive invite-only audiences. One under-appreciated reason for Substack’s success at taking over some of the blogosphere’s role is that it’s conducive to this chamber-music style of writing. One of my current operating theories is that this style is in fact the culturally load-bearing part of Substack, even though most of the attention is on high-profile refugees from old media. The proprietors of the platform don’t quite appreciate the chamber music scenes they harbor, which is one of the reasons I’m not convinced the platform will last.</p>



<p>I don’t read any of the old-media refugee substacks, but I do read a lot of chamber-music style substacks. And one of the reasons I don’t quite feel at home on Substack is that while I like reading the chamber-music style stuff, I don’t really do it well myself. I’m too much of a careless shitposter, and the chamber music style calls for a certain earnestness of approach. It calls for a certain amount of self-conscious gravitas (which can easily turn into humorless self-importance, the main failure mode on Substack; one that gives it decided LinkedIn overtones). </p>



<p>This sense of anxiously performed gravitas is perhaps the governing vibe of Substack. They’re sincerely trying to make <em>meaning </em>over there. We here in the blogosphere were just having fun watching the world burn for a couple of fiery decades. A kind of psychotic, nihilistic humor was the governing vibe of the blogosphere at its best.  So far I haven’t seen anything like it on Substack. I miss it of course, but one must move on with the times.</p>



<p>On Substack, the mere <em>prospect</em> of making money reliably (something the blogosphere was spectacularly shitty at, and remains so in its dotage) seems to get people to adopt a more respectable demeanor, and second-guess the shitposting instincts that would have served them well in the blogosphere at its peak. The blogosphere didn’t so much move to Substack as get gentrified by it, much as they’d like you to believe it did. And many of us transplanted bloggers got a shave and haircut, put on a suit, and went to work there, shoulder-to-shoulder with the old media types we once maintained ritual rivalries with, but are now increasingly indistinguishable from. </p>



<p>The rest of them, that is. Not me of course. I’m only wearing the Substack Suit ironically. Why can’t anyone see I’m only wearing the Substack Suit ironically!</p>



<p>But kidding aside, this is fine (and not in a burning-house dog gif sense). Mediums should grow into their own true natures. And if the message of the Substack medium (and subscription newsletters generally… there’s a handful of other contenders) is one of earnestness and gravitas, so be it. Let it get <em>good </em>at it, just as the blogosphere got good at shitposting. <em>Really </em>good.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most revealing example. Sometime around late 2021, thanks to my interests shifting steadily towards what I might call <em>studious </em>interests in things like storytelling, fermi estimation, and tinkering in my pandemic-born lab, my posting here began taking on the tenor of a semi-private notebook. Ribbonfarm began to resemble my private Roam notebooks more than its own past as a slovenly, loud, meme-making, virality-chasing, content junkyard. And it’s no accident that the notebook/digital garden type of medium began to emerge around 2019. A vast amount of good writing these days is happening <em>entirely </em>in private. A tiny fraction is shared (Sarah Constantin, a long-time friend of this blog, <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/srcpublic/page/dUOCm_0cT">has a public Roam</a> for example), and a slightly larger fraction (including a lot of my own Roam content) is likely intended for eventual public sharing in some form. But much of the notebooking universe will remain private forever. It is interesting that a kind of semi-public notebooking is how my blogging story is wrapping up. A kind of semi-public notebooking is a good description of the <em>original </em>vibe of blogs, circa 2002-09. </p>



<p>But we’ve moved on to a deeper kind of notebooking now (deeper in the sense of much more richly and densely hyperlinked internally). A much deeper kind than blogs can sustain. Deep notebooking and content gardening too, aren’t blogging — and shouldn’t try to be. That would be selling <em>that</em> new medium short.</p>



<p>Fourth and final example: I quit actively posting on Twitter when Musk took over. Not directly related to the ribbonfarm story, but a key adjacent subplot. In the moment, it felt like a tactical reaction to the (political and cultural) writing that was clearly on the wall, and I’m glad I quit when I did. But in hindsight, the Muskening was not an independent story. It was just another chapter in the larger story of the rise and fall of the blogosphere and public social media.</p>



<p>Anyhow, where to next?</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Much of the appropriate subset of my nonfiction writing, of course, has already migrated to my <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/">substack</a>, which is already five years old (time flies, huh?), but still doesn’t quite feel like home, and I suspect never will. At least not in the way this blog has felt.</p>



<p>Mostly what I write there has to do with technology trends and serialized book-length projects. There’s not much left here that’s suitable for substacking. It’s mostly stuff that does not look good when it puts on a suit, so I probably won’t try to put it there.</p>



<p>These remaining active threads on this blog — narrative theory, fiction experiments, mediocrity musings, outtakes from my lab tinkering — don’t fit Substack and have never quite fit the blog medium either. They need transplanting to media where they can flourish. Lab tinkering really belongs in video, and in cozy conversations with small groups of co-conspirators, such as I’ve been able to find via the <a href="https://yakcollective.org/">Yak Collective</a> (also already 4 years old). Fiction <em>really </em>does not like the reverse-chronological tendency of the blog, and wants to create its own escaped reality, complete with its own temporality, in pre-temporal media spaces. I’m not yet sure where to take my fiction experiments. I suspect I’ll be parking ongoing efforts either in Roam or in novella-length ebook drafts. A few non-fiction threads — narrative theory, mediocrity — will likely eventually turn into monograph-style ebooks/books. They’re kinda done, really. They just need a round of editing and packaging.</p>



<p>That leaves a few loose ends which don’t really belong anywhere in the future at all. They feel like increasingly fussy footnotes, not just to my own archives here, but to the blogging era itself. The impulse to post here now feels like an archival impulse. An impulse to tend to the needs of a gradually settling and cooling past, rather than the needs of a restless and warming future. Garbage collector janitorial work in a memory palace where the temperature is dropping slowly to cold-storage levels. </p>



<p>I’ll be redirecting the energy fueling the memory-curation impulse towards gradually putting together a decent collection of book-length volumes from the archives. And perhaps a fine-tuned LLM that can serve as a ghostly era-bound after-image of myself too. And maybe a glossary and a set of footnotes too, why not. With my twitter archives (also sitting around) thrown in for good measure. They belong spiritually with this blog.</p>



<p>I look forward to chatting with the Ghost of Ribbonfarm+vgr-on-twitter in the metaverse, whenever that option is available and cheap enough to exercise. For now, I’m starting out on this memory curation project by working on a book of key posts spanning the entire life of the blog. A selection I hope will tell at least my subplot of the larger story this blog belongs to. Taxidermy-ing the twitter archives (particularly the threads, not so much the conversations) into a suitably mummified form is a tougher challenge I haven’t yet figured out.</p>



<p>But the memory curation is, to be frank, a backburner priority. Retiring this blog is a poignant moment for me, but I’m fundamentally a future-oriented guy.</p>



<p>These half-assed retirement plans still leave an important function of this blog unaccounted for: As the default outlet for all my random impulses for nearly two decades. What I’ve called my <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2023/03/01/salt-seeking/">salt-seeking</a> tendencies. Without this blog serving as a sort of /etc folder, I will be sort of cognitively homeless after November 13, since such impulses are probably my most primal ones. It might sound silly, but “where will I put my random 2x2s now” is a real and serious question for me. </p>



<p>I have no idea where I’m going to put my random hare-brained theories, 2x2s, crappy maps, bad cartoons, and so on. Substack and post-Twitter protocol media don’t feel right. Neither does a private notebook. There’s a decidedly social element to that kind of /etc salt-seeking thinking. It thrives best when embedded in global and public distributional media as shitposts, ready to trigger Cunningham’s Law dynamics (“the easiest way to get the right answer is to post a wrong answer”). It struggles along in freshwater publishing media like books and newsletters. And it wilts entirely in private media like notebooks. A bathtub is no place for ideas that yearn for the ocean. There’s no fun or dopamine in making a 2×2 if you can’t immediately share it, as publicly as possible. If you have to put it in a suit to send out via substack, or limit it to niche cozy media, or pay Elon to put it out in the post-apocalyptic sewage stream that is “public” social media, it doesn’t feel quite right.</p>



<p>I’m sure having no outlet for this core part of my thinking will drive me nuts, but that’s a good problem to have. You have to harbor a certain inner restlessness if you want to be a good homeless nomad. Maybe I’ll start putting certain thoughts down on paper, and tossing them into the ocean in plastic bottles. Luckily I live by the Pacific Ocean, the biggest tank of saltwater around. And I’m told they just cleaned up the garbage gyre, so we can start making a new one, and killing a whole new generation of turtles.</p>



<p>Speaking of nomadism, a curious inversion is underway in my life. I’ve been digitally at home here on ribbonfarm for 17 years, but a nomad in my physical life, having lived in 23 apartments in 10 cities over the last 27 years. If my cunning plans work out, that will flip. I’ll be digitally homeless once more (as I was 2000-2007), but hopefully manage to buy a <s>house</s> mansion within the next year if this damn housing market thaws soon. Ideally in the Seattle area. We’ll see.</p>



<p>As I said, I’ll post a final roundup sometime in the next month, and perhaps some sort of final epitaph post on the 13th itself (rather appropriately, I’ll be in Thailand that week, a country that will likely go down in history as a sort of blogger Mecca during the heyday of public social media, when blogosaurs ruled the Earth).</p>



<p>In the meantime, thanks for coming along with me on this long journey, and hope to see you at <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/">my rental apartment on Substack</a>. I’m somewhat active in the Notes section there, and also on Farcaster. I’m on Bluesky too, but not very active there (something isn’t quite working for me there).</p>

	<h3><strong>Part 1:</strong> Intro by Evilslug</h3><p>
	
What follows is a succession-style Let's Play of the game Dwarf Fortress.  In it, we chronicle the rise and fall of the epic Dwarven fortress, Boatmurdered.  (Actually, it's pretty much all fall.)  Each ruler was given a single year of gametime in which to manage the fortress, then they gave the reigns over to the next player in line.  I have added the occasional editor's note to clarify things, but mostly I stay out of the way.  The madness surrounding Boatmurdered is quite apparent on its own, I feel.</p><p>

<b>Official List of Madmen...er..."Rulers".</b></p><p>

TouretteDog<br>
mariguana (aka.  megor grendel)<br>
Keyboard Fox (aka.  Furry, Kalo)<br>

All eras of Boatmurdered history are highly noteworthy and interesting.  Things very quickly progressed from somewhat casual daily elephant deaths to retired rulers rampaging and beating people to death (while burning alive).  The heavy downward slide that would come to define Boatmurdered seems to have begun during StarkRavingMad's rule, with the utterly epic "Elephant War".  Historians seem to agree that the insanity surrounding Boatmurdered began to increase almost exponentially from that point forward.</p><p>

<b>The "WTF is Dwarf Fortress?" Crash-Course.</b></p><p>

The thread to follow generally assumes you have a tiny bit of knowledge about the game being played.  In hopes of making it an easy read for those unfamiliar, I've condensed the most important factors from the general info threads and wiki into this brief introduction.  You don't need to know a thing about the game to genuinely enjoy the playthrough, but a tiny bit of knowledge does help.  Here's the tl;dr guide, first.

</p><div><p><img src="https://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/Introduction/dwarfguide.gif" alt=""></p><p>

Left to right:  Elephant, Dwarf, Miasma Cloud (the purple cloud of stench that comes from rotting bodies).</p><p>

For a bit better outline of the game, read on.  Impatient types and those who already know Dwarf Fortress well, please skip straight to the first update.  The initial update outlines the rules by which this game was played (there aren't many, hah!).  The second update is where we generate the world and actually get the ball rolling.</p><p>

====</p><p>

<b>What kind of game is Dwarf fortress?</b></p><p>

In a nutshell, Dwarf Fortress is best described as a 2-D base building game in the theme of Dungeon Keeper.  The concept is simple, the graphics are simple; but the depth of the game is fairly awesome.  (Even more amazing when you realize it is all the product of a single man gaming company.)</p><p>

The dwarves you "control" are somewhat autonomous.  They have likes, dislikes, and needs.  While you can assign them specific duties and set basic orders, they have minds of their own and will act according to how they feel.  You can give them a job, but that doesn't always mean they'll do it right away.  Injuries to all animals and dwarves are tracked, down to internal organs and body parts.  Dwarves have moods that are affected by the things around them.  They can decide to throw a party for their friends, or they might stress out under strain and suddenly kill each other with little to no warning.  Female dwarves occasionally get pregnant and, if they are exposed to trauma (say a goblin siege); they very well might miscarry.  Sad thoughts caused by things of that nature can lead dwarves to tantrums or even suicide.</p><p>

You begin with 7 dwarves and scarce few supplies at the face of a mountain.  Your only objective is to survive the elements while building yourself as cool a fortress as you possibly can before you inevitably die.  Simple enough, yes?</p><p>

The game is displayed in a pseudo-ASCII style, which uses letters for objects in the game world, similar to Nethack.  I hear you groaning, but you'll quickly catch the hang of things.  The players provide excellent explanation of what is going on in each screenshot.  I've included a general key to some common items, below; should you find yourself needing one.</p><p>

In the following shot, a bunch of dwarves are charging off to be trampled by elephants outside the fortress.  The cliff face bisects the picture, with the outdoors on the left and the cliff interior on the right:

</p></div><div><p><img src="https://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/Introduction/chargedetail.png" alt=""></p><p>

1:  This section with the '=' symbols marks a stockpile.  It's where dwarves store various crafts, barrels (not pictured...denoted by a % with a yellow background), and food.</p><p>

2:  This symbol represents a cage for trapping creatures.  You'll see these a lot.</p><p>

3:  This is a pile of rocks which come from digging away the mountain.  You'll see them all over.  They can be crafted into all manner of useful items.</p><p>

4:  The matrix looking green crap is the ground.  On the inside, to the right of box 10, you'll see the symbols are white, instead.  Smoothed stone floors in the fort are represented by + symbols.  Some people use a variegated tileset, which results in what you see here.  Others will have ground that displays as all periods.  You eventually get used to both and can easily pick out what is where on any map.</p><p>

5:  Dwarves are shown as these guys here, or as smiley faces.  Different colors indicate different professions.  These guys are all military recruits, charging off stupidly to their deaths.</p><p>

6:  The E is an elephant.  They murder dwarves in wonderful fashion.  Get used to them.  Above and below him, the brackets are discarded armor or clothing.  The grey blocks to his right represent exposed walls of un-mined rock.  The blocks with the cross on them represent stone doors.  The small 2's that fill the room behind the two doors are the bones of animals or dwarves.</p><p>

7:  The ^ symbol denotes a trap.  The parallel lines below the traps represent a smoothed wall.  Below these lines, you see the grey wall of the bone room, which is not smoothed.  Different colored symbols in grey rock walls just represent types of exposed mineral, gems, or ore veins.</p><p>

8:  This is a pile of dead dwarves, an Elephant, and a cloud of Miasma.  Those are the three most prevalent features in Boatmurdered.  Miasma is the purple blotch that shows up when corpses begin to rot.  It makes your dwarves angry, which usually leads to hilarity.</p><p>

9:  The two green asterisks are gems.  These have been mined out of a wall, already; and are awaiting storage.</p><p>

10:  These are siege engines.  In this case, two ballistas aimed at the hallway with all the dead dwarves.</p><p>

11:  The black spaces with symbols like these are areas of the mountain that have yet to be mined.</p><p>

In other images, you'll often see a yellow X somewhere and a command list on the right side of the screen.  The text on that screen generally refers to whatever is under the yellow X to its left.</p><p>

<p>Bouyed by the surprisingly good performance of neural networks with quantization aware training <a href="https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2024/04/24/implementing-neural-networks-on-the-10-cent-risc-v-mcu-without-multiplier/">on the CH32V003</a>, I wondered how far this can be pushed. How much can we compress a neural network while still achieving good test accuracy on the MNIST dataset? When it comes to absolutely low-end microcontrollers, there is hardly a more compelling target than the <a href="https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2019/08/12/the-terrible-3-cent-mcu/">Padauk 8-bit microcontrollers</a>. These are microcontrollers optimized for the simplest and lowest cost applications there are. The smallest device of the portfolio, the PMS150C, sports 1024 13-bit word one-time-programmable memory and 64 bytes of ram, more than an order of magnitude smaller than the CH32V003. In addition, it has a proprieteray accumulator based 8-bit architecture, as opposed to a much more powerful RISC-V instruction set.</p>

<p>Is it possible to implement an MNIST inference engine, which can classify handwritten numbers, also on a PMS150C?</p>



<p>On the CH32V003 I used MNIST samples that were downscaled from 28×28 to 16×16, so that every sample take 256 bytes of storage. This is quite acceptable if there is 16kb of flash available, but with only 1 kword of rom, this is too much. Therefore I started with downscaling the dataset to 8×8 pixels.</p>

<p>The image above shows a few samples from the dataset at both resolutions. At 16×16 it is still easy to discriminate different numbers. At 8×8 it is still possible to guess most numbers, but a lot of information is lost. </p>



<p>Suprisingly, it is still possible to train a machine learning model to recognize even these very low resolution numbers with impressive accuracy. It’s important to remember that the test dataset contains 10000 images that the model does not see during training. The only way for a very small model to recognize these images accurate is to identify common patterns, the model capacity is too limited to “remember” complete digits. I trained a number of different network combinations to understand the trade-off between network memory footprint and achievable accuracy.</p>



<h2>Parameter Exploration</h2>

<p>The plot above shows the result of my hyperparameter exploration experiments, comparing models with different configurations of weights and quantization levels from 1 to 4 bit for input images of 8×8 and 16×16. The smallest models had to be trained without data augmentation, as they would not converge otherwise.</p>



<p>Again, there is a clear relationship between test accuracy and the memory footprint of the network. Increasing the memory footprint improves accuracy up to a certain point. For 16×16, around 99% accuracy can be achieved at the upper end, while around 98.5% is achieved for 8×8 test samples. This is still quite impressive, considering the significant loss of information for 8×8.</p>



<p>For small models, 8×8 achieves better accuracy than 16×16. The reason for this is that the size of the first layer dominates in small models, and this size is reduced by a factor of 4 for 8×8 inputs.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it is possible to achieve over 90% test accuracy even on models as small as half a kilobyte. This means that it would fit into the code memory of the microcontroller! Now that the general feasibility has been established, I needed to tweak things further to accommodate the limitations of the MCU.</p>



<h2>Training the Target Model</h2>



<p>Since the RAM is limited to 64 bytes, the model structure had to use a minimum number of latent parameters during inference. I found that it was possible to use layers as narrow as 16. This reduces the buffer size during inference to only 32 bytes, 16 bytes each for one input buffer and one output buffer, leaving 32 bytes for other variables. The 8×8 input pattern is directly read from the ROM.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I used 2-bit weights with irregular spacing of (-2, -1, 1, 2) to allow for a simplified implementation of the inference code. I also skipped layer normalization and instead used a constant shift to rescale activations. These changes slightly reduced accuracy. The resulting model structure is shown below.</p>

<p>All things considered, I ended up with a model with 90.07% accuracy and a total of 3392 bits (0.414 kilobytes) in 1696 weights, as shown in the log below. The panel on the right displays the first layer weights of the trained model, which directly mask features in the test images. In contrast to the higher accuracy models, each channel seems to combine many features at once, and no discernible patterns can be seen.</p>







<h2>Implementation on the Microntroller</h2>



<p>In the first iteration, I used a slightly larger variant of the Padauk Microcontrollers, the PFS154. This device has twice the ROM and RAM and can be reflashed, which tremendously simplifies software development. The C versions of the inference code, including the debug output, worked almost out of the box. Below, you can see the predictions and labels, including the last layer output. </p>

<p>Squeezing everything down to fit into the smaller PMS150C was a different matter. One major issue when programming these devices in C is that every function call consumes RAM for the return stack and function parameters. This is unavoidable because the architecture has only a single register (the accumulator), so all other operations must occur in RAM.</p>



<p>To solve this, I flattened the inference code and implemented the inner loop in assembly to optimize variable usage. The inner loop for memory-to-memory inference of one layer is shown below. The two-bit weight is multiplied with a four-bit activation in the accumulator and then added to a 16-bit register. The multiplication requires only four instructions (t0sn, sl,t0sn,neg), thanks to the powerful bit manipulation instructions of the architecture. The sign-extending addition (add, addc, sl, subc) also consists of four instructions, demonstrating the limitations of 8-bit architectures.</p>


<div><pre title="">void fc_innerloop_mem(uint8_t loops) {

    sum = 0;
    do  {
       weightChunk = *weightidx++;
__asm   
    idxm  a, _activations_idx
	inc	_activations_idx+0

    t0sn _weightChunk, #6
    sl     a            ;    if (weightChunk &amp; 0x40) in = in+in;
    t0sn _weightChunk, #7
    neg    a           ;     if (weightChunk &amp; 0x80) in =-in;                    

    add    _sum+0,a
    addc   _sum+1
    sl     a 
    subc   _sum+1  

  ... 3x more ...

__endasm;
    } while (--loops);

    int8_t sum8 = ((uint16_t)sum)&gt;&gt;3; // Normalization
    sum8 = sum8 &lt; 0 ? 0 : sum8; // ReLU
    *output++ = sum8;
}

</pre></div>


<p>In the end, I managed to fit the entire inference code into 1 kilowords of memory and reduced sram usage to 59 bytes, as seen below. (Note that the output from SDCC is assuming 2 bytes per instruction word, while it is only 13 bits). </p>

<p>Success! Unfortunately, there was no rom space left for the soft UART to output debug information. However, based on the verificaiton on PFS154, I trust that the code works, and since I don’t have any specific application in mind, I left it at that stage.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>It is indeed possible to implement MNIST inference with good accuracy using one of the cheapest and simplest microcontrollers on the market. A lot of memory footprint and processing overhead is usually spent on implementing flexible inference engines, that can accomodate a wide range of operators and model structures. Cutting this overhead away and reducing the functionality to its core allows for astonishing simplification at this very low end.</p>



<p>This hack demonstrates that there truly is no fundamental lower limit to applying machine learning and edge inference. However, the feasibility of implementing useful applications at this level is somewhat doubtful.</p>

<p>Engineers from BitEnergy AI, a firm specializing in AI inference technology, has developed a means of artificial intelligence processing that replaces floating-point multiplication (FPM) with integer addition.&nbsp;</p><p>The new method, called Linear-Complexity Multiplication (L-Mul), comes close to the results of FPM while using the simpler algorithm. But despite that, it’s still able to maintain the high accuracy and precision that FPM is known for. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techxplore.com/news/2024-10-integer-addition-algorithm-energy-ai.html" data-url="https://techxplore.com/news/2024-10-integer-addition-algorithm-energy-ai.html" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">TechXplore reports</a>, this method reduces the power consumption of AI systems, potentially up to 95%, making it a crucial development for our AI future.</p><p>Since this is a new process, popular and readily available hardware on the market, like Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell GPUs, aren't designed to handle this algorithm. So, even if BitEnergy AI’s algorithm is confirmed to perform at the same level as FPM, we still need systems that could handle it. This might give a few AI companies pause, especially after they just invested millions, or even billions, of dollars in AI hardware. Nevertheless, the massive 95% reduction in power consumption would probably make the biggest tech companies jump ship, especially if AI chip makers build application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that will take advantage of the algorithm.</p><p>Power is now the primary constraint on AI development, with all data center GPUs sold last year alone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/a-single-modern-ai-gpu-consumes-up-to-37-mwh-of-power-per-year-gpus-sold-last-year-alone-consume-more-power-than-13-million-households" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/a-single-modern-ai-gpu-consumes-up-to-37-mwh-of-power-per-year-gpus-sold-last-year-alone-consume-more-power-than-13-million-households">consuming more power than one million homes</a> in a year. Even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/google" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/google">Google</a> put its climate target in the backseat because of AI’s power demands, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/google-reveals-48-increase-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-2019-largely-driven-by-data-center-energy-demands" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/google-reveals-48-increase-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-2019-largely-driven-by-data-center-energy-demands">its greenhouse gas emissions increasing by 48%</a> from 2019, instead of declining year-on-year, as expected. The company’s former CEO even suggested opening the floodgates for power production by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/former-google-ceo-says-climate-goals-are-not-meetable-so-we-might-as-well-drop-climate-conservation-unshackle-ai-companies-so-ai-can-solve-global-warming" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/former-google-ceo-says-climate-goals-are-not-meetable-so-we-might-as-well-drop-climate-conservation-unshackle-ai-companies-so-ai-can-solve-global-warming">dropping climate goals</a> and using more advanced AI to solve the global warming problem.</p><p>But if AI processing can be more power efficient, then it seems that we can still get advanced AI technologies without sacrificing the planet. Aside from that, this 95% drop in energy use would also reduce the burden that these massive data centers put on the national grid, reducing the need to build more energy plants to power our future quickly.</p><p>While most of us are amazed by the additional power that new AI chips bring every generation, true advancement only comes when these processors are more powerful and more efficient. So, if L-Mul works as advertised, then humanity could have its AI cake and eat it, too.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-EDyKodJvgq4KhLWiwh7i8j"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

<p>I often argue that the toughest thing about distributed systems is changing the way you think.  The below is a collection of material I've found useful for motivating these changes.
</p>

<h2>Thought Provokers</h2>

<p>Ramblings that make you think about the way you design.  Not everything can be solved with big servers, databases and transactions.</p>
