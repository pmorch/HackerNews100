<p>Defendant’s failure to laugh at the question of whether he had “firearms, drugs, cats, dogs, alligators, and weapons” in his vehicle stop was not reasonable suspicion. United States v. Holloway, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187752 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 18, 2023):</p>



<blockquote><p>Officer Smart testified that he regularly asks individuals a question concerning possession of “firearms, drugs, cats, dogs, alligators, and weapons” at vehicle stops because it “helps [him] read people’s body language and their demeanor.” … He further testified that he was trained by other officers to infer that an individual who does not laugh at such a question is nervous about either firearms or narcotics … and that he typically receives a “laughing response” to that question …. While courts “do give considerable deference to police officers’ determinations of reasonable suspicion, … courts do not owe them blind deference.” United States v. Alvin, 701 F. App’x 151, 156 (3d Cir. 2017) (internal quotations omitted). The Court does not find that laughing at a law enforcement officer while being questioned about drugs and weapons would be an appropriate response. Moreover, failing to laugh at a bizarre question while being questioned about drugs and weapons does not create reasonable suspicion to remove an individual from a car after a traffic violation.</p></blockquote>



<p>Note that the officer said he got that from other officers, not from official training.</p>

        <p><em>Translations: <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/zh/">Chinese</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/fr/">French</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/hu/">Hungarian</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/it/">Italian</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/ko/">Korean</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/pt/">Portuguese</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/ru/">Russian</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/es/">Spanish</a></em></p>
        <p>I’ve been programming for 15 years now. Recently, our industry’s lack of care for efficiency, simplicity, and excellence started really getting to me, to the point of me getting depressed by my own career and IT in general.</p>
        <p>Modern cars work, let’s say for the sake of argument, at 98% of what’s physically possible with the current engine design. Modern buildings use just enough material to fulfill their function and stay safe under the given conditions. All planes converged to the optimal size/form/load and basically look the same.</p>
        <p>Only in software, it’s fine if a program runs at 1% or even 0.01% of the possible performance. Everybody just seems to be ok with it. People are often even proud about how inefficient it is, as in “why should we worry, computers are fast enough”:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1039002300600147968" target="_blank">@tveastman</a>: I have a Python program I run every day, it takes 1.5 seconds. I spent six hours re-writing it in rust, now it takes 0.06 seconds. That efficiency improvement means I'll make my time back in 41 years, 24 days :-)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You’ve probably heard this mantra: “Programmer time is more expensive than computer time.” What it means basically is that we’re wasting computers at an unprecedented scale. Would you buy a car if it eats 100 liters per 100 kilometers? How about 1000 liters? With computers, we do that all the time.</p>

        <h2 id="everything-is-unbearably-slow">Everything is unbearably slow</h2>
        <p>Look around: our portable computers are thousands of times more powerful than the ones that brought man to the moon. Yet every other webpage struggles to maintain a smooth 60fps scroll on the latest top-of-the-line MacBook Pro. I can comfortably play games, watch 4K videos, but not scroll web pages? How is that ok?</p>
        <p>Google Inbox, a web app written by Google, running in Chrome browser also by Google, <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/statuses/968882438024941568" target="_blank">takes 13 seconds to open moderately-sized emails</a>:</p>

        </figure>
        <p>It also animates empty white boxes instead of showing their content because it’s the only way anything can be animated on a webpage with decent performance. No, decent doesn’t mean 60fps, it’s rather “as fast as this web page could possibly go”. I’m dying to see the web community answer when 120Hz displays become mainstream. Shit barely hits 60Hz already.</p>
        <p>Windows 10 <a href="https://grumpy.website/post/0PeXr1S7N" target="_blank">takes 30 minutes to update</a>. What could it possibly be doing for that long? That much time is enough to fully format my SSD drive, download a fresh build and install it like 5 times in a row.</p>
        <figure>

        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure/" target="_blank">Pavel Fatin</a>: Typing in editor is a relatively simple process, so even 286 PCs were able to provide a rather fluid typing experience.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Modern text editors have higher latency than 42-year-old Emacs. Text editors! What can be simpler? On each keystroke, all you have to do is update a tiny rectangular region and modern text editors can’t do that in 16ms. It’s a lot of time. A LOT. A 3D game can fill the whole screen with hundreds of thousands (!!!) of polygons in the same 16ms and also process input, recalculate the world and dynamically load/unload resources. How come?</p>
        <p>As a general trend, we’re not getting faster software with more features. We’re getting faster hardware that runs slower software with the same features. Everything works way below the possible speed. Ever wonder why your phone needs 30 to 60 seconds to boot? Why can’t it boot, say, in one second? There are no physical limitations to that. I would love to see that. I would love to see limits reached and explored, utilizing every last bit of performance we can get for something meaningful in a meaningful way.</p>
        <h2 id="everything-is-huuuuge">Everything is HUUUUGE</h2>
        <p>And then there’s bloat. Web apps could open up to 10 times faster if you just simply blocked all ads. Google begs everyone to stop shooting themselves in the foot with the AMP initiative—a technology solution to a problem that doesn’t need any technology, just a little bit of common sense. If you remove bloat, the web becomes crazy fast. How smart do you have to be to understand that?</p>
        <p>An Android system with no apps <a href="https://grumpy.website/post/0Oz1lDOq5" target="_blank">takes up almost 6 GB</a>. Just think for a second about how obscenely HUGE that number is. What’s in there, HD movies? I guess it’s basically code: kernel, drivers. Some string and resources too, sure, but those can’t be big. So, how many drivers do you need for a phone?</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/android_storage.jpg?t=1697909369" width="550" height="489">        </figure>
        <p>Windows 95 was 30MB. Today we have web pages heavier than that! Windows 10 is 4GB, which is 133 times as big. But is it 133 times as superior? I mean, functionally they are basically the same. Yes, we have Cortana, but I doubt it takes 3970 MB. But whatever Windows 10 is, is Android really 150% of that?</p>
        <p>Google's keyboard app routinely eats 150 MB. Is an app that draws 30 keys on a screen really five times more complex than the whole Windows 95? Google app, which is basically just a package for Google Web Search, is 350 MB! Google Play Services, which I do not use (I don’t buy books, music or videos there)—300 MB that just sit there and which I’m unable to delete.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/apps_storage@2x.gif?t=1697909369" width="270" height="480">        </figure>
        <p>All that leaves me around 1 GB for my photos after I install all the essential (social, chats, maps, taxi, banks etc) apps. And that’s with no games and no music at all! Remember times when an OS, apps and all your data fit on a floppy?</p>
        <p>Your desktop todo app is probably written in Electron and thus <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/" target="_blank">has a userland driver for the Xbox 360 controller in it</a>, can render 3D graphics and play audio and take photos with your web camera.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/slack_memory.jpg?t=1697909369" width="703" height="455">        </figure>
        <p>A simple text chat is notorious for its load speed and memory consumption. Yes, you really have to count Slack in as a resource-heavy application. I mean, chatroom and barebones text editor, those are supposed to be two of the less demanding apps in the whole world. Welcome to 2018.</p>
        <p>At least it works, you might say. Well, bigger doesn’t imply better. Bigger means someone has lost control. Bigger means we don’t know what’s going on. Bigger means complexity tax, performance tax, reliability tax. This is not the norm and should not become the norm. Overweight apps should mean a red flag. They should mean run away scared.</p>
        <h2 id="everything-rots">Everything rots</h2>
        <p>A 16GB Android phone was perfectly fine 3 years ago. Today, with Android 8.1, it’s barely usable because each app has become at least twice as big <em>for no apparent reason</em>. There are no additional features. They are not faster or more optimized. They don’t look different. They just...grow?</p>
        <p>The iPhone 4s was released with iOS 5, but can barely run iOS 9. And it’s not because iOS 9 is that much superior—it’s basically the same. But their new hardware is faster, so they made software slower. Don’t worry—you got exciting new capabilities like...running the same apps with the same speed! I dunno.</p>
        <p>iOS 11 dropped support for 32-bit apps. That means if the developer isn’t around at the time of the iOS 11 release or isn’t willing to go back and update a once-perfectly-fine app, chances are you won’t be seeing their app ever again.</p>

          <p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/jckarter/statuses/1017071794245623808" target="_blank">jckarter</a>: A DOS program can be made to run unmodified on pretty much any computer made since the 80s. A JavaScript app might break with tomorrow’s Chrome update</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Web pages working today <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/chrome-intervention/">would not be compatible with any browser in 10 years time</a> (probably sooner).</p>
        <p>“It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place”. But what’s the point? I might enjoy occasionally buying a new phone and new MacBook as much as the next guy, but to do so just to be able to run all the same apps which just became slower?</p>
        <p>I think we can and should do better than that. Everyone is busy building stuff for right now, today, rarely for tomorrow. But it would be nice to also have stuff that lasts a little longer than that.</p>
        <h2 id="worse-is-better">Worse is better</h2>
        <p>Nobody understands anything at this point. Neither do they want to. We just throw barely baked shit out there, hope for the best and call it “startup wisdom”.</p>
        <p>Web pages ask you to refresh if anything goes wrong. Who has time to figure out what happened?</p>

        <p>Any web app produces a constant stream of “random” JS errors in the wild, even on compatible browsers.</p>
        <p>The whole webpage/SQL database architecture is built on a premise (hope, even) that nobody will touch your data while you look at the rendered webpage.</p>
        <p>Most collaborative implementations are “best effort” and have many common-life scenarios in which they lose data. Ever seen this dialogue “which version to keep?” I mean, the bar is so low today that your users would be happy to at least have a window like that.</p>

        <p>And no, in my world, an app that says “I’m gonna destroy some of your work, but you get to choose which one” is not okay.</p>
        <p>Linux kills random processes <em>by design</em>. And yet it’s the most popular server-side OS.</p>
        <p>Every device I own fails regularly one way or another. My Dell monitor needs a hard reboot from time to time because there’s software in it. Airdrop? You’re lucky if it’ll detect your device, otherwise, what do I do? Bluetooth? The spec is so complex that devices <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/blog/understanding-bluetooth-pairing-problems/" target="_blank">won’t talk to each other</a> and <a href="http://time.com/4358533/bluetooth-fix-how/" target="_blank">periodic resets are the best way to go</a>.</p>

        <p>And I’m not even touching the <a href="https://twitter.com/internetofshit" target="_blank">Internet of Things</a>. It’s so far beyond the laughing point I’m not even sure what to add.</p>
        <p>I want to take pride in my work. I want to deliver working, stable things. To do that, we need to understand what we are building, in and out, and that’s impossible to do in bloated, over-engineered systems.</p>
        <h2 id="programming-is-the-same-mess">Programming is the same mess</h2>
        <p>It just seems that nobody is interested in building quality, fast, efficient, lasting, foundational stuff anymore. Even when efficient solutions have been known for ages, we still struggle with the same problems: package management, build systems, compilers, language design, IDEs.</p>
        <p>Build systems are inherently unreliable and periodically require full clean, even though all info for invalidation is there. Nothing stops us from making build processes reliable, predictable and 100% reproducible. Just nobody thinks its important. NPM has stayed in “sometimes works” state for years.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="https://twitter.com/przemyslawdabek/status/940547268729606145" target="_blank">@przemyslawdabek</a>: It seems to me that <code>rm -rf node_modules</code> is indispensable part of workflow when developing Node.js/JavaScript projects.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And build times? Nobody thinks compiler that works minutes or even hours is a problem. What happened to “programmer’s time is more important”? Almost all compilers, pre- and post-processors add significant, sometimes disastrous time tax to your build without providing proportionally substantial benefits.</p>
        <figure>
<a href="https://xkcd.com/303/" target="_blank"><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/compiling.gif?t=1697909369" width="413" height="360"></a>        </figure>
        <p>You would expect programmers to make mostly rational decisions, yet sometimes they do the exact opposite of that. E.g. choosing Hadoop <a href="https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html" target="_blank">even when it’s slower than running the same task on a single desktop</a>.</p>
        <p>Machine learning and “AI” moved software to guessing in the times when most computers are not even reliable enough in the first place.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="https://twitter.com/freetonik/status/1039826129190875136" target="_blank">@rakhim</a>: When an app or a service is described as “AI-powered” or “ML-based”, I read it as “unreliable, unpredictable, and impossible to reason about behavior”. I try to avoid “AI” because I want computers to be the opposite: reliable, predictable, reasonable.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We put virtual machines inside Linux, and then we put Docker inside virtual machines, simply because nobody was able to clean up the mess that most programs, languages and their environment produce. We cover shit with blankets just not to deal with it. “Single binary” is still a HUGE selling point for Go, for example. No mess == success.</p>
        <figure>
<a href="https://xkcd.com/1987/" target="_blank"><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/python_environment@2x.gif?t=1697909369" width="491" height="487"></a>        </figure>
        <p>And dependencies? People easily add overengineered “full package solutions” to solve the simplest problems without considering their costs. And those dependencies bring other dependencies. You end up with a tree that is something in between of horror story (OMG so big and full of conflicts) and comedy (there’s no reason we include these, <a href="https://medium.com/@jdan/i-peeked-into-my-node-modules-directory-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next-b89f63d21558" target="_blank">yet here they are</a>):</p>

<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/dependencies.gif?t=1697909369" width="600" height="440">        </figure>
        <p>Programs can’t work for years without reboots anymore. Sometimes <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/unicorn.html#unicorn-worker-killer" target="_blank">even days are too much to ask</a>. Random stuff happens and nobody knows why.</p>
        <p>What’s worse, nobody has time to stop and figure out what happened. Why bother if you can always buy your way out of it. Spin another AWS instance. Restart process. Drop and restore the whole database. Write a watchdog that will restart your broken app every 20 minutes. Include same resources <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2017/0410-analysis-of-the-facebook-app-for-ios-v-87-0/" target="_blank">multiple times, zip and ship</a>. Move fast, don’t fix.</p>
        <p>That is not engineering. That’s just lazy programming. Engineering is understanding performance, structure, limits of what you build, deeply. Combining poorly written stuff with more poorly written stuff goes strictly against that. To progress, we need to understand what and why are we doing.</p>
        <h2 id="were-stuck-with-it">We’re stuck with it</h2>
        <p>So everything is just a pile of barely working code added on top of previously written barely working code. It keeps growing in size and complexity, diminishing any chance for a change.</p>
        <p>To have a healthy ecosystem you <em>need</em> to go back and revisit. You <em>need</em> to occasionally throw stuff away and replace it with better stuff.</p>
        <figure>

        <p>But who has time for that? We haven’t seen new OS kernels in what, 25 years? It’s just too complex to simply rewrite by now. Browsers are so full of edge cases and historical precedents by now that nobody dares to write layout engine from scratch.</p>
        <p>Today’s definition of progress is either <a href="https://twitter.com/sahrizv/status/1018184792611827712" target="_blank">throw more fuel into the fire</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>

          <p>2016 - We must adopt #docker to solve all problems with microservices</p>
          <p>2018 - We must adopt #kubernetes to solve all problems with docker</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>or <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_c0d3/status/1040092903052378112" target="_blank">reinventing the wheel</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>

          <p>At least XML had schemas...</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We’re stuck with what we have, and nobody will ever save us.</p>
        <h2 id="business-wont-care">Business won’t care</h2>
        <p>Neither will users. They are only learned to expect what we can provide. We (engineers) say every Android app takes 350 MB? Ok, they’ll live with that. We say we can’t give them smooth scrolling? Ok, they’ll live with a phone that stutter. We say “if it doesn’t work, reboot”? They’ll reboot. After all, they have no choice.</p>
        <p>There’s no competition either. Everybody is building the same slow, bloated, unreliable products. Occasional jump forward in quality does bring competitive advantage (iPhone/iOS vs other smartphones, Chrome vs other browsers) and forces everybody to regroup, but not for long.</p>
        <p>So it’s our mission as engineers to show the world what’s possible with today’s computers in terms of performance, reliability, quality, usability. If we care, people will learn. And there’s nobody but us to show them that it’s very much possible. If only we care.</p>
        <h2 id="its-not-all-bad">It’s not all bad</h2>
        <p>There are some bright spots indicating that improving over state-of-the-art is not impossible.</p>
        <p>Work <a href="https://twitter.com/mjpt777" target="_blank">Martin Thompson</a> has being doing (<a href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor" target="_blank">LMAX Disruptor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding" target="_blank">SBE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/real-logic/aeron" target="_blank">Aeron</a>) is impressive, refreshingly simple and efficient.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/google/xi-editor" target="_blank">Xi editor</a> by Raph Levien seems to be built with the right principles in mind.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888" target="_blank">Jonathan Blow</a> has a language he alone develops for his game that can compile 500k lines per second on his laptop. That’s cold compile, no intermediate caching, no incremental builds.</p>
        <p>You don’t have to be a genius to write fast programs. There’s no magic trick. The only thing required is not building on top of a huge pile of crap that modern toolchain is.</p>
        <h2 id="better-world-manifesto">Better world manifesto</h2>
        <p>I want to see progress. I want change. I want state-of-the-art in software engineering to improve, not just stand still. I don’t want to reinvent the same stuff over and over, less performant and more bloated each time. I want something to believe in, a worthy end goal, a future better than what we have today, and I want a community of engineers who share that vision.</p>
        <p>What we have today is not progress. We barely meet business goals with poor tools applied over the top. We’re stuck in local optima and nobody wants to move out. It’s not even a good place, it’s bloated and inefficient. We just somehow got used to it.</p>
        <p>So I want to call it out: where we are today is bullshit. As engineers, we can, and should, and will do better. We can have better tools, we can build better apps, faster, more predictable, more reliable, using fewer resources (orders of magnitude fewer!). We need to understand deeply what we are doing and why. We need to deliver: reliably, predictably, with topmost quality. We can—and should–take pride in our work. Not just “given what we had...”—no buts!</p>
        <p>I hope I’m not alone at this. I hope there are people out there who want to do the same. I’d appreciate if we at least start talking about how absurdly bad our current situation in the software industry is. And then we maybe figure out how to get out.</p>

E-commerce platform Shopify is suing a 'John Doe' defendant for sending numerous false copyright complaints. The DMCA takedown notices have targeted a variety of vendors, who had their legitimate products taken offline as a result of the fraudulent actions. In addition, these vendors risked losing their entire accounts due to multiple false claims.
</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo.jpg" alt="shopify" width="300" height="203" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo.jpg 462w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20203'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo.jpg 462w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo-300x203.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo.jpg">The DMCA takedown process gives copyright holders the option to remove infringing content from the web.</p>
<p>It’s a powerful, widely-used tool that takes millions of URLs and links offline every day. This often happens for a good reason, but some takedown efforts are questionable.</p>
<h2>Takedown Abuse</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> was targeted by a series of problematic DMCA requests earlier this month. The e-commerce platform typically receives thousands of takedown notices per month from rightsholders, which are in part processed automatically. That works well in most instances, but not always. </p>
<p>Starting on October 5, an unknown person created the account “Sacha Go” which was subsequently used to file dozens of DMCA takedown requests. The notices targeted listings on a variety of shops selling perfume products, claiming that they infringe copyright. </p>
<p>After being alerted by one of the targeted merchants Shopify looked into the matter, concluding that all takedowns were false. Instead of containing legitimate claims the DMCA notices were being used to harass Shopify and its merchants.</p>
<h2>Shopify Files Lawsuit</h2>
<p>The account information provided by “Sacha Go” turned out to be false. To stop this activity and any related to future accounts the defendant may create, Shopify filed a complaint alleging DMCA violations at a federal court in New York.</p>
<p>“Defendant Doe has sent Shopify dozens of DMCA takedown notices littered with misrepresentations, claiming that materials Shopify merchants have posted to their online stores supposedly infringe Doe’s copyrights. But Doe does not actually own any of the copyrights to which he claims ownership in these notices,” Shopify writes. </p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit.jpg" alt="shopift suit" width="600" height="485" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit.jpg 1115w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit-300x242.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20485'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit.jpg 1115w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit-300x242.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit.jpg"></center>
<p>Shopify says that it’s not feasible for the company to investigate the validity of all takedown notices in detail. As such, these false claims resulted in actual removals and the affected stores also received strikes on their accounts. </p>
<h2>Merchants at Risk</h2>
<p>The strikes will be removed if the merchant files a successful counternotice, but those can take up to two weeks to process. Also, those who are not aware of their right to appeal risk losing their accounts. </p>
<p>“[F]or unsuspecting merchants who may be unfamiliar with the DMCA, a sudden onslaught of takedown notices can result in the termination of their entire store under Shopify’s repeat infringer policy,” Shopify explains. </p>
<p>The defendant stands accused of sending more than 70 fraudulent takedown notices from October 5 to October 13, targeting at least twenty perfume shops with bogus copyright claims. These false claims resulted in 52 strikes against various stores. </p>
<h2>Shopify Seeks Damages and an Injunction</h2>
<p>On October 12, Shopify launched an investigation and the company ultimately restored all items and removed all strikes, but that came at significant cost. </p>
<p>“Those efforts cost Shopify tens of thousands of dollars in personnel time and resources. The loss of goodwill that Shopify suffered from penalizing innocent merchants cannot be quantified,” the company explains.</p>
<p>The defendant’s motivations are currently unknown, but it’s certainly possible that they run a competing perfume store. If that’s the case, these takedown notices were likely intended to harm competitors. </p>
<p>Through discovery, Shopify hopes to identify the John Doe and hold them responsible for the recent wave of DMCA abuse. In addition to requesting damages, Shopify also seeks an injunction to prevent more false DMCA notices going forward. </p>

<p>Behind the scenes, we’ve been working hard with our friends at the Sony UK Technology Centre in Wales (where your Pi is baked) to ramp up the manufacturing and production test processes. Things have gone a little faster than expected, and we’re happy to announce that the first mass-production units will ship to customers this week. As promised, we’ll be starting with subscribers to The MagPi and HackSpace magazines, who have taken advantage of the Priority Boarding promotion.</p>

<p>By the end of next week, all existing Priority Boarding orders will have shipped, and every <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/resellers/">Approved Reseller</a> in a country where our compliance paperwork has been signed off by the authorities will have received initial stock of both 4GB and 8GB variants, so those of you who have pre-ordered will start to see parcels arriving in your mailboxes. We are continuing to increase our production rate, with the aim of fulfilling all backorders, and getting Raspberry Pi in stock at all our Approved Resellers, by the end of the year – by then we expect you to be able to just buy one straight off the shelf.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The Council of EU Member States has postponed the final vote on the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (CSAR), which had been
scheduled for Oct. 19th - which is the second postponement already. EU countries simply can't get an agreement on this highly
controversial draft, which then - even if EU Member States come to an agreement eventually - also needs to be discussed in the EU Parliament.
This is great sign that the regulation, also dubbed chat control and one of the most criticized EU laws ever, might fail.
</p><div><p>The fight over chat control continues among the EU member states were a small group of countries - namely Germany,
Austria, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Estonia, and Slovenia - are in opposition to the current draft of the EU CSA Regulation.
German politicians have said before that <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/eu-client-side-scanning">there is no prosecution at any cost</a>, a clear statement
against the EU plans for client-side scanning which would undermine encryption.</p>
<p>This comes at a very important time as the UK just passed the <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/online-safety-bill-encryption">Online Safety Bill, the so called 'playbook for dictators'</a>.
While it's now theoretically possible for the UK to undermine encryption, the EU still has the chance to take a more
pro-privacy approach when it comes to safeguarding the web.</p>

<p>Germany demanded to postpone the vote, as in the previous session, supported by Austria.
The work would not be finished, yet, the measures in the current text are disproportionate and illegal and need to be amended.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the legal experts of the EU Parliament's Scientific Service concluded in a study on the legality of <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/chat-control">chat control</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"when weighing the fundamental rights affected by the measures of the CSA proposal, it can be established that
the CSA proposal would violate Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights with regard to users."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the legal services of the EU, the CSAR proposal's parts on chat control via client-side scanning are
disproportionate and contrary to fundamental rights. <strong>The EU CSA Regulation is illegal under EU law.</strong></p>
<h3 id="council-is-divided">Council is divided</h3>
<p>In addition, Poland,
the Netherlands and Sweden wanted changes to the text of the law. Nine other states called for the common position
to be adopted soon. Their argumentation: in the trilogue negotiations with the Commission and the EU Parliament, the states will have to make
further compromises anyway.</p>
<p><strong>But since the start of the debates 18 months ago, surveillance obligations such as client-side scanning, chat control, and encryption aspects - key
points of the draft law - are particularly controversial among EU member states.</strong></p>
<p>Sweden sees "problems with the integrity and legal certainty of the proposal."
Poland called everything
"very complicated," saying the CSA Regulation has not yet "managed to strike the right balance between child protection and data protection."</p>
<p>Poland demanded that only chats of "people under concrete suspicion" should be scanned, not those of innocent citizens.</p>
<p>Several states criticize other provisions as disproportionate. The Netherlands and Germany want to exempt audio telephony, while
Sweden wants to exempt communications over mobile networks. Sweden and the Netherlands want to limit scanning
to known abusive material and exempt unknown material and grooming.</p>
<p>This demonstrates how divided EU member states still are - and how controversial chat control is, one of the most criticized
EU laws of all time.</p>
<h3 id="eu-commissions-conflicting-statements">EU Commission's conflicting statements</h3>
<p><strong>The EU Commission, however, rejects the arguments of the opponents and claims that you can protect and scan chats at the same time - however, giving no evidence
on how this should be done.</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, another formulation within the draft law makes it clear that chat control is a surveillance tool: Non-public communication services are to be
exempted, for example if they are "used for national security purposes." This is to protect "confidential information,
including classified information." <strong>States do not want chat control for their own communications to avoid surveillance.</strong></p>
<h3 id="decision-postponed">Decision postponed</h3>
<p>While the EU Commission is putting pressure on the states to come to a final decision, it has become obvious that
there is no qualified majority for the current proposal. Consequently, <strong>the vote on CSAR has been postponed within the council</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This comes at no surprise as no other EU law has been criticized as much as
<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/LEAK_bf162e8c-5804-479b-972c-d12321bff2c9-Compromise-text-on-CSAM-regulation-on-Sept-8.pdf">CSAR (leaked draft of Spanish Presidency)</a>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="criticism-of-chat-control">Criticism of chat control</h2>
<h4 id="1-chat-control-may-be-illegal">1. Chat control may be illegal</h4>
<p><strong>The core problem of CSAR is the following: scanning the communications of unsuspected persons en masse without cause
is disproportionate and contrary to fundamental rights.</strong></p>
<p>In May last year, the European Commission proposed to introduce mandatory requirements for all chat, messaging and email services,
even when providing end-to-end encryption, to scan messages for illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM).
But since their publication, the proposed measures are criticized across Europe as these could lead to the de
facto “permanent surveillance of all interpersonal communications”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/charter-of-fundamental-rights/">EU Charter of Fundamental Rights</a>
guarantees the right to privacy for all people living in the European Union. Consequently, the EU legal advisors have concluded
that European chat control proposals which would require tech companies to scan private and encrypted messages
for child abuse material (CSAM) are in breach with EU law.</p>
<p>The controversial EU law will enable governments to serve “detection orders” on technology companies,
requiring them to scan private messages and emails for “indicators of child abuse”. This could
undermine encrypted communications, which is criticized by security experts as well as privacy advocates as being
general and indiscriminate mass surveillance.
In addition, one must remember that the German Federal Constitutional Court
has even declared <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/data-retention-germany">data retention</a> as illegal in Germany for being "disproportionate".</p>
<p>It is highly likely that the CSA Regulation - should it become law - would be <strong>declared illegal by the European Court of
Justice (ECJ)</strong> as well. The requirement for companies such as WhatsApp, Signal and others to scan every
message - even when encrypted - for child abuse material infringes people's right to privacy, which is in conflict with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p>While technology companies have unsuccessfully objected to similar UK proposals in the <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/online-safety-bill-encryption">Online Safety Bill</a>
which just got passed including it's controversial requirement to scan for child sexual abuse material once a "feasible
technology" exists, it seems rather unlikely that something similar will be passed in the EU given the
great resistance, even among EU member states, but even more so among European MPs.</p>
<h4 id="2-lobbying-from-ai-companies">2. Lobbying from AI companies</h4>
<p>In September 2023 a new research was <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/">published</a>
that threw a very different light on chat control - and who would really benefit if all Europeans would be monitored
24/7 on the internet.</p>
<p>Next to Ashton Kutcher and his organization Thorn a long list of organizations, AI companies and law enforcement are lobbying pro chat control in Brussels.
The research for example exposes the WeProtect Global Alliance as a government-affiliated institution that is closely linked to
ex-diplomat Douglas Griffiths and his Oak Foundation. The latter has invested more than 24 million US dollars in lobbying for
chat control since 2019, for example via the Ecpat network, the Brave organization and the PR agency Purpose.</p>
<p>The
research "confirms our worst fears," said Diego Naranjo, head of policy at civil rights organization European Digital Rights (EDRi).
"The most criticized European law on technology in the last decade is the product of lobbying by private companies and law enforcement."
EU commissioner, Ylva Johansson, ignored "science and civil society" and proposed a law to "legalize mass surveillance and break encryption,"
he said. "Child protection is being abused here as a door-opener for an infrastructure for mass surveillance without any reason,"
complains Konstantin Macher of the data protection association Digitalcourage.</p>
<h4 id="3-germany-against-proposal">3. Germany against proposal</h4>
<p>Germany is the strongest opponent of the current CSAR draft - and rightly so. Germany has a track record of defending
people's right to privacy, not least because of its history of
mass surveillance during the German repressive systems of the <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/germany-unity-day">German Democratic Republic (GDR) and during World War II</a>.</p>
<p>Today, German politicians say: "There is no prosecution at any cost." Meaning: The right to privacy is an important
human right, one that we must not give up.</p>
<h4 id="4-mostly-criticized-eu-law-ever">4. Mostly criticized EU law ever</h4>
<p>According to the non-profit organization EDRi
an "unprecedentedly broad range of stakeholders have raised concerns that despite its important aims, the measures
proposed in the draft EU Child Sexual Abuse Regulation are fundamentally incompatible with human rights".</p>
<p>EDRi has <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/most-criticised-eu-law-of-all-time/">published</a> an impressive collection of 69 opposing
voices from EU politicians, EU member states, tech companies and even child protection experts explaining why chat control must fail.</p>
<p>It also published an open letter signed by over 80 <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/open-letter-eu-countries-should-say-no-to-the-csar-mass-surveillance-proposal/">NGOs</a>
adding to the voice of almost <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Aeex72MtFBjKhExRTooVMWN9TC-pbH-5LEaAbMF91Y/edit?pli=1">500 scientists</a>
explaining why we must fight for privacy in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>No matter how politicians try to convince the public: Scanning our private message for child sexual abuse material is mass surveillance.
We must never allow this.</strong></p>
<h3 id="tutanota-wont-accept-chat-control">Tutanota won't accept chat control</h3>
<p>At Tutanota we are freedom fighters: We are at the forefront of the privacy revolution by offering everyone in the world
a private email account.</p>
<p>Should the CSA Regulation more forward in its current form, we would be willing to defend people's right to privacy in court
as we have done so before in Germany.</p>
<p>We put your privacy and security first, our code for Tutanota's automatic end-to-end encryption is publicly available
as open source. We would never undermine our privacy promise or our encryption.</p>
<p><strong>Our position remains firm: we will do
whatever it takes to ensure your right to privacy.</strong></p>

<p>This study compares two websites with a similar design: the official Tailwind “spotlight” template from the developers of Tailwind, and the same site crafted with semantic CSS and <a href="https://nuejs.org/docs/nuejs/server-components.html">Nue server components</a>. We’ll take a deep look at what is under the hood and how the sites are built.</p>

<p><strong>The semantic version is 8 × smaller, renders faster, and is easier to modify and extend.</strong></p>

</section>
<h2 id="front-page-html">Front page HTML<a href="#front-page-html" title="Permlink for &quot;Front page HTML&quot;"></a></h2>
<p>The main difference is that Tailwind uses “utility” class names and Nue uses semantic class names. That is: Nue gives meaning to the elements like <code>nav</code>, <code>button</code>, and <code>.gallery</code> and styles them with an external stylesheet. Tailwind styles elements inline — directly on the markup.</p>
<p>We can easily see the difference in the HTML markup by drilling down to the first element on the main navigation:</p>

<a>

  <picture>
    <source srcset="https://nuejs.org/blog/tailwind-vs-semantic-css/img/markup.png" media="(max-width: 768px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://nuejs.org/blog/tailwind-vs-semantic-css/img/markup-big.png" media="(min-width: 768px)" type="image/png">
    
  </picture>

  <figcaption>Drilling down to the first element on the main navigation</figcaption>

  

</a>
<p>The semantic version is smaller because it utilizes high-level, semantic components like <code>.nav</code> and the external CSS can target elements with CSS selectors like <code>body &gt; header</code>. Tailwind needs significantly more markup because the utility-first approach lacks the power of CSS selectors. You are forced to wrap divs inside divs inside divs and fill the elements with Tailwind-specific class syntax.</p>
<p>Here is the full HTML source code of the front page.</p>

</a>
<p>Tailwind (and Next.js) generate 75K of unminified HTML, while the semantic version is only 8K. While some parts come from Next, it’s pretty clear that Tailwind requires significantly more HTML to render the same design than the semantic version.</p>
<p>With Tailwind the <a href="https://www.siteguru.co/free-seo-tools/text-to-html-ratio?url=spotlight.tailwindui.com">Text to HTML Ratio</a> is only 2.3%, which is “Very low” according to SiteGuru. <a href="https://www.siteguru.co/free-seo-tools/text-to-html-ratio?url=nuejs.org/@spotlight/">Nue ratio</a>, however, is 20.3% which is “Good”.</p>
<h2 id="front-page-css">Front page CSS<a href="#front-page-css" title="Permlink for &quot;Front page CSS&quot;"></a></h2>
<p>Let’s study the difference in CSS coding:</p>

</a>
<p>Blue is semantic CSS, gray is utility classes, and black-bordered is primary CSS (which makes your pages render faster).</p>
<p>Some key takes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Tailwind CSS is seven times larger: 33K vs 4.6K. Overall you need eight times more HTML/CSS code with Tailwind to render the page (108K vs 12.6K). The most surprising thing is that Tailwind uses more global/semantic CSS than the semantic approach itself <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Most of the semantic CSS is re-usable on other pages and only a fraction of the CSS is specific to the front page. It’s easy to create new pages when the groundwork is already done.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Spotlight” is just a <em>theme</em> extending a base design. There is an extremely minimalistic <a href="https://nuejs.org/@base/">base-version</a> of the website that can be used to create new themes, like our Spotlight theme.</p>

</ol>

  <figcaption>Creating a new design by extending a semantic base design</figcaption>

  

</a>
<p>Theming or “skinning” is a powerful concept in semantic CSS. You can alter your design by swapping parts of your CSS with another one or overriding a <a href="https://nuejs.org/@base/">base version</a>. CSS theming is impossible with Tailwind because the design is coupled to the markup. If you want a new design, you must edit your markup and override your earlier work.</p>
<h2 id="rendering-speed">Rendering speed<a href="#rendering-speed" title="Permlink for &quot;Rendering speed&quot;"></a></h2>
<p>The two metrics that measure page rendering speed are <a href="https://web.dev/articles/fcp">first contentful paint</a> (FCP) and <a href="https://web.dev/articles/lcp">largest contentful paint</a> (LCP). The semantic version is faster than in both metrics and in both mobile and PC. Here’s LCP on mobile for example:</p>

</a>
<p>Please compare <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-spotlight-tailwindui-com/cqtnf4xxoy?form_factor=mobile">Tailwind metrics</a> with <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-nuejs-org-spotlight/6nnhwwnz8b?form_factor=mobile">Semantic CSS metcis </a>.</p>
<p>Two reasons why the semantic version is faster:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The primary CSS is <a href="https://imkev.dev/loading-css">inlined</a> on the HTML page so that all the assets for the first viewport are fetched in the initial request. This is probably the most important performance optimization for the perceived page loading experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The first request is <a href="https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/">less than 14K</a>, which is the maximum size of the first TCP packet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Preview tab on the Developer console is a great way to debug FCP:</p>

</a>
<h2 id="best-practices">Best practices<a href="#best-practices" title="Permlink for &quot;Best practices&quot;"></a></h2>
<p>The key best practice of Tailwind is <strong>tight coupling</strong>. That is: the structure and styling are tied together. The semantic approach is the opposite: the structure and styling are loosely coupled**. Let’s see what that means by studying the gallery component on the front page:</p>

<a>

  <picture>
    <source srcset="https://nuejs.org/blog/tailwind-vs-semantic-css/img/coupling.png" media="(max-width: 768px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://nuejs.org/blog/tailwind-vs-semantic-css/img/coupling-big.png" media="(min-width: 768px)" type="image/png">
    
  </picture>

  <figcaption>Tight coupling vs Loose coupling</figcaption>

  

</a>
<p>The semantic version, allows you to change the design of the gallery freely. You name the component and style it externally. With Tailwind the style cannot be separated from the structure.</p>
<p>Here’s a better example. Let’s look at the “Uses” or “Setup” page on both implementations:</p>

<p>With Tailwind you must create a JavaScript component to construct a suitable HTML structure for the design. With the semantic version, we can use Markdown in place of the custom JSX component because the generated HTML is semantic and can be styled externally with CSS selectors:</p>

<p>Loose coupling makes you think <strong>content first</strong>. There is no need to write a component for every situation because you can use external CSS to do the heavy lifting.</p>

<h3 id="but-naming-things-is-unnecessary">But naming things is unnecessary<a href="#but-naming-things-is-unnecessary" title="Permlink for &quot;But naming things is unnecessary&quot;"></a></h3>
<p>Naming things is a skill. You name things that repeat. Think of function names in JavaScript or component names in Figma. The same goes for CSS class names. Be good at naming, and you can move from repeating things to re-using things. That is: you can move from this:</p>
<pre><code><b>&lt;!-- utility- first css --&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;</b><b>button </b><b>className</b><b>=</b><b>"</b>group mb<b>-</b><b>8</b> flex h<b>-</b><b>10</b> w<b>-</b><b>10</b>

</code></pre>
<p>To this</p>
<pre><code><b>&lt;!-- semantic css --&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;</b><b>button </b><b>class</b><b>=</b><b>"secondary"</b><b>&gt;</b>
</code></pre>
<p>Without turning into components.</p>
<h3 id="but-co-location-is-important">But co-location is important?<a href="#but-co-location-is-important" title="Permlink for &quot;But co-location is important?&quot;"></a></h3>
<p>Co-location is a catchy name for tight coupling. A term to promote the idea that styling should be tied to the presentation. Repeating things vs. re-using things. See above.</p>
<h3 id="but-tailwind-is-a-great-design-system">But Tailwind is a great design system<a href="#but-tailwind-is-a-great-design-system" title="Permlink for &quot;But Tailwind is a great design system&quot;"></a></h3>
<p>Tailwind has great defaults for colors, spacing, and responsive design. That part is roughly 3% of your Tailwind CSS file. It’s easy to copy these defaults to your semantic design system if needed.</p>
<h3 id="but-i-move-faster-with-tailwind">But I move faster with Tailwind<a href="#but-i-move-faster-with-tailwind" title="Permlink for &quot;But I move faster with Tailwind&quot;"></a></h3>
<p>Yes. You can move faster with Tailwind. But only when:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You are comparing Tailwind with your earlier, badly structured CSS or you are completely new to CSS development.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You don’t care about building reusable modules for later use. That is: you are not naming things that repeat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you really want to move faster, you’ll create a set of CSS components that you can reuse. Like <code>&lt;button class="secondary"&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="but-why-is-tailwind-so-popular-then">But why is Tailwind so popular then?<a href="#but-why-is-tailwind-so-popular-then" title="Permlink for &quot;But why is Tailwind so popular then?&quot;"></a></h3>
<p>Because mastering CSS requires practice. It takes several failed attempts before you get it. Most developers haven’t gone through that so they only remember the bad things. They have never built or used well-structured CSS.</p>
<p>But when you truly master CSS, there is no turning back.</p>
<p>Tailwind, however, forces you to write divs inside divs and fill your elements with an insane amount of class names. I guess that Tailwind’s popularity will eventually fade and the codebases will turn to technical debt. It’s just a matter of time.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-the-source-code">Where is the source code?<a href="#where-is-the-source-code" title="Permlink for &quot;Where is the source code?&quot;"></a></h3>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Audible even over the squeal of an HVAC blower with a suffering belt, the whine
of small, high velocity fans pervades the grocery side of this Walgreens. Were
they always this loud? I'm not sure; some of the fans sound distinctly
unhealthy. Still, it's a familiar kind of noise to anyone who regularly works
around kilowatt quantities of commercial IT equipment. Usually, though, it's a
racket set aside for equipment rooms and IDF closets---not the refrigerator
aisle.</p>
<p>The cooler screens came quickly and quietly. Walgreens didn't seem interested
in promoting them. There was no in-store signage, no press announcements that I
heard of. But they were apparently committed. I think I first encountered them
in Santa Fe, and I laughed at this comical, ridiculous-on-its-face "innovation"
in retailing, falsely confident that it would not cross the desert to
Albuquerque's lower income levels. "What a ridiculous idea," I said, walking up
to a blank cooler. The screens turn on in response to proximity, showing you an
image of what is (supposedly) inside of the cooler, but not quickly enough that
you get annoyed with not being able to just see inside.</p>
<p>I would later find that these were the good days, the first phase of the Cooler
Screen's invasion, when they were both limited in number and merely mediocre.
Things would become much worse. Today, the Cooler Screens have expanded their
territory and tightened their grip. The coolers of Walgreens have gone dark,
the opaque, black doors some sort of Kubrickian monolith channeling our basic
primate understanding of Arizona Iced Tea. Like the monolith, they are faceless
representatives of a power beyond our own, here to shape our actions, but not
to explain themselves.</p>
<p>Like the monolith, they are always accompanied by an eery sort of screeching.</p>
<p>Despite my leftist tendencies I am hesitant to refer to "late-stage
capitalism." To attribute our modern situation to such a "late stage" is to
suggest that capitalism is in its death throes, that Marx's contradiction has
indeed heightened and that some popular revolution is sure to follow. What is
to say that things can't get worse? To wave away WeWork as an artifact of
"late-stage capitalism" is an escape to unfounded optimism, to a version of
reality in which things will not spiral further downward.</p>
<p>Still, I find myself looking at a Walgreens cooler that just two years ago was
covered in clear glass, admitting direct inspection of which tall-boy teas were
in stock. Today, it's an impenetrable black void. Some Walgreens employee has
printed a sheet of paper, "TEA" in 96-point Cambria, and taped it to the wall
above the door. Taking in this spectacle, of a multi-million dollar effort that
took our coolers and made them more difficult to use, of a retail employee's
haphazard effort to mitigate the hostility of their employer's merchandising,
it is hard not to indulge in that escape. Surely, things can't get much worse.
<em>Surely, these must be the latter days.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Gregory Wasson is the sort of All-American success story that you expect from a
neighborhood brand like Walgreens Also Known As Duane Reade In New York City.
Born in 1958, he honed his business sense working the family campground near
Delphi, Indiana. A first-generation college student, he aimed for a sensible
profession, studying pharmacy at Purdue. Straight out of college, he scored a
job as a pharmacy intern at a Walgreens in Houston.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, he was CEO.</p>
<p>A 2012 Chicago Tribune profile of Wasson ends with a few quick notes. One,
"Loves: The desert," could easily go on a profile of myself. Another, "Hobbies:
Visiting Walgreens across the country," is uncomfortably close as well. It's
not that I have any particular affection for Walgreens, in fact, I've long
thought it to very poorly managed, but for reasons unclear to me I cannot
seriously consider entering a CVS. I don't know what they get up to, over there
under the other red drug store sign. I hear it has something to do with long
receipts. I don't want to find out.</p>
<p>I suppose some of Wasson's sensible, farm-and-country upbringing resonates with
me as a consumer. It also makes it all the more surprising that he would become
one of the principle agents behind Walgreen's most publicly embarrassing misstep
to date. There must have been some sort of untoward influence, corruption by
exposure to a Bad Element. Somehow, computers got to him.</p>
<p>Arsen Avakian came from Armenia as a Fulbright scholar. With a background the
most capitalistic corners of technology (software outsourcing and management
consulting), he turned to the food industry and worked in supply chain
management systems for years before deciding to strike out on his own.
Steering sensibly away from technology, he chose tea. Argo Tea started out as a
chain of cafes based in Chicago, but by 2020 had largely shifted focus to a
"ready-to-drink premium tea line derived from one of its most popular café
beverages." This meant bottled tea, sold prominently in Walgreens.</p>
<p>It seems to be this Walgreens connection that brought Wasson and Avakian
together. Wasson retired from Walgreens in 2014, and joined with Avakian and
two other tech-adjacent executives to disrupt the cooler door.</p>
<p>Several publications have investigated the origin of Cooler Screens, taking the
unquestioningly positive view typical of business reporters that do not bother
to actually look into the product. Avakian, researching the branding and
presentation of his packaged premium teas, was dismayed at the appearance of
retail beverage sections. "Where is the innovation?," he is often quoted as
saying, apparently in reference to the glass doors that have long allowed
shoppers to see the products that they might decide to buy.</p>
<p>Avakian reportedly observed that people in store aisles would frequently look
at their phones. I have a theory to explain this behavior; it has more to do
with text messages and Tik Tok and a million other things that distract people
milling around in a Walgreens to kill time (who among us hasn't taken up a
fifteen minute gap by surveying a Walgreens? Fifteen minutes, perhaps, of
waiting for the pharmacy in that very Walgreens to fill a prescription?). To
Avakian's eyes, this was apparently a problem to be solved. People distracted
from the tea are not, he seems to think, purchasing enough tea. The tea needs
to fight back: "How do we make the cooler door a more engaging experience?,"
Cooler Screens CRO Lindell Bennett said in an interview with a consulting firm
called Tinuiti that proclaims in their hero banner that "the funnel has
collapsed."</p>
<p>Engagement is something like the cocaine of the computer industry. Perhaps in
the future we will look back on it as the folly of quack practitioners, a
cure-all for monetization as ill advised as the patent medicines of the 19th
century. At the moment, though, we're still in the honeymoon phase. We are
cramming engagement into <em>everything</em> to see where it sticks. It is fitting,
then, that our cooler screens now obscure the inventory of Coca-Cola. It's
crazy what they'll put into things, claiming it a cure for lethargy (of body or
of sales). Coca into cola. Screens into coolers.</p>
<hr>
<p>It's a little hard to tell what the cooler screens do. It comes down to the
typical struggle of interpreting VC-fueled startups. <em>Built In Chicago</em>
explains that "The company's digital sensors also help brands collect data on
how consumers interact with their items." This is the kind of claim that makes
me suspicious on two fronts: First, it probably strategically simplifies the
nature of the data collected in order to understate the privacy implications.
Second, it probably strategically simplifies how that data will be used in
order to overstate its commercial value.</p>
<p>The simplest part of the cooler screen play is their use as an advertising
medium. There seems to be a popular turn of phrase in the retail industry right
now, that the store is a canvas. Cooler Screens' CRO, in the same interview,
describes the devices as "a six-foot canvas with a 4K resolution where brands
can share their message with a captive audience." I'm not sure that we're
really <em>captive</em> in Walgreens, although the constant need to track down a
Walgreens correction officer to unlock the cell in which they have placed the
hand lotion does create that vibe.</p>
<p>Cooler Screens launched with a slate of advertising partners, basically who you
would expect. Nestlé, MillerCoors, and Conagra headlined. The Wall Street
Journal, referring to a MillerCoors statement, reported that "a big barrier for
MillerCoors is that half of shoppers aren't aware beer is available in
drugstores." I find this a little surprising since it is plainly visible next
to the other beverages, but, well, these days it isn't any more, so I'm sure
there's still a consumer awareness gap to be closed.</p>
<p>The idea of replacing cooler doors with a big television so that you can show
advertising is exactly the kind of thing I would expect to take off in today's
climate, but doesn't yet have that overpromising energy of AdTech or, I am
learning, BevTech. The Cooler Screens are equipped with front-facing sensors,
but no cameras facing the outside world. Cooler Screens seems appropriately
wary of anything that could attract privacy attention, and refers to its
product as "identity-blind." This, of course, makes it a little confusing that
they also refer to targeted advertising and even retargeting as consumers
approach the cooler.</p>
<p>To resolve this apparent contradiction, Cooler Screens describes its approach
as "contextual advertising." They target based not on information about the
customer, but on information about the context. The CRO offers an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you think about it within the context of "I'm in front of an ice cream
door and I want to buy," you have the ability to isolate the message to exactly
what a consumer is focused on at this point in time based on the distance that
they are from the door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Age-old advertising technology would use the context that you are in front of
the ice cream door as a trigger to display the ice cream through the door.  In
the era of the Cooler Screen, though, the ice cream itself is hidden safely out
of view while the screen contacts a cloud service to obtain an advertisement
that is contextually related to it.</p>
<p>It should be clear by this point that the Cooler Screens as an advertising
medium don't really have anything to do with how the items behind them are
perceived by consumers. They have to do with how the advertising space is sold.
Historically, brands looking to achieve prominence in a retail environment have
done so through the set of practices known as "merchandising." Business
agreements between brands and retailers often negotiate the physical shelf
space that stores will devote to the brand's products, and brands throw in
further incentives for retailers to use brand-provided displays and move
products to more lucrative positions in the store. As part of the traditionally
multi-layered structure of the retail industry, the merchandising of beverage
products especially is often managed by the distributor instead of the
retailer. This is one way that brands jockey for more display space: the
retailer is more likely to take the deal if their staff don't have to do the
work.</p>
<p>With Cooler Screens, though, the world of AdTech can entirely disrupt this tie
between placing products and placing advertising. Regardless of what is behind
the door, regardless of what products the store actually chooses to stock,
regardless of the business incentives of the beverage distributor that actually
puts things into the coolers, the coolers will display whatever ads they are
paid for. Are the cooler screens controlled by a real-time auction system, like
many online advertisements? I haven't been able to tell for sure, although
several uses of phrases like "online-like advertising marketplace" make me
think it is at least the goal.</p>
<p>The first, and I suspect primary, purpose of the Cooler Screens is therefore
one of disintermediation and disconnection. By putting a screen in front of the
actual shelves, store display space can function as an advertising market
completely disconnected from the actual stocked products. It's sort of like the
3D online stores that occupied the time of VR entrepreneurs before Mark
Zuckerburg brought us his Metaverse. The actual products in the store aren't
the important thing; the money is in the advertising space.</p>
<p>Second, the Cooler Screens <em>do</em> have cameras on the inside. With these, they
promise to offer value to the distributor. Using internal cameras they can
count inventory of the cooler, providing real-time stock level data and
intriguing information on consumer preference. Cooler Screens promises to tell
you not only which products are out of stock, but also which products a
consumer considers before making their purchase. Reading between the lines here
I assume this means the rear-facing cameras are used not only to take inventory
but also to perform behavioral analysis of individuals who open the doors; the
details here are (probably intentionally) fuzzy.</p>
<p>The idea of reporting real-time inventory data back to distributors is a solid
one, and something that retail technology has pursued for years with ceiling
mounted cameras, robots, and other approaches that always boil down to machine
vision. Whether or not it works is hard to say, the arrival of the Cooler
Screens seems to have coincided with a rapid decline in the actual availability
of cold beverages, but presumably that has more to do with the onset of COVID
and the related national logistical crisis rather than the screens themselves.
The screens are, at least anecdotally, frequently wrong in their front-facing
display of what is and isn't in stock. Generally they present the situation as
being much better than it actually is. That this provides a degree of cover for
Walgreens faltering ability to keep Gatorade in stock is probably a convenient
coincidence.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cooler Screens was born of Walgreens, and seems to have benefited from
familial affection. Placement of Cooler Screens in Walgreens stores started in
2018, the beginning of a multi-year program to install Cooler Screens in 2,500
stores. This would apparently come at an expense of $200 million covered by
Cooler Screens themselves. Cooler Screens was backed by venture funding,
including an $80 million round lead by Verizon and Microsoft. Walgreens
discussed Cooler Screens as part of their digital strategy, and Cooler Screens
used Walgreens as a showcase customer. The Cooler Screens family was not a
happy one, though.</p>
<p>The initial round of installations in 2018 reached 10,300 screens in 700
stores. Following this experience, Walgreens seemed to develop cold feet, with
the pace of installation slowing along with Walgreens broader participation in
the overall joint venture. Walgreens complained of "freezing screens, incorrect
product displays, failure to update stock data accurately, and safety concerns
such as screens sparking and catching fire, according to Walgreens."</p>
<p>In statements to the press, Cooler Screens referred to mention of frozen and
incorrect displays as "false accusations." I can only take that as anything
other than an outright lie if I allow myself to believe that the leadership and
legal counsel of Cooler Screens have never actually seen their product in use.
Given the general tenor of the AdTech industry, that might be true.</p>
<p>If it has not become clear by this point, the poor performance and reliability
of the Cooler Screens is not only a contention by Walgreens but also a firm
belief of probably every Walgreens customer with the misfortune of coming
across them. In an informal survey of four Albuquerque-area Walgreens that I
occasionally use, more than half of the screens are now dark. It varies by
location; in one store, there are two not working. In another, there are two
<em>working.</em> The cooler screens that still cling to life are noticeably infirm.
As best I can remember, animations and video have never played back smoothly,
with over a second sometimes passing between frames.</p>
<p>The screens are supposed to show full-size ads (increasingly rare) or turn off
(now the norm) when idle, and then as a customer approaches they are supposed
to turn on and display a graphical representation of the products in the cooler
that is similar to---but much worse than---what you would see if the cooler
door was simply transparent. Since they were first installed this automatic
transition has been a rocky one. Far from the smooth process shown in Cooler
Screens demo videos, the real item as installed here in the desert (which look
worse than the ones in the demo videos to begin with) noticeably struggle to
update on cue. As you approach they either fail to notice at all or seem to
lock up entirely for a few seconds, animations freezing, as they struggle to
retrieve the images of stock they should display. What then appears is, more
often than not, wrong.</p>
<p>Early on in the Cooler Screens experiment they were wrong in more subtle ways.
They would display one product as out of stock when it was, in fact, physically
present just behind the door. They would display three other products as in
stock when there were none to be found. That was the peak performance the
rear-camera-based intelligence would achieve. Today, it seems like the screens'
basic information on cooler layout is no longer being maintained. They display
the wrong products in the wrong places, sometimes even an entirely wrong
category of products.</p>
<p>It's perhaps hard to understand how they work so poorly, unless you have seen
any of the other innovations that the confluence of AdTech and digital signage
have brought us. There seems to be some widespread problem where designers of
digital advertising products completely forget about basic principles of
mechanical reliability.</p>
<p>It is ironic, given the name and purpose of the cooler screens, that they are
not at all cool. In fact they run very warm, hot to the touch. I cannot be
entirely sure of my own senses but in a recent trip to a Walgreens I swear that
I could feel the heat radiating from the Cooler Screens as I approached the
section, like an evening walk approaching a masonry wall still warm from the
day's sun. As a practical matter they are mounted to the outside of standard
glass cooler doors. Yes, it is deeply ironic that behind the cooler screens are
normal glass doors through which their cameras are allowed to see the contents
the way that customers are not, but at least the door provides some insulation.
Still, somewhere between the cooler refrigeration and the store air
conditioning, the excess thermal output of the new cooler doors is being
removed at Walgreens' expense.</p>
<p>I was a bit baffled at how hot they ran (and how loud the cooling fans can be)
until I considered the impressive brightness of the displays. Cooler Screens
does refer to them as vivid and engaging, and they must have thought that they
needed to compete with store lighting to catch attention. They are bright,
almost uncomfortably so when you are close up, and the wattage of the
backlighting (and attendant heat dissipated) must be considerable. Based on
some experience I have with small SoCs in warm environments, I suspect they
have a thermal problem. The whole system probably worked fine on a bench, but
once manufactured and mounted with one face against an insulated cooler door,
heat accumulates to the point that the SoC goes into thermal throttling and
gives up on real-time playback of 4K video. The punishing temperature of the
display and computer equipment leads to premature failure, and the screens go
dark.</p>
<p>At a level of personal observation, the manufacturing quality of the screens
also seems poor. The fit and finish is lacking, the design much less refined
than the ones Cooler Screens displays in its own marketing material. The
problems may be more than skin-deep, based on Walgreens reports of electrical
problems leading to fire in more than one case. Cooler Screens contends that
these cases were the result of failures on Walgreens part; it can be hard to
tell who to blame in these situations anyway. But design and software problems
must be the fault of Cooler Screens and, besides, Walgreens doesn't even like
them.</p>
<hr>
<p>Walgreens pulled the plug, or at least tried, early this year. In February,
Walgreens terminated the business partnership with Cooler Screens. Only one
third of the planned displays had been installed: Walgreens had started to back
out years earlier. In 2021, Roz Brewer took over as CEO of Walgreens.
According to reporting, she "did not like how the screens looked" and "wanted
them out of the stores." According to Cooler Screens themselves, Brewer
described them as "'Vegas' in a derogatory way."</p>
<p>I am skeptical of corporations in general and especially of their executives,
and I have a natural aversion to the kind of hero worship that brings people to
refer to CEOs as "visionary." Still, how validating it is to find someone,
anyone, in corporate leadership who sees what I see. Cooler Screens alleges
that "when she realized that her opinion on how the doors looked was not enough
to get out of the contract... she and her team began to fabricate excuses." As
would I! They are so evidently terrible, I would be fabricating excuses in the
sense that one gets out of a bad date. "I am sorry about not installing the
Cooler Screens on schedule but I have plans tomorrow with someone else who is
not you." Perhaps I can install cooler screens in 500 more stores some other
time? "Sure, call me, we'll work something out," I say, scrawling 505-FUCK-OFF
on an old receipt.</p>
<p>Still, one does not typically start off a first date with a multi-year
agreement in which one party commits $200 million in exchange for future
revenue. Cooler Screens sued Walgreens, arguing that Walgreens has failed to
perform on their 2018 contract by not installing additional screens. They're
asking for an injunction to prohibit Walgreens removing of the currently
installed units. Walgreens is contending that Cooler Screens failed to perform
by installing screens that broke and occasionally caught fire, Cooler Screens
retorts that the screens would have worked fine if Walgreens stores were in
better condition.</p>
<p>The consumer, as always, is caught in the crossfire. As Cooler Screens continue
to fail it seems unlikely that they will be repaired or replaced. As the
lawsuit is ongoing, it seems unlikely that they will be removed. We just open
every door and look behind it, thinking fondly of a bygone era when the cooler
doors were clear and you could see through them. Now they are heavy and loud
and uncomfortably warm. In the best case, we get to see a few scattered frames
of a Coca Cola animation before they manage to present an almost shelf-like
view of products that may or may not be in the cooler behind them.</p>
<p>Hope springs eternal. Earlier this year, Kroger announced the installation of
Cooler Screens in 500 more of their stores, the result of a three-year pilot
that apparently went better than Walgreens. They have claimed Walgreens as
their territory, leaving destruction in their wake. They are advancing into the
Smith's next.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the strangest parts of Cooler Screens, to me, is Cooler Screens
insistence that consumers like them. I have never personally seen someone react
to Cooler Screens with anything other than hostility. Everyday shoppers make
rude remarks about the screens, speaking even in somewhat elevated tones,
perhaps to be heard over the fans. Employees look sheepish. Everyone is in
agreement that this is a bad situation.</p>
<p>"The retail experience consumers want and deserve," Cooler Screens says on
their website. I would admire this turn of phrase if it was intended as a
contemptful one. Cooler Screens promise to bring the experience of shopping
online, "ease, relevance, and transparency." "Transparency" seems like a poor
choice of language when promoting a product that infamously compares poorly to
the transparent door it replaces. Relevance, too, is a bold claim given the
unreliability of their inventory information. I suppose I don't have anything
particularly mean to say about ease, although I have seen at least one elderly
person struggle to open the heavy screens.</p>
<p>Still, "90%+ of consumers no longer prefer traditional glass cooler doors."
What an intriguing claim! 90%+? How many plus? No longer prefer traditional
glass? What exactly does that even mean?</p>
<p>Indeed, Cooler Screens presents a set of impressive numbers based on their
market research. 94% of respondents say the screens impacted their shopping
positively or neutrally (and the breakdown of positive/neutral in the graphic
shows that this isn't even relying on a huge amount of neutral response, a good
majority really did say positively). 82% said they found the content on the
screens memorable. I certainly do find them memorable, but perhaps not how
Cooler Screens intends.</p>
<p>I struggle to reconcile these performance numbers with the reality I have
observed. Perhaps Albuquerque is a horrible backwater of Cooler Screens
outcomes; I have not thoroughly inspected many out-of-town Walgreens. Maybe
there exists, somewhere back East, a sort of Walgreens paradise where the
screens are all in working order and actually look good and people like them.
Or perhaps the surveys backing this data were only ever collected in the first
two days following installation at Walgreens locations adjacent to dispensaries
holding free pre-roll promotions. I don't know, because Cooler Screens shares no
information on the methodology used to collect these metrics.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is this: customer experience data collected by Cooler Screens
seems to reflect some world other than the one in which I exist.</p>
<p>I wish I lived there, the Walgreens must be exceptionally well-stocked. Out
here, I am hoping the staff have fabricated crude signs so that I don't have to
manually open every door. I am starting to memorize Walgreens shelf plans as an
adaptation. I am nodding and appropriately chuckling when a stranger says
"remember when you could see through these?" as they fight against retail
innovation to purchase one of the products these things were supposed to
promote. You cannot say they aren't engaged, in a sense.</p>

<p><a href="https://hackweek.opensuse.org/">Hackweek 22</a> took place last week. During
this week all the SUSE employees are free to hack on whatever they want. This one of
the perks of working at SUSE 😎.</p>

<p>This time my personal project has been about
<a href="https://hackweek.opensuse.org/22/projects/build-a-unikernel-that-runs-webassembly">building a unikernel that runs WebAssembly</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted this blog post to contain all the details about this journey. However
I realized this would have been too much for a single post. I hence decided to
split everything into smaller chunks.
I’ll update this section to keep track of all the posts.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can find the code of the POC <a href="https://github.com/flavio/hermit-wasm">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>There are multiple reasons why I did that, but I don’t want to repeat what I
wrote inside of the <a href="https://hackweek.opensuse.org/22/projects/build-a-unikernel-that-runs-webassembly">project description</a>.
Learning and fun goals aside, I think there’s actually a good reason to mix
unikernels and WebAssembly.</p>

<p>From the application developer POV, porting/writing an application to the
unikernel is not an easy task. The application and all its dependencies
have to support the target unikernel. Some patching might be required inside
of the whole application stack to make it work.</p>

<p>From the unikernel maintainers POV, they have to invest quite some energies
to ensure any kind of application can run in a seamless way on top of their
platform. They don’t know which kind of system primitives the user applications
will leverage, this makes everything harder.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when targeting a WebAssembly platform (think of
<a href="https://github.com/fermyon/spin">Spin</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/spiderlightning">Spiderlightning</a>), the
application has a clear set of capabilities that have to be provided by
the WebAssembly runtime.</p>

<p>If you look at the Spiderlightning scenario, an application might be requiring
Key/Value store capabilities at runtime. However, how these capabilities are
implemented on the host side is not relevant to the application. That means
the same <code>.wasm</code> module can be run by a runtime that implements the K/V store
using Redis or using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db/">Azure Cosmos DB</a>.
That would be totally transparent to the end user application.</p>

<p>You might see where I’m going with all that…</p>

<p>If we write a unikernel application that runs WebAssembly modules and supports a
set of Spiderlightning APIs, then the same Spiderlightning application could be
run both on top of the regular <code>slight</code> runtime and of this unikernel.</p>

<p>All of that without any additional work from the application developer. The Wasm
module wouldn’t even realize that.
The complexity would fall only on the unikernel developer who, whoever, would
have a clear set of functionalities to implement (as opposed to “let’s try to
make any kind of application work”).</p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p>Sometimes ago I stumbled over the <a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit">RustyHermit</a>
project, this is a unikernel written in Rust.
I decided to use it as the foundation to write my unikernel application.</p>

<p>Building a RustyHermit application is pretty straightforward. Their documentation,
even though is a bit scattered, is good and their examples help a lot.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that RustyHermit is part of Rust nightly, which makes the whole
developer experience great. It feels like writing a regular Rust application.</p>

<p>Obviously you cannot expect all kind of Rust crates to just work with RustyHermit.
You will see how that influenced the development of the POC.</p>

<p>The next sections go over some of the major challenges I faced during the last week.
I’ll share more details inside of the upcoming blog posts (see the disclaimer
section at the top of the page).</p>

<h3 id="the-webassembly-runtime">The WebAssembly runtime</h3>

<p>Unfortunately <a href="https://wasmtime.dev/">Wasmtime</a>, my favorite WebAssembly runtime,
does not build on top of RustyHermit. Many of its dependencies expect <code>libc</code>
or other low level libraries to be around.
The same applies to <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer">wasmer</a>.</p>

<p>I thought about using something like <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime">WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR)</a>,
but I preferred to stick with something written in Rust and have the
“full RustyHermit experience”.</p>

<p>After some searching I found <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmi">wasmi</a> a pure Rust
WebAssembly runtime. This works fine on top of RustyHermit, plus its design
is inspired by the one of Wasmtime, which allowed me to reuse a lot of my previous
knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="webassembly-component-model">WebAssembly Component Model</h3>

<p>Spiderlightning leverages the <a href="https://github.com/webassembly/component-model">WebAssembly Component Model</a>
proposal to offer capabilities to the WebAssembly guests and
to allow the host to consume capabilities offered by the WebAssembly guest.</p>

<p>The communication between the host and the guest happens using types defined
with the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md">Wasm Interface Type</a>.</p>

<p>To give some concrete examples, the demo I’m going to run leverages the
WebAssembly Component Model in these ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The guest asks the host to start a HTTP server. When doing that, the guest
informs the host about the HTTP routes that have to be registered, plus
the names of its internal handlers (the functions that have to be executed).
This is done by using the <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/spiderlightning/blob/main/wit/http-server.wit"><code>http-server</code></a>
types. In this case it’s the guest that leverages capabilities offered by the
host.</li>
<li>The host handles the incoming HTTP requests using the routing
information provided by the guest. The http handlers mentioned before are
functions exposes by the WebAssembly guest. The server is now consuming
capabilities offered by the guest. The communication is done using the
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/spiderlightning/blob/main/wit/http-handler.wit"><code>http-handler</code></a>
types.</li>
<li>Some of the http handlers defined by the guest are also interacting with
a Key/Value store. Also in this case the guest is leveraging a set of
capabilities offered by the host. These are defined using the
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/spiderlightning/blob/main/wit/keyvalue.wit"><code>keyvalue</code></a>
types.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see there are many WIT types involved. For each one of them we
need code both inside of the guest (a SDK basically) and on the host (the
code that implements the guest SDK).
This code can be scaffolded by a cli tool called <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen"><code>wit-bindgen</code></a>,
which generates host/guest code starting from a <code>.wit</code> file.</p>

<p>In this case I only had to implement the host side of these interfaces inside
of the unikernel.</p>

<p>The code generated by <code>wit-bindgen</code> is doing low level operations using the
WebAssembly runtime. The code to be scaffolded depends on the programming language
and on the WebAssembly runtime used on the host side.</p>

<p>Obviously the <code>wasmi</code> WebAssembly runtime was not supported by <code>wit-bindgen</code>,
hence I had to extend <code>wit-bindgen</code> to handle it. The code can be found inside of
<a href="https://github.com/flavio/wit-bindgen/tree/wasmi">this fork</a>, under the <code>wasmi</code>
branch.</p>

<p>With all of that in place, I scaffolded the host side of the Key/Value capability
and I made a simple implementation of the host traits. The host code was just
emitting some debug information.
I was then able run the vanilla <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/spiderlightning/tree/main/examples/keyvalue-demo">keyvalue-demo</a>
from the Spiderlightning project. 🥳</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>You made to the bottom of this long post, kudos! I think you deserve a prize for
that, so here we go…</p>

<p>This is a recording of the unikernel application running the Spiderlightning http-server
demo.</p>

Stay tuned for the next part of the journey. This will cover Rust async, Redis
and some weird errors.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/blog/control-data-conversions-in-excel-for-windows-and-mac">https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/blog/control-data-conversions-in-excel-for-windows-and-mac</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37982049">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div _ngcontent-sc9="" id="content"><p>Hi, Microsoft 365 Insiders! My name is Chirag Fifadra, and I’m a Product Manager on the Excel team. I’m thrilled to announce that, based on your feedback, we’ve improved the Automatic Data Conversion settings we made available last year, and are now making them broadly available in both Excel for Windows and Excel for Mac.</p>
<h3>What did we change?</h3>
<p>Last year’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/blog/control-data-conversions-in-excel">blog post</a>&nbsp;explains how the initial version of the feature worked. Based on your feedback, we have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>made the feature easier to find</li>
	<li>added more format support</li>
	<li>made the feature available in Excel for Mac</li>
</ul>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>We wanted to address customers’ frustration with Excel automatically converting data to specific formats. So, we have now given you the ability to change Excel’s default behavior and disable specific types of automatic data conversions as needed.</p>
<p>To do so, select&nbsp;<strong>File &gt; Options &gt; Data &gt; Automatic Data Conversion</strong>, and then choose the conversion(s) that you’d like to disable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://office-insider-media.azurefd.net/media/2023/10/XL-Conversion-Win-and-Mac_2.png" alt="Excel Options dialog box with Automatic Data Conversion section selected" width="805" height="640" srcset="https://office-insider-media.azurefd.net/media/2023/10/XL-Conversion-Win-and-Mac_2.png 1613w, https://office-insider-media.azurefd.net/media/2023/10/XL-Conversion-Win-and-Mac_2-300x239.png 300w, https://office-insider-media.azurefd.net/media/2023/10/XL-Conversion-Win-and-Mac_2-1024x815.png 1024w, https://office-insider-media.azurefd.net/media/2023/10/XL-Conversion-Win-and-Mac_2-768x611.png 768w, https://office-insider-media.azurefd.net/media/2023/10/XL-Conversion-Win-and-Mac_2-1536x1222.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px"></p>
<h3>Tips and tricks</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can enable or disable the following options:

<ul>
	<li>Remove leading zeros from numerical text and convert to a number.</li>
	<li>Truncate numerical data to 15 digits of precision and convert to a number that may be displayed in scientific notation, if needed.</li>
	<li>Convert numerical data surrounding the letter “E” to a number displayed in scientific notation.</li>
	<li>Convert a continuous string of letters and numbers to a date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>When you select the&nbsp;<strong>When loading&nbsp;a .csv file or similar&nbsp;file,&nbsp;notify&nbsp;me&nbsp;of&nbsp;any automatic number&nbsp;conversions&nbsp;</strong>check box, Excel displays a warning message when it detects that at least one of the optional automatic data conversions is enabled and about to occur when opening a .csv or .txt file. The message gives the ability to open the file once without converting the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scenarios to try</h3>
<p>Based on the settings you chose above, try some or all of the scenarios below to test the increased control over data conversions.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Type directly into a cell.</li>
	<li>Copy and paste from external sources (e.g., a web page).</li>
	<li>Open a .csv or .txt file.</li>
	<li>Find and replace operations.</li>
	<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Data&nbsp;</strong>&gt;<strong>&nbsp;Text to Columns</strong>, and then use the&nbsp;<strong>Convert Text to Columns Wizard</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>Since the feature works by saving the entered data as text, you might see a green triangle with a&nbsp;<strong>Number stored as text</strong>&nbsp;error. This is expected. You can dismiss the error by selecting&nbsp;<strong>Ignore error</strong>&nbsp;in the context menu. Also, you may not be able to use that data in mathematical operations.</p>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The feature does not support disabling these conversions during macro execution.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>This feature is available to all users running:</p>
<ul>
	<li><u>Windows</u>: Version 2309 (Build 16808.10000) or later</li>
	<li><u>Mac</u>: Version 16.77 (Build 23091003) or later</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>We’d love to hear from you! Click&nbsp;<strong>Help &gt; Feedback</strong>&nbsp;to share your feedback and help us prioritize our work.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-canvas-grid="content" data-canvas-grid-self="full">
            <p>When you're programming, it's easy to get by with a superficial understanding of many things. You can easily fool yourself by thinking that you are programming when you are blindly copy + pasting code from Stack Overflow or some random article you stumbled upon.</p><p>Base64 encoding was one of these topics that was bugging me for a while. I often came across Base64 encoded images or URLs, and had no idea whatsoever it meant or why it was even used. Finally, I decided to do some research to fill that knowledge gap, and spent the Sunday reading <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648?ref=akshaykhot.com" rel="noreferrer">RFC 4648</a> (my idea of a fun weekend). </p><p>What follows is everything I learned about Base64 encoding.</p><h2 id="what-is-base64-encoding">What is Base64 Encoding?</h2><p>Base64 encoding takes binary data and converts it into text, specifically ASCII text. The resulting text contains only letters from <code>A-Z</code>, <code>a-z</code>, numbers from <code>0-9</code>, and the symbols <code>+</code> and <code>/</code>. </p><p>As there are 26 letters in the alphabet, we have <code>26 + 26 + 10 + 2</code> characters. Hence this encoding is named <strong><code>Base64</code></strong>. These 64 characters are considered "safe", that is, they cannot be misinterpreted by legacy computers and programs unlike characters such as <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>\n</code> and many others.</p><div><p>💡</p><p>Here's what the text "Ruby on Rails" looks like when Base64 encoded: <b><strong>UnVieSBvbiBSYWlscw==</strong></b>.</p></div><p> <strong>It's important to remember that we are not encrypting the text here.</strong> Given Base64 encoded data, it's very easy to convert it back (decode) to the original text. We are only changing the representation of the data, i.e. encoding.</p><p>In its essence, Base64 encoding uses a specific, reduced set of characters to encode binary data, to prevent against data corruption. </p><figure><img src="https://www.akshaykhot.com/content/images/2023/10/base64_encoding.png" alt="The Base64 Alphabet" loading="lazy" width="474" height="309"><figcaption><span>The Base64 Alphabet</span></figcaption></figure><p>As there are only 64 characters available to encode into, we can represent them using only 6 bits, because <code>2^6 = 64</code>. Every Base64 digit represents 6 bits of data. There are 8 bits in a byte, and the closest common multiple of 8 and 6 is 24. So 24 bits, or 3 bytes, can be represented using four 6-bit Base64 digits. </p><p><em>(If that last paragraph totally went over your head, <strong>don't worry</strong>. Hopefully it should be clear by the end of this post.)</em></p><h2 id="why-base64">Why Base64?</h2><p>You must have included an image in your HTML document using the <code>&lt;img src="nature.jpeg"&gt;</code> tag. <strong>Did you know you can embed the image data directly into the HTML without linking to the external image file?</strong> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs?ref=akshaykhot.com" rel="noreferrer">Data URLs</a> let you do this, and they use Base64 encoded text to embed files inline.</p><pre><code>&lt;img src="dataimage/gif;base64,xxxxbase64encodedtextxxxx"&gt;

data:[&lt;mime type&gt;][;charset=&lt;charset&gt;][;base64],&lt;encoded data&gt;</code></pre><div><p>Historically it has been used to encode binary data in email messages where the email server might modify line-endings. A more modern example is the use of Base64 encoding to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sweeting.org/mark/blog/2005/07/12/base64-encoded-images-embedded-in-html?ref=akshaykhot.com" rel="noreferrer">embed image data directly in HTML source code</a>. Here it is necessary to encode the data to avoid characters like '&lt;' and '&gt;' being interpreted as tags.</p><p>From: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538021/why-do-we-use-base64?ref=akshaykhot.com" rel="noreferrer">Why do we use Base64?</a></p></div><p>Another common use case is when we have to store or transmit some binary data over the network that's supposed to handle text, or US-ASCII data. This ensures data remains unchanged during transport. Base64 can also be used for passing data in URLs when that data includes non-URL friendly characters.</p><p>Base encoding is also used in many applications simply because it makes it possible to manipulate objects with text editors.</p><p>You can also transfer files as text, using Base64 encoding. First, get the file's bytes and encode them as Base64. Then transfer the Base64 encoded string, and then decode it back to the original file content on the receiving side. </p><p>Let's take a deeper look into this algorithm in the next section.</p><h2 id="base64-encoding-algorithm">Base64 Encoding Algorithm</h2><p>Here's the simple algorithm that converts some text into Base64. </p><ol><li>Convert the text to its binary representation.</li><li>Divide the bits into groups of 6 bits each.</li><li>Convert each group to a decimal number from 0-63. It cannot be greater than 64 as there are only 6 bits in each group.</li><li>Convert this decimal number to the equivalent Base64 character using the Base64 alphabet.</li></ol><p>That's it. You have a Base64 encoded string. If there're insufficient bits in the final group, you can use <code>=</code> or <code>==</code> as padding.</p><p>Sounds confusing? Don't worry, the following example should make it pretty clear.

The name "Akshay" is represented in Base64 as <code>QWtzaGF5</code>. </p><p>At first glance, the benefit of Base64 encoding is not quite obvious. <strong>What exactly did we achieve by converting "Akshay" to "QWtzaGF5"?</strong> </p><p>Imagine, instead of my name, you had an image or a sensitive file (PDF, text, video, anything, really), and you wanted to store it as text. You could first convert it to binary, and then Base64 encode it to get corresponding ASCII text. </p><p>Now you could send or store that text anywhere and anyhow you like, without worrying whether some legacy device, protocol or software won't misinterpret the raw binary data to corrupt your file. Makes sense? </p><h2 id="how-to-encode-and-decode-base64">How to Encode and Decode Base64</h2><p>All programming languages have support for encoding and decoding data to and from the Base64 format. </p><p>Here is the Ruby code that takes some text as input and converts it into Base-64 encoded string.</p><pre><code>require "base64"

$str = "Ruby on Rails";
echo base64_encode($str);

<p dir="auto">For writing more complex code, it's a good practice to create a template code with pypipe and edit the templated code manually. Here's the process you can follow:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Create a template code with pypipe and save it to a file, for example:
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ppp line --output /tmp/pipe.py ..."><pre>ppp line --output /tmp/pipe.py ...</pre></div>
</li>
<li>Edit the code in /tmp/pipe.py to suit your needs.</li>
<li>Execute the modified code by piping input to it, for example:
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cat sample.txt | /tmp/pipe.py"><pre>cat sample.txt <span>|</span> /tmp/pipe.py</pre></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-main-codes" dir="auto"><a href="#main-codes">Main codes</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The main code is specified as positional arguments. You can specify multiple main codes. The placement of the main code varies depending on the command. In commands like <code>line</code>, <code>rec</code>, <code>csv</code>, and <code>file</code>, the main code is added within the loop processing with proper indentation. However, in the <code>text</code> command, where there is no loop processing, the main code is added without indentation.
In the <code>custom</code> command, the main code is added according to the definitions provided in the <code>pypipe_custom.py</code> file.</p>

I've probably sent out well over a hundred resumes (definitely over this number since I was keeping track until recently). I had a brief respite when I picked up a temp contract but that only lasted about a month.</p><p>I mostly get just rejections. I have over 15 years of experience. I literally know how to build out every part of a normal web/api stack.</p><p>I even have an active ongoing project I've run for 13 years and have scaled to support a couple million requests a day.</p><p>Nothing seems to matter.</p><p>I have maybe managed to get one actual call a week for the last year where I actually speak to someone from the company. And even then, it's been one "thanks for playing" response email after another.</p><p>I honestly don't know what to do. I've <i>never</i> had a problem at least getting interviews to the point where I'm at least in the consideration process.</p><p>I need help.</p><p>I revised my resume a few times and that hasn't helped. I've gotten more involved with LinkedIn and I get more noise but still low results.</p><p>I'm basically getting very desperate.

I adore the Chrome plugin Highlight This -- <a href="https://highlightthis.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://highlightthis.net/</a></p><p>- apply for jobs on a schedule (e.g. Mon-Wed-Fri), don't just struggle for hours at a time, it's soul-sucking.</p><p>- do Studying (job-related tech) interspersed with Fun Programming (generative art!) -- have fun!</p><p>- take care of your health and family, go outside and take walks</p><p>- DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY

I know that my team has more or less had a hiring freeze for about 18 months now, even though the company is doing better than ever.</p><p>Based on nothing more than headlines I've read, it seems the CEO class got spooked about the economy last year and hasn't eased up yet.  It doesn't help that interest rates are high, which typically bodes poorly for tech(despite megatech having plenty of cash right now due to a number of factors, along with debt held at mostly low, fixed rates).  Many, many smart folks thought the economy would have died last year.  My guess is that we are largely avoiding it thanks to near-record levels of debt-based federal spending(govt debt more or less becomes an asset to private sector). If high rates force the feds to cut spending(unlikely, given war and going into an election year), I think we'll see things cool quickly, but barring that I'm not so sure the economy is going to crash anytime soon. Some sectors, yes.

Seven months, dozens of applications, four interviews. Two interviews were from applications, one from a recruiter cold-call, and one from networking. Applications to interview was about 4 months. Three were EM positions, one was senior engineer.

I've had 2 final stage interviews: knocked back in one and dropped out of the other (red flags). Have also had 2-3 applications get a "this role now on hold, soz" response. So I'm getting just enough interest to keep hope alive. Even the steady stream of LinkedIn PMs for vaguely-related jobs has dried up.<p>I touched up the resume a little bit but otherwise I'm not doing anything a whole lot differently. I was almost allowing myself to quit this ass job if I instead got some vendor certs, but I'm increasingly concerned that a decent job market might years away, not months, so the suffering continues. :)

<p>A diverse set of species, from snails to algae to amoebas, make programmable DNA-cutting enzymes called Fanzors—and a new study from scientists at MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research has identified thousands of them. Fanzors are RNA-guided enzymes that can be programmed to cut DNA at specific sites, much like the bacterial enzymes that power the widely used gene-editing system known as CRISPR. The newly recognized diversity of natural Fanzor enzymes, reported Sept. 27 in the journal <i>Science Advances</i>, gives scientists an extensive set of programmable enzymes that might be adapted into new tools for research or medicine.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>"RNA-guided biology is what lets you make programmable tools that are really easy to use. So the more we can find, the better," says McGovern Fellow Omar Abudayyeh, who led the research with McGovern Fellow Jonathan Gootenberg.
</p><p>CRISPR, an ancient bacterial defense system, has made it clear how useful RNA-guided enzymes can be when they are adapted for use in the lab. CRISPR-based genome editing tools developed by MIT professor and McGovern investigator Feng Zhang, Abudayyeh, Gootenberg, and others have changed the way scientists modify DNA, accelerating research and enabling the development of many experimental gene therapies.
</p><p>Researchers have since uncovered other RNA-guide enzymes throughout the bacterial world, many with features that make them valuable in the lab. The discovery of Fanzors, whose ability to cut DNA in an RNA-guided manner was reported by Zhang's group earlier this year, opens a new frontier of RNA-guided biology. Fanzors were the first such enzymes to be found in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/eukaryotic+organisms/" rel="tag">eukaryotic organisms</a>—a wide group of lifeforms, including plants, animals, and fungi, defined by the membrane-bound nucleus that holds each cell's genetic material. (Bacteria, which lack nuclei, belong to a group known as prokaryotes.)
</p><p>"People have been searching for interesting tools in prokaryotic systems for a long time, and I think that that has been incredibly fruitful," says Gootenberg. "Eukaryotic systems are really just a whole new kind of playground to work in."
</p><p>One hope, Abudayyeh and Gootenberg say, is that enzymes that naturally evolved in eukaryotic organisms might be better suited to function safely and efficiently in the cells of other eukaryotic organisms, including humans. Zhang's group has shown that Fanzor enzymes can be engineered to precisely cut specific DNA sequences in human cells. In the new work, Abudayyeh and Gootenberg discovered that some Fanzors can target DNA sequences in human cells even without optimization. "The fact that they work quite efficiently in mammalian cells was really fantastic to see," Gootenberg says.
</p><p>Prior to the current study, hundreds of Fanzors had been found among eukaryotic organisms. Through an extensive search of genetic databases led by lab member Justin Lim, Gootenberg and Abudayyeh's team has now expanded the known diversity of these enzymes by an order of magnitude.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>Among the more than 3,600 Fanzors that the team found in eukaryotes and the viruses that infect them, the researchers were able to identify five different families of the enzymes. By comparing these enzymes' precise makeup, they found evidence of a long evolutionary history.
</p><p>Fanzors likely evolved from RNA-guided DNA-cutting bacterial enzymes called TnpBs. In fact, it was Fanzors' genetic similarities to these <a href="https://phys.org/tags/bacterial+enzymes/" rel="tag">bacterial enzymes</a> that first caught the attention of both Zhang's group and Gootenberg and Abudayyeh's team.
</p><p>The evolutionary connections that Gootenberg and Abudayyeh traced suggest that these bacterial predecessors of Fanzors probably entered eukaryotic cells, initiating their evolution, more than once. Some were likely transmitted by viruses, while others may have been introduced by symbiotic bacteria. The research also suggests that after they were taken up by eukaryotes, the enzymes evolved features suited to their new environment, such as a signal that allows them to enter a cell nucleus, where they have access to DNA.
</p><p>Through genetic and biochemical experiments led by biological engineering graduate student Kaiyi Jiang, the team determined that Fanzors have evolved a DNA-cutting active site that is distinct from that of their bacterial predecessors. This seems to allow the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/enzyme/" rel="tag">enzyme</a> to cut its target sequence more precisely the ancestors of TnpB, when targeted to a sequence of DNA in a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/test+tube/" rel="tag">test tube</a>, become activated and cut other sequences in the tube; Fanzors lack this promiscuous activity. When they used an RNA guide to direct the enzymes to cut specific sites in the genome of human cells, they found that certain Fanzors were able to cut these target sequences with about 10 to 20 percent efficiency.
</p><p>With further research, Abudayyeh and Gootenberg hope that a variety of sophisticated genome editing tools can be developed from Fanzors. "It's a new platform, and they have many capabilities," says Gootenberg.
</p><p>"Opening up the whole eukaryotic world to these types of RNA-guided systems is going to give us a lot to work on," Abudayyeh adds.

<p>Let’s start with the numbers.</p><p>The <a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend" target="_blank">FBI’s annual report on the nation’s crime</a> statistics showed a 6% decline in homicides in 2022. The drop exceeded what most crime experts expected, said <b>Jeff Asher</b>, a crime data analyst and consultant whose <a href="https://www.ahdatalytics.com/" target="_blank">AH Datalytics’ site</a> is a widely cited source of information.</p><p>The FBI data, which the bureau compiled from reports filed by 18,888 local police departments, lags nearly a year behind reality. Asher, who puts together data from departments that cover a large majority of the nation’s population, says that so far this year, homicides nationwide have declined 11% to 12%. </p><p>Cities tend to report first and have larger drops than more-rural areas, Asher noted, so he’s projecting the final, nationwide 2023 numbers will show a smaller drop — somewhere between 7% and 10%.</p><p>“A 10% decline would be the largest ever recorded,” he said.</p><p>The decline goes beyond homicides: Violent crime overall ticked down in 2022 across the country, the FBI numbers showed, returning the U.S. pretty much to the level of 2019, before the COVID-19-era increase.</p><p>That’s consistent with the pattern of the last dozen years. Despite some fluctuations, violent crime nationwide has stayed largely at the same level since 2011, when it hit a plateau after 20 years of steady declines.</p><p>That doesn’t mean all categories of crime have declined. Auto thefts, for example, have soared in many parts of the country, in part because of a wave of social media videos publicizing easy <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-19/hyundai-kia-reach-settlement-on-vehicles-vulnerable-to-tiktok-theft-challenge">ways to steal Kia and Hyundai cars</a>.</p><p>But “the concept of a violent crime wave — it just really doesn’t exist,” Asher said.</p><h2 id="california-declines-similar-to-u-s">California declines similar to U.S.</h2>
<p>The numbers in California are similar to the national ones: In 2022, the state saw a 6.1% drop in homicides although it had a <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/crime-trends-in-california/?utm_source=ppic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=epub" target="_blank">5.7% increase in violent crime</a> overall compared with the preceding year, according to data from the Public Policy Institute of California.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-12/violent-crime-is-down-fear-is-up-why-is-la-perceived-as-dangerous">Los Angeles, violent crime has declined</a> nearly 7% so far this year compared with last year, according to Los Angeles Police Department statistics. The city has experienced 1,650 fewer incidents reported as of Sept. 30, the numbers show.</p><p>The public perception is very different. Gallup, for example, has surveyed Americans every fall for years about crime. Last year’s survey found that by <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1603/crime.aspx" target="_blank">56%-28%, Americans said crime had increased</a> in their area. </p><p>That’s almost always true. More Americans said crime increased than decreased in all but four of the last 24 years, Gallup found — the exceptions being 2000, 2001, 2004 and 2018. That was true despite the huge decline in crime nationwide that began in 1991, when crime peaked, and continued through 2011 for violent crime and through 2020 for property crimes.</p><h2 id="anecdotes-shape-perception">Anecdotes shape perception</h2>
<p>Why the gap between perception and reality?</p><p>The power of anecdote explains much of it: In a country of nearly 340 million people, some crime takes place every hour, every day. Those incidents stick in people’s minds, especially when the details are grisly. Vivid stories have far more power than dry numbers to shape how people view their world. And in the social media era, crimes anywhere can be just a click away.</p><p>“Every time there’s a smash-and-grab, it just amplifies in people’s minds that crime’s out of control,” said pollster <b>David Paleologos</b>, director of the Suffolk University polling center, which has <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/academics/research-at-suffolk/political-research-center/polls/cityview-polls" target="_blank">surveyed residents of many of the country’s major cities</a>.</p><p>Anecdotes have even greater impact when they’re fresh and crime statistics aren’t. Unlike economic statistics, which arrive monthly in real time, the U.S. system for reporting crime data, first set up in the 1930s, remains antiquated and slow. By the time the government reports the data, it’s often too old to inform national debates.</p><p>The localized nature of most crime plays a role too. In any year, whatever the national trend, some city probably will have an uptick in crime — often without a clear cause. This year, for example, Washington, D.C., has suffered a sharp increase in killings, in marked contrast to the nationwide decline. San Francisco has experienced a heavily publicized <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-07/san-francisco-police-launches-crackdown-on-retail-crime">rash of retail burglaries</a>. News tends to focus on the unusual, not the routine, so those outliers get disproportionate attention.</p><h2 id="politics-amplifies-fears">Politics amplifies fears</h2>
<p>And, of course, “part of what causes the gap between perception and reality is politics,” said Democratic pollster and strategist <b>Anna Greenberg,</b> whose firm has conducted several studies on public attitudes toward crime.</p><p>Even when crime is declining nationwide, some people live in unsafe neighborhoods and have very real fears about being victimized. Black women, for example, many of whom live in urban neighborhoods with high crime rates, are among the groups who rank crime highest on their list of priorities.</p><p>They’re not, however, the voters who most often back policies traditionally seen as tough on crime — longer sentences, for example, or expanded police powers. Those voters — generally older, conservative and white — often live in relatively low-crime areas. When polled, they frequently rate their own neighborhoods as safe but say crime is rampant elsewhere.</p><p>There’s an obvious racial subtext for many of those voters’ concerns about crime. But race isn’t the only factor. For many voters, worries about crime reflect a concern about “a sense of disorder and chaos” in the world, Greenberg said.</p><p>“That doesn’t come out of nowhere. We’ve been in a very unsettling period in our country,” she added.</p><p>There’s evidence, however, that even if public perceptions of crime remain at odds with reality, voters are less prone to support “lock them up” as a solution.</p><p>Research that Greenberg’s firm has done for Vera Action, a liberal research and advocacy organization, suggests that Democrats often can <a href="https://www.gqrr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Vera-TrueLine-national-memo-9.18.23-proofed_final-2.pdf" target="_blank">counter Republican messages on crime</a> by stressing their support for measures like expanded mental health treatment and getting guns off the street.</p><p>“A more comprehensive, prevention focus is more popular than just punishing your way out of the problem,” Greenberg said.</p><p>Electoral experience backs up that claim.

			<h2>Rebelle Rally has become a proving ground for the EV maker</h2>

				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>Motorsports and off-road</span> competition isn’t the typical fodder over here at TechCrunch — unless, of course, there also happens to be a podium-winning team driving an all-electric 2023 Rivian R1T.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rebellerally.com/?playlist=66d89f6&amp;video=559d83d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebelle Rally</a>, the longest off-road map-and-compass rally in the United States, wrapped up Friday evening with a new EV milestone under its belt. This was the first time that a team driving an all-electric vehicle (that would be the Rivian R1T) came in first place. The Rebelle Rally, in which all-women teams competed along a 2,120-kilometer course using only paper maps, compasses, and plotters, is in its eighth year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 Rivian R1T</a>, with Lilly Macaruso behind the wheel and Alex Anderson behind the compass and map, took first place in the 4×4 class. (An EV has yet to make the podium in the X Cross class.) Macaruso and Anderson, who are both Rivian employees, came in fourth place in the 2022 Rebelle Rally. This year, in another first, Rivian customer, Many Brezina, took her personally owned R1T in the competition. Brezina, and navigator Alex Gilman, finished 11th.</p>

<p>The Rivian R1T, which Anderson and Macaruso playfully nicknamed ‘Timmy,’ is actually considered a bone stock, meaning nothing aside from tires were changed on the vehicle that would affect its performance. However, Macaruso and Anderson, both of whom work Rivian, made a number of modifications to the interior to keep them organized during the event.</p>
<p>Anderson, a senior mechanical engineer at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/rivian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rivian</a>, designed a number of items that her co-workers helped bring to life, including inserts for secure storage of a five-gallon water jug, encasing the interior of the A piller with velcro and fabricating mounts for a shovel and fire extinguisher. Anderson also 3D printed an upper cup holder that hooked onto the center console and a lower tray that sat just below it.</p>
<p>“All of these little changes added up for us,” Anderson said after the Rebelle Rally concluded.</p>
<h2>Proving ground</h2>
<p>The Rebelle has also become a proving ground of sorts for Rivian.</p>
<p>Rivian first came on the Rebelle scene in 2020 when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/emme-hall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emme Hall</a>, who is also an automotive journalist and contributor at TechCrunch, drove a pre-production version of the R1T. Rivian has sponsored a team every year since. The EV startup turned publicly traded company has used its experience at Rebelle Rally to workshop ideas and fine tune technology and features that eventually make their way into vehicles that consumers own.</p>
<p>While Rivian engineers told me that <a href="https://stories.rivian.com/software-update-soft-sand-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“sand mode”</a> was always the plan, feedback from Hall as well as Rivian employees who have competed in Rebelle helped the company perfect the drive mode. Rivian’s 2022 Rebelle teams were instrumental in final validation of the software build, according to the company.</p>
<p>The latest example can be found in Rivian’s new 2023.38.0 software. In that OTA software update Rivian added a gauge view, which adapts each drive mode and gives real-time information about the vehicle’s battery <span>and motor temperature, torque, steering angle, pitch and roll and tire pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Rebelle Rally brings competitors far from established charging stations or gas stations, for that matter. Rebelle has partnered with companies like Pennzoil for gas and Renewable Innovations for green hydrogen. What does green hydrogen have to do with charging an EV?</p>
<p>Renewable Innovations has been providing DC fast chargers for the race since 2020. But until this year, the company used diesel generators to power up the chargers. The intention, Rebelle Rally founder Emily Miller told TechCrunch, was always to use hydrogen.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge was the EV infrastructure,” Miller told TechCrunch at the finish line of Rebelle Rally 2023.</p>
<p>It took years to find the right partner, build out the infrastructure and secure the 800 kilograms of green hydrogen required for the 10-day event, she added.</p>
<p>Today, there are four charge points available to competitors. These chargers are trailered out to spots along the course for teams driving EVs.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.archmission.org/nanofiche">https://www.archmission.org/nanofiche</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37978483">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-5c211236596558cd04a7">
  <h3><strong>Nanofiche: Space-Age Archival Storage</strong></h3><p>The Arch Mission Foundation chose a new technology — nickel based films of Nanofiche™ — for the Arch Lunar Library.™ </p><p>We chose Nanofiche because it is ideally suited to preserving large amounts of analog format information in the harsh environment of space and the surface of the Moon.</p><p>When it comes to preserving data in extreme environments, such as outer space, the surfaces and atmospheres of planets, or underground or underwater, there really is no alternative to Nanofiche today.  </p><p>There is no other archival technology that we know of that is space-grade, lightweight, highly durable and efficient, and ready for prime-time today. Nanofiche is the only viable solution for these scenarios. </p><h3><strong>What is Nanofiche?</strong></h3><p>Nanofiche is a new analog archival preservation media that overcomes the limitations of existing technologies. </p><p>Unlike other alternatives, nickel-based Nanofiche never degrades and never has to be replaced. </p><p>Nickel does not oxidize, has no half-life, and can withstand electromagnetic radiation, high heat, extreme cold, and exposure to the elements, microbes, and many types of chemicals, for thousands of years or longer on Earth. </p><p>Nanofiche can also store up to 2,000 analog pages of text at 150 dpi, per square centimeter. </p><p>For example a 20 x 20 mm nickel Nanofiche sheet can hold up to 8,000 pages of text rendered at 150 dpi. </p><p><em>At this resolution, a letter size page of Nanofiche would hold up to 1.2 million analog images and pages of text!</em></p><p>If the content to be preserved contains photos, then the output must be rendered at double the resolution (300 dpi) to reduce pixelation and increase image quality. Because photos are rendered to Nanofiche in grayscale diffusion dithers, it effectively reduces the capacity to from 1.2 million images, to 300,000 analog images, per letter size sheet of Nanofiche. </p><p>For greater image quality, at 600 dpi, Nanofiche can still hold an impressive 150,000 analog images of pages and photos, per single 8.5”*11” sheet.</p><p>It also worth noting that Nanofiche primarily stores data in analog format, but can also be used to encode digital data for archival preservation as well — either as analog images of digital bitmaps, or in native digital formats (such as DVD format).</p><h3><strong>how long does Nanofiche last? </strong></h3><p>The Pyramids and the hieroglyphics they contain are still readable, thousands of years after being built and abandoned. But, ironically, for all our advances, our civilization’s records are far more delicate than those of ancient civilizations that used stone and metal to capture their knowledge.</p><p>If there was a national or global catastrophe, the majority of our knowledge and data would be immediately inaccessible, and then gone without a trace in 50 years or less. Within a few decades to a few hundred years after such an event, all our paper records would decay as well, leaving only dust.</p><h3><strong>The Ephemerality of The Digital Age</strong></h3><p>The digital data that our present-day civilization  depends on is stored in, and accessed with,  plastic and other unstable materials. These materials oxidize and decay in only a few decades or less, or even faster if exposed to water, chemicals, or extreme temperatures.  </p><p>The computer equipment and electronic devices that power the world - from phones to the server farms that drive the Internet and all major corporations and governments, are also highly vulnerable to electromagnetic radiation. In the event of a major solar storm, or an EMP attack, nuclear blast, or high energy cosmic energy burst, anything not protected by military-grade shielding would be lost.</p><p>And then there are all the ordinary risks, like loss of power, power surges, fires, floods, and other natural disasters that can destroy or prevent use of our information technologies and storage media.</p><p>In short, our digitally-dependent civilization’s  technologies make it increasingly vulnerable to a variety of risks. </p><h3><strong>Microfiche: 1960’s Archival</strong></h3><p>The only sure-fire way to guarantee that important information can be recovered in the event of a catastrophic event, is to back it up with specialized archival media that are designed to survive and be recoverable, even without access to computers and electronics.</p><p>The preferred technology for critical long-term backups is analog archival storage. However, today nearly all such storage uses an decades-old film-based media called microfiche. </p><p>Microfiche is a fragile, film-based media, invented in 1961, that stores data as optical images on film — literally, tiny photographs.</p><p>Microfiche is created using camera systems and retrieved using mechanical optical microfiche readers that, if you are over 30, you may have encountered in a library when you were in school. </p><p><br><strong>The weaknesses of Microfiche</strong></p><p>While microfiche is certainly more durable than any form of paper or magnetic media, and even most optical media, it is delicate, perishable, costly to maintain, and takes up far more physical space than Nanofiche. </p><p>Microfiche is sensitive to environmental conditions and must be carefully maintained. It is vulnerable to humidity, heat, and water damage. It requires HVAC to maintain a proper temperature and humidity environment to preserve it. Sustained loss of power that disables HVAC, or damage from natural disasters such as floods, can result in total loss or damage that requires costly replacement or salvage operations.</p><p>Microfiche has a life expectancy of 400 to 800 years, if maintained continuously under ideal conditions. However most State Archives only certify microfiche for 25 to 50 years, after which point a new copy of the media must be generated to be certain that records are preserved. .</p><p>Microfiche is also not very space efficient compared to today’s digital media. Microfiche typically stores 0.4 pages per square centimeter. A typical sheet or card of microfiche is 3” x 5” or 9 x 12 cm and contains 40 pages of text, with a reduction equivalent of about 25 times. </p><p>A letter size format sheet of microfiche would hold only about 250 pages of text, compared to up to 1.2 million pages of text in Nanofiche. While there are some forms of microfiche that can store slightly more pages per sheet, they are not widely used and are still not comparable to Nanofiche’s capacity.</p><p>Due to the dual necessities of HVAC and replacement, and the physical space requirements of microfiche storage, and the need for old-fashioned microfiche readers, the total cost-of ownership of microfiche grows with time</p><h3><strong>Who Makes Nanofiche?</strong></h3><p>Nanofiche is a new medium, that is only supplied by a single vendor. </p><p>Nanofiche is a patented, proprietary product of Stamper Technology, under license from NanoIP. </p><p>The technology underlying Nanofiche is based on the inventions and technology of Arch Mission Foundation Chief Scientist, Bruce Ha, a senior research scientist who invented the technology for PictureCD technology while at Kodak. </p><p><strong>WHAT ARE THE&nbsp; NICKEL NANOFICHE SPECIFICATIONS?</strong></p><p>• Deep blue laser technology optically reduced to a 100nm focus point.</p><p>• Text at 0.003 point size can be printed at 1,000 pages per minute lithographically per printer.</p><p>• Size of each character of text is 1 micron, or the size of a bacillus bacterium. A page fits within the width of a human hair. </p><p>• 1.2 million pages of 200 dpi images or text can fit on a single 8.5 inch * 11 inch letter-sized sheet of Nanofiche.</p><p>• The master is written to glass at 300,000 dpi and then is electro deposited into nickel.</p><p>• Elemental nickel has melting point of 2,651 F.</p><p>• Los Alamos environmentally tested writing on nickel at high temperature (570 F) and found no degradation up to the longest test time of 65h as measured by SEM at 20,000X.</p><p>• Longevity of engraved content expected to last billions of years, if undisturbed, for example, in outer space. On the surface of the Moon, we project 50 million years or longer (depending on how it is protected). On the surface of the Earth, at least 10,000 years (or up to millions of years if below the surface).</p><p>• Every page is encoded with diffractive security features as a special flag as well.</p><p>• Covered by US patents 8717650, 8264757, 7961367, 7830573<br></p>

Many users, especially developers -- including Linus Torvalds -- love it. As Torvalds recently said, "Normally, I wouldn't name names, but I'm <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/look-whats-inside-linus-torvalds-latest-linux-development-pc/" rel="follow">making an exception for the XPS 13</a> just because I liked it so much that I also ended up buying one for my daughter when she went off to college."&nbsp;</p><p>So, how did Dell -- best known for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/" rel="follow">good-quality, mass-produced PCs</a> -- end up building top-of-the-line&nbsp;<a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Ubuntu Linux</a>&nbsp;laptops? Well, Barton George, Dell Technologies' Developer Community manager, shared the "Project Sputnik"&nbsp;  story this week in a presentation at the popular Linux and open-source community show,&nbsp;<a href="https://2023.allthingsopen.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">All Things Open</a>.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-linux-laptop/" rel="follow">The best Linux laptops (and why you might want one)</a></strong></p><p>First, however, you should know that Dell has supported Linux desktops and laptops since the middle 2000s. In 2006, Michael Dell told me that&nbsp;<a href="https://practical-tech.com/2006/03/08/dell-opens-up-about-desktop-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Dell would be the first major PC vendor to release and support desktop Linux</a>&nbsp;-- and this proved to be a success.&nbsp;</p><p>George explained that Dell had always done great volume with these computers. Not volume, like the Windows machines, of course, but enough that Dell has always offered Linux-based -- primarily&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</a>&nbsp;powered --&nbsp; workstations. &nbsp;</p><!----><p>Still, none of these machines really appealed to developers. George explained:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;"Back in 2011, a group of us were trying to figure out how Dell could become more relevant to developers. Dell wasn't a big thing in developers' minds, and we decided it would be a good idea to get developers to change their minds and to think of Dell as a company they wanted to work with."&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This notion had been sparked by a conversation between Dell and Stephen O'Grady, co-founder of the developer-centric analyst firm <a href="https://redmonk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">RedMonk</a>. Barton recalled O'Grady suggesting it would be great for developers "if you took one of your laptops, put Ubuntu on it, and just got it to work. We said that's an awesome idea, but it'll never happen, because we're talking about Dell. Our laptops need to deliver huge volumes and revenue. When I talked to one of our higher-ups about the volumes that we thought we would sell, he said, 'Yeah, that's what we sell in Belgium on Tuesday, between three and four in the afternoon.'"&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this disheartening evaluation, when Dell started an in-house innovation fund, Barton pitched it again. This time, he was granted $40,000 to pursue the idea. "This was enough to get going," George recalled. "So, first thing, we put together an official team. But none of us were full-time on this. We got approval from their managers to work on this officially, but it was sort of in our spare time." At times, George said, "The project staff was two people and a dog."</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-linux-desktops-for-beginners/" rel="follow">The best Linux distros for beginners</a></strong></p><p>George approached Google and Amazon: "'Here's what we're trying to do,' he related his pitch. 'Does this look like something you'd be interested in?' And so while they didn't place an order there for 10,000 units, they didn't laugh me out of the room, either." It was enough to prove there was a business case for a developer-focused Ubuntu Linux laptop. &nbsp;</p><p>During that same period, George announced on his personal blog what Dell was planning, and his traffic went from 60 views a day to 15,000. Then, as now, there's a lot of interest in laptops that come with Linux ready to go.&nbsp;</p><p>After all that, the team wanted to ensure they did it right. This wouldn't just be a case of dumping a distro on a machine and hoping for the best. You can do that today and have an excellent chance of everything working perfectly. In 2013? Not so much.&nbsp;</p><p>George added, "We created a rough image that people could use on the XPS 13. Developers could download it and start working on it. We told people there were a&nbsp; lot of caveats, and it wasn't an official release nor supported. But the key thing here is while you couldn't do this with consumers, with developers -- who knew it was a beta-- then you're okay. And, we had most of the bugs worked out. The biggest one was the touchpad, which somebody described as 'craptastic'."</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-might-be-your-best-bet-for-heightening-your-desktop-computer-security/" rel="follow">Linux might be your best bet for heightening your desktop computer security</a></strong></p><p>So, Dell got together with <a href="https://canonical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Canonical</a>, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, to make sure all the drivers were in place for a top-notch Ubuntu Linux developer desktop experience. Indeed, the name 'Project Sputnik' is a nod to Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu founder and Canonical CEO. A decade before the project itself, Shuttleworth had spent eight days orbiting the Earth in a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. George and the crew decided "Soyuz"&nbsp; didn't have an inspiring ring to it, so the company went with "Sputnik" instead.</p><p>George continued:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;"We announced a beta program for the machine with a 10% off offer. We thought, well, we'll probably get 300 people. Instead, we got 6,000. This is where senior management said OK, you've got something real. We went from slides to launch in nine months. That's pretty fast for building a system."</p></blockquote><p>Now, more than a decade later, the <span><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/subid_value/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-plus-developer-edition/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop/usexcucto9320rpl01" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Dell XPS 13 line</span><!----></a></span> and other <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/ubuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">other Ubuntu-Linux-powered systems</a> are more popular than ever.

<p>The <b>Great Male Renunciation</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a>: <i lang="fr">Grande Renonciation masculine</i>) is the historical phenomenon at the end of the 18th century in which Western men stopped using bright colours, elaborate shapes and variety in their dress, which were left to women's clothing.  Instead men concentrated on minute differences of cut, and the quality of the plain cloth.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Coined by the Anglo-German psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fl%C3%BCgel" title="John Flügel">John Flügel</a> in 1930, it is considered a major turning point in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_clothing_and_textiles" title="History of clothing and textiles">history of clothing</a> in which the men relinquished their claim to adornment and beauty.<sup id="cite_ref-bbc_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-bbc-2">[2]</a></sup> Flugel asserted that men "abandoned their claim to be considered beautiful" and "henceforth aimed at being only useful".<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The Great Renunciation encouraged the establishment of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_(clothing)" title="Suit (clothing)">suit</a>'s monopoly on male dress codes at the beginning of the 19th century.

        				<p><span>US regulators are fast-tracking a novel, gene-altering insecticide in an unusual move that would greenlight the product for three years of commercial use before a standard testing period is completed.</span></p>
<p><span>Calantha, a product of the company GreenLight Biosciences, contains the active ingredient ledprona, which uses a mechanism called RNA interference (RNAi) to kill the Colorado potato beetle, a notorious pest, by turning off genes it needs to survive. Calantha would be the first pesticide spray using RNAi, though the technology has been genetically engineered into some </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/epa-registers-innovative-tool-control-corn-rootworm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>corn plants</span></a><span> to protect them from the corn rootworms, and RNAi has a history of use in medical therapeutics and vaccines.</span></p>
<p><span>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) just granted GreenLight Biosciences an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) in May, giving the company two years to gather and assess data from use of the new product in limited test plots. But now the new pesticide could be widely sprayed on potato crops around the country as early as this spring.</span></p>
<p><span>Critics fear that the new pesticide is being rushed to market without sufficient data to demonstrate that it is safe for human health and the environment. They also question whether it will be effective.</span></p>
<p><span>“It’s a huge precedent-setter,” said Michael Hansen, a senior scientist at Consumer Reports. “This is a new form of pesticide which has never been on the market before. When this is a new class [of pesticide], you shouldn’t be cutting corners.”</span></p>
<p><span>The EPA said Friday that it is extending the public comment period for ledprona following a request from the environmental group Friends of the Earth. The deadline for the comment period, which was scheduled to end October 13, has been </span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2021-0271-0009" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>moved to October 30</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3>Unintended consequences</h3>
<p><span>Agrichemical companies applaud gene-silencing pesticides as a promising solution to the problem of pest resistance and an answer to consumers’ call for pesticide residue-free products.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2021, the US Department of Agriculture wrote a </span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OPP-2021-0271-0002" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>letter</span></a><span> to the EPA strongly encouraging the agency to authorize ledprona for experimental use, writing that it “could displace some broad-spectrum insecticide usage” and could help potato growers manage the invasive insect.</span></p>
<p><span>Multiple studies have “confirmed” that the product has no harmful effect on “people, pollinators, birds, fish or other non-target organisms,” said a spokesperson for GreenLight Biosciences. “Additionally, unlike the commercial chemical pesticides commonly used to control Colorado Potato Beetle, Calantha leaves no detectable residues on food, soil, water or in the atmosphere,” the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><span>Still, opponents fear embracing this biotech alternative to chemical pesticides without carefully assessing risks could simply create new problems. Gene-silencing pesticides, which large companies including Bayer, BASF, and Syngenta are also developing, could potentially harm off-target species and jeopardize farmers’ health, critics argue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We can’t assume that because a technology is biological and not chemical that it is necessarily going to be safe,” said Kendra Klein, deputy director for science at Friends of the Earth and an author of a 2020 </span><a href="https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/RNAi_FullReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>report</span></a><span> that calls gene-silencing pesticides “a vast, open-air genetic experiment”. “We are considering releasing a material into the environment that will genetically engineer organisms in real time. We have such a long history of unintended consequences of technologies in agriculture – it would be foolish to not assume that there will be unintended consequences to this technology.”</span></p>
<p><span>The gene-silencing mechanism used by such pesticides can be triggered whenever they encounter a matching or similar genetic sequence, noted Klein.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re talking about potentially thousands of other species that would have related genetic sequences,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The EPA said in a </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticides/epa-opens-public-comment-period-proposal-register-novel-pesticide-technology-potato" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>press release</span></a><span> that EUP experimental testing will continue during the initial commercial registration period and data from it “may be used in a future application for this product to amend its directions for use.”</span></p>
<p><span>But critics said that is not sufficient. The EPA should know, for instance, how spraying the pesticide might affect species other than the intended target, including endangered beetles and the birds and amphibians that prey on the potato pest, said Jaydee Hanson, the policy director at the Center for Food Safety.</span></p>
<p><span>“The EPA had done a pretty good job leading up to their abrupt notice that they wanted to approve this as a pesticide,” said Hanson. “It’s not a bad job for the start of a field trial. But it’s a grossly incomplete job for turning this into an approval of the pesticide.”</span></p>
<h3>Immune response and efficacy concerns</h3>
<p><span>Consumer Reports’ Hansen said he commends the EPA for having the company consider effects on endangered species and for looking at both the active ingredient and the formulated product when conducting tests. “Those are big steps forward,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, Hansen remains concerned about the possibility that the new pesticide could trigger an immune system response in humans. An analysis by GreenLight Biosciences previously identified two human transcripts that could potentially be affected by ledprona, although the final EPA</span><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2021-0271-0005" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span> human health risk assessment </span></a><span>states that “there is a reasonable expectation that ledprona is unlikely to affect these genes </span><i><span>in vivo</span></i><span>.”</span></p>
<p><span>“But they don’t present enough data for us to see whether that’s true,” said Hansen.</span></p>
<p><span>The EPA notes in the assessment that double-stranded RNA molecules that are on the longer side, such as ledprona, “are generally considered candidates to induce innate immune responses.” As a result, the agency concludes that farmers and others working with the pesticide should wear respirators to avoid any risks from inhaling the pesticide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, the agency is not requiring “any kind of verification that everyone’s going to be wearing [personal protective equipment] or even monitoring any of those folks to see if anything is happening,” Hansen said. “It seems to me almost like a ‘don’t look, don’t find’ strategy.”</span></p>
<p><span>Hansen also wonders about the pesticide’s efficacy – and the efficacy of RNAi pesticides more generally. A 2021 Scientific Reports </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85876-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>study</span></a><span> assessed a similar double-stranded RNA, which was being developed for a spray to combat the same potato pest. It found that within nine generations, 11,100 times the original quantity of pesticide was needed to get the same effect – an “extremely high” level of resistance, according to the study itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I would want to see the same thing on this product [ledprona] before it was ever approved, because if it does select for resistance very rapidly, that’s not useful,” said Hansen. “With most chemical pesticides you don’t see something like that,” he added. “That caused me to wonder if this whole field will just collapse.”</span></p>

If so, is there a reference implementation/article to read about it? Martin responds: What would be the goal in that as opposed to Collector -> collector tiering?"><figcaption><i>Doesn't collector tiering make more sense, generally, than using a queue?</i></figcaption></figure><p>(Big thank you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-thwaites-ab445120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin</a> for always being there with a helpful answer.)</p><h2 id="what-the-collector-does">What the Collector Does<a href="#what-the-collector-does" aria-label="Direct link to What the Collector Does" title="Direct link to What the Collector Does">​</a></h2><p>To review, the OpenTelemetry Collector is an optional but strongly recommended part of an OpenTelemetry observability deployment. The collector can gather, compress, manage, and filter data sent by OpenTelemetry instrumentation before data gets sent to your observability backend. If sending data to the SigNoz backend, the system will look something like this:</p><figure data-zoomable="true"><img loading="lazy" src="https://signoz.io/img/blog/2023/10/c2c-2.webp" alt="Graph of a simple distribution with a single collector"><figcaption><i>Calls from OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, API calls, and other code instrumented with the OpenTelemetry SDK all go to the collector running on a host.</i></figcaption></figure><p>In more advanced cases, however, this may not be sufficient. Imagine an edge service that handles high-frequency requests, sending regular requests to a fairly distant collector on the same network. The result will be errors raised on the app when it fails to reach the collector for every single request.</p><p>Again, the whole benefit of the collector is that it should be able to cache, batch, and compress data for sending, no matter how high-frequency its data ingest.</p><h2 id="multi-collector-architecture">Multi-Collector Architecture<a href="#multi-collector-architecture" aria-label="Direct link to Multi-Collector Architecture" title="Direct link to Multi-Collector Architecture">​</a></h2><figure data-zoomable="true"><img loading="lazy" src="https://signoz.io/img/blog/2023/10/c2c-3.webp" alt="Diagram of a multi-collector architecture"><figcaption><i>A collector, B, running close to the service being instrumented could collect data reliably and batch it before sending to a second, central collector, C. The C collector could gather data from multiple other 'front-line' collectors before sending to a data backend.</i></figcaption></figure><p>This has a number of advantages:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: In large-scale distributed systems, a single OpenTelemetry collector might not be sufficient to handle the volume of telemetry data generated by all the services and applications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduced Network Traffic</strong>: For every additional step of filtering that happens within your network, you reduce the total amount of network bandwidth used for observability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Filtering and Sampling</strong>: With a multi-tiered approach, you can perform data filtering, transformation, or sampling at the intermediate collector before forwarding the data to the central collector. This can be done by teams who know the microservices under instrumentation and what data is important to highlight. Alternatively, if you have an issue like PII showing up from multiple services, you can set filtering on the central collector to make sure the rules are followed everywhere.</p></li></ul><h3 id="using-a-kafka-queue-for-otlp-data">Using a Kafka Queue for OTLP Data<a href="#using-a-kafka-queue-for-otlp-data" aria-label="Direct link to Using a Kafka Queue for OTLP Data" title="Direct link to Using a Kafka Queue for OTLP Data">​</a></h3><p>In the Slack thread above, the proposed solution was to use something like a Kafka queue. This would have the advantage of ingesting events reliably and almost never raising errors. Both an internal queue and a collector-to-collector architecture are ways to improve the reliability of your observability data. The two scenarios where a Kafka Queue makes the most sense for your data are:</p><ol><li>Ensuring data collection during database outages - even reliable databases fail, and Kafka can ingest and store data during the outage. When the DB is up again, the consumer can start taking in data again.</li><li>Handling traffic bursts - observability data can spike during a usage spike, and if you're doing deep tracing, the spike can be even larger in scale than the increase in traffic. If you scale your database to handle this spike without any queuing, the DB will be over-provisioned for normal traffic. A queue will buffer the data spike so that the database can handle it when it's ready.</li></ol><figure data-zoomable="true"><img loading="lazy" src="https://signoz.io/img/blog/2023/10/c2c-4.webp" alt="Diagram with multiple collectors with an added Kafka queue"><figcaption><i>In this new version, a Kafka queue receives data from collectors near the edge. Services could also publish directly to Kafka. Collector C reads the data from the queue, using the OTel Kafka Receiver.</i></figcaption></figure><p>To learn more about the options for receiving data from Kafka, see the <a href="https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W/p1690203259803679" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kafka receiver in the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repository</a>.</p><p>The process for implementing multiple collectors should be straightforward.

<p>The 1990s! They felt like a wasteland of culture at the time, but looking back, there was hyper color t-shirts, the beginning of mainstream computing and the internet, the height of alternative rock, and of course magic eye pictures.</p>



<p>Unfocus your eyes such that the two dots overlap. A 3D image should emerge!</p>

<p>To make an autostereogram, you need two things:<br>1. <strong>Color Image</strong>: A tileable repeating pattern.  This can also just be “white noise”.<br>2. <strong>Depth Image</strong>: A grey scale depth map, or a black and white mask.  This defines the 3D shape. Brighter pixel values are closer in depth.</p>



<p>For the above, I snagged these two from pintrest.</p>

<p>The image you are making is going to be the width and height of the depth image, but is going to have as many color channels as the color image.</p>



<p>You build the output image row by row, from left to right. To start out, we can just tile the output image with the color image.  The <strong>Output Image</strong> pixel at (x,y) is the <strong>Color Image</strong> pixel at (x % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight).  That makes a tiled image, which does not have any 3d effect whatsoever:</p>

<p>To get a 3D effect we need to modify our algorithm.  We need to read the <strong>Depth Image</strong> at pixel (x,y) to get a value from 0 to 255.  We divide that by 255 to get a fractional value between 0 and 1.  We then multiply that value by the “maximum offset amount”, which is a tuneable parameter (i set it to 20), to get an offset amount.  This offset is how much we should move ahead in the pattern.</p>



<p>So, instead of <strong>Output Image</strong> pixel (x,y) using the <strong>Color Image</strong> pixel (x % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight), we are calculating an offset from the <strong>Depth Image</strong> and using the <strong>Color Image</strong> pixel ((x + offset) % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight).</p>



<p>Doing that, we aren’t quite there.  Some 3D effects are starting to pop out, but it doesn’t look quite right.</p>

<p>In fact, if you use the simpler depth map of the rectangles shown below, you can see the rectangles just fine, but there seems to be holes to the right of them.</p>

<p>What we need to do is not just look into the <strong>Color Image</strong> at an offset location, but that we need to look at the <strong>Output Image</strong> we are building, at an offset location.  Specifically, we need to look at it in the previous color tile repetition. We use the <strong>Output Image</strong> pixel at ((x + offset – ColorWidth), y).</p>



<p>A problem with that though, is that when x is less than ColorWidth, we’ll be looking at a pixel x value that is less than 0 aka out of bounds.  When x &lt; ColorWidth, we should use the <strong>Color Image</strong> pixel instead, using the same formula we had before ((x + offset) % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight).</p>



<p>That fixes our problem with the simpler squares depth map. The holes to the right are gone.</p>

<p>And it also mostly fixes our “grave” image:</p>

<p>There is one problem remaining with the grave image though. How these images work is that your left eye needs to lined up with an unmodified tile on the left, and your right eye needs to be lined up with a modified tile on the right. The grave image has depth information very close to the left side, which makes that not be possible. To fix this, you can add an extra “empty color tile” on the left.  That makes our image a little bit wider but it makes it work.  This also has the added benefit of centering the depth map, where it previously was shifted to the left a bit.</p>

<p>There we are, we are done!</p>



<h2>Other Details</h2>



<ul>
<li>I found it useful to normalize the greyscale depth map. Some of them don’t use the full 0 to 1 range, which means they aren’t making the most use of the depth available.  Remapping them to 0 to 1 helps that.</li>



<li>Some masks were meant to be binary black or white, but the images i downloaded form the internet had some grey in them (they were .jpg which is part of the problem – lossy compression). Having an option to binarize these masks was useful, forcing each pixel value or 0 or 1, whichever was closer.</li>



<li>The binary masks i downloaded had the part i was interested in being black, with a white background.  I made the code able to invert this, so the interest part would pop out instead of receeding in.</li>



<li>The distance between the helper dots on the images are the width of the <strong>Color Image</strong>.  A wider color image means a person has to work harder to get those dots to overlap, and it may not even be possible for some people (I’m unsure of details there hehe).  I used tile sizes of 128.</li>



<li>It’s hard to make out fine detail from the depth maps.  It seems like larger, coarse features are the way to go, instead of fine details.</li>
</ul>



<h2>More Pictures</h2>



<p>Here is the grave, with a different color texture. I find this one harder to see.</p>

<p>And another, using RGB white noise (random numbers). I can see this one pretty easily, but it isn’t as fun themed as the pumpkin image 🙂</p>

<p>And here is greyscale white noise (random numbers) used for the color image. I can see this just fine too.</p>

<p>I also tried using blue noise as a <strong>Color Image</strong> but I can’t see the 3d at all, and it isn’t a mystery what the 3d image is.  You can see the repetition of the depth map object from the feedback.  I think it’s interesting that the repetition is needed to make it look right. I have no understanding of why that is, but if you do, please leave a comment!</p>

<p>Lastly, I think it would be really neat to make a game that used this technique to render 3d. It could be something simple like a brick breaking game, or as complex as a first person shooter.  A challenge with this is that you need to process the image from left to right, due to the feedback loop needed.  That won’t be the fastest operation on the GPU, forcing it to serialize pixel processing unless anyone has any clever ideas to help that. Still, it would be pretty neat as a tech demo!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper was presented at The First Annual International Conference
on Cyberspace in 1990. It was published in Cyberspace: First Steps, Michael
Benedikt (ed.), 1990, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Lucasfilm's Habitat was created by Lucasfilm Games, a division of LucasArts
Entertainment Company, in association with Quantum Computer Services, Inc.
It was arguably one of the first attempts to create a very large scale
commercial multi-user virtual environment. A far cry from many laboratory
research efforts based on sophisticated interface hardware and tens of
thousands of dollars per user of dedicated compute power, Habitat is built
on top of an ordinary commercial online service and uses an inexpensive
-- some would say "toy" -- home computer to support user interaction.
In spite of these somewhat plebeian underpinnings, Habitat is ambitious
in its scope. The system we developed can support a population of thousands
of users in a single shared cyberspace. Habitat presents its users with
a real-time animated view into an online simulated world in which users
can communicate, play games, go on adventures, fall in love, get married,
get divorced, start businesses, found religions, wage wars, protest against
them, and experiment with self-government. </p>

<p>The Habitat project proved to be a rich source of insights into the
nitty-gritty reality of actually implementing a serious, commercially viable
cyberspace environment. Our experiences developing the Habitat system,
and managing the virtual world that resulted, offer a number of interesting
and important lessons for prospective cyberspace architects. The purpose
of this paper is to discuss some of these lessons. We hope that the next
generation of builders of virtual worlds can benefit from our experiences
and (especially) from our mistakes. </p>

<p>Due to space limitations, we won't be able to go into as much technical
detail as we might like; this will have to be left to a future publication.
Similarly, we will only be able to touch briefly upon some of the history
of the project as a business venture, which is a fascinating subject of
its own. Although we will conclude with a brief discussion of some of the
future directions for this technology, a more detailed exposition on this
topic will also have to wait for a future article. </p>

<p>The essential lesson that we have abstracted from our experiences with
Habitat is that a cyberspace is defined more by the interactions among
the actors within it than by the technology with which it is implemented.
While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface
technologies -- DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering
engines, and so on -- both exciting and promising, the almost mystical
euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our
opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced. We can't help having a
nagging sense that it's all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing
issues. At the core of <i>our</i> vision is the idea that cyberspace is
necessarily a <i>multiple-participant environment</i>. It seems to us that
the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment
are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other
people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can
affect one another. Beyond a foundation set of communications capabilities,
the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while
sexy and interesting, is a peripheral concern. </p>

<h2>What is Habitat?</h2>

<p>Habitat is a "multi-player online virtual environment" (its
purpose is to be an entertainment medium; consequently, the users are called
"players"). Each player uses his or her home computer as a frontend,
communicating over a commercial packet-switching data network to a centralized
backend system. The frontend provides the user interface, generating a
real-time animated display of what is going on and translating input from
the player into requests to the backend. The backend maintains the world
model, enforcing the rules and keeping each player's frontend informed
about the constantly changing state of the universe. The backend enables
the players to interact not only with the world but with each other. </p>

<p>Habitat was inspired by a long tradition of "computer hacker science
fiction", notably Vernor Vinge's novel, <i>True Names</i> [1], as
well as many fond childhood memories of games of make-believe, more recent
memories of role-playing games and the like, and numerous other influences
too thoroughly blended to pinpoint. To this we add a dash of silliness,
a touch of cyberpunk [2,3], and a predilection for object-oriented programming
[4]. </p>

<p>The initial incarnation of Habitat uses a Commodore 64 for the frontend.
One of the questions we are asked most frequently is, "Why the Commodore
64?" Many people somehow get the impression that this was a technical
decision, but the real explanation has to do with business, not technology.
Habitat was initially developed by Lucasfilm as commercial product for
QuantumLink, an online service (then) exclusively for owners of the Commodore
64. At the time we started (1985), the Commodore 64 was the mainstay of
the recreational computing market. Since then it has declined dramatically
in both its commercial and technical significance. However, when we began
the project, we didn't get a choice of platforms. The nature of the deal
was such that both the Commodore 64 for the frontend and the existing QuantumLink
host system (a brace of Stratus fault-tolerant minicomputers) for the backend
were givens. </p>

<p>The largest part of the screen is devoted to the graphics display. This
is an animated view of the player's current location in the Habitat world.
The scene consists of various objects arrayed on the screen, such as the
houses and tree you see here. The players are represent by animated figures
that we call "Avatars". Avatars are usually, though not exclusively,
humanoid in appearance. In this scene you can see two of them, carrying
on a conversation. </p>

<p>Avatars can move around, pick up, put down and manipulate objects, talk
to each other, and gesture, each under the control of an individual player.
Control is through the joystick, which enables the player to point at things
and issue commands. Talking is accomplished by typing on the keyboard.
The text that a player types is displayed over his or her Avatar's head
in a cartoon-style "word balloon". </p>

<center><p>A typical Habitat scene (© 1986 LucasArts Entertainment
Company). </p></center>

<p>The Habitat world is made up of a large number of discrete locations
that we call "regions". In its prime, the prototype Habitat world
consisted of around 20,000 of them. Each region can adjoin up to four other
regions, which can be reached simply by walking your Avatar to one or another
edge of the screen. Doorways and other passages can connect to additional
regions. Each region contains a set of objects which define the things
that an Avatar can do there and the scene that the player sees on the computer
screen. </p>

<p>Some of the objects are structural, such as the ground or the sky. Many
are just scenic, such as the tree or the mailbox. Most objects, however,
have some function that they perform. For example, doors transport Avatars
from one region to another and may be opened, closed, locked and unlocked.
ATMs (Automatic Token Machines) enable access to an Avatar's bank account.
Vending machines dispense useful goods in exchange for Habitat money. Habitat
contained its own fully-fledged economy, with money, banks, and so on.
Habitat's unit of currency is the Token, owing to the fact that it is a
token economy and to acknowledge the long and honorable association between
tokens and video games. </p>

<p>Many objects are portable and may be carried around in an Avatar's hands
or pockets. These include various kinds of containers, money, weapons,
tools, and exotic magical implements. Listed here are some of the most
important types of objects and their functions. The complete list of object
types numbers in the hundreds. </p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The following, along with several programmer-years of tedious and expensive
detail that we won't cover here, is how the system works: </p>

<p>At the heart of the Habitat implementation is an object-oriented model
of the universe. </p>

<p>The frontend consists of a system kernel and a collection of objects.
The kernel handles memory management, display generation, disk I/O, telecommunications,
and other "operating system" functions. The objects implement
the semantics of the world itself. Each type of Habitat object has a definition
consisting of a set of resources, including animation cels to drive the
display, audio data, and executable code. An object's executable code implements
a series of standard behaviors, each of which is invoked by a different
player command or system event. The model is similar to that found in an
object-oriented programming system such as Smalltalk [5], with its classes,
methods and messages. These resources consume significant amounts of scarce
frontend memory, so we can't keep them all in core at the same time. Fortunately,
their definitions are invariant, so we simply swap them in from disk as
we need them, discarding less recently used resources to make room. </p>

<p>When an object is instantiated, we allocate a block of memory to contain
the object's state. The first several bytes of an object's state information
take the same form in all objects, and include such things as the object's
screen location and display attributes. This standard information is interpreted
by the system kernel as it generates the display and manages the run-time
environment. The remainder of the state information varies with the object
type and is accessed only by the object's behavior code. </p>

<p>Object behaviors are invoked by the kernel in response to player input.
Each object responds to a set of standard verbs that map directly onto
the commands available to the player. Each behavior is simply a subroutine
that executes the indicated action; to do this it may invoke the behaviors
of other objects or send request messages to the backend. Besides the standard
verb behaviors, objects may have additional behaviors which are invoked
by messages that arrive asynchronously from the backend. </p>

<p>The backend also maintains an object-oriented representation of the
world. As in the frontend, objects on the backend possess executable behaviors
and in-memory state information. In addition, since the backend maintains
a persistent global state for the entire Habitat world, the objects are
also represented by database records that may be stored on disk when not
"in use". Backend object behaviors are invoked by messages from
the frontend. Each of these backend behaviors works in roughly the same
way: a message is received from a player's frontend requesting some action;
the action is taken and some state changes to the world result; the backend
behavior sends a response message back to the frontend informing it of
the results of its request and notification messages to the frontends of
any other players who are in the same region, informing <i>them</i> of
what has taken place. </p>

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<p>In order to say as much as we can in the limited space available, we
will describe what think we learned via a series of principles or assertions
surrounded by supporting reasoning and illustrative anecdotes. A more formal
and thorough exposition will have to come later in some other forum where
we might have the space to present a more comprehensive and detailed model.
</p>

<p>We mentioned our primary principle above: </p>

<center><p><b>A multi-user environment is central to the idea of cyberspace.</b>
</p></center>

<p>It is our deep conviction that a definitive characteristic of a cyberspace
system is that it represents a multi-user environment. This stems from
the fact that what (in our opinion) people seek in such a system is richness,
complexity and depth. Nobody knows how to produce an automaton that even
approaches the complexity of a real human being, let alone a society. Our
approach, then, is not even to attempt this, but instead to use the computational
medium to augment the communications channels between real people. </p>

<p>If what we are constructing is a multi-user environment, it naturally
follows that some sort of communications capability must be fundamental
to our system. However, we must take into account an observation that is
the second of our principles: </p>

<center><p><b>Communications bandwidth is a scarce resource.</b> </p></center>

<p>This point was rammed home to us by one of Habitat's nastier externally
imposed design constraints, namely that it provide a satisfactory experience
to the player over a 300 baud serial telephone connection (one, moreover,
routed through commercial packet-switching networks that impose an additional,
uncontrollable latency of 100 to 5000 milliseconds on each packet transmitted).
</p>

<p>Even in a more technically advanced network, however, bandwidth remains
scarce in the sense that economists use the term: available carrying capacity
is not unlimited. The law of supply and demand suggests that no matter
how much capacity is available, you always want more. When communications
technology advances to the point were we all have multi-gigabaud fiber
optic connections into our homes, computational technology will have advanced
to match. Our processors' expanding appetite for data will mean that the
search for ever more sophisticated data compression techniques will <i>still</i>
be a hot research area (though what we are compressing may at that point
be high-resolution volumetric time-series or something even more esoteric)[6].
</p>

<p>Computer scientists tend to be reductionists who like to organize systems
in terms of primitive elements that can be easily manipulated within the
context of a simple formal model. Typically, you adopt a small variety
of very simple primitives which are then used in large numbers. For a graphics-oriented
cyberspace system, the temptation is to build upon bit-mapped images or
polygons or some other <i>graphic</i> primitive. These sorts of representations,
however, are invitations to disaster. They arise from an inappropriate
fixation on display technology, rather than on the underlying purpose of
the system. </p>

<p>However, the most significant part of what <i>we</i> wish to be communicating
are human behaviors. These, fortunately, can be represented quite compactly,
provided we adopt a relatively abstract, high-level description that deals
with behavioral concepts directly. This leads to our third principle: </p>

<center><p><b>An object-oriented data representation is essential.</b>
</p></center>

<p>Taken at its face value, this assertion is unlikely to be controversial,
as object-oriented programming is currently the methodology of choice among
the software engineering cognoscenti. However, what we mean here is not
only that you should adopt an object-oriented approach, but that the basic
objects from which you build the system should correspond more-or-less
to the objects in the user's conceptual model of the virtual world, that
is, people, places, and artifacts. You could, of course, use object-oriented
programming techniques to build a system based on, say, polygons, but that
would not help to cope with the fundamental problem. </p>

<p>The goal is to enable the communications between machines take place
primarily at the behavioral level (what people and things are doing) rather
than at the presentation level (how the scene is changing). The description
of a place in the virtual would should be in terms of what is there rather
than what it looks like. Interactions between objects should be described
by functional models rather than by physical ones. The computation necessary
to translate between these higher-level representations and the lower-level
representations required for direct user interaction is an essentially
local function. At the local processor, display-rendering techniques may
be arbitrarily elaborate and physical models arbitrarily sophisticated.
The data channel capacities required for such computations, however, need
not and should not be squeezed into the limited bandwidth available between
the local processor and remote ones. Attempting to do so just leads to
disasters such as NAPLPS [7,8]. </p>

<p>Once we begin working at the conceptual rather than the presentation
level, we are struck by the following observation: </p>

<center><p><b>The implementation platform is relatively unimportant.</b>
</p></center>

<p>The presentation level and the conceptual level cannot (and should not)
be <i>totally</i> isolated from each other. However, defining a virtual
environment in terms of the configuration and behavior of objects, rather
than their presentation, enables us to span a vast range of computational
and display capabilities among the participants in a system. This range
extends both upward and downward. As an extreme example, a typical scenic
object, such as a tree, can be represented by a handful of parameter values.
At the lowest conceivable end of things might be an ancient Altair 8800
with a 300 baud ASCII dumb terminal, where the interface is reduced to
fragments of text and the user sees the humble string so familiar to the
players of text adventure games, "There is a tree here." At the
high end, you might have a powerful processor that generates the image
of the tree by growing a fractal model and rendering it three dimensions
at high resolution, the finest details ray-traced in real time, complete
with branches waving in the breeze and the sound of wind in the leaves
coming through your headphones in high-fidelity digital stereo. And these
two users might be looking at the same tree in same the place in the same
world and talking to each other as they do so. Both of these scenarios
are implausible at the moment, the first because nobody would suffer with
such a crude interface when better ones are so readily available, the second
because the computational hardware does not yet exist. The point, however,
is that this approach covers the ground between systems already obsolete
and ones that are as yet gleams in their designers' eyes. Two consequences
of this are significant. The first is that we can build effective cyberspace
systems today. Habitat exists as ample proof of this principle. The second
is that it is conceivable that with a modicum of cleverness and foresight
you could start building a system with today's technology that could evolve
smoothly as the tomorrow's technology develops. The availability of pathways
for growth is important in the real world, especially if cyberspace is
to become a significant communications medium (as we obviously think it
should). </p>

<p>Given that we see cyberspace as fundamentally a communications medium
rather than simply a user interface model, and given the style of object-oriented
approach that we advocate, another point becomes clear: </p>

<center><p><b>Data communications standards are vital.</b> </p></center>

<p>However, our concerns about cyberspace data communications standards
center less upon data transport protocols than upon the definition of the
data being transported. The mechanisms required for reliably getting bits
from point A to point B are not terribly interesting to us. This is not
because these mechanisms are not essential (they obviously are) nor because
they do not pose significant research and engineering challenges (they
clearly do). It is because we are focused on the unique communications
needs of an object-based cyberspace. We are concerned with the protocols
for sending messages between objects, that is, for communicating behavior
rather than presentation, and for communicating object definitions from
one system to another. </p>

<p>Communicating object definitions seems to us to be an especially important
problem, and one that we really didn't have an opportunity to address in
Habitat. It <i>will</i> be necessary to address this problem if we are
to have a dynamic system. The ability to add new classes of objects over
time is crucial if the system is to be able to evolve. </p>

<p>While we are on the subject of communications standards, we would like
to make some remarks about the ISO Reference Model of Open System Interconnection
[9]. This multi-layered model has become a centerpiece of most discussions
about data communications standards these days. Unfortunately, while the
bottom 4 or 5 layers of this model provide a more or less sound framework
for considering data transport issues, we feel that the model's Presentation
and Application layers are not so helpful when considering cyberspace data
communications. </p>

<p>We have two main quarrels with the ISO model: first, it partitions the
general data communications problem in a way that is a poor match for the
needs of a cyberspace system; second, and more importantly, we think it
is an active source of confusion because it focuses the attention of system
designers on the wrong set of issues and thus leads them to spend their
time solving the wrong set of problems. We know because this happened to
us. "Presentation" and "Application" are simply the
wrong abstractions for the higher levels of a cyberspace communications
protocol. A "Presentation" protocol presumes characteristics
of the display are embedded in the protocol. The discussions above should
give some indication why we feel such a presumption is both unnecessary
and unwise. An "Application" protocol presumes a degree of foreknowledge
of the message environment that is incompatible with the sort of dynamically
evolving object system we envision. </p>

<p>A better model would be to substitute a different pair of top layers:
a Message layer, which defines the means by which objects can address one
another and standard methods of encapsulating structured data and encoding
low-level data types (e.g., numbers); and a Definition layer built on top
of the Message layer, which defines a standard representation for object
definitions so that object classes can migrate from machine to machine.
One might argue that these are simply Presentation and Application with
different labels, but we don't think the differences are so easily reconciled.
In particular, we think the ISO model has, however unintentionally, systematically
deflected workers in the field from considering many of the issues that
concern us. </p>

<h2>World Building</h2>

<p>There were two sorts of implementation challenges that Habitat posed.
The first was the problem of creating a working piece of technology --
developing the animation engine, the object-oriented virtual memory, the
message-passing pseudo operating system, and squeezing them all into the
ludicrous Commodore 64 (the backend system also posed interesting technical
problems, but its constraints were not as vicious). The second challenge
was the creation and management of the Habitat world itself. It is the
experiences from the latter exercise that we think will be most relevant
to future cyberspace designers. </p>

<p>We were initially our own worst enemies in this undertaking, victims
of a way of thinking to which we engineers are dangerously susceptible.
This way of thinking is characterized by the conceit that all things may
be planned in advance and then directly implemented according to the plan's
detailed specification. For persons schooled in the design and construction
of systems based on simple, well-defined and well-understood foundation
principles, this is a natural attitude to have. Moreover, it is entirely
appropriate when undertaking most engineering projects. It is a frame of
mind that is an essential part of a good engineer's conceptual tool kit.
Alas, in keeping with Maslow's assertion that, "to the person who
has only a hammer, all the world looks like a nail", it is a tool
that is easy to carry beyond its range of applicability. This happens when
a system exceeds the threshold of complexity above which the human mind
loses its ability to maintain a complete and coherent model. </p>

<p>One generally hears about systems crossing the complexity threshold
when they become very large. For example, the Space Shuttle and the B-2
bomber are both systems above this threshold, necessitating extraordinarily
involved, cumbersome and time-consuming procedures to keep the design under
control -- procedures that are at once vastly expensive and only partially
successful. To a degree, the complexity problem can be solved by throwing
money at it. However, such capital intensive management techniques are
a luxury not available to most projects. Furthermore, although these dubious
"solutions" to the complexity problem are out of reach of most
projects, alas the complexity threshold itself is not. Smaller systems
can suffer from the same sorts of problems. It is possible to push much
smaller and less elaborate systems over the complexity threshold simply
by introducing chaotic elements that are outside the designers' sphere
of control or understanding. The most significant such chaotic elements
are autonomous computational agents (e.g., other computers). This is why,
for example, debugging even very simple communications protocols often
proves surprisingly difficult. Furthermore, a special circle of living
Hell awaits the implementors of systems involving that most important category
of autonomous computational agents of all, groups of interacting human
beings. This leads directly to our next (and possibly most controversial)
assertion: </p>

<center><p><b>Detailed central planning is impossible; don't even try.</b>
</p></center>

<p>The constructivist prejudice that leads engineers into the kinds of
problems just mentioned has received more study from economists and sociologists
[10-15] than from researchers in the software engineering community. Game
and simulation designers are experienced in creating virtual worlds for
individuals and small groups. However, they have had no reason to learn
to deal with large populations of simultaneous users. Since each user or
group is unrelated to the others, the same world can be used over and over
again. If you are playing an adventure game, the fact that thousands of
other people elsewhere in the (real) world are playing the same game has
no effect on your experience. It is reasonable for the creator of such
a world to spend tens or even hundreds of hours crafting the environment
for each hour that a user will spend interacting with it, since that user's
hour of experience will be duplicated tens of thousands of times by tens
of thousands of other individual users. </p>

<p>Builders of online services and communications networks are experienced
in dealing with large user populations, but they do not, in general, create
elaborate environments. Furthermore, in a system designed to deliver information
or communications services, large numbers of users are simply a load problem
rather than a complexity problem. All the users get the same information
or services; the comments in the previous paragraph regarding duplication
of experience apply here as well. It is not necessary to match the size
and complexity of the information space to the size of the user population.
While it may turn out that the quantity of information available on a service
is a function of the size of the user population, this information can
generally be organized into a systematic structure that can still be maintained
by a few people. The bulk, wherein the complexity lies, is the product
of the users themselves, rather than the system designers -- the operators
of the system do not have to create all this material. (This observation
is the first clue to the solution to our problem.) </p>

<p>Our original specification for Habitat called for us to create a world
capable of supporting a population of 20,000 Avatars, with expansion plans
for up to 50,000. By any reckoning this is a large undertaking and complexity
problems would certainly be expected. However, in practice we exceeded
the complexity threshold very early in development. By the time the population
of our online community had reached around 50 we were in over our heads
(and these 50 were "insiders" who were prepared to be tolerant
of holes and rough edges). </p>

<p>Moreover, a virtual world such as Habitat needs to scale with its population.
For 20,000 Avatars we needed 20,000 "houses", organized into
towns and cities with associated traffic arteries and shopping and recreational
areas. We needed wilderness areas between the towns so that everyone would
not be jammed together into the same place. Most of all, we needed things
for 20,000 people to do. They needed interesting places to visit -- and
since they can't all be in the same place at the same time, they needed
a <i>lot</i> of interesting places to visit -- and things to do in those
places. Each of those houses, towns, roads, shops, forests, theaters, arenas,
and other places is a distinct entity that someone needs to design and
create. We, attempting to play the role of omniscient central planners,
were swamped. </p>

<p>Automated tools may be created to aid the generation of areas that naturally
possess a high degree of regularity and structure, such as apartment buildings
and road networks. We created a number of such tools, whose spiritual descendents
will no doubt be found in the standard bag of tricks of future cyberspace
architects. However, the very properties which make some parts of the world
amenable to such techniques also make those same parts of the world among
the least important. It is really not a problem if every apartment building
looks pretty much like every other. It is a big problem if every enchanted
forest is the same. Places whose value lies in their uniqueness, or at
least in their differentiation from the places around them, need to be
crafted by hand. This is an incredibly labor intensive and time consuming
process. Furthermore, even very imaginative people are limited in the range
of variation that they can produce, especially if they are working in a
virgin environment uninfluenced by the works and reactions of other designers.
</p>

<h2>Running The World</h2>

<p>The world design problem might still be tractable, however, if all players
had the same goals, interests, motivations and types of behavior. Real
people, however, are all different. For the designer of an ordinary game
or simulation, human diversity is not a major problem, since he or she
gets to establish the goals and motivations on the participants' behalf,
and to specify the activities available to them in order to channel events
in the preferred direction. Habitat, however, was deliberately open ended
and pluralistic. The idea behind our world was precisely that it did not
come with a fixed set of objectives for its inhabitants, but rather provided
a broad palette of possible activities from which the players could choose,
driven by their own internal inclinations. It was our intent to provide
a variety of possible experiences, ranging from events with established
rules and goals (a treasure hunt, for example) to activities propelled
by the players' personal motivations (starting a business, running the
newspaper) to completely free-form, purely existential activities (hanging
out with friends and conversing). Most activities, however, involved some
degree of pre-planning and setup on our part -- we were to be like the
cruise director on a ocean voyage, but we were still thinking like game
designers. </p>

<p>The first goal-directed event planned for Habitat was a rather involved
treasure hunt called the "D'nalsi Island Adventure". It took
us hours to design, weeks to build (including a 100-region island), and
days to coordinate the actors involved. It was designed much like the puzzles
in an adventure game. We thought it would occupy our players for days.
In fact, the puzzle was solved in about 8 hours by a person who had figured
out the critical clue in the first 15 minutes. Many of the players hadn't
even had a chance to get into the game. The result was that one person
had had a wonderful experience, dozens of others were left bewildered,
and a huge investment in design and setup time had been consumed in an
eyeblink. We expected that there would be a wide range of "adventuring"
skills in the Habitat audience. What wasn't so obvious until afterward
was that this meant that most people didn't have a very good time, if for
no other reason than that they never really got to participate. It would
clearly be foolish and impractical for us to do things like this on a regular
basis. </p>

<p>Again and again we found that activities based on often unconscious
assumptions about player behavior had completely unexpected outcomes (when
they were not simply outright failures). It was clear that we were not
in control. The more people we involved in something, the less in control
we were. We could influence things, we could set up interesting situations,
we could provide opportunities for things to happen, but we could not dictate
the outcome. Social engineering is, at best, an inexact science (or, as
some wag once said, "in the most carefully constructed experiment
under the most carefully controlled conditions, the organism will do whatever
it damn well pleases"). </p>

<p>Propelled by these experiences, we shifted into a style of operations
in which we let the players themselves drive the direction of the design.
This proved far more effective. Instead of trying to push the community
in the direction we thought it should go, an exercise rather like herding
mice, we tried to observe what people were doing and aid them in it. We
became facilitators as much as we were designers and implementors. This
often meant adding new features and new regions to the system at a frantic
pace, but almost all of what we added was used and appreciated, since it
was well matched to people's needs and desires. We, as the experts on how
the system worked, could often suggest new activities for people to try
or ways of doing things that people might not have thought of. In this
way we were able to have considerable influence on the system's development
in spite of the fact that we didn't really hold the steering wheel -- more
influence, in fact, than we had had when we were operating under the illusion
that we controlled everything. </p>

<p>Indeed, the challenges posed by large systems are prompting some researchers
to question the centralized, planning dominated attitude that we have criticized
here, and to propose alternative approaches based on evolutionary and market
principles [16-18]. These principles appear applicable to complex systems
of all types, not merely those involving interacting human beings. </p>

<h2>The Great Debate</h2>

<p>Among the objects we made available to Avatars in Habitat were guns
and various other sorts of weapons. We included these because we felt that
players should be able to materially effect each other in ways that went
beyond simply talking, ways that required real moral choices to be made
by the participants. We recognized the age old story-teller's dictum that
conflict is the essence of drama. Death in Habitat was, of course, not
like death in the real world! When an Avatar is killed, he or she is teleported
back home, head in hands (literally), pockets empty, and any object in
hand at the time dropped on the ground at the scene of the crime. Any possessions
carried at the time are lost. It was more like a setback in a game of "Chutes
and Ladders" than real mortality. Nevertheless, the death metaphor
had a profound effect on people's perceptions. This potential for murder,
assault and other mayhem in Habitat was, to put it mildly, controversial.
The controversy was further fueled by the potential for lesser crimes.
For instance, one Avatar could steal something from another Avatar simply
by snatching the object out its owner's hands and running off with it.
</p>

<p>We had imposed very few rules on the world at the start. There was much
debate among the players as to the form that Habitat society should take.
At the core of much of the debate was an unresolved philosophical question:
is an Avatar an extension of a human being (thus entitled to be treated
as you would treat a real person) or a Pac-Man-like critter destined to
die a thousand deaths or something else entirely? Is Habitat murder a crime?
Should all weapons be banned? Or is it all "just a game"? To
make a point, one of the players took to randomly shooting people as they
roamed around. The debate was sufficiently vigorous that we took a systematic
poll of the players. The result was ambiguous: 50% said that Habitat murder
was a crime and shouldn't be a part of the world, while the other 50% said
it was an important part of the fun. </p>

<p>We compromised by changing the system to allow thievery and gunplay
only outside the city limits. The wilderness would be wild and dangerous
while civilization would be orderly and safe. This did not resolve the
debate, however. One of the outstanding proponents of the anti-violence
point of view was motivated to open the first Habitat church, the Order
of the Holy Walnut (in real life he was a Greek Orthodox priest). His canons
forbid his disciples to carry weapons, steal, or participate in violence
of any kind. His church became quite popular and he became a very highly
respected member of the Habitat community. </p>

<p>Furthermore, while we had made direct theft impossible, one could still
engage in indirect theft by stealing things set on the ground momentarily
or otherwise left unattended. And the violence still possible in the outlands
continued to bother some players. Many people thought that such crimes
ought to be prevented or at least punished somehow, but they had no idea
how to do so. They were used to a world in which law and justice were always
things provided by somebody else. Somebody eventually made the suggestion
that there ought to be a Sheriff. We quickly figured out how to create
a voting mechanism and rounded up some volunteers to hold an election.
A public debate in the town meeting hall was heavily attended, with the
three Avatars who had chosen to run making statements and fielding questions.
The election was held, and the town of Populopolis acquired a Sheriff.
</p>

<p>For weeks the Sheriff was nothing but a figurehead, though he was a
respected figure and commanded a certain amount of moral authority. We
were stumped about what powers to give him. Should he have the right to
shoot anyone anywhere? Give him a more powerful gun? A magic wand to zap
people off to jail? What about courts? Laws? Lawyers? Again we surveyed
the players, eventually settling on a set of questions that could be answered
via a referendum. Unfortunately, we were unable to act on the results before
the pilot operations ended and the system was shut down. It was clear,
however, that there are two basic camps: anarchy and government. This is
an issue that will need to be addressed by future cyberspace architects.
However, our view is that a virtual world need not be set up with a "default"
government, but can instead evolve one as needed. </p>

<h2>A Warning</h2>

<p>Given the above exhortation that control should be released to the users,
we need to inject a note of caution and present our next assertion: </p>

<center><p><b>You can't trust <blink>anyone.</blink></b> </p></center>

<p>This may seem like a contradiction of much of the preceding, but it
really is not. Designers and operators of a cyberspace system must inhabit
two levels of virtual world at once. The first we call the "infrastructure
level", which is the implementation, where the laws that govern "reality"
have their genesis. The second we call the "percipient level",
which is what the users see and experience. It is important that there
not be "leakage" between these two levels. The first level defines
the physics of the world. If its integrity is breached, the consequences
can range from aesthetic unpleasantness (the audience catches a glimpse
of the scaffolding behind the false front) to psychological disruption
(somebody does something "impossible", thereby violating users'
expectations and damaging their fantasy) to catastrophic failure (somebody
crashes the system). When we exhort you to give control to the users, we
mean control at the percipient level. When we say that you can't trust
anyone, we mean that you can't trust them with access to the infrastructure
level. Some stories from Habitat will illustrate this. </p>

<p>When designing piece of software, you generally assume that it is the
sole intermediary between the user and the underlying data being manipulated
(possibly multiple applications will work with the same data, but the principle
remains the same). In general, the user need not be aware of how data are
encoded and structured inside the application. Indeed, the very purpose
of a good application is to shield the user from the ugly technical details.
It is conceivable that a technically astute person who is willing to invest
the time and effort could decipher the internal structure of things, but
this would be an unusual thing to do as there is rarely much advantage
to be gained. The purpose of the application itself is, after all, to make
access to and manipulation of the data easier than digging around at the
level of bits and bytes. There are exceptions to this, however. For example,
most game programs deliberately impose obstacles on their players in order
for play to be challenging. By tinkering around with the insides of such
a program -- dumping the data files and studying them, disassembling the
program itself and possibly modifying it -- it may be possible to "cheat".
However, this sort of cheating has the flavor of cheating at solitaire:
the consequences adhere to the cheater alone. There is a difference, in
that disassembling a game program is a puzzle-solving exercise in its own
right, whereas cheating at solitaire is pointless, but the satisfactions
to be gained from it, if any, are entirely personal. </p>

<p>If, however, a computer game involves multiple players, delving into
the program's internals can enable one to truly cheat, in the sense that
one gains an unfair advantage over the other players of which they may
be unaware. Habitat is such a multi-player game. When we were designing
the software, our "prime directive" was, "The backend shall
not assume the validity of anything a player computer tells it." This
is because we needed to protect ourselves against the possibility that
a clever user had hacked around with his copy of the frontend program to
add "custom features". For example, we could not implement any
of the sort of "skill and action" elements found in traditional
video games wherein dexterity with the joystick determines the outcome
of, say, armed combat, because you couldn't guard against someone modifying
their copy of the program to tell the backend that they had "hit",
whether they actually had or not. Indeed, our partners at QuantumLink warned
us of this very eventuality before we even started -- they already had
users who did this sort of thing with their regular system. Would anyone
actually go to the trouble of disassembling and studying 100K or so of
incredibly tight and bizarrely threaded 6502 machine code just to tinker?
As it turns out, the answer is yes. People have. We were not 100% rigorous
in following our own rule. It turned out that there were a few features
whose implementation was greatly eased by breaking the rule in situations
where, in our judgment, the consequences would not be material if people
"cheated" by hacking their own systems. Darned if people didn't
hack their systems to cheat in exactly these ways. </p>

<p>Care must be taken in the design of the world as well. One incident
that occurred during our pilot test involved a small group of players exploiting
a bug in our world database which they interpreted as a feature. First,
some background. Avatars are hatched with 2000 Tokens in their bank account,
and each day that they login the receive another 100T. Avatars may acquire
additional funds by engaging in business, winning contests, finding buried
treasure, and so on. They can spend their Tokens on, among other things,
various items that are for sale in vending machines called Vendroids. There
are also Pawn Machines, which will buy objects back (at a discount, of
course). </p>

<p>In order to make this automated economy a little more interesting, each
Vendroid had its own prices for the items in it. This was so that we could
have local price variation (i.e., a widget would cost a little less if
you bought it at Jack's Place instead of The Emporium). It turned out that
in two Vendroids across town from each other were two items for sale whose
prices we had inadvertently set lower than what a Pawn Machine would buy
them back for: Dolls (for sale at 75T, hock for 100T) and Crystal Balls
(for sale at 18,000T, hock at 30,000T!). Naturally, a couple of people
discovered this. One night they took all their money, walked to the Doll
Vendroid, bought as many Dolls as they could, then took them across town
and pawned them. By shuttling back and forth between the Doll Vendroid
and the Pawn Shop for <i>hours</i>, they amassed sufficient funds to buy
a Crystal Ball , whereupon they continued the process with Crystal Balls
and a couple orders of magnitude higher cash flow. The final result was
at least three Avatars with hundreds of thousands of Tokens each. We only
discovered this the next morning when our daily database status report
said that the money supply had quintupled overnight. </p>

<p>We assumed that the precipitous increase in "T1" was due to
some sort of bug in the software. We were puzzled that no bug report had
been submitted. By poking around a bit we discovered that a few people
had suddenly acquired enormous bank balances. We sent Habitat mail to the
two richest, inquiring as to where they had gotten all that money overnight.
Their reply was, "We got it fair and square! And we're not going to
tell you how!" After much abject pleading on our part they eventually
did tell us, and we fixed the erroneous pricing. Fortunately, the whole
scam turned out well, as the nouveau riche Avatars used their bulging bankrolls
to underwrite a series of treasure hunt games which they conducted on their
own initiative, much to the enjoyment of many other players on the system.
</p>

<h2>Keeping "Reality" Consistent</h2>

<p>The urge to breach the boundary between the infrastructure level and
the percipient level is not confined to the players. The system operators
are also subject to this temptation, though their motivation is expediency
in accomplishing their legitimate purposes rather than the gaining of illegitimate
advantage. However, to the degree to which it is possible, we vigorously
endorse the following principle: </p>

<center><p><b>Work within the system.</b> </p></center>

<p>Wherever possible, things that can be done within the framework of the
percipient level should be. The result will be smoother operation and greater
harmony among the user community. This admonition applies to both the technical
and the sociological aspects of the system. </p>

<p>For example, with the players in control, the Habitat world would have
grown much larger and more diverse than it did had we ourselves not been
a technical bottleneck. All new region generation and feature implementation
had to go through us, since there was no means for players to create new
parts of the world on their own. Region creation was an esoteric technical
specialty, requiring a plethora of obscure tools and a good working knowledge
of the treacherous minefield of limitations imposed by the Commodore 64.
It also required a lot of behind-the-scenes activity that would probably
spoil the illusion for many. One of the goals of a next generation Habitat-like
system ought to be to permit far greater creative involvement by the participants
without requiring them to ascend to full-fledged guru-hood to do so. </p>

<p>A further example of working within the system, this time in a social
sense, is illustrated by the following experience. One of the more popular
events in Habitat took place late in the test, the brainchild of one of
the more active players who had recently become a QuantumLink employee.
It was called the "Dungeon of Death". </p>

<p>For weeks, ads appeared in Habitat's newspaper, The Rant, announcing
that that Duo of Dread, DEATH and THE SHADOW, were challenging all comers
to enter their lair. Soon, on the outskirts of town, the entrance to a
dungeon appeared. Out front was a sign reading, "Danger! Enter at
your own risk!" Two system operators were logged in as DEATH and THE
SHADOW, armed with specially concocted guns that could kill in one shot,
rather than the usual 12. These two characters roamed the dungeon blasting
away at anyone they encountered. They were also equipped with special magic
wands that cured any damage done to them by other Avatars, so that they
wouldn't themselves be killed. To make things worse, the place was littered
with dead ends, pathological connections between regions, and various other
nasty and usually fatal features. It was clear that any explorer had better
be prepared to "die" several times before mastering the dungeon.
The rewards were pretty good: 1000 Tokens minimum and access to a special
Vendroid that sold magic teleportation wands. Furthermore, given clear
notice, players took the precaution of emptying their pockets before entering,
so that the actual cost of getting "killed" was minimal. </p>

<p>One evening, one of us was given the chance to play the role of DEATH.
When we logged in, we found him in one of the dead ends with four other
Avatars who were trapped there. We started shooting, as did they. However,
the last operator to run DEATH had not bothered to use his special wand
to heal any accumulated damage, so the character of DEATH was suddenly
and unexpectedly "killed" in the encounter. As we mentioned earlier,
when an Avatar is killed, any object in his hands is dropped on the ground.
In this case, said object was the special kill-in-one-shot gun, which was
immediately picked up by one of the regular players who then made off with
it. This gun was not something that regular players were supposed to have.
What should we do? </p>

<p>It turned out that this was not the first time this had happened. During
the previous night's mayhem the special gun was similarly absconded with.
In this case, the person playing DEATH was one of the regular system operators,
who, used to operating the regular Q-Link service, simply ordered the player
to give the gun back. The player considered that he had obtained the weapon
as part of the normal course of the game and balked at this, whereupon
the operator threatened to cancel the player's account and kick him off
the system if he did not comply. The player gave the gun back, but was
quite upset about the whole affair, as were many of his friends and associates
on the system. Their world model had been painfully violated. </p>

<p>When it happened to us, we played the whole incident within the role
of DEATH. We sent a message to the Avatar who had the gun, threatening
to come and kill her if she didn't give it back. She replied that all she
had to do was stay in town and DEATH couldn't touch her (which was true,
if we stayed within the system). OK, we figured, she's smart. We negotiated
a deal whereby DEATH would ransom the gun for 10,000 Tokens. An elaborate
arrangement was made to meet in the center of town to make the exchange,
with a neutral third Avatar acting as an intermediary to ensure that neither
party cheated. Of course, word got around and by the time of the exchange
there were numerous spectators. We played the role of DEATH to the hilt,
with lots of hokey melodramatic shtick. The event was a sensation. It was
written up in the newspaper the next morning and was the talk of the town
for days. The Avatar involved was left with a wonderful story about having
cheated DEATH, we got the gun back, and everybody went away happy. </p>

<p>These two very different responses to an ordinary operational problem
illustrate our point. Operating within the participants' world model produced
a very satisfactory result. On the other hand, what seemed like the expedient
course, which involved violating this model, provoked upset and dismay.
Working within the system was clearly the preferred course in this case.
</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>As of this writing, the North American incarnation of Lucasfilm's Habitat,
QuantumLink's "Club Caribe", has been operating for almost two
years. It uses our original Commodore 64 frontend and a somewhat stripped-down
version of our original Stratus backend software. Club Caribe now sustains
a population of some 15,000 participants. </p>

<p>A technically more advanced version, called Fujitsu Habitat, has recently
started pilot operations in Japan, available on NIFtyServe. The initial
frontend for this version is the new Fujitsu FM Towns personal computer,
though ports to several other popular Japanese machines are anticipated.
This version of the system benefits from the additional computational power
and graphics capabilities of a newer platform, as well as the Towns' built-in
CD-ROM for object imagery and sounds. However, the virtuality of the system
is essentially unchanged and Fujitsu has not made significant alterations
to the user interface or to any of the underlying concepts. </p>

<h2>Future Directions</h2>

<p>There are several directions in which this work can be extended. Most
obvious is to implement the system on more advanced hardware, enabling
a more sophisticated display. A number of extensions to the user interface
also suggest themselves. However, the line of development most interesting
to us is to expand on the idea of making the development and expansion
of the world itself part of the users' sphere of control. There are two
major research areas in this. Unfortunately, we can only touch on them
briefly here. </p>

<p>The first area to investigate involves the elimination of the centralized
backend. The backend is a communications and processing bottleneck that
will not withstand growth above too large a size. While we can support
tens of thousands of users with this model, it is not really feasible to
support millions. Making the system fully distributed, however, requires
solving a number of difficult problems. The most significant of these is
the prevention of cheating. Obviously, the owner of the network node that
implements some part of the world has an incentive to tilt things in his
favor there. We think that this problem can be addressed by secure operating
system technologies based on public-key cryptographic techniques [19, 20].
</p>

<p>The second fertile area of investigation involves user configuration
of the world itself. This requires finding ways to represent the design
and creation of regions and objects as part of the underlying fantasy.
Doing this will require changes to our conception of the world. In particular,
we don't think it will be possible to conceal all of the underpinnings
to those who work with them. However, all we really need to do is find
abstractions for those underpinnings that fit into the fantasy itself.
Though challenging, this is, in our opinion, eminently feasible. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>We feel that the defining characteristic of cyberspace is the shared
virtual environment, not the display technology used to transport users
into that environment. Such a cyberspace is feasible today, if you can
live without head-mounted displays and other expensive graphics hardware.
Habitat serves as an existence proof of this contention. </p>

<p>It seems clear to us that an object-oriented world model is a key ingredient
in any cyberspace implementation. We feel we have gained some insight into
the data representation and communications needs of such a system. While
we think that it may be premature to start establishing detailed technical
standards for these things, it is time to begin the discussions that will
lead to such standards in the future. </p>

<p>Finally, we have come to believe that the most significant challenge
for cyberspace developers is to come to grips with the problems of world
creation and management. While we have only made the first inroads onto
these problems, a few things have become clear. The most important of these
is that managing a cyberspace world is not like managing the world inside
a single-user application or even a conventional online service. Instead,
it is more like governing an actual nation. Cyberspace architects will
benefit from study of the principles of sociology and economics as much
as from the principles of computer science. We advocate an agoric, evolutionary
approach to world building rather than a centralized, socialistic one.
</p>

<p>We would like to conclude with a final admonition, one that we hope
will not be seen as overly contentious: </p>

<center><p><b>Get real.</b> </p></center>

<p>In a discussion of cyberspace on Usenet, one worker in the field dismissed
Club Caribe (Habitat's current incarnation) as uninteresting, with a comment
to the effect that most of the activity consisted of inane and trivial
conversation. Indeed, the observation was largely correct. However, we
hope some of the anecdotes recounted above will give some indication that
more is going on than those inane and trivial conversations might indicate.
Further, to dismiss the system on this basis is to dismiss the users themselves.
They are paying money for this service. <i>They</i> don't view what they
do as inane and trivial, or they wouldn't do it. To insist this presumes
that one knows better than they what they should be doing. Such presumption
is another manifestation of the omniscient central planner who dictates
all that happens, a role that this entire article is trying to deflect
you from seeking. In a real system that is going to be used by real people,
it is a mistake to assume that the users will all undertake the sorts of
noble and sublime activities which you created the system to enable. Most
of them will not. Cyberspace may indeed change humanity, but only if it
begins with humanity as it really is. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, October 21, 2023, is the third <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/global-encryption-day-2022/">Global Encryption Day</a>, organized by the <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/">Global Encryption Coalition</a>, of which the Tor Project is a member. Global Encryption Day is an opportunity for businesses, civil society organizations, technologists, and millions of Internet users worldwide to highlight why encryption matters and to advocate for its advancement and protection.</p>
<p>Needless to say, fighting for the protection of encryption is a topic for us 365 days a year. But we want to use this day to reflect on some of the efforts we have initiated or supported in 2023 to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/how-we-plant-and-grow-new-onions/">ensure access to encryption</a> and push back against <a href="https://www.badinternetbills.com/">government efforts that seek to undermine it</a> - from <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2023/06/a-call-to-the-brazilian-supreme-court-to-recognize-the-importance-of-encryption-in-safeguarding-fundamental-rights/#:~:text=By%20taking%20these%20measures%2C%20the,for%20secure%20and%20confidential%20communication.">signing letters</a> and supporting ally organizations on a number of advocacy and <a href="https://www.univision.com/local/san-francisco-kdtv/protesta-slack-cifrado-extremo-mensajes-abortos-fotos">awareness campaigns</a> to expanding our <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/empowering-human-rights-defenders/">outreach and training efforts</a> or <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-tutorials/">localizing educational content</a>.</p>
<h2>Encryption's Critical Role in Safeguarding Human Rights</h2>
<p>Most recently, we co-organized and co-hosted a workshop at the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) -&nbsp;an annual meeting established by the United Nations in 2005 as a forum for multi-stakeholder dialogue concerning public policy issues relating to the internet. The panel entitled <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2023-ws-356-encryptions-critical-role-in-safeguarding-human-rights">Encryption's Critical Role in Safeguarding Human Rights</a> brought together professionals from the technology, non-profit, policy, human rights and advocacy spaces to discuss balancing the demands of national security with the protection of individual privacy, adherence to international human rights laws and seeking a global approach.</p>
<p>The debate underscored the importance of international collaboration and respecting international standards and human rights principles to navigate the complexities of encryption and content moderation, pushing back against the weakening of encryption and the proliferation of surveillance technologies that have been used against human rights activists, journalists, and members of the civil society. The panelists called for education, including training and capacity-building of policymakers, and the normalization of encryption in creating a safer online environment for all users. Tech companies must play a role in protecting user privacy while addressing legitimate concerns related to content moderation, including the ability for safe and responsive reporting channels for users that do not compromise encryption and acknowledging the limitations of AI. By offering end-to-end encryption they can give power back to the users and simultaneously simplify their regulatory burden.</p>
<p>Two key takeaways and calls for action from our discussion have already been reflected in the first draft of IGF messaging outcomes <a href="https://intgovforum.org/en/content/kyoto-messages">"intended to provide a high-level overview for decision-makers of the most current thinking on key Internet governance and digital policy issues."</a></p>
<h3>HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>"Policymakers need to improve their understanding of Internet technologies, the infrastructure underpinning them, their modalities and business models if they are to make informed policy decisions and design appropriate regulatory frameworks. Greater transparency on the part of businesses and other stakeholders can help to achieve this."</p>
</li>
<li><p>"Technology is not confined by geographic boundaries. Laws and regulations governing the use of technology in areas such as encryption should be consistent with international standards and norms concerned with privacy, freedom of expression, due process and access to information."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested to find out what other measures and recommendations to policymakers were proposed, check out the full session recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4FgMt3KXec">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Tor Project's mission is to advance Human Rights. For us that means not only by building and deploying technology, but also by advocating for the protection and unrestricted availability of privacy-preserving technologies like encryption. We are connecting with people all around the world and supporting them to use the internet safely and freely to achieve this mission.</p>

<h2 id="vss-beginners-guide-to-building-a-hardware-hacking-lab">VSS: Beginners Guide to Building a Hardware Hacking Lab</h2>

<h2 id="introduction"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>One of the most common questions that I get during a <a href="https://voidstarsec.com/training">training</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What do we need to build out an initial hardware hacking lab?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the answer to this question can be heavily tailored based on the goals of the team and their targets, but I wanted to attempt to document what would make for a good starter lab. The following document aims to outline the basic requirements for well rounded embedded systems laboratory.</p>

<p>In this list, I will focus on devices that I and a few others regularly use for hardware pen testing and research. I will list a range of devices covering various budgets.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the following recommendations are my opinion, and <strong>none</strong> of the links below are affiliate links or anything of the sort. My goal is to help people build out their first lab, not to make money. This guide will also be maintained at the GitHub repository located <a href="https://github.com/voidstarsec/hw-hacking-lab">here</a> - please submit pull requests with your suggestions and favorite tools!</p>

<h2 id="contributors">Contributors</h2>

<p>Throughout the development of this guide, I was lucky enough to have some really sharp people offer to help me proofread and provide recommendations for some of the gear listed in this write up, I’ve included their names/handles below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/ElectronicsbyJH">Jeremy Hong</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="workbench"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/workbench">Workbench</a></h2>

<p>First and foremost, you will require a place to perform your work. Depending on your needs this might be a small section on your desk, or you may want an entirely separate workbench. When it comes to choosing a workbench, you’ll quickly find that you can spend a <em>lot</em> of money on a high end standing desk, especially if you’re looking for a larger one. One place you might consider looking is Home Depot / Lowes, I am a big fan of their Husky standing workbench and am currently using two of them in my office.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something more traditional, I have also built a handful of workbench setups using IKEA tabletops and legs, this is a very popular option for workstations.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The IKEA drawer units have mounting holes on top of them for attaching to IKEA tabletops which makes assembly extremely simple, and you get the added benefit of extra storage.</p>

<h2 id="esd-protections">ESD Protections</h2>

<p>The last thing that you want to happen is for you to accidentally destroy a device with static electricity, In order to avoid this, it is always a good idea to get an ESD wrist strap or an ESD protective mat.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not all silicone mats that you will find on Amazon are actually anti-static, please make sure that you read the description of the mat that you are going to purchase if ESD protection is a high priority for your workspace (which it should be!)</p>

<h2 id="soldering"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/soldering">Soldering</a></h2>

<p>Whether you are tearing down a new router or looking for a new target to perform fault injection, you will need to solder at some point during your hardware hacking journey. Soldering is the process of joining metal surfaces with “solder”; creating a conductive connection between the two soldered points. Soldering is useful when populating unused debug pin headers or connecting wires to points on your target circuit board that you wish to interact with.</p>

<h2 id="soldering-irons">Soldering Irons</h2>

<p>When looking for a new iron, it is essential to keep your goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you mainly focusing on smaller surface mount device (SMD) rework projects?</li>
  <li>Will you be working with larger/older components that may need a lot of heat to remove?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, you want an iron with adjustable temperature and removable tips. These can be purchased relatively cheaply from Amazon and other online vendors. I recommend one with an emergency timeout in case you forget to turn off your iron after some late-night soldering.</p>

<h3 id="low-cost">Low Cost</h3>

<p>Below is a very solid starter kit from Amazon, which makes for a good beginner iron. Before buying a more expensive iron, use this iron to learn proper <a href="https://forum.digikey.com/t/how-to-clean-tin-and-maintain-soldering-iron-tip">care and maintenance</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/KSGER-Soldering-Electronic-Controller-Equipments/dp/B0974F1VQ5">KSGER T12 Soldering Station</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Two other solid options for a beginner iron (at a slightly higher price point) are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888D-23BY-Digital-Soldering-Station/dp/B00ANZRT4M">Hakko FX888D</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weller-Digital-Soldering-Station-WE1010NA/dp/B077JDGY1J">Weller WE1010NA</a>. The WE1010NA is the successor to the venerable Weller WES51, which has since been discontinued.</p>

<p>For a portable option, the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/ts100-soldering-iron">TS-100</a> or <a href="https://rotorriot.com/products/ts101-portable-soldering-iron-programmable-smart-iron">TS-101</a> is an excellent choice. These are great for travel, have interchangeable tips and are relatively low cost.</p>

<h3 id="high-cost">High Cost</h3>

<p>For high-end soldering or jobs that require you to solder to smaller components, such as 0402 components, a  JBC CDS station with intelligent heat management and sleep/hibernation modes can’t be beaten. This is the station that I have used for quite a while now, and it has been highly reliable and easy to maintain. With this station, you can also get tweezer tips for SMD components, making these jobs much more manageable. It also can be connected to other JBC accessories, such as a fume extractor and other JBC handles.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.jbctools.com/c210-cartridge-range-product-18.html">Additional Tips / Cartridges</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have the funds to spare, the JBC DDPE 2-Tool station is great because it lets you have multiple tools active simultaneously. This station comes with micro tweezers and a T210 precision handle, which is compatible with a wide variety of cartridges.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.jbctools.com/ddpe-2-tool-precision-rework-station-product-1630.html">JBC DDPE 2-Tool Station</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hot-air-stations--hot-plates">Hot Air Stations / Hot Plates</h2>

<p>Hot air stations and hot plates can both be used when doing SMD rework. Hot plates work as you might expect, they require surface to surface contact in order to heat the target device, allowing for either solder paste or a traditional iron to be used to bond the solder to the contact pads. These of course have some disadvantages, if you are working with a system that has plastic connectors, housings or is a two sided PCB with components on each side you will not be able to effectively use a hotplate without risking damaging the target. Hot plates can be used in conjunction with a hot air gun in order to “preheat” your target, making component removal easier.</p>

<h3 id="low-cost-1">Low Cost</h3>

<p>Introductory hot plates are relatively low cost, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soiiw-Microcomputer-Soldering-Preheating-200X200mm/dp/B082H12PPT">Soiiw Microcomputer Soldering Preheating station</a> is a great place to start as it has built-in temperature control and display (helpful for letting others in the lab know that the plate is on!).</p>

<p>If you are going for a lower-cost hot air rework station, there are plenty on Amazon. I have used the YIHUA 959D and have had no issues with it. Others have recommended the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quick-957DW-Hot-Station-Watt/dp/B074SBH4G5">QUICK 957D Rework Station</a>, which also has excellent reviews!</p>

<h3 id="high-cost-1">High Cost</h3>

<p>You will need a hot air station for BGA rework or other package removal. Like a standard soldering station, these can vary in price/quality. A higher-end hot air rework station will allow for precise temperature and airflow control; they will also have a wider variety of hose attachments, allowing for the removal/replacement of smaller components. When working with standard embedded systems, the JBC TESE is an excellent rework station that has multiple suction tips and hose sizes included:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.jbctools.com/tese-precision-hot-air-station-product-1255.html">JBC TESE</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, if you are looking to do a <em>lot</em> of SMD rework and reflow on PCBs, you may want to consider the <a href="https://www.jbctools.com/srs-smd-rework-system-product-1454.html">SRS System SMD Rework</a> station.</p>

<p>This kit includes an arm, allowing for hands-free operation, as well as a preheater. A preheater is a device used to (as you might have guessed) pre-heat the PCB from below, allowing things to be soldered more easily.</p>

<p>The full table of all of the recommended kits can be seen below:</p>

<h2 id="multimeters"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/multimeter">Multimeters</a></h2>

<p>Regardless of the types of components and targets that you’re working on, you will need a multimeter. This is what you will use for your initial survey of your device for things such as measuring voltage, resistance, current and checking for continuity. When choosing a multimeter, make sure that you review the available voltage and current ranges and that they match the ranges of your expected targets. Some multimeters will also have an “auto-range” feature, which will attempt to automatically select the appropriate range for measuring voltage/current/resistance, etc. This feature can be helpful when measuring unknown voltages; it will save you a few button presses when measuring points on a target. The two multimeters listed below are the ones that I keep in my toolbox. I have also included different probes sets, allowing smaller pads/pins to be measured.</p>

<p>When tearing down a target for the first time, you first want to locate and document all of the part numbers. Part numbers and PCB markings can sometimes be challenging to see with the naked eye, so having a cheap benchtop microscope or hand held loupe is never a bad idea. These will also come in handy when removing or modifying small components. Hand held loupes are great for quick identification of components.</p>

<h2 id="oscilloscopes"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/oscilloscope">Oscilloscopes</a></h2>

<p>While multimeters help us measure various signals on our target device, an oscilloscope can help us capture and visualize these measurements. When selecting a scope, you need to consider what the use case will be. Will you be doing differential power analysis or power trace captures? Or are you more interested in capturing other types of analog waveforms over a longer period? The main variables to look at when selecting an oscilloscope are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Channel Count</strong> - How many channels can you capture on</li>
  <li><strong>Memory Depth</strong> - This is how long you can capture for</li>
  <li><strong>Sample Rate</strong> - How fast the analog signal is sampled</li>
  <li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> -Maximum frequency of an input signal that can be passed through the analog front end (probe)</li>
</ul>

<p>Without enough bandwidth, you will capture what appears to be a distorted signal, and with too slow of a sample rate, you risk data loss.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong>: According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem#:~:text=Nyquist's%20theorem%20states%20that%20a,oscilloscope%20bandwidth%20would%20be%20typical.">Nyquist sampling theorem</a> sampling rate should be at least 2x the frequency of your target signal <strong>at a minimum</strong>!</p>

<p>An excellent introductory scope can be purchased for ~$500; all big manufacturers offer something in this range. For example, the SIGLENT SDS1104 is an excellent starting scope with a bandwidth of 100MHz and a sample rate of 1GSa/s. I’ve listed a few options below, ranging in price from lowest to highest, and included a few tables from some of the manufacturer’s websites as well:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Many modern oscilloscopes can be upgraded via software. For example, many will have built-in logic analyzers and signal decoders. These will come at an extra cost; decoders are typically $100-$400, depending on the protocol, and other software upgrades can be purchased to unlock things like faster sample rates and increased bandwidth, etc. It’s easy for a 2k-4k oscilloscope purchase to turn into a 10k purchase once all the upgrades and add-ons have been included.</p>

<h2 id="example-specifications-rigol">Example Specifications: Rigol</h2>

<p>Below are some specifications from the RIGOL MSO5000 line:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/assets/images/rigol.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>The MSO5354 is an excellent deal for this line, especially considering the 350MHz bandwidth and the 8GSa/s sampling rate. I have this in my lab and use it regularly.</p>

<p>Here is a similar specification table from the SIGLENT SDS2000 line:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/assets/images/siglent.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>The Siglent and the Rigol have great options for the prices listed above. Make sure that you pick an appropriate scope per the types of targets you anticipate analyzing.</p>

<h2 id="logic-analyzers"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/logic-analyzer">Logic Analyzers</a></h2>

<p>Let’s say you identified a fluctuating voltage sequence with your multimeter and decided to look at the signal with your oscilloscope. After viewing the signal with the oscilloscope, you saw sequences of high and low pulses that look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jpcg1.jpg" alt="Image"></p>

<p>We will need a Logic Analyzer to make more sense of this signal capture. Logic analyzers are used when analyzing digital signals; they can take sequences of high and low voltages and translate them into a stream of logical 1s and 0s. This stream of 1s and 0s can then be analyzed and decoded via software to display packet structures and more user-friendly data to the user. When choosing a logic analyzer, we need to consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Channel Count - How many channels can be analyzed at once?</li>
  <li>Sampling Rate - How quickly can we sample data?</li>
  <li>Hardware Sampling Depth / Memory Depth - How long can we sample?</li>
  <li>Threshold Voltages - What voltage ranges are compatible with this device?</li>
</ul>

<p>When analyzing standard COTS devices that utilize SPI, eMMC, etc., the Kingst and DSLogic series logic analyzers will work 90% of the time. The Saleae has a well-polished software interface, including APIs for writing decoders <em>and</em> instrumenting captures. The analog capture features of the Saleae are also beneficial when debugging lower-level issues. Despite being the most expensive analyzers listed here, they are worth purchasing if your budget allows it.</p>

<h2 id="oscilloscope-vs-logic-analyzers-"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/oscope-vs-logic-analyzer">Oscilloscope Vs. Logic Analyzers </a></h2>

<p>Another common question that often comes up as we review the tools in class is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is an oscilloscope used for, and what is a logic analyzer used for? Don’t they both measure signals?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the short answer is yes, they both measure electronic signals and visualize them for human consumption; there are a few key differences.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Oscilloscopes are useful for analyzing <strong>analog waveforms</strong>, that is, data that is steadily changing over time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Logic analyzers are used to analyze <strong>digital signals</strong> and convert high/low voltage pulses into a sequence of 0s and 1s that we can attempt to interpret.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So, how do we choose what tool to use? For example, let’s say we are measuring a voltage source on a particular target we are trying to <a href="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/replicant-part-1">glitch</a>. If we want to monitor the fluctuations of the voltage line, we should use an oscilloscope. The oscilloscope will let us observe the <strong>voltage over time</strong>, allowing us to see the small period where the voltage drops to a low value and then returns to normal. See the image below, where the purple line represents the voltage line being glitched:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/glitch/scope/SDS00001.png" alt="Glitch!"></p>

<p>We can also use oscilloscopes to characterize and capture power traces. For example, see the following power trace that was captured from the Trezor (purple line):</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/glitch/scope/power_trace.png" alt="Power Trace"></p>

<p>In the previous two examples, we measured a signal oscillating between a range of values and not just <strong>HIGH</strong> or <strong>LOW</strong>. There are fluctuations, rising and falling sequences, and other interesting patterns that we could not catch with our logic analyzer as the logic analyzer looks for either a high or low voltage and reports the results back to the user as a digital signal.</p>

<p>For an example of when we might use a logic analyzer, let’s revisit the oscilloscope capture from before:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jpcg1.jpg" alt="Image"></p>

<p>Notice that there are not nearly as many strange shapes or fluctuations in this signal; the line either appears at a high or low voltage at any given time. While some oscilloscopes can decode digital signals like this, they often are limited by how much memory they can use for a capture. So that means that if you’re trying to capture UART traffic on a Linux system that takes 60 seconds to boot, you would need a large amount of memory / a costly scope. Also, if you wanted to extract the data from the stream or try to decode it using custom plugins, getting access to the digital signal is a headache (<strong>Note</strong> It is possible, but logic analyzers greatly simplify this process for us). This is a perfect use case for our logic analyzer if we want to extract the <strong>data</strong> being encoded in this <strong>digital signal</strong>.</p>

<p>The Logic analyzer can sample for much longer because it samples a signal, reports whether the sample is high or low, and does not report back the exact values in between. Note that what defines high or low can often be configured within your logic analyzer software, but the analyzer will still report back either a 0 or 1. Because the logic analyzer is not concerned with all the values in between, it requires significantly less memory to capture over long periods.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, let’s revisit the <a href="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/uart-uboot-and-usb">older blog post we published last year</a>. The following video shows that the voltage levels fluctuate around 3.3V and eventually return to idle at 3.3V.</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/serial.gif" alt="Gif"></p>

<p>If we were to capture this signal with an oscilloscope, it would look very similar to the screenshot we referenced earlier. However, there is one problem - this system takes about <strong>90 seconds</strong> to boot, and ideally, we want to capture all of the traffic in a way that allows us to analyze it. This is where our logic analyzer will come in handy.</p>

<p>After connecting our logic analyzer to the signals referenced in the blog post, our logic analyzer software (Pulseview) captures the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/pulseview-uart.png" alt="UART"></p>

<p>With this traffic captured, we can set up a decoder to get human-readable values out of this signal, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/decoded2.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>Now, we can export this data to a text or binary file for further analysis.</p>

<p>So, in summary - when we want to capture digital signal traffic such as SPI, UART, I2C, JTAG, etc, we use a logic analyzer. If we want to analyze the <strong>shape</strong> of the waveform or we are investigating an analog signal such as a power source or audio signal, we use an oscilloscope.</p>

<h2 id="clips--jumpers--probes"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/clips-and-probes">Clips / Jumpers / Probes</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes, we have to connect to specific pads or pins to analyze the signal on our target device, but that does not always require soldering and removing components. Probing test pads and reading flash chips in-circuit can significantly reduce the debugging/analysis time when performing firmware patches or testing PoCs. Below are some helpful items that I use when soldering/connecting to new targets. The PCBite kit is handy as the fine-tip probes will often save you from needing to solder to test pads when performing initial analysis.</p>

<p>When picking a power supply, you need to consider the power requirements of your targets. Be sure to review the voltage and current limitations and choose an appropriate supply based on the targets you will analyze. Some power supplies have options like Over-Current Protection (OCP), which is a feature that prevents a power supply from providing more current than it can handle. Some power supplies will also include a <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyt467/slyt467.pdf?ts=1696813801504&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F">Remote Sense</a> feature that is used to regulate the output voltage at the target load. This compensates for the voltage drop across the cables connecting the power supply to the target load.</p>

<p>Perhaps during your teardown, you discovered a set of test points or debug headers that you believe might be for hardware-level debugging, such as JTAG or SWD. If you’re trying to get hardware-level debugging working on a target, it is always a good idea to see what OEM tools are available. I’ve compiled a list below of some of the more generic tools I keep in my toolbox. Most of these are ARM-focused, as many other JTAG tooling for different architectures will often involve purchasing specific hardware/software or utilizing OpenOCD.</p>

<p>When attempting to utilize a hardware debug mechanism (especially from a black box perspective), there is no “one size fits all” tool. Whether you are accessing a <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/jtag-hdd/">JTAG</a> tap or an <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/stm-xbox-jtag/">SWD</a> peripheral, there are two hurdles that you need to overcome:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Can your hardware communicate with the TAP/DAP?
    <ol>
      <li>Logic Levels, appropriate speeds, timings, etc</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Can your software properly enumerate and interact with the TAP/DAP?
    <ol>
      <li>OpenOCD, UrJTAG, OEM Tools, etc</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The right tools for the job is critical when looking at a new hardware-level debug peripheral. Make sure that you search for OEM software/hardware and always check the latest OpenOCD commits for similar targets.</p>

<h2 id="flash-readers"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/flash-extraction">Flash Readers</a></h2>

<p>So, you have done your initial teardown and identified a non-volatile storage device from which you want to extract some data. Perhaps there is a <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/router-teardown/">SPI flash</a> chip or a <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/Holiday-Teardown/">TSOP 48 parallel</a> flash that you want to extract data from. Many flash readers are available; below is a list of what I have in my lab. The Xeltek is somewhat expensive (it is currently on sale for $995.00), and the individual sockets for different chip packages range from $400-$700, so the cost adds up quickly. However, with that cost comes support from Xeltek and fairly reliable tooling, assuming you are comfortable with BGA rework and re-balling ICs, this may be the right choice for you and your team.</p>

<p>In my experience, no flash readout tool works on <strong>everything</strong>. Some tools are better at certain flash types than others. Having a few options in your hardware hacking toolbox is always a good idea if your preferred tool does not support your target device. If I had to pick two devices from the list above, I would choose the FlashCAT and the XGecu T56; you will have a wide range of target chip coverage between those two.</p>



<p>Having a few generic embedded interface tools in your toolkit is always a good idea. I am a big fan of using embedded Linux SBCs due to their flexibility and the fact that you have an entire OS at your disposal, which can open up opportunities to use your favorite programming language to interact with the standard peripherals. One of the most common Linux-based SBCs, the Raspberry Pi, has been difficult to acquire over the last few years. Luckily, the Armbian project supports other boards, such as the Orange Pi Zero 2 and the Orange Pi 4 LTS. You may not always require a fully featured OS, and you just need a tool that can talk to peripherals. In this case, having FT2232H-based boards, such as the generic breakouts and things like the Tigard, will also come in handy. While the FT2232H is a well known, classic interface IC, the RP2040 is quickly gaining popularity due to its ease of use and availability. The Buspirate, a classic embedded Swiss army knife, recently released a new version that the RP2040 powers (Note that the Link below is for just the PCB and not for the entire product)</p>

<h2 id="fault-injection"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/fault-injection">Fault Injection</a></h2>

<p>Fault injection (FI) involves introducing an error/modification minor enough to cause undefined behavior on a target but not enough to stop the target from operating entirely. This typically involves injecting a high-voltage pulse or temporarily draining the voltage from a targeted power source or “rail” on the target system.</p>

<p>By causing momentary voltage modulations (either above or below the expected voltage), we can force our target system to enter a realm of undefined behavior. An adequately targeted fault can bypass various security checks or other features that may impede an attacker or reverse engineer.</p>

<p>When it comes to FI, I think that <a href="https://twitter.com/furrtek">Furrtek</a> explained it best here:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/images/glitch.gif" alt="Image"></p>

<p>Regarding FI, anything capable of pulling a voltage line low or injecting a clock pulse <strong>can</strong> work. However, depending on your target and attack, you might need advanced timing or protocol triggering, where tools such as the ChipWhisperer become very handy. When learning the fundamentals of fault injection, you cannot go wrong with an introductory ChipWhisperer kit. Their materials and example targets explain the principles behind fault injection and provide a tested, repeatable learning environment. I can’t recommend their materials highly enough. If the ChipWhisperer tools are too expensive for your budget, however, there are other tools that folks have used in the past. I have included the tools in the table below and provided some example blog posts that utilize them to help get you started. We have also published a blog post <a href="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/replicant-part-1">here</a> as an introduction to FI.</p>

<p>In the realm of security testing, these tools play a crucial role in assessing and safeguarding the integrity of wireless communication systems and devices. High-cost options provide powerful capabilities for in-depth analysis of various RF signals, allowing security professionals to identify vulnerabilities, intercept and decode wireless transmissions, and assess the robustness of communication protocols. These tools are often employed in academic and research settings for advanced RF security research. On the other hand, low-cost options are accessible solutions that aid in testing and securing more common wireless technologies, including RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and various ISM band devices.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>This write-up covered some of the tools required to build your first hardware hacking toolkit. This by no means is an exhaustive list, and I’m sure there are plenty of alternatives to the devices I’ve listed here.Also, it should be noted that you don’t need <strong>all</strong> of these tools to start hacking on hardware. Sometimes it makes more sense to buy what you need for a given project and save money for nicer equipment later on. I hope this guide was helpful; I plan to revisit this writeup regularly to update it with new tools. If you think a tool should be added to this guide, feel free to email at contact@voidstarsec.com or on <a href="https://twitter.com/wrongbaud">Twitter</a>. A list of just the components discussed here can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/voidstarsec/hw-hacking-lab">github repository</a>, and all pull requests are welcome!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this article is to explain how to make a CPU out of rocks and sand as fast as possible without using too many words. &nbsp;As the world of proprietary hardware and software crushes in around us, we risk losing the ability to make things for ourselves as individuals. &nbsp;It is for this reason that I felt compelled to learn how one could hypothetically make their own integrated circuits by themself. &nbsp;Skip to the end of this article for a few more words on this subject and a disclaimer.</p>

<h2>1)  Get a rock.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/1-rock_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/1-rock_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Quartz Rock" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>2)  Smash the rock.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/3-99.9-sio2_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/3-99.9-sio2_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="98.9%" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>4)  Purify it further to 99.9999999% polysilicon metal.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/4-poly-silicon_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/4-poly-silicon_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Polysilicon" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>5)  Put the polysilicon ingots into a crucible.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/5-poly-silicon-crucible_1689x1086_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/5-poly-silicon-crucible_600x386_q70.jpeg" alt="Polysilicon In Crucible" width="600" height="386"></a></p>

<h2>6)  Heat the silicon ingots to 1698 °K.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WARNING: do not attempt melting silicon at 1698 °K in your kitchen home oven.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/6-heat-silicon_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/6-heat-silicon_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Head The Polysilicon" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>7)  Take a small seed monocrystal and dip it into the vat of molten silicon.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WARNING: do not place your hands in molten silicon.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/7-seed-monocrystal_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/7-seed-monocrystal_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Seed Monocrystal" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>8)  Slowly pull the crystal out as it cools.</h2>

<h2>10) Now, you've got pristine freshly-cut silicon wafers.  Optionally, dope them with Boron, Phosphorus or another dopant.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/10-freshly-cut-wafers_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/10-freshly-cut-wafers_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Freshly Cut Wafer" width="600" height="338"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/10-boron_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/10-boron_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Boron" width="600" height="338"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/10-phosphorus_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/10-phosphorus_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Phosphorus" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not brave enough to buy elemental phosphorus, so you'll have to use your imagination with the matches.</p>

<h2>11) Put photoresist on the wafer.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/11-photoresist_2022x1212_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/11-photoresist_600x360_q70.jpeg" alt="Photoresist" width="600" height="360"></a></p>

<h2>12) Take a chromium-etched photo-lithographic quartz mask with your desired circuit pattern and shine a laser beam through it to project the circuit pattern onto the wafer.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/12-overhead-photomask_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/12-overhead-photomask_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Shine Light Photomask" width="600" height="338"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/12-photomask_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/12-photomask_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Photomask" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>13) The locations of the shadows produced by the photo-mask will control where the photo-resist is chemically changed on the surface of the silicon wafer (depending on whether you used positive or negative photoresist). </h2>

<h2>14) Now, develop the photoresist.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/14-develop-photoresist_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/14-develop-photoresist_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Develop Photoresist" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>15) Acid etch the exposed parts of the wafer.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/15-acid-etch_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/15-acid-etch_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Acid Etch Wafer" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>16) Perform countless iterations and repetitions of homo-epitaxy, hetero-epitaxy, pseudo-epitaxy, diffusion doping, copper interconnect layers, chemical mechanical polishing, photoresist applications, acid etching, and photomask exposing to build up the desired features on the wafer.</h2>

<h2>17) Now you've got a finished silicon wafer.  Cut it into pieces.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/17-finished-wafer_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/17-finished-wafer_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Finished Silicon Wafer Closeup" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>18) Now you've got un-packaged silicon dies.  Locate the pads on the silicon chip, and attach bond wires, or use the flip-chip method as is done now for most modern processors.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/18-unpackaged-silicon-dies_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/18-unpackaged-silicon-dies_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Unpackaged Silicon Dies" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>19) Use the bond wires or solder balls to provide an electrical connection between the pins on the chip package, and the pads on the silicon die.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's how you make a CPU. &nbsp;Also, see <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-small-is-a-cpu/">CPUs Are Smaller Than You Think</a> for a look inside a real Intel CPU.</p>

<h2>A Few More Words</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the process of making a modern CPU is more complicated and less well-defined that depicted by this article. &nbsp;Every new generation of chips usually makes changes to the way features are built up on the wafer (not just in terms of feature size). &nbsp;Many common techniques are not even mentioned in this article, and many important steps have been left out. &nbsp;Important details (such as precise chemical compositions/concentrations) are extremely proprietary and you won't see anyone describing them on HackerNews or Reddit. &nbsp;Many steps in the process (such as sourcing and purification of the silicon) have more than one commonly used method. &nbsp;If you want to learn more about these topics, the right search phrases are "Advanced Optics For Photolithography" and "Chemical Deposition Nanofabrication" or "Lithographic Metrology".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this article isn't perfect, the hope is that an interested reader will benefit from using many of the topics discussed herein as search terms for further research on their own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While cutting-edge nanometer scale features are not likely to be accessible for a hobbyist, micron-scale amateur chip fabrication does appear to be quite feasible.&nbsp;I have not tried this myself, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SamZeloof/videos">Sam Zeloof</a> has, and you should definitely check out his YouTube channel. &nbsp;I think you could probably even build some basic chips with far less equipment than he has if you get the optics right. &nbsp;You could probably make it a hobby business selling cusom chips to other tech people!</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A Word Of Caution</strong>: &nbsp;In case it wasn't already clear, I don't advise that anyone actually attempt making integrated circuits in their apartment in the manner shown in this video. &nbsp;The 'photoresist' and 'developer solution' in this video is just a colored prop.  &nbsp;The real chemicals are usually hazardous and you should only work with them with proper safety gear in a well ventilated area or in a fume hood.</p>
