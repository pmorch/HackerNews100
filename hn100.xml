Tomlinson, a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>-based science fiction author who says he has been swatted dozens of times in the past four years as part of a targeted <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/harassment">harassment</a> campaign by a group of “sociopathic” stalkers.</p><p>“You can’t fathom the amount of clinical obsession that grips these people,” Mr Tomlinson told <em>The Independent </em>this week. “Trying to destroy my world is their full time lives.”</p><figure><figcaption><p>Patrick S. Tomlinson says he has been swatted 47 times in the past four years by Milwaukee Police Department officers </p><p> (Patrick S. Tomlinson)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Mr Tomlinson told <em>The Independent</em> he had woken in the middle of the night to find officers banging on his door, been handcuffed, and had guns shoved in his face during the yearslong ordeal. He was once swatted four times in one day.</p><p>Mr Filion has not been charged in relation to the swats on Mr Tomlinson’s home, and investigators believe there are at least two individuals behind the Torswats account.</p><p>The FBI, Milwaukee Police Department and the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/florida">Florida</a> where the teenager is facing four felony counts declined to provide further information, beyond an extensive account of Mr Filion’s activities in a probable cause charging document.</p><p>After Mr Filion was arrested on 18 January at his home in Lancaster, Los Angeles County, Mr Tomlinson said he and his wife Niki Robinson had their first decent night of sleep in years.</p><p>Their relief was short-lived. A new Telegram channel named “Torswats Return” was created by someone claiming that their “partner has been arrested”, according to posts viewed by <em>The Independent.</em></p><p>The channel stated that it would continue offering “swats” for as little as $40, and offered returning customers a discounted rate. It also posted derogatory photographs and text about Mr Tomlinson — noting that there would be no charge for requested swats against him.</p><p>“And of course swats to Patrick… are free,” read the Telegram message.</p><figure><figcaption><p>California teenager Alan Winston Filion has been extradited to Florida and charged with calling in hoax bomb threats to a Seminole County mosque</p><p> (Seminole County Sheriff’s Office)</p></figcaption></figure><p>On January 31, Milwaukee Police Department officers arrived at Tomlinson’s home after receiving a hoax report of a shooting at the address — for what Tomlinson says is the 47th time their home had been “swatted” in a little over three years.</p><p>“It’s just farcical at this point,” Mr Tomlinson told <em>The Independent.</em> “Nobody told them this had happened 46 previous f…ing times.”</p><p>The MPD denied an open records request by <em>The Independent</em> for callouts to Mr Tomlinson’s home, citing an open FBI investigation.</p><p>The science fiction author has endured relentless harassment from an anonymous online army of what he describes as “cyber terrorists”. He says they have stalked and impersonated him, defaced his home, and continue to send a daily avalanche of abusive phone calls, voicemail messages and emails.</p><p>“I wont stop until one of them die (sic),” a message posted to the channel, referring to Mr Tomlinson, on 6 January stated.</p><p>As swatting incidents have spiked in recent months, victims and cybersecurity experts say law enforcement are failing to deal with the threat.</p><p>Last month, Republican presidential candidate <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/nikki-haley">Nikki Haley</a> revealed she was targeted by swatting hoaxes twice in two days, and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/nikki-haley-swatting-secret-service-b2491146.html"><u>has requested Secret Service protection</u></a> amid the rising threats to her safety.

That’s why it’s so dangerous, that’s why it’s attempted murder.”</p><p>Mr Tomlinson wants to see repeat swatters charged with attempted murder and terrorism.</p><p>“You’re not dealing with internet trolls here, these are hardened criminals,” he told<em> The Independent.</em></p><p>“You have to treat it like a domestic terror cell, they get off on creating chaos and trying to harm people. And in order to keep chasing that high they are only going to escalate.”</p><p><h2><strong>The most swatted man in America</strong></h2></p><p>Mr Tomlinson, who dabbles in stand-up comedy, came to the attention of a hardcore group of online stalkers five and a half years ago after posting an innocuous tweet about the late <em>Saturday Night Live </em>comedian Norm Macdonald.</p><p>“Hot take: I’ve never found Norm Macdonald funny and was pretty sure all my comedy friends who did were either nuts or screwing with me,” he posted on 11 September 2018.</p><p>Days later, Mr Tomlinson was locked out of his verified Twitter account @stealthygeek. He later discovered a 30,000-strong Reddit group of fans of the former shock jock radio show <em>Opie and Anthony</em> had mass reported him for breaching community standards.</p><p><em>Opie and Anthony </em><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/opie-anthony-host-anthony-cumia-fired-after-racist-twitter-tirade-185021/"><u>was canned</u></a> by SiriusXM in 2014 after the network said co-host Anthony Cumia made “racially-charged and hate-filled remarks” on Twitter. Fans of the show later coalesced on the internet around a shared enjoyment of posting hateful content attacking the LGBTQ community, their supporters and any left-wing commentators they took a dislike to.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Author Patrick S. Tomlinson has been relentlessly stalked and harassed for years </p><p> (Courtesy of Patrick S. Tomlinson)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Mr Tomlinson told <em>The Independent </em>his accounts on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook were targeted over the next few months with false complaints.</p><p>He said the trolls created Twitter accounts impersonating him, which he says posted racist, homophobic abuse in an attempt to discredit him.</p><p>The Reddit group also posted photoshopped images of Mr Tomlinson and doxxed his home address and phone number.</p><p>The harassment quickly escalated to death threats left on Mr Tomlinson’s voicemail. Mr Tomlinson said the stalkers began following him to science fiction conventions where they would secretly photograph him and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/1567952066064285696"><u>post the images online</u></a>, and contacted his book publishers claiming they had kidnapped his wife.</p><p>In June 2019, one of the stalkers paid MacDonald <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMBNcPSfbU"><u>to record a Cameo</u></a> in which the comedian, who died in 2021, says he was told that someone named Patrick had said he wasn’t funny. He then calls on “Patrick’s friends” to “please continue insulting that fat loser.”</p><p>The video appears to have encouraged the stalkers to ramp up their efforts.</p><p>In May 2020, Mr Tomlinson’s home was swatted for the first time when two police officers turned up “ready to go” at his home late one night demanding to know where “the children” were.</p><p>The swat came soon after stalkers had created a bogus Craigslist advert with Mr Tomlinson’s home address bizarrely <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boogie2988/comments/174pi0s/psa_please_keep_your_black_children_away_from/"><u>claiming</u></a> that he was kidnapping African-American children, and “grinding them down to make pepperoni”. </p><p>The twisted claim has echoes of the “pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which claimed that Democratic Party insiders were keeping child sex slaves in a pizza parlour in Washington DC.</p><p>The coordinated campaign continued to escalate. The harassers <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/32921860"><u>flooded book sale sites</u></a> Amazon and Goodreads with bogus one star reviews of Mr Tomlinson’s publications in a coordinated assault.</p><p>After the<em> Opie and Anthony</em> subreddit was removed in 2019 for repeated breaches of its terms of service, the harassers migrated to the website new.onaforums.net where the campaign of torment continued.</p><p>The site’s message boards have attracted more than 40,000 threads and around one million comments dedicated to what Mr Tomlinson describes as their “total, clinical obsession with my every tweet, thought, public appearance”.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Milwaukee Police Department police officers have been called out to hoax threats at the home of Patrick S. Tomlinson dozens of times in the past four years</p><p> (Courtesy of Patrick S. Tomlinson)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Mr Tomlinson wrote <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/1567957109978849282"><u>in a lengthy tweet thread at the time</u></a> that the site was being used “to coordinate new attacks, execute, and then brag about the crimes and suffering they’ve inflicted”.</p><p>The group’s stated goal was to “destroy his career, his marriage and drive him to suicide”, he said.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson says that security cameras captured stalkers defacing his house and motorcycles. In another cruel move, the group also posted <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMOtHizStiE&amp;t=1s"><u>audio on YouTube of Mr Tomlinson</u></a> screaming in frustration as he is being swatted.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson reported the group’s obsessive harassment to police and the FBI in May 2020. He said a special agent from the Milwaukee field office was assigned to look into the case, but that he has heard little back about their investigation.</p><p>“The FBI is a black hole as far as their investigation is concerned,” he told <em>The Independent. </em>“We throw evidence down the hole, and nothing comes out.”</p><p>Mr Tomlinson said he has reported each swat to the Milwaukee PD and the FBI, and personally gone to his local precinct on several occasions to ask that they stop sending armed police to his home “every time our stalkers tell them to”.</p><figure><figcaption><p>After Alan Filion’s arrest, the Torswats Telegram channel is back advertising ‘swats’ for as little as $40 </p><p> (Screenshot)</p></figcaption></figure><p>In a response to <em>The Independent</em>, The Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) declined to address why it hasn’t put measures in place to recognise serial swatting attacks at Mr Tomlinson’s home, instead just sharing the same statement it has given other outlets.</p><p>“Swatting is unacceptable, illegal and potentially very dangerous behavior, as it can lead to a very dynamic situation, placing both the residents involved and our officers at risk,” an MPD spokesperson said. </p><p>“Out of an abundance of caution, MPD has a duty to respond to calls for service in order to ensure that no one is in danger and that the necessary precautions are taken into consideration during these incidents.”</p><p>Mr Tomlinson’s attempt to involve law enforcement only seemed to embolden his stalkers, who doubled down on the campaign of emotional torment.</p><p>At 1am on 25 July 2022, the MPD responded to a hoax 911 call by someone claiming to be Mr Tomlinson saying he had killed his wife and a man in their bed. Mr Tomlinson said he was in bed asleep and woke up to hear pounding on his door, and officers armed with assault rifles surrounding his home.</p><p>Security footage taken by his home cameras shows him handcuffed on the porch while the MPD searched his home.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson may be the main target but the stalkers also harass those around him. The same month, while attending her grandfather’s funeral, Mr Tomlinson’s wife discovered she had been impersonated by someone who sent racist emails to Black influencer Marvin Toliver.</p><p>She was temporarily suspended from work before being cleared of any involvement in sending the hateful messages. Mr Toliver later <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CgQOUWXDDcU"><u>posted a video to Instagram</u></a> explaining that the racist messages he’d received were a hoax.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson’s elderly parents have also been swatted three times, he said.</p><figure><figcaption><p>A dedicated ‘swatting’ channel on Telegram has made explicit threats and derogatory posts about author Patrick S. Tomlinson</p><p> (Screenshot)</p></figcaption></figure><p>In September 2022, cyberstalkers sent a “detailed, explicit” death threat to the organisers of the WorldCon in Chicago where Mr Tomlinson was due to appear.</p><p>A few months later, singer Patti LaBelle was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/patti-labelle-concert-wisconsin-bomb-threat-b2243312.html">pulled off stage at a concert in Milwaukee</a> and 2,000 audience members were evacuated due to a bomb threat. Six downtown city blocks were shut down for hours while bomb-sniffing dogs checked buildings.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson told <em>The Independent</em> that MPD officers stopped by his home that night to tell him that the bomb threat had come from stalkers using his name, one of more than half a dozen such hoax bomb threats he had been accused of.</p><p>In April 2023, he was swatted four times in one day. The fourth time the MPD sent six officers with assault rifles to his home at 9pm.</p><p>His home has since been swatted a further 20 times, the most recent being just last week.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson has <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/1567957109978849282"><u>documented the years of harassment</u></a> on Twitter, now X, with the posts often enraging the stalkers and drawing dozens of abusive responses.</p><p>He first spoke at length about the harassment to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/internet-trolls-have-tormented-patrick-tomlinson-for-years-and-he-cant-stop-them"><u><em>the Daily Beast</em></u></a> in October 2022, and has given interviews to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-science-fiction-writer-victim-of-swatting/40912738"><u>local</u></a> and <a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Ftech%2Ffbi-formed-national-database-track-004042096.html&amp;sref=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/swatting-nikki-haley-trump-fbi-stalkers-b2494097.html"><u>national media</u></a> in the hope it might deter the stalkers, but each time it only seemed to spur them on.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://webapps.sftc.org/ci/CaseInfo.dll?SessionID=30CDAC0FED5343082DB67C4BACB8CC240542A495&amp;URL=https%3A%2F%2Fimgquery.sftc.org%2FSha1_newApp%2Fmainpage.aspx%3FWeb_Server%3Dimgquery.sftc.org%26MINDS_Server%3Dhoj-imx-01%26Category%3DC%26DocID%3D07662612%26Timestamp%3D20240202112224%26Digest%3Dacee2c5a847c8cbf820acdd7a4bf83ab602a4392"><u>filed a lawsuit in 2020</u></a> to try to force the internet service provider Cloudflare to reveal the names of the individuals behind the website.</p><p>The request to subpoena Cloudflare was denied by the Superior Court of California after a judge ruled it fell under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields blogs and social media sites from problematic content on their platforms posted by third parties.</p><p>A judge also ordered Mr Tomlinson to pay the anonymous blogger behind the website $23,700 in legal fees.</p><p>That figure has ballooned to $50,000 with interest and penalties, and Mr Tomlinson said the group behind the blog was trying to bankrupt him and take his house.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson has refused to cave despite the ongoing threats to his life, and he and his wife suffering from PTSD and chronic insomnia.</p><p>Rather than relocating or going into hiding, he said he had invested in a top-of-the line security system and bought a “small arsenal of weapons” to protect himself.</p><p>“I bought my wife a gun for Christmas, just so she could feel more at ease.”</p><p><h2><strong>‘Nobody would ever dare swat himself, right?’</strong></h2></p><p>Court documents from Mr Filion’s arrest this week provided a rare glimpse into the dark web nexus between an underground network of professional “swatters” and the criminal stalkers who hire them.</p><p>According to a charging document, the Torswats Telegram channel first came onto the law enforcement’s radar in October 2022, when Anacortes High School in Skagit County, Washington was <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.goskagit.com/anacortes/news/anacortes-high-schools-disrupted-by-phone-threats/article_b1bee9b8-4eeb-11ed-ab37-cba9f380ce4c.html"><u>targeted five times in a week</u></a> with hoax bomb threats and shooting callouts.</p><p>Police initially believed a 17-year-old student at the school was behind the swats, before concluding that he had also been a victim of swatting attempts. The Telegram channel that authorities have tied to Mr Filion later posted audio of the 911 calls.</p><p>Over a month-long period, Torswats posted recordings of fake 911 bomb threats at schools and non-profit organisations in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas, Maryland and Iowa.</p><p>In one swatting incident in February 2023, a teenager in Dubuque, Iowa, who had been in contact with Torswats <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kcrg.com/2023/03/06/high-school-student-charged-with-making-threats-toward-dubuque-hempstead/"><u>was arrested</u></a> for ordering a bomb threat at a local high school.</p><p>In April 2023, <em>Motherboard </em><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7z8be/torswats-computer-generated-ai-voice-swatting"><u>revealed for the first time</u></a> how the Torswats Telegram channel was offering to swat victims using a synthesized speech programme for a $75 fee.</p><p>The next month, Torswats posted audio of a swatting at the Masjid Al Hayy Mosque in Sanford, Florida.</p><p>The caller allegedly told a dispatch operator that he had a handgun and explosive devices and was going to kill everyone inside “in the name of Satan” while playing audio of gunfire.</p><p>Around 30 heavily armed police officers were sent to the mosque, Seminole County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.</p><p>The Torswats Telegram channel was also filled with screeds of racist, misogynistic, transphobic and anti-LGBTQ postings, according to prosecutors.</p><p>In one post, Mr Filion allegedly wrote that he “sent police to the homes of people I don’t like (f… and transsexuals) for fun”, according to a charging document.</p><p>“While a number of victims targeted by Torswats were the product of conducting a swatting’ service, there is an obvious trend observed in the subject’s targeting and his own words, in which victims are chosen due to their sexual orientation and identity, race or religion,” detectives from the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office wrote.</p><p>In May 2023, the FBI set up a national database to “track and create a real-time picture of swatting incidents” and share information between hundreds of police departments and law enforcement agencies across the country.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Judge Arthur Engoron, who presided over a civil fraud trial against the Trump Organisation, was swatted in January </p><p> (POOL/AFP via Getty Images)</p></figcaption></figure><p>In late June, Scott Schubert, the section chief of the FBI Criminal Justice Services Division, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-formed-national-database-track-prevent-swatting-rcna91722"><u>gave an interview</u></a> to <em>NBC News</em> about a new swatting national database that would enable law enforcement to monitor the growing threat.</p><p>In the following days, Mr Schubert, and the FBI special agents in charge in Pittsburgh, San Antonio and Oklahoma City were targeted in swatting calls.</p><p>An FBI spokesperson told <em>The Independent</em> that more than 550 swatting incidents have been reported to the database, known as the National Common Operation Picture, in the past seven months.</p><p>Experts say that figure could be just the tip of the iceberg, as police departments are often reluctant to report swats due to the embarrassment of being duped.</p><p>“That the FBI is starting to take this seriously and get some data, is a useful thing,” Professor Singer, the cybersecurity expert, told <em>The Independent.</em></p><p>“It helps you identify underlying systemic behaviours that might indicate a larger problem.”</p><p>Swatters are typically prosecuted under state False Information and Hoaxes laws.</p><p>But without a federal statute, law enforcement are constrained from devoting additional resources to training 911 dispatchers or investigating cases, Professor Singer said.</p><p>Meanwhile, “swatters” are sharing information and learning from one anothers’ tactics to stay one step ahead of authorities, Professor Singer said.</p><p>He called for more sophisticated IT systems in police call centres to identify the location of where the phone call is coming from, and mandatory reporting of swats.</p><p>“People seem willing to do things online that they would never do in real life. And this is an illustration of where that kind of online harassment mentality can lead. It’s never been good, but now it’s actually dangerous,” Professor Singer said.</p><p>“It used to be spamming, it used to be doxxing, it used to be pizza orders — swatting is a much more destructive evolution of online harassment.”</p><p>The FBI alleges that in order to learn his trade, Torswats placed nine swatting calls to his own home in Andale Avenue, Lancaster, over a three month period between September and December 2022 to test what the police response would be.</p><p>The suspect allegedly boasted about calling out the swats on Telegram: “How would I know my methods would work otherwise.

            <p>OpenTTD is an open source simulation game based upon the popular Microprose game "Transport Tycoon Deluxe", written by Chris Sawyer. It attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features.</p>

Play with the game to experience all the features yourself, or take a look at the <a href="https://wiki.openttd.org/">Wiki</a> for a more thorough listing and explanation of the features and possibilities available. </p>

          -=[ Demoscene &amp; Video Game Music Streaming Radio Links ]=-

-=[ Introduction ]=-

On this web page I have compiled all of the demoscene and video game music
streaming radio station links that I know of.  I have been collecting these
stations for over ten years and the list has grown and shrunk over those
years.

Each radio station linked below starts with the link to the home page for the
station.  This is usually then followed by links to playlists (.m3u, .pls) that
when clicked will launch the station in you default player.  Then you will find
links to the stream (sometimes ending in .mp3, .acc, .ogg, .opus or a ;) that
will play in your web browser when clicked.  There will be repeats of playlists
and stream links when there are multiple different channels of music or multiple
different speed streams to choose from.  In some cases there are links, that
when clicked, will bring you to the SHOUTcast or Icecast server for the station.
Try clicking on links there to start the station playing.  If you have 
difficulty playing a stream, try to go to the station's home page and try to
play the streams from there.  Please do not be annoyed if some of the stations
do not work, I recently verified all of them, and they do go up and down on
a regular basis.  Give a station a try another day if it is not working now.

If you have any corrections or additions, please let me know in an email and I
will consider including them on this page.  My email address can be found by
going to my contact Michael Walden page at: <a href="https://mw.rat.bz/contact.htm">https://mw.rat.bz/contact.htm</a> .

The links on this list are not in any particular order, they are mostly in the
order that I became aware of them (oldest first, newest at the end).

Note: You may want to check out my Desktop Streaming Radio Players page at
      <a href="https://mw.rat.bz/players/">https://mw.rat.bz/players/</a> to get a player program for these streams.
      You can set one of them up to be your default streaming radio player.

There are currently about 60 stations on this list.

From this point on this page, to the end, I provide links to sites that were
used to collect stations to put on this list.  I will use these links in the
future to collect more new stations.  I went through all of these sites just
before publishing this page (around 2024-02-08).  There is no point in
looking at any of these links, to find new stations, any time in the near
future.  I would wait at least a year before going through the effort of
identifying any new stations on these sites.

        <p>Interviews should be as close as possible to the work that the candidate would do if they join. </p><p>While that seems like a pretty tautological statement, it is unfortunately not always true. When interviewing as a software engineer, for example, you’ll run into places that lean heavily on algorithms interviews. </p><p>And don’t get me wrong, those interviews can be fun (in the same way that <a href="https://projecteuler.net/?ref=propelauth.com">Project Euler</a> can be fun), but it’s not very relevant for most jobs. For some jobs, it's a proxy for the technical skills you'll need for the job, but often it feels like it’s testing if you took an algo class that covered dynamic programing.</p><p>So, when <a href="https://www.propelauth.com/?ref=propelauth.com">we</a> were designing our interviews for Support Engineers, we were met with the same problem - how can we best simulate and test what the job would be like?</p><p>Support has a lot of unique aspects to it - you have to be able to context switch, you have to be able to debug issues well, you have to be able to make customers feel heard, and so much more all at the same time. For a technical product, you also need to be able to read and write code.</p><h3 id="the-interview">The Interview</h3><p>After we talked about it, we decided on a format:</p><ul><li>We describe a fake product. To avoid everyone needing to ramp up on it, it’s just a simplified clone of a very well known product.</li><li>We provide docs for the fake product.</li><li>We provide a queue of emails/questions for that fake product, loosely based on real questions / customer issues we’ve debugged.</li><li>The goal is to resolve the queue, just like you would in real life.</li></ul><p>There are so many aspects to this that give us actually a lot of signal. Candidates have to first prioritize the queue, which means deciding which issues seem important and which can wait. Candidates have to be able to parse through questions that are vague or maybe misinterpretations of what’s happening.</p><p>It’s a pretty interesting exercise, but there’s one problem:</p><p>You can’t really resolve tickets in <strong>isolation</strong>.</p><p>Real customer issues often require back and forth. You may need to clarify something, get more information, dig through logs, etc. Without that, you are just blindly guessing at what the underlying issue is.</p><h3 id="becoming-a-dungeon-master-dm">Becoming a Dungeon Master (DM)</h3><p>To solve that, we took each of the tickets that we made and we created extra assets for them. These are things like code snippets that a customer would send over if prompted, answers that engineers would give if asked about the product, or what the actual underlying issue is (in case it isn’t obvious from the ticket).</p><p>The idea was that the candidate would basically just say what they would do next and we would provide what happened.</p><p>It’s been a while since I’ve played DnD, but it feels like a very, very light version of the prep you do when designing a campaign as a DM. You want to be prepared for the different things that might happen, because you aren’t 100% sure which direction they will take it.</p><p>In the DnD context, this could be someone carefully going over every detail of a room that you didn’t expect them to care about. In the interview context, this could be someone asking to check the status page before responding to a ticket about API errors - something that is very reasonable, but you may not have thought of ahead of time.</p><p>Fortunately, relative to an entire fantasy world, a small product with minimal docs is pretty easy to prep for.</p><h3 id="what-does-it-look-like-in-practice">What does it look like in practice?</h3><ul><li><strong>Candidate:</strong> Hmm, ok, so the user is getting timeouts in production but not locally. Can they clarify if all requests are timing out or just some?</li><li><strong>Us:</strong> They say it’s every request</li><li><strong>Candidate</strong>: As a sanity check, could we have them make a request to a different service in production and see if that times out?</li><li><strong>Us:</strong> They said that also timed out.</li><li><strong>Candidate:</strong> Great, so this is probably a networking issue that isn’t specific to us. I’d probably ask another question about how their infrastructure is set up.</li><li><strong>Us:</strong> They then apologized and said they figured out the issue from there. They were using Lambda functions in prod but hadn’t set it up to have internet access yet.</li></ul><p>To be clear, we aren’t expecting the candidate to say “Oh it’s probably in a private subnet,” or even go into the networking weeds with the user, but we are expecting that the right prompts will lead the user to figure it out.</p><p>The whole exercise takes about 45 minutes and provides a lot of good insights. For that same example, there are a bunch of paths to the same answer. Some candidates will ask if we are down before saying anything to the user, some candidates will try to reproduce the issue themselves (which is hard in this case, but not all of them), and some candidates will lean more heavily on their intuition to figure out what’s wrong.</p><h3 id="any-problems-with-it">Any problems with it?</h3><p>So far, it’s been going pretty well. I will say there are probably two areas that could be better.</p><p>The first is that there are occasions where the candidate doesn’t really know the bounds (or lack thereof) of what they can do from the prompt. In these cases, I switch to an easy ticket and walk them through it to show how it works.</p><p>The second is that it can be tricky to ramp other people up on. The prep work helps standardize the question, but a group of people would likely need to shadow each other for a little while before they can all ask it and compare notes correctly.</p><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><p>While it requires a bit of up front work (and some creativity), designing an interview process that mimics the actual day to day responsibilities can give you much more signal than something more divorced from reality.</p><p>We’ve also received the feedback that it’s a much more enjoyable interview process than most - and it never hurts to provide an excellent candidate experience!</p>

and <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#willingham2018">Willingham 2008</a>, who
writes:
<ul>
"using learning-styles theories in the classroom does not bring an
advantage to students. … There's increasing evidence that people
[who claim to have learning preferences] act on those beliefs ….
But doing so confers no cognitive advantage.  People believe they have
learning styles, and they try to think in their preferred style, but doing
so doesn't help them think." (pp.&nbsp;28–29)
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
But everyone surely has a different "studying
style". </p><p><b>More importantly, the way that you are studying right now might not be the best for
you:</b><br> How would you know?  Easy:  If your grades aren't what you'd like
them to be, then you probably need to change how you study!
</p><p>
One important clarification before we begin:
</p><ul>
<b>"Studying" is not the same thing as "doing homework"!</b>
</ul>
<p>
Studying may <i>include</i> doing homework, but it is also a lot more,
as you will see. <br>(So, if you say that you have no homework and that therefore
you can't, or you don't have to, study, you're mistaken!)
</p><p>
I am going to give you some suggestions on how to study efficiently. They
worked for me when I was in high school, college, and graduate school.
<br>
Not only that, but they worked equally well for me in humanities courses
(like philosophy and literature) and in science courses (like math and
computer science).</p><p> But, to the extent that everyone's styles may
be different, some of my suggestions may not work for you, at least not
without some individual modifications.<br> Nevertheless, I urge you to
<i>try</i> them.  Most successful students use them (or some slight
variation of them).

</p><p>
Please feel free to

suggestions</a> for studying that worked for you.  I will try to include
them in further versions of this guide.

2.  Manage Your Time</a></h2><a name="time">

<p>
2.1. School is a full-time job.  And managing your time is important.
</p><ul>
<li>If you have a "real" job after school
that you do just for fun (or for some extra spending money), or if
you participate in extra-curricular activities (whether
school-related or not), keep your priorities
in mind:  
<ul><b>Your education should come first!</b></ul>
</li><li>If you must work (in
order to make ends meet), you should realize the limitations that
this imposes on your study time.

</li><li>
How much time should you devote to studying?  
A recent
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/che.homework.html" target="_blank">survey
in the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i></a> suggested that students
are not studying enough. So, how much is enough?  
<ul>
<li>
If you assume that
your education is a full-time job, then you should spend about 40
hours/week on it.  Figure that 1 academic credit equals about 1
hour.  So, if you're taking 15 credits, then you're spending about 15
hours in class.  Subtracting that from 40 gives you 25 hours that you
should be spending studying at home (or in the library).
</li><li>
You should spread that out over the week.  Suppose you decide to study
Sunday through Thursday evenings, taking Fridays and Saturdays off (from
studying, that is).  Dividing that 25 hours by those 5 days gives you 5
hours of studying per night.  If you think that's too much, then plan on
studying in the afternoons, too, or some of Saturday.
</li><li>
The above are just rules of thumb.  If you're taking a 3-credit
independent-study course, but you meet with your instructor only 1 hour/week,
then you should add the extra 2 hours to your at-home study time.  If
you're working to earn some money, you should subtract your work hours
from your <i>free time</i>, not from your study time!  (If you don't
want to do that, then you should consider quitting your job or reducing
your course load.)
</li><li>
So, for instance, if you are a part-time student taking (say) 3 courses
worth a total of 9 credits
and working (say) 20 hours per week, then you have 20 hours per week for
your coursework (40 hours in a typical work-week minus 20 hours at your
job).  The 9 credits amount to approximately 9 hours in class.  So,
20&nbsp;–&nbsp;9&nbsp;=&nbsp;11 hours to spend at home studying.
That works out to about 2.2 hours (2 hours and 12 minutes, to be overly
precise) per day (in a 5-day week, using the assumption about no
studying on Fridays or Saturdays),
or about 0.7 hours (42 minutes) per course for 3
courses.
</li><li>
If that still seems like a lot, consider the difference between
high-school courses and college courses.  The typical high-school course
meets every day, for about 5 hours/week.  But the typical college course
meets only about 3 hours/week, yet is supposed to be more intensive than
its high-school counterpart.  That's because in college you're expected
to put more of your own time into studying.

<p>
2.2. Set yourself a grade goal.  If you don't meet it, cut down on
non-school activities.  (If you can't, because you're working for a
living, then consider dropping down to part-time schooling.)

<h3><a name="takenotes">3.1. Take Notes</a></h3><a name="takenotes">
Good studying at home begins with good notes taken in class.  
<p>Just as
different
students may have different learning or studying styles,
different teachers have different
teaching styles (and often these clash with the students' learning styles!):  
</p><ul>
<li>Some teachers lecture, some lead discussions, some
"facilitate" individual work (as in a lab), etc.
</li></ul></a><p><a name="takenotes">
  Consequently,
different classroom settings will require different note-taking
techniques.
But the suggestions here are general enough to work in most situations.

</a><a name="compnotes">
</a></p><h3><a name="compnotes">3.2.  Take Complete Notes</a></h3><a name="compnotes">
The key idea of taking good notes in class is to
<b>write down as much as possible</b>.
There are several reasons to take notes that are as complete as possible:
<ol>
<li>It will force you to pay attention to what's going on in class.
</li><li>It will keep you awake (!)
</li><li>There will be less that you'll have to remember.
</li></ol>

<p>
Should you concentrate on <i>taking notes</i> or should you concentrate on
<i>understanding</i> what you are learning?  
</p></a><ul><a name="compnotes">
</a><li><a name="compnotes">Paradoxically, I'd err on the
side of taking notes, not understanding!  
</a><ul><a name="compnotes">
</a><li><a name="compnotes">
Understanding can come later,
when you </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#copy">review your notes</a>.
</li><li>
But if you have incomplete notes, it will be
hard for you to learn what you didn't take notes on.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<a name="useabbrev">
<h3>3.3. Use Abbreviations</h3>
Taking complete notes will require you to write fairly quickly and, as a
consequence, to <i>use abbreviations</i>.  Here are some that I use (many of
which I borrowed from other students and teachers), to give you an idea of
how you can abbreviate. 
If you send text messages on your cell phone, then you know the sort of
abbreviations I'm talking about. Use them when you take notes in
class!




</a><p><a name="useabbrev">
A related idea is  based on a system of shorthand called </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedwriting" target="_blank">Speedwriting</a>:  There used to be
ads in the New York City subway system that read something like this:
</p><ul>if u cn rd ths, u cn lrn spdwrtg</ul>

<p>
The key idea in abbreviating is to use abbreviations that will make sense
to <i>you</i>. You can put an abbreviation key in the margin of your

</a></p><h3><a name="neatness">3.4.  Neatness Doesn't Count.</a></h3><a name="neatness">
Yet another key idea of note-taking is that you don't have to be
<i>neat</i>! You only have to be <i>legible enough</i> to be able to read
your notes a few hours (or, at most, a few days) later.  The reason for
this
will become clear </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#copy">later</a>.

<a name="askqns">
<h3>3.5. Ask Questions &amp; Make Comments</h3>
If you have a question or something comes to mind as you're taking notes,
you have two choices:  
<li>
You can contribute to the class discussion by
asking your question or making your comment.  
</li><li>Or you can jot your question
or comment down in your notes.  
<p>
I suggest always doing the latter, but
also doing the former as often as possible.  
</p></li><li>One reason that you should
always put your question or comment in your notes is so that you won't
forget it. You can then always bring it up later, either in class or
one-on-one with the teacher or a fellow student.
</li><li>
Another reason, of course, is that if you <i>do</i> bring it up in class,
it should thereby become part of the day's class notes!  
<p>
One technique
that I use to be able to distinguish my own questions or comments from the
rest of the notes is to put them in the margin and/or to surround them
with big, bold square brackets
<span size="+5">[</span>like this.<span size="+5">]</span>

</p><p>
By the way, if you have a question, especially if you need clarification
of something that the teacher said or wrote (possibly because it was
inaudible or illegible), <i>ask it</i>!  
</p></li><li>Do <i>not</i> be embarrassed about
asking it!  
</li><li>I can guarantee you that there will be at least one other
student in the class (and often many more) who will be extremely grateful
to you for having asked the very same question that they were too
embarrassed to ask. 
</li></a><li><a name="askqns">And they will come to view you as wise and brave for
having asked it.  (So will the teacher!)

</a><a name="copy">
<h3>3.6.  Copy Your Notes at Home</h3>
Recall that this section was titled "Take Notes in Class &amp; <i>Rewrite</i>
Them at Home". 
<p>
The title was <i>not</i> "Take Notes in Class &amp; <i>Study</i> Them
at Home".  
</p><p>Of course you should study your class notes at home; but just
(re-)<i>reading</i> them is too passive. 
</p><p>
One of the themes of this guide
is that</p><ul><b>STUDYING MUST BE <i>ACTIVE</i></b>.
</ul>
<p>
It is all too easy when
<i>just</i> reading passively to have your mind wander or even to fall
asleep:
</p></a><ul><a name="copy"></a><a href="https://www.gocomics.com/betty/2002/03/20" target="_blank">
<img src="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/betty.notetaking"></a></ul>
<p>
Moreover, notes are often incomplete or sketchy; just reading
such notes won't help.  And a few days or months after you take them, they
may very well be illegible or incomprehensible.
Finally, if you don't do something active with your notes, you run the
risks of having unorganized notes or of misplacing them.

</p><p>
What I suggest is that you <b>study your notes by re-writing them</b>:
</p><ul>
<li>
For each class, buy a separate notebook from the one you take your notes in.
I recommend a "composition" or spiral notebook, not a looseleaf
notebook, for your "permanent" (i.e., re-written) notes.  
</li><li>
Then, as soon as
possible after class (preferably that evening or the next), copy your
notes into your permanent notebook.  
</li></ul>

<p>
The main idea behind re-writing your "raw" class notes (besides making
them more legible and organized) is that the very act of copying them is
one of the best ways of studying them!  Further study of your class notes
can then be done from these "cooked" ones that are neater, more legible,
more organized, and more complete.  I will suggest ways to do this <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#examstudy">later</a>.

</p><p>
Use this opportunity to fill in gaps
from your memory while they are still fresh in mind.  You may find that
you have questions, perhaps something you missed or don't understand, or
even a "substantive" question.  If so, good!  Make a note of your
question and ask it in class next time!  

</p><p>
Use this opportunity to
(re-)organize your notes in a more logical or coherent fashion.  You could
write your permanent notes in an outline form if that seems suitable:  You
don't have to follow any "official" or formal outlining style (e.g.,
using the I.A.1.(a)(i) format or the (sometimes silly) rule that there
must always be at least two subsections, never just one)&nbsp;—&nbsp;after all,
these are <i>your</i> notes.  Personally, I like to number main ideas (and
separate them with a line), using
an "indented bullet" style for details:
</p><pre>1.  Main idea 1
    - detail 1
    - detail 2
      - further detail 2.1
    - detail 3
      - further detail 3.1
      - further detail 3.2
</pre>
<hr>
<pre>2.  Main idea 2
</pre>
<hr>
<pre>3.  Main idea 3
</pre>
<hr>
etc.

<h3>3.7.  Don't Take Notes on a Computer</h3>
By the way, I do <i>not</i> recommend taking notes on a laptop
computer <i>during class</i>.  
</a></li><li><a name="computer">Certainly you should not do this unless you are a <i>very</i>
good typist and have "compiled" your word-processing or text-editing
program into your fingertips. 
</a></li><li><a name="computer"> (In any case, typing can be very noisy and
disturbing to your fellow students!)  
</a><p><a name="computer">
Also, typing class
notes into a computer file can be inconsistent with my recommendation to
</a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#copy">re-write your class notes</a>.
</p></li><li>Rewriting on a computer might have some advantages in terms of keeping
track of your notes or, especially, searching them.
</li><li>And, of course, you can <i>edit</i> your computer
file later, but editing is not the same as <i>copying</i>,
and I am recommending
copying as a means to studying (for one thing, it forces you to (re-)read
all your notes).  
</li><li>Of course, you <i>can</i> copy your raw notes into a
neater computer file; this may be a matter of taste, but I find that I
have a firmer grasp of what I write if I handwrite it than if I type it.
</li><li>(As Usama Fayyad has said:
computers are "great at bookkeeping
but not yet great at recording impromptu
ideas, thoughts, feelings. For that, paper
is still far superior. You can hold it, fold
it, put it in your pocket, look at it again
later when it's convenient" (as quoted in
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#swerdlow">Swerdlow 1999</a>: 130).)
</li><li>Moreover, the main use of your notes should be for summarizing them to
make
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#outline">a study guide for exams</a>.
</li><li>In that case, handwritten notes would serve as well as online ones,
especially if you're tempted to create the summary merely by cutting and
pasting your computer file rather than by rewriting.
<p>
Worse, you may be tempted to use the computer that you're ostensibly
taking notes on to surf the Internet, look at email, or chat with
friends. Don't!  (For an interesting debate on this topic, see
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#adams2006">Adams 2006</a>.)
</p><p>
For that matter, turn off your computer in class.  And your iPod.  And
your cell phone.  And your pager.  And anything else that might distract
you.  For reasons why, see:

<b>When should you study or do your homework?</b>

It's tempting to put
off your homework to the last minute.
There are at least two good reasons to do your homework as soon
as possible and not put it off till the evening, when it's not daylight
(although you should certainly take a break between the end 
of the school day and before starting your homework):
	<ol>
	<li>It's better to get it done and over with, and to leave yourself
enough time to do it all.  
<ul>
<li>If you put it off, you may find that you
have an assignment or two that are going to take you a lot longer than
you thought they would.  
</li><li>If you start early and get your work done
before you relax, you'll have enough time for even those hard
assignments
(even if it means not having enough time to Facebook or play videogames
or read for fun).  
</li><li>The general principle is:
Don't eat your dessert first!
</li></ul>
</li><li>You're more awake during the daytime or after relaxing for, say,
an hour or so after classes end, than you will be at the end of the day
just before going to sleep.

<h3>5.1. Read Actively, Not Passively</h3>
Whatever you have to read &nbsp;—&nbsp; whether it's a text book, a
work of fiction, a poem, an essay, an article from a journal or magazine,
or even a class handout &nbsp;—&nbsp; <b>read it slowly and
actively</b>:
</a><ul><a name="active"></a><li><a name="active">
With </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#exception">one major exception</a>, you should not
read passively.  
</li><li>That is, don't just read the text straight through
without thinking about what you're reading.  
<ul><a href="https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1972/03/28" target="_blank">
<img width="50%" src="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/peanuts.word.a.day.png"></a></ul>
<p>
If you read without thinking, I guarantee that
your mind will eventually wander off, your eyes will eventually glaze
over, and you will fall asleep—it's a form of self-hypnosis.
</p><ul><li>
So you must read actively.  
</li><li>To use computer jargon, you must turn the
inert medium of text on paper to an <i>interactive</i> medium, in which you have
a "conversation" with the text, as you might if you could be talking to
the author.  
</li></ul>
</li></ul>


<a name="slow">
<h3>5.2. Read Slowly.</h3>
<p>
"…an undeniable truth:  that in the pursuit of knowledge, slower
can be better."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
—Gleick, James (2011), <i>The Information</i> (New
York:  Pantheon): 404. 
</p></a><ul><a name="slow"></a><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/ziggy/2004/11/22" target="_blank">
<img width="15%" src="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/ziggy-slowReading.gif"></a></ul>
<p>
The first step in reading actively is to read <i>s-l-o-w-l-y</i>.  Here is
an algorithm (i.e., a procedure) for
how to read any text, in any subject, slowly and actively:

</p><ul>
<pre>WHILE there is a next sentence to read, DO:
  BEGIN { while }
    Read it, SLOWLY;
    IF you do not understand it, THEN
      BEGIN { if }
        re-read the previous material, SLOWLY;
        re-read the incomprehensible sentence, SLOWLY;
        IF you still don't understand it, THEN
           ask a fellow student to explain it;
        IF you still don't understand it, THEN
           ask your Teaching Assistant (TA) to explain it;
        IF you still don't understand it, THEN
           ask me;
        IF you are in an upper-level course &amp; you still don't understand it, THEN
           write a paper about it (!)
      END { if } 
END; { while }
</pre>
</ul><p>
Since there is no next sentence (because the Boolean test in the
WHILE is false), you've understood the text!
</p><p>
For those of you who may not be familiar with how to read structured
computer programs such as this one, here's how it goes:
</p><ul>
<li>
In a "while" statement, if the initial test is false, then the rest of
the statement is not executed.
</li><li>
So, if you are at the beginning or the middle of reading a text, there
<i>will</i> be a "next" sentence, so you <i>do</i> execute the rest of the
statement, which says to read that next sentence slowly, etc.
</li><li>
However, if you have finished reading the entire text (and, hopefully,
have now understood it), then there is <i>no</i> next sentence, so you are
finished!   
</li><li>
(The words in braces, like "{&nbsp;while&nbsp;}",
are just computer-programming notation for a comment that is intended
for human readers of a computer program but that is ignored by the
computer.)
</li></ul>
<p>
This algorithm has three major advantages:

</p><ol>
<li>
It forces you to actively think about each sentence you read
before you go on to read the next one.
</li><li>
It slows you down,
so that you don't read past the point at which you don't understand.
This is especially important in mathematical and scientific subjects.
</li><li>
It can help you get help from your teacher, because you can show your
teacher exactly where you got lost.  
<ul>
<li>It is always much better to show
your teacher exactly what it is that you don't understand than
it is to
just say that you don't understand the material.
</li></ul>
</li><li>
Note that it also provides you an opportunity to interact with your
instructors and fellow students!
</li></ol>
<p>
How do you know whether you understand what you've read?  Easy:  After
each sentence, ask yourself "Why?" (Pressley &amp; El-Dinary 1992).

<a name="highlighting">
<h3>5.3.  Highlight the Text in the Margin</h3>
There are some other tricks for active reading.  One, of course, is to
highlight important or interesting passages.  There are several ways to do
this: 
</a><ul><a name="highlighting">
</a><li><a name="highlighting"> The <i>worst</i> is to use a <mark>yellow highlighting marker</mark> (or hot
pink, or whatever color you like). 
</a><ul><a name="highlighting"><li>
The main problem with this is that you
will tend to find almost every sentence to be important or interesting.
</li><li>
As a consequence, every page will become yellow (or hot pink, or
whatever).  
</li><li>
Not only does this defeat the purpose of highlighting&nbsp;—&nbsp;because
if <i>everything</i> has been highlighted, then really <i>nothing</i> has
been!&nbsp;—&nbsp;but the pages of your text will become damp, curl up, and be
generally messy.
</li></a><li><a name="highlighting">
This technique can have other problems, too:
</a><ul><a name="highlighting"></a><a href="http://gocomics.com/betty/" target="_blank">
<img width="45%" src="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/betty.highlighting.gif"></a></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
A slightly less messy, but equally useless, technique is to use a pen or
pencil to <u>underline</u> important or interesting passages.  
<ul><li>I guarantee
that you will wind up underlining every sentence on every page, and you
will have gained nothing.
</li></ul>

</li><li>
The technique that I suggest is also susceptible to this problem, but has
a built-in way to overcome it, so that you can
re-read the text, highlighting different passages each
time.  
<ul>
<li>
The trick is to <b>highlight a passage by drawing a <i>vertical
line</i> in the margin.</b>
<ul><li>I like to use the right margin and to make my
line a right square bracket: <span size="+20">]</span>  
</li><li>If you want to make it
clear [exactly
where the highlighted passage begins or ends,] you can use small square
brackets in the text,
as I did in this sentence,
along with the vertical line in the margin.
</li><li>
This way, even if you've
slipped into the error of highlighting (i.e., vertical-lining)
every sentence on every page, at
least you haven't ruined the page.  
</li><li>
Moreover, when you re-read the text
&nbsp;—&nbsp;
note that I said 'when', not 'if'&nbsp;:-)
&nbsp;—&nbsp;
you can then use a different
highlighting technique (e.g., underlining) to highlight more important
passages.  
</li><li>Sometimes, I use double brackets in the margin for this second
round of highlighting: <span size="+20">]</span><b>]</b>
<br>
and <u>underlining</u> for a third round.  (If you must, you could use
<mark>yellow
highlighter</mark> for a fourth  round.)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>


<a name="marginalnotes">
<h3>5.4. Make Notes in the Margin</h3>
You should also make notes in the margin of the text (<i>if</i> there's
room, and <i>if</i> the text belongs to you).  
<ul><li>I like to put
cross-references in the margin; e.g., if a passage on p.&nbsp;20 reminds me in
some way of a passage on p.&nbsp;10, I'll write "see&nbsp;p.&nbsp;10"
in the margin on
p.&nbsp;20, and "see&nbsp;p.&nbsp;20" in the margin on p.&nbsp;10.  
</li><li>Or I'll put some keyword
in the margin if a passage reminds me of some major idea.  
</li></ul>

<p>
But now suppose that a few months (or a few years) later, you want to find
that interesting passage that related to, say, consciousness; how will you
find it?  
</p><ul><li>
You could, of course, page through the book till you find it,
but what I like to do is to make an index of my marginal comments. 
</li><li>You can
add entries 
(e.g.,&nbsp;Consciousness: &nbsp;10,&nbsp;20)
to the book's index if it already has one,
or use a  blank page at the end of the book if it doesn't have an index.
</li></ul>

</a><a name="notebook">
<h3>5.5.  Keep a Notebook</h3>
Highlighting has the disadvantage that it
can lead you to highlight everything, and margins have the disadvantage
that they are often too
small for making comments.  
</a><ul><a name="notebook"><li>
The best technique for active reading is
to keep a notebook.  
</li><li>In addition to (or instead of) highlighting a
passage, copy it
&nbsp;—&nbsp;
<i>verbatim</i>
&nbsp;—&nbsp;
into your notebook.  
</li></a><li><a name="notebook">Be sure to begin
your notebook with a full
</a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtowrite.html#citations" target="_blank"> citation</a> to the text
for use in a bibliography, and
be sure to write down the page numbers of each passage that you copy.
</li><li>
Then, write down
&nbsp;—&nbsp;
at length and in detail
&nbsp;—&nbsp;
your comments on the passage.
</li><li>
(I sometimes like to use a pen for the text and a pencil for my
commentary.) 
</li></ul>

<p>
<a name="ident">
These notes can then be used later if you write a term paper
or research paper that discusses the material in the text.  
</a></p><ul><li><a name="ident">
For that
purpose, it will be useful to number your notes.  
</a></li><li><a name="ident">
I find the following
scheme useful:  Number each notebook
page with a
</a><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22roman+numerals%22" target="_blank">Roman numeral</a>
(I, II, etc.), number each quoted
passage (or stand-alone comment) with an Arabic numeral (1, 2, etc.),
and letter (a, b, etc.) each
comment associated with a quoted passage (or stand-alone comment).  
</li><li>Then
you can refer to each passage with an identifier (like XIV-7-b, i.e.,
comment b about quotation 7, which comment is located on notebook page
XIV) that will
enable you to find it later.  
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#makeoutline">See below</a>.)
</li></ul>

<a name="exception">
<h3>5.6. Read Literature Quickly and Passively the First Time.</h3>
</a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#active">Earlier</a>, I said that there was an exception to this
method of slow and active reading:  
<ul><li>
If the text is a work of literature (a
story, novel, play, poem, etc.), then it is often best to read it once all the
way through without stopping, just as you would read something for fun,
so that you get to know what it's about and can appreciate it
as a work of literature.  
</li><li>
(If there's a recording of it, you might find it
helpful to listen to the recording <i>while reading the text</i>. I have
found this especially useful for Shakespeare.)
</li><li>
Then you can use the slow
and active reading techniques for a second (or third, or fourth, or
…) reading when you are studying the text.
</li><li>
Actually, even for non-fiction, it can be useful to read the text
through once, quickly, to get an overview, perhaps making notes if
something strikes you, and then doing the slow and active reading
techniques when you are studying the text.
</li></ul>

<p>
What about film or video versions?  
</p><ul><li>
They can be helpful but, in general,
of course are no substitute for reading.  
</li><li>The exception here is for plays,
which are intended to be seen, not (just) read.  
</li><li>If you do decide to watch
in addition to read, which should you do first?  
<ul><li>I prefer watching first,
reading afterwards.  
</li><li>I have almost always been disappointed by film
adaptations of favorite texts (because they don't match the mental images
that I construct when I read), but I have almost never been disappointed
by a text after watching a film adaptation.  
</li><li>Besides, if you watch first
and read later, the adaptation can help you visualize what you're
reading.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<a name="before">
<h3>5.7. Read Before and After Class</h3>
Ideally, you should read a text at least twice:  
</a><ul><a name="before"><li>
Read it (perhaps
quickly) <i>before</i> the class in which it will be discussed, so that
you are familiar with its contents.  
</li></a><li><a name="before">
Then (re-)read it <i>after</i>
class using the </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#slow">slow and active method</a>. 
</li><li>
 If time
permits, you can cut corners by only reading it—slowly
and actively!—<i>after</i> class.

Science and math courses (and some others, such as foreign-language

them in.

<i>copy them neatly</i>.  </b>
</li><li>
Turn in the neat copy (and, of course, be sure

You may
even want to duplicate your work in case the teacher loses it (unlikely)
or doesn't give it back in time to use it for studying for an exam (this
should only happen in rare circumstances, usually just before an exam
(when the teacher has a lot of things to do),

7.1.  Don't Study for Exams!</h3>

That's right:  You shouldn't study <i>only</i> for exams.  And you shouldn't
study <i>for the sake of</i> exams.
</p><p>
You should "study for learning and understanding":

But in case you do want to study for that exam, here are some
suggestions:
<a name="examtime">
</a></p><h3><a name="examtime">7.2.  Manage Your Time</a></h3><a name="examtime">
<p>
The first rule is:  <b>Don't cram!</b>
</p></a><ul><a name="examtime">
</a><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/theargylesweater/2011/08/11" target="_blank" title="Argyle Sweater">

</a><p><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/theargylesweater/2011/08/11" target="_blank" title="Argyle Sweater">
</a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#time">Earlier</a>, I discussed managing your time.  When
you have exams, time management becomes even more crucial.
</p><p>
Begin studying about 1 week before the exam.  
</p><ul><li>Spend at least an hour each
night (or day) studying for the exam in the manner described below.  
</li><li>Try to
spend the entire night (and/or day) before the exam studying for it.  
</li><li>Of
course, if you have two exams on the same day, you'll have to split the
time in half.
</li></ul>

<p>
For final exams, try to spend as much time as possible studying.  
</p><ul><li>Do not
be tempted, by any free time that you have during exam week, to do anything
other than studying.  
<ul><li>
(If you must take some time to relax, do it
<i>after</i> you've done all your studying for the day.)  
</li></ul>
</li><li>
If you have
<i>E</i> exams and <i>D</i> days to study for them, spend roughly
<i>D</i>/<i>E</i> days studying for each exam.  
<ul><li>(E.g., if you have 4 exams
and 5 days to study for them, spend a little more than 1 day (1.25 days to
be exact) studying for each exam.)
</li></ul>

</li><li>
If you have some free days, then some exams, then some more free days,
then some more exams, etc., plan your studying so that you'll spend
approximately the same amount of time studying for each exam, making sure
that the night (or day) just before an exam is spent studying for it.
<ul><li>
E.g., suppose you have 2 free days to study before exam&nbsp;#1, then one more
free day before exams&nbsp;#2 and&nbsp;#3.
</li><li>
Think of each day as having 3 parts:  morning, afternoon, and evening.
</li><li>
Let's assume that each exam is in only one of these parts (i.e., it's not
so long that it extends through 2 of them). 
</li><li>
 Then you might divide your
studying time as shown in the chart below.
</li><li>
 Note that you
should <i>not</i> delay studying for exam&nbsp;#3 until after exam&nbsp;#2! Start
studying for all exams right away.

<a name="chart">
<ul>
<table>
<tbody><tr> <th>DAY</th> <th>PART OF DAY</th> <th>WHAT TO DO</th> </tr>

Moreover, you should <i>distribute</i> your studying, not "mass" it all
together: 
</a><ul><a name="chart"></a><li><a name="chart">
"set aside blocks of time throughout each week to study the
content for each class"; "massed practive leads to quick learning and
quick forgetting, whereas interleaved practice slows learning but leads
to much greater retention" (Dunlosky, John (2013),

<h3>
7.3. How <i>Not</i> to Study</h3>
Believe it or not,
<b>re-reading your textbook has "little or no benefit" when you are
studying for a test.</b> (Callender &amp; McDaniel 2009;
see also
John Dunlosky,
</a><a href="http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall2013/Dunlosky.pdf" target="_blank">"Strengthening the Student Toolbox:  Study Strategies to
Boost Learning"</a>, 
<a href="https://www.aft.org/newspubs/periodicals/ae/" target="_blank"><i>American Educator</i></a> 37(3) (Fall 2013):
12–21.)
<p>
Most students don't realize this, because they have an "illusion of
competence" (that is, you think you know the material better than you
really do) when they re-read notes and textbooks
(Karpicke&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;2009;
Belluck 2011),
especially when
re-reading <i>passively</i> instead of
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#active">
<i>actively</i></a>.
</p><p>
One method of studying that is better than passive re-reading is the
<b>"read-recite-review"</b> ("3R") method:  "Read the text, set the text aside
and recite out loud all that [you can] remember, and then read the text
a second time" (McDaniel&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;2009).
</p><p>
More importantly,
<b>you learn better and remember more from repeated testing</b>
(from both in-class quizzes and from self-testing at home)
than from repeated reading (Karpicke&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;2009).  
(So when your instructor gives you lots
of quizzes or tells you to memorize basic facts, don't complain!  That's
the best way to learn and to remember what you learn.)
</p><p>
The next few sections give you some suggestions on how to do this.

<a name="outline">
</a></p><h3><a name="outline">7.4. Make a Study Outline</a></h3><a name="outline">
Use your recopied class notes, together with your highlighted text and
notebook, to make an outline of the material.  
</a><ul><a name="outline"><li>Try to put as much as
possible onto the front sides of only&nbsp;1 or 2&nbsp;sheets of paper (like those
plasticized crib sheets that are often sold in college bookstores).  
</li><li>Then
do all your studying from these.  
</li></a><li><a name="outline">(You could even combine this outline
with </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#flash">"flash cards"</a>.)

</p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="samples">7.5.  Write Sample Essays &amp; Do Sample Problems</a></h3><a name="samples">
For subjects in which you will be expected to write essays, either
"psych out" the teacher and make up some plausible essay questions, or
get copies of old exams that have real essay questions on them.  
</a><ul><a name="samples"></a><li><a name="samples"><b>Then
</b></a><b><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#writing">write sample essays</a>.</b>
<ul><li>
Although the essay
questions that you find or make up may not be the actual ones on your
exam, you will probably find that much of what you wrote in your sample
essays by way of preparation
for the exam can be recycled for the actual exam.  
</li><li>You will then be in the
advantageous position during the exam of not having to <i>create</i> an essay
answer from scratch but being able to merely <i>recall</i>
the main ideas from a
sample that you have already written as part of your studying.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>


<p>
For subjects in which you will have to solve problems or write proofs,
solve lots of sample problems from your text or from other texts.
</p><ul><li>
(<a href="https://www.mhprofessional.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=schaum%27s+outline" target="_blank">
Schaum's Outline Series</a>
(<a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/" target="_blank">McGraw-Hill</a>)
books are usually quite good in this regard).
</li><li>
How will you know if your answers are correct?  
<ul><li>The best way is to form a
study group of 2&nbsp;or more fellow students:  
<ul><li>Solve the same problems and
compare answers.  
</li><li>
If your answers agree, they're probably correct; if not,
go to your Teaching Assistant (TA) or teacher.  
</li><li>
As with <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#slow">slow reading</a>,
it's always better when asking for help from a teacher to have a specific
problem or question to ask.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<a name="flash">
<h3>7.6.  Make "Flash Cards"</h3>
For any subject, you  can make a set of "flash cards".  
</a><ul><a name="flash"><li>
But I suggest
using regular 8&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;x&nbsp;11" paper, not index cards.  
</li><li>
Divide each page in
half, vertically.  
</li><li>
On the left, write a "question" that requires an
"answer", e.g., the name of a theorem, a term to be defined, the
statement of a theorem, etc.  
</li></a><li><a name="flash">
On the right, write the answer, e.g., the
statement of the theorem named on the left, the definition of the term on
the left, the proof of the theorem stated on the left, etc.  
</a><ul><a name="flash"></a><li><a name="flash">(This could
even be your </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#outline">study outline</a>.)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>
Then <i>memorize</i> the questions and answers—<i>but</i> do <i>not</i>
simply recite them by heart.  
</p><ul><li>
Instead, <i>write down</i> the answers:
<ul><li>
Cover the right-hand side (the answers) with a blank sheet of paper, and
<i>write down</i> the answers.  
</li><li>
When you finish a page, check your work
and repeat <i>writing</i> the answers to the questions you missed
until you get them all correct.  
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>
Recent psychological evidence suggests that people learn better by
making mistakes than by getting everything correct.  So don't worry
about getting some answers wrong!  (See Roediger III, Henry&nbsp;L.;
&amp; Finn, Bridgid (2010),
<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=getting-it-wrong" target="_blank">
"The Pluses of Getting It Wrong"</a>,
<i>Scientific American Mind</i> 21(1) (March/April): 39–41.

</p><p>
Why
write, and not merely recite?  
</p><ul><li>
Because you will have to <i>write</i> the
answers on the actual test, so get used to writing them now.  
</li><li>
(Of course, if
it's going to be an oral exam, reciting may be better than writing.  
</li><li>Still,
one tends to skip details when reciting, especially if you recite
silently to yourself, but if you <i>write</i> the answers and
have a good memory, then, during an oral exam, you can "read" the
answers with your mind's eye.)
</li></ul>

<p>
Moreover, there is evidence that the kind of "self-testing" that you can
do with this technique is one of the best ways to study:  "taking
practice tests (versus merely rereading the material to be learned) can
substantially boost student learning", according to
John Dunlosky,
<a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1021069.pdf" target="_blank">"Strengthening the Student Toolbox:  Study Strategies to
Boost Learning"</a>, 
<a href="https://www.aft.org/newspubs/periodicals/ae/" target="_blank"><i>American Educator</i></a> 37(3) (Fall 2013):
12–21.

<a name="stop">
</a></p><h3><a name="stop">7.7.  Stop Studying When You Feel Confident</a></h3><a name="stop">
How do you know when you've studied enough?  
<ul><li>It's
<i>not</i> when you're tired of
studying!  
</li><li>And it's <i>not</i> when you've gone through the material
one time!  
</li><li>You should <b>stop only
when you get to the point that you feel confident
and ready for whatever will be on the exam</b>
&nbsp;—&nbsp;
when you're actually eager to
see the exam to find out if you guessed its contents correctly.

border="0" alt="Peanuts" /></a>-->
</ul>
For an essay question, do a "mind dump":  
<ul><li>Write down, on
scrap paper, brief reminders (keywords) of everything that you remember
about the topic of the question.  
</li><li>Then
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#makeoutline">develop an outline</a> of your answer.
</li><li>
Then write the essay.  (With luck, much of the essay can be "copied from

<p>
For an exam with problems to solve or proofs to write, do the easy ones
first.

</p><p>
When you are all done, review your answers carefully.

</p><p>
And, when all of your exams are over, take heed…&nbsp;:-)

<a name="choosetopic">
<h3>9.1.   Choose Topic Carefully</h3>
Choose your topic wisely.  
</a></li><li><a name="choosetopic">Avoid the two extremes of a topic that is so
broad or well-known that there are too many sources of information and a
topic that is so narrow or little-known that there is a paucity of
information.  
</a></li><li><a name="choosetopic">If you are having trouble choosing a topic, talk to your
teacher.

</a><a name="research">
<h3>9.2.  Do Research</h3>
Once you have a topic and have found appropriate resource materials,
</a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#readactively">read
them slowly and actively</a>, and be sure to 
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#notebook">keep a  notebook</a>.
</li><li>
I won't repeat the details of those suggestions here, with one exception:
Be sure to carefully record your sources and the page numbers of any
quotations, so that you can include them in your final report.

<a name="makeoutline">
<h3>9.3.  Make an Outline</h3>
This stage may require several iterations.  
</a></li><li><a name="makeoutline">You should make an
outline and sort your notes into categories that correspond to the main
sections of your outline.  
</a></li><li><a name="makeoutline">But which of these should you do
first?  It doesn't matter.
<ul><li>
You may have a clear outline in mind, in which case, sorting your notes
will be relatively straightforward (though  you may find that some notes
don't quite fit or that some suggest a section that you hadn't initially
thought of).  
</li><li>Or you may need to sort your notes
first, to see which ones go together, and <i>then</i> create an outline
based on the categories you discover during the sorting process.
</li></ul>

<p>
How do you make an outline?  The suggestions that follow work for almost
anything you have to write. 

</p></a></li><li><a name="makeoutline">First, write down a handful of main themes
that you want to discuss (these will be the categories that you sorted
your notes into); describe each using only a few keywords.  
</a></li><li><a name="makeoutline">Decide
in
what order you want to write about them, and then—on a blank piece of
paper—put each at the head of a column, something like this:
<ul>
<u>intro</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>topic1</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>topic2</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>topic3</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>conclusion</u>
</ul>
<p>
These will be the main sections of your paper.  In addition,
you should always have an
introductory section and a conclusion or summary section.

</p></a></li><li><a name="makeoutline">
Next, in each column, write down the main ideas that you want to include,
again ordering them and using just a few keywords.  
</a><ul><a name="makeoutline"><li>These will be your
subsections.  
</li></a><li><a name="makeoutline">
Under each of these, put the </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#ident">identifying numbers</a>
of the items in your
notes that you want to include in each subsection.  
<ul><li>
(You may find that you
will need to repeat this process recursively for subsubsections, etc. 
</li><li> If
so, do this when you're ready to write that subsection, not at the
beginning.  
</li><li>This kind of process is called "top-down design and stepwise
refinement".)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<!--
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<a name="write">
<h3>9.4. Write, Using Your Outline</h3>
</a><ul><a name="write">
</a><a href="http://oceanflynn.wordpress.com/2007/04/21/how-can-i-tell-what-i-think-until-i-see-what-i-say/" target="_blank">
"How can I tell what I think until I see what I say?"</a>
</ul>
<p>
Once you've got your outline, start writing, using your outline and notes
as a guide.  
</p></li><li>Don't spend too much time editing what you write at this
stage.  Just write.  
</li><li>(I should note that some people prefer
<a href="http://wiki.ehow.com/Freewrite" target="_blank">
"free writing"
</a>, in which you <i>don't</i> spend any time preparing an outline
before you write.  If that works for you, go for it.)

<p>
By the way, it's always helpful for keeping track of where
you are in your outline, both to you as writer and
to your reader, to give each section and subsection a name, as I have done
in this document.


<a name="edit">
</a></p><h3><a name="edit">9.5. Edit</a></h3><a name="edit">
After you've written your first draft, re-read what you wrote, using the
</a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#readactively">method of slow and active reading</a>, and revise
(or "edit") what you wrote.  
</li><li>
Then ask a friend to read it and give you
feedback.  
</li><li>
Then revise again, and
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtowrite.html" target="_blank">prepare the final version</a>.

<p>
Right about now, you're probably asking yourself whether you really
have to do <i>all</i> of this.  It seems like an awful lot of work.
</p><ul>
<a href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2012/04/02" target="_blank">
<img src="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/HOWTOSTUDY/ch20120402.gif">
</a>
</ul>
<p>
Well, of
course, you don't have to do all of it at once.  Try various of these
suggestions to see what works for you. Try some variations that may better
fit your learning style or personal circumstances. But, in the long run,
there's no quick and easy road to studying.  It <i>is</i> hard work and
<i>should</i> take a lot of time.  
</p><p>
So, <i>do</i> you really have to do all
of this?  Yes (or things very much like them)—<i>if</i> you want to
really learn the material (and get good grades).

</ul>
<hr><p>
Finally, for what it's worth, here are some comments from students and
others who
have tried some of these methods:
</p><ul>
<li>
"... this is the way you taught me to study years ago and it finally
paid off last year!" (a college sophomore who went from high-school
grades in the 70s to a 3.00 average in college)
</li><li>
"Thank you for the guide.  It has some great tips!  I'm surprised that I
use some of the techniques myself.  (E.g., I abbrev. and cndnse my
notes.) I have one
suggestion, though: when reviewing for a test/exam, only study what you
aren't
familiar with. It reduces studying time and is helpful if you're a last
minute
person like me. :) Well, that may not work for you, but who knows?"
</li><li>
"... encourage some study groups! Not 5 in a group, 'cause
that will be a crowd, but study environment is as important as studying
itself; change of environments is sometimes good to make you study
better.
Thank you for your helpful hints, and it does help me to notice some of
my 
weaknesses in studying."
</li><li>
"I'd like to pass along a bit of technique that worked well for 
me in just about all my courses.  Thinking about the subject 
matter—often catalyzed by discussion with others—before delving into 
it was my key to success.  After giving it some thought, I wrote out a 
series of logical, fundamental questions which I sought to answer that 
would clarify the subject matter.  You know, make it perspicuous.  I 
read/listened/watched with those questions in mind, noting as well other 
points an author/instructor was attempting to make.  If my questions 
(which were fundamental to a clear understanding) went unanswered, I 
would seek the answers through other written, visual, or aural 
materials.  Visiting an instructor during office hours or asking the 
question in class was often most helpful.  Once I had the basics well in 
mind, building on them was easy and fun.  Studying and learning in this 
way also helped me to prepare for exams.  Clearly, if I could think of a 
question, there was a good chance one writing an exam might think of it 
too.  The technique is not a panacea for all study-related problems; 
however, it does set forth a system to build upon in an individualized way.
I also suggest a 
visit to the children's section of the library when revisiting or 
attempting to master the basics of certain things.  Books written at 
that level, though often oversimplified, present ideas and concepts in
a 
clear and easily understandable form usually lacking in primers
written 
for adults.  There's no substitute for laying a good foundation on 
which to build additional knowledge." — <a href="mailto:magames@earthlink.net">Marc L. Ames</a>
</li><li>
"I would like to thank you for the effort made doing this guide....
But there is one thing I would like to suggest for ... future
"upgrades" of this
 text: I think you have to mention that it is important to be in good
physical condition as well, I mean: sleep 8 hours a day, eat well, ....
What I would like to point is that, in my opinion, it would be good to tell
students that they have to be in their best condition to study/take an
exam/work."

E.U.I.T.I.O student (Computer Engineering),

</li><li>
"I would like to thank you very much for the "How to Study" document I
discovered on the net. It is very informative, and it will help me with
my day
to day activities. I only wish I had it while I was in high school!"
—<a href="mailto:Joseph.DiLillo@cn.ca">Joseph Di Lillo</a>,

"Thanks so much for the great study guide. I am a high school counselor,
and
we have been teaching a freshmen study skills class for two years....
Your ideas have really inspired me, and there are many
of
the same theories that we have been presenting, but in a <i>new</i> way! Thanks
for
the great tips!"

Those who might check their phone’s map when lost are instead being encouraged to ask for directions.</p><figure id="2ef2191c-d42e-4550-a5d0-f35019fec2d7" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Vincent Paul-Petit, the mayor of Seine-Port, who drove the ban." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156c3568dfb1c9bb7b2c7b2de43f7d58412da499/1636_525_4114_4116/master/4114.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445.2163344676714" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Vincent Paul-Petit, the mayor of Seine-Port, who drove the ban.</span> Photograph: Magali Delporte/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The village has also approved a charter for families on children’s use of screens: no screens of any kind in the morning, no screens in bedrooms, no screens before bed or during meals. If parents of teenagers sign a written agreement not to give their child a smartphone before the age of 15, the town hall will provide the child with an old-fashioned handset for calls only.</p><p>“I’m totally in favour of this,” said Ludivine, 34, who has two children aged one and four. “Some say it’s an attack on freedoms but I don’t think so. It’s about raising awareness of the impact of phones in our lives.</p><p>“My one-year-old has zero screens. My four-year-old has no screens on a school day, and only ever for a short moment while the youngest is napping. A lot of children and adults are intoxicated by screens – even babies in pushchairs scroll phones. This is about replacing that with more human contact. Before I had children, my TV was always on in the background; now I never switch it on.”</p><p>A total of 277 people turned out to vote – about 20% of the electoral register – with 54% in favour of the charter. The mayor, Vincent Paul-Petit, of the rightwing party Les Républicains, will now write a municipal decree on smartphone use, the first of its kind in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/france" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">France</a>. It is not enforceable by police – officers could not stop or fine people scrolling in the street because there is no national law against smartphones – but the mayor describes it as an incitement to stop scrolling and guidance for limiting phone use. Shopkeepers are being urged to put up stickers in windows and gently ask people to stop scrolling.</p><figure id="cc6271a9-92d8-43a1-8bb4-d911b10058f3" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Children walk by signs discouraging smartphone use outside the village school." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfcfb332c3eba231704f6e22e3f52ff33663eff/0_402_5949_3571/master/5949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.11968398050095" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Children walk by signs discouraging smartphone use outside the village school.</span> Photograph: Magali Delporte/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>In the village bar, the restaurant manager Angélique da Silva said she was unlikely to ask customers to stop scrolling but she saw its purpose. “It’s an interesting idea for children,” she said. “But the younger generation don’t approve of this because if you take their phone away, they have nothing.

My daughter is a footballer and prefers to be outside. It’s about what alternative activities we can provide.”</p><p>Young people in the village complained there were not enough facilities for teenagers who had little to amuse them but their phones.

        <tr>
    <td>
        <p dir="auto">This is an attempt to articulate the Svelte <em>philosophy</em> — our bedrock principles, that guide our design decisions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Edit: for visitors from Hacker News, and anyone else who is curious, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eswNQiq4T2w&amp;t=5211s" rel="nofollow">here is the video</a> that this list came out of</em></p>
<h2 dir="auto">The web matters</h2>
<p dir="auto">We work on Svelte because we believe that the web is a critically important technology, and that its continued survival is not guaranteed.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Optimise for vibes</h2>
<p dir="auto">People use Svelte because they <em>like</em> Svelte. They like it because it aligns with their aesthetic sensibilities.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of striving to be the fastest or smallest or whateverest, we explicitly aim to be the framework with the best vibes.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Don't optimise for adoption</h2>
<p dir="auto">We're not trying to be the most popular framework, we're trying to be the best framework. Sometimes that means making choices that we believe in but that go against the grain of web development trends.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">HTML, The Mother Language</h2>
<p dir="auto">HTML is a really good language for describing UI. Svelte augments HTML in a way that makes it a really good language for describing <em>interactive</em> UI.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most frameworks are JS-centric, because JS is the most powerful language. But then they find themselves jumping through hoops to make it feel like you're writing HTML. We think both options are valid, but the HTML-first approach ends up feeling more natural.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Embrace progress</h2>
<p dir="auto">There is a tendency in the web developer community towards a harmful form of pessimistic nostalgia — the idea that things were better in the prelapsarian age before bundlers, TypeScript, client-side routing and other trappings of modernity.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is nonsense. As a community our default position is one of optimism about technology — the platform is getting better, our tools are getting better, our devices are getting better, and if we embrace that fact we can make better stuff.</p>
<p dir="auto">And when other frameworks introduce new ideas like signals or server components, we look at them with interest and jealousy, and try to work out how we can incorporate good ideas, instead of resting on our laurels. There is always room for improvement.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Numbers lie</h2>
<p dir="auto">Lighthouse has broken the brains of a generation of web developers. We have replaced good judgment with subservience to metrics that were only ever intended to be used as a diagnostic tool.</p>
<p dir="auto">Goodhart's Law states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">and this is very true in web development. Numerical rigour is good, and we pay attention to the various numbers, but when designing Svelte we think qualitatively, not quantitatively.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Magical, not magic</h2>
<p dir="auto">There's a subtle line between something feeling <em>magical</em>, and something feeling like <em>magic</em>. We want Svelte to feel magical — we want you to feel like a wizard when you're writing Svelte code. Historically I think Svelte went too far into magic territory, where it's not 100% clear why things work a certain way, and that's something that we're rectifying with Svelte 5.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Dream big</h2>
<p dir="auto">'Choose the right tool for the job' is sensible but boring advice.</p>
<p dir="auto">It makes us small in our ambitions. I want us to dream bigger. I don't want to feel like my tools can't handle evolving requirements, or that if I want to dabble in a new field I need to learn an entirely new way of working first.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even if it turns out to be unachievable, I find it valuable to ask the question 'what would it take for SvelteKit to be the best framework for <em>any</em> app?', whether it's purely static content, or a realtime multiplayer app, or an offline-first productivity app, or even something built for an augmented reality headset.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">No-one cares</h2>
<p dir="auto">Most people do not care about frameworks. They just want to build something cool, and Svelte is for those people too.</p>
<p dir="auto">So when we design things we need to think about the people who haven't read the docs in a while, if at all, and don't care about things like fine-grained rendering or configuring their build tool. This means that things need to be intuitive, that we shouldn't need to worry about manual optimisations like memoisation, that we should have as few APIs as possible, and that things need to be discoverable — for example you should be able to hover over a rune and get a link to comprehensive documentation.</p>
<p dir="auto">This also informs our approach to documentation and tutorials — it should be possible to build what you want by just learning the concepts that you need, and worrying about the other stuff for another day.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Design by consensus</h2>
<p dir="auto">Svelte is a community-driven and consensus-led project. It's important that the community — that's you — has a stake in the project's future. Many of Svelte's best ideas originated outside the core team.</p>
<p dir="auto">When we introduce new plans, we want to communicate them openly and provide everyone with good opportunities to offer their feedback.</p>
<p dir="auto">Those of us who work on the project every day have a vision for what kind of thing we want it to be, but we don't want to foist that vision on people against their will. And so while we can't get unanimous agreement on every change, we can at least say that dissenting voices have been heard and considered.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How much would you pay a broker for a $1,100-a-month apartment if you knew the rent wouldn’t be jacked up year after year?</p><p>A broker in Queens was offering apartment hunters the deal of a lifetime: a one-bedroom, rent-stabilized unit in Flushing, well below market rate for the area. The only catch was a $15,000 broker fee to secure the unit. Under rent stabilization, modest annual increases are <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-board-votes-to-increase-rents-on-1-million-rent-stabilized-units-by-3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">set by a city panel</a>, shielding tenants from dramatic hikes.</p><p>That was the predicament facing 27-year-old Christian Garbutt while he was searching for an apartment last month, he told Gothamist. The apartment seemed great, but he couldn’t afford the fee — nor did he want to pay it.</p><p>But the $15,000 broker fee levied by Miguel Silva, a broker with the New York City branch of the real estate company Keller Williams, was too high for even his employers. In response to questions from Gothamist, they said they are returning some of the money to the tenant who landed the apartment.</p><p>Broker fees are standard procedure in the city’s highly competitive real estate market, even when tenants find the units online and do most of the work themselves. Typical rates range from a month’s rent to a higher percentage of the yearly total.</p><p>But as affordable housing dwindles, broker’s fees are rising along with rents, making moves more difficult and dependent on upfront cash, in a sector where laws and regulations remain cloudy.</p><p>Last month, Gov. Kathy Hochul criticized “<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-brokers-charging-exorbitant-fees-forced-to-pay-260k-in-penalties" rel="noopener" target="_blank">excessive</a>” fees when she announced a $260,000 penalty against a brokerage firm found to be demanding $20,000 from prospective tenants trying to secure a rent-stabilized apartment, a rare rebuke of the practice.</p><p>The New York Department of State, which licenses brokers, said in an email that it determines that fees are too high when they exceed “industry norms and standards” and do not relate to actual services.</p><p>The rules are murky, and no laws explicitly cap broker’s fees or define the difference between reasonable costs and extortion — similar to a once-common arrangement known as “<a href="https://www.brickunderground.com/blog/2015/11/what_is_key_money" rel="noopener" target="_blank">key money</a>.”</p><h4><b>‘That’s insane’</b></h4><p>Garbutt said he was looking for an apartment in Queens when he came across a place in Flushing priced at $1,450 a month and advertised as a “newly renovated rent-stabilized” one-bedroom on the listings website StreetEasy. He said he toured the unit and “fell in love with it,” but soon found out there was a catch: The broker was asking for an $8,000 fee.</p><p>Garbutt said he decided to pass on the place because the upfront cost would have wiped out his savings. He said he found another one-bedroom in the same building — this one listed online at $1,100 a month — and again texted the broker.</p><p>According to text messages reviewed by Gothamist, the broker warned “the fee is also high. It’s much higher than the other one.” He wanted $15,000.</p><p>Garbutt said he was “shocked” by the figure and could not afford it. He said he stopped responding, even after the broker offered to negotiate the fee and updated the listing to $1,800 a month.</p><p>“That’s insane," Garbutt said of the fee. "That’s totally not fair. Normal New Yorkers, a lot of people, don't have that type of money saved up.”</p><p>He said he’s still looking for a place.</p><p>Silva, the broker, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Keller Williams said it would return any money over 15% of the annual rent to the tenant who got the apartment.</p><p>"Although there are no standard or typical or legal caps on broker fees, Keller Williams NYC adheres to real property law and its guidance in the commission fees that are charged to reasonably relate to legitimate services provided to renters by our agents and firm,” said Richard Amato, an operating principal at the firm.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about broker’s fees and what to do if you think you’re being overcharged.</p><h4><b>What are the upfront costs for renting an apartment?</b></h4><p>Renting an apartment in New York City is hard. The broker’s fee, a uniquely New York inconvenience that has <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/state/2022/09/09/broker-fees-nyc-nj-renters/65474656007/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spread</a> to a <a href="https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2020/02/07/broker-fees-for-nyc-rentals-mystified-outsiders-heres-how-other-us-cities-do-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">few other places</a>, can make it even harder.</p><p>Along with the first month’s rent, security deposit and moving expenses, apartment hunters in the five boroughs typically have to fork over even more money to a middleman — a broker — usually hired by a landlord to list and show apartments.</p><p>Brokers typically charge a one-time fee of around 8% to 15% of the annual rent, or roughly $5,400 on a $3,000-a-month apartment.</p><p>In most cases, there is no way of getting around it, said Allia Mohamed, CEO of listings and landlord review website openigloo.</p><p>“It’s not really fair, but if you want to get that specific apartment you have to be prepared to pay up,” Mohamed said.</p><h4><b>What is a broker anyway?</b></h4><p>A real estate broker is a person who facilitates the sale or rental of a property, typically for a fee.</p><p>Real estate brokers in the Empire State <a href="https://dos.ny.gov/real-estate-broker" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are regulated by the New York Department of State</a>, which grants them a license if they meet the requirements and pass an exam.</p><p>Normally, people hire brokers to survey the market and find prospective options to buy or rent a place.</p><p>But in New York City, it's more common for landlords to hire the brokers to list the apartments on StreetEasy, Trulia and other platforms that charge a fee, and arrange visits with applicants. It’s then left to tenants to pay their commission.</p><h4><b>How much is too much?</b></h4><p>There’s a limit to what’s considered reasonable, according to industry regulators and lawmakers. Even many brokers agree that some fees are truly exorbitant. But where brokers cross the line isn’t clearly spelled out.</p><p>Regulators from the Department of State didn’t respond to a question about what they consider the industry standard for New York City broker fees. Industry groups generally agree that 15% of the annual rent is the norm.</p><p>Yet brokers know that someone with disposable income may be willing to pony up for a rent-stabilized apartment, since they could save money down the road. That’s the argument Garbutt said his broker made.</p><p>“He said it’s a lot of money, but you’re going to see it in the long run,” Garbutt recalled.</p><p>Still, that arrangement locks out the vast majority of New Yorkers who can only dream of paying that kind of fee.</p><p>The median household income in New York City is around $76,600, <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to the U.S. Census Bureau</a>. Median rents are about $4,100 in Manhattan and $2,500 in Queens, according to the latest <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/data-dashboard/[object%20Object]?agg=Median&amp;metric=Asking%20Rent&amp;type=Rentals&amp;bedrooms=One%20Bedroom&amp;property=Any%20Property%20Type&amp;minDate=2010-01-01&amp;maxDate=2024-01-01&amp;area=Flatiron,Brooklyn%20Heights" rel="noopener" target="_blank">StreetEasy review of listings</a>. And most New Yorkers are considered rent-burdened, as they pay more than 30% of their income on rent, <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/1-in-3-nyc-tenants-spend-half-their-income-on-rent-as-affordability-crisis-deepens" rel="noopener" target="_blank">city housing data</a> shows.</p><p>For a $3,000-a-month apartment, that means you would need $11,400 upfront to cover the security deposit, first month of rent and 15% broker’s fee.</p><p>If you suspect you’re being overcharged, you can file a complaint <a href="https://dos.ny.gov/preliminary-statement-complaint-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with the Department of State.</a></p><h4><b>So is anyone doing anything about these fees?</b></h4><p>Past efforts to limit the fees have all failed.</p><p>The Real Estate Board of New York, or REBNY, successfully sued to <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/those-hefty-brokers-fees-are-returning-following-state-judges-ruling" rel="noopener" target="_blank">end a brief cap on broker’s fees for tenants</a>, based on an interpretation of <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-real-estate-brokers-are-already-exploiting-a-perceived-loophole-in-new-rent-laws" rel="noopener" target="_blank">state rent laws</a> enacted in 2019.</p><p>A City Council <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/city-council-proposals-would-slash-obscene-brokers-fees-and-limit-security-deposits" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bill limiting broker’s fees</a> to one month’s rent also died in 2019 amid <a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2019/6/28/18761629/nyc-broker-fee-reform-bill-city-council-real-estate" rel="noopener" target="_blank">opposition from the real estate industry</a>.</p><p>The latest attempt? A <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-broker-fees-are-skyrocketing-the-city-council-is-trying-to-put-the-fees-on-landlords" rel="noopener" target="_blank">City Council bill</a> that would require whoever hired the broker — such as the landlord, property manager or tenant — to cover the cost.</p><p>“I don't think anyone should be forced to pay a fee to someone who they never hired,” said Councilmember Chi Ossé of Brooklyn, who introduced the measure. “It's kind of replicating how we do transactions in every other industry within the city.”</p><p>REBNY and other critics of the bill say it will lead to higher rents on non-rent-stabilized apartments because landlords will spread the cost across the monthly rent payments for as long as the tenant lives there, instead of a one-time fee. Owners of rent-stabilized units would have to eat the cost.</p><p>“This bill would make the process of renting an apartment more costly and challenging for New Yorkers while negatively impacting the livelihood of hardworking agents,” said REBNY spokesperson Christopher Santarelli.</p><p>Veteran broker <a href="https://sammoritz.medium.com/thoughts-on-broker-fees-in-nyc-from-a-new-york-city-real-estate-agent-c7ef0802a68" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sam Moritz</a> agreed.</p><p>“The tenant paying the broker fee is what it is,” he said. “If you eliminate the tenant-paid broker fee for apartments, rents are going to increase.”</p><p>Nikki Thomas, a broker and real estate agent for the Corcoran Group, declined to take a position on the legislation but said nixing the fee could be good business for property owners.</p><p>Thomas said she often encourages landlords to pay her commission and then add the price to the rent, since people get alienated by “junk fees.”</p><p>“I usually tell them to adjust the rent to factor that in, because I know people psychologically don’t like additional upfront costs,” she said. “You’re starting off with a happier tenant.”</p><h4><b>So what are you paying for exactly?</b></h4><p>Convenience — usually for the landlord — said Mohamed, the openigloo executive.</p><p>The brokers advertise the apartments, arrange showings and put together applications for the property owner, she said.</p><p>“When the landlord is hiring the broker, they’re the ones benefiting from the headache the broker is taking off their shoulders,” Mohamed said. “They definitely put in a ton of work in helping the landlord sift through applicants and prepare that space.”</p><p>Moritz, the longtime broker, said the services are especially important when the landlord lives outside the city or has a busy schedule that prevents them from continuously showing the apartment.</p><p>“They want to hire a professional, someone who does this full time and closes deals efficiently and professionally,” he said.</p><p>The brokers also have to cover some costs. Posting the apartment on StreetEasy costs $7 a day, or more than $200 a month, for example.</p><p>Moritz said he charges tenants the equivalent of one month’s rent so that he can get apartments leased up as quickly as possible. He said he figures he needs to earn about $6,500 a month to cover his own rent and expenses in Bushwick, which equates to at least three or four broker fees a month, he said.</p><p>He criticized brokers who charge exorbitant fees and said they are taking advantage of tenants and owners.</p><p>“I think that is a little greedy because this is the landlord’s asset,” Moritz said. “I personally think that if a landlord gives me a listing, then I am working for the landlord.”</p><p>Plenty of tenants also end up hiring brokers to help them find an apartment, especially if they have disposable income, a busy schedule or are moving to New York City from somewhere else.</p><p>“A broker can accomplish in a few days what might take someone several weeks,” Thomas of the Corcoran Group said. “Like so many things, you can do it on your own, but is it actually worth it?”</p></div></div>]]></description>

                      <p>Two years ago, union organizer Magda Malinowska was fired from her job at an Amazon warehouse near Poznań, in western Poland. Her sacking came as retaliation for her efforts to speak out against poor working conditions — a conflict catalyzed by the September 2021 death of forty-nine-year-old Dariusz Dziamski, a colleague of hers who died on the shop floor. Fast forward to October 2023, and a Polish court has ruled that Amazon fired Malinowska illegally.</p>
<p>The ruling provides a small step toward justice for Malinowska, albeit only after a two-year delay, and a period in which many aspects of Amazon workers’ rights have worsened. In an interview, Malinowska spoke to <i>Jacobin</i>’s Caspar Shaller about Amazon’s inhumane treatment of staff, its violation of basic union rights, and workers’ efforts to stand up against corporate tyranny.</p>

<p>In Poland, however, it is possible to win the case, but without reinstatement. Some judges believe that if there is a major conflict between the trade unionists and the company it will be better this way. I was afraid that I would win the case but would not be reinstated — all the more so because the judge called more witnesses and delved deeply into the case and the relationship between the union and Amazon. The HR employees who fired me were questioned twice. Finally, the judge stated that my dismissal could have been caused by my activity. What I was accused of in terminating the contract was not proven during the case. Amazon didn’t manage to provide any evidence to support their position.</p>

                      Magda Malinowska
                </span></p><p>Dariusz had all the signs of experiencing a heart attack, but apparently that was not the medical reason. His wife told me his heart was broken. That’s why this was such an important case for us. Dariusz worked so hard. His job used to be done by a few people during a shift, but then they made him do all that work alone, pushing around trolleys with heavy boxes.</p>
<p>Dariusz had been complaining that his job was too exhausting for him and he wanted a different task. But they wouldn’t give him another position. They did the exact opposite: they reduced the number of people working the same job, so his work got even more exhausting.</p>
<p>Before Dariusz died, we’d long been trying to get Amazon to carefully examine energy expenditure and how hard the work we do is, including Dariusz’s. The company is required to do so by law. However, Amazon only roughly estimates how much energy workers put in, and doesn’t use an appropriate method to calculate it. A few years ago, we managed to persuade the Labor Inspectorate and CIOP (Central Institute for Labor Protection) to investigate the cases of several employees; some of them were putting in up to twice as much as the allowed levels.</p>
<p>We have court judgments that say that Amazon does not examine this properly. But this is dangerous, especially as each of us has some health issues, and some of us have been doing hard physical work for years. After Dariusz’s death, I told the media that [this past dispute] was probably the real reason for my dismissal.</p>
<p>On the Sunday before Dariusz died, he asked the supervisor to transfer him to another department because he was fed up with working too hard. Despite the requests, he continued to work alone at his post for about five hours. The next morning Dariusz collapsed and died on the floor of the warehouse. They didn’t really help him, despite his symptoms. He was told to go through the warehouse — the size of a dozen or so soccer fields — on his own, to go down the stairs to the medical room. When he got there, he died.</p>

                </span></p><p>It’s not like a construction site or a mine, where workers die all the time or have severe accidents. Amazon management actually gets pretty angry when there’s an accident. The work is dangerous in another way: the repetition and the strain get to you. That does affect your body and your health. That’s why we want to be able to do a labor inspection, to see if someone’s health is being affected by their work. And we want to change the definition of a workplace accident. Because if you do a super heavy job for some time and then you get a heart attack, formally it’s not connected to the job.</p>

                      Caspar Shaller
                </span></p><p>Amazon is known for spearheading new types of labor surveillance. How is that connected to this case?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Magda Malinowska
                </span></p><p>One reason for the surveillance is that Amazon is trying to optimize all steps of the work process. They are not the only ones to try out new forms of labor management, but they are very quick at implementing changes. They are constantly implementing new ways of controlling workers’ bodies and movements. You can’t even leave your workstation for more than three minutes. You have scanners and cameras everywhere checking on your every movement.</p>
<p>So, surveillance is really the big issue at Amazon. Through all this, they force you to do very simple movements in a very repetitive way. Because they broke down the labor process into these simple movements, they can easily exchange workers, they don’t need experienced workers, they can just train new ones to do these simple movements. But having to do the same movements over and over and faster and faster is totally destroying our bodies.</p>

              </div>
          
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Caspar Shaller
                </span></p><p>What are you going to do, now that you can go back to the warehouse?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Magda Malinowska
                </span></p><p>Well, for me, this is a completely new situation. I’ve never been fired and then reinstated. It’s going to be interesting what Amazon will do now. And I’m wondering if, after this ruling and the explanation that the judge gave us, they will be willing to change their relationship with us on the union side. That is actually what the judge said: that there is a conflict between labor and employer, but the conflict cannot be an argument to dismiss union members.</p>
<p>Firing all union members would mean there’s no union in the workplace anymore, but Polish law guarantees the right to a union. The juge even said she can see that Amazon’s attitude toward unions is very negative. It’s a global problem with Amazon: they don’t want to recognize unions anywhere. So, I think it was very important that this judge confirms what we’ve been saying, someone who’s not like us — some militant activist, who’s always up for a fight — but a representative of the state.</p>

              </div>

                      Caspar Shaller
                </span></p><p>Do you think this ruling will change anything in the immediate future?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Magda Malinowska
                </span></p><p>Unfortunately, I’m afraid they will not change their policy. They behave like they’re not scared of anything and try to break as many rules and regulations as possible. They’re just smashing everything on their way to making more and more profit. They’re always checking how far they can go, until finally there will be nothing left that can stop them. So this small victory is a step toward stoping them.</p>
<p>Amazon has used Poland as a base from which to attack German unions right next door, either by importing Polish workers as strikebreakers when German warehouses were being picketed or then by simply building warehouses along the German-Polish border to serve the German market and get around German labor laws and unions.</p>

              </div>
          
            <div>

                      Caspar Shaller
                </span></p><p>How can workers cooperate over national lines and stop multinationals from playing workers off each other?</p>

              </div>

                      Magda Malinowska
                </span></p><p>The current situation is amazing for Amazon. There are so many different legal systems, even within Germany for example, different regions have different regulations. So they try to use it against us and to make bigger profits, pay less taxes, and so on. They move orders from one warehouse to another warehouse, if there is slack in one location – or when we’re organizing a blockade, for example for our campaign “Make Amazon Pay.”</p>
<p>When the Polish warehouses were opened, German workers were on strike, and the Amazon moved orders from German warehouses to Polish warehouses, forcing people Polish to work longer shifts. When Polish workers heard about the reason why they had to work longer shifts, they said, hey we don’t want to be scabs, and organized a go-slow. That was the beginning of our cooperation with German workers.</p>

              </div>
          
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Caspar Shaller
                </span></p><p>How has organizing workers made progress over the recent years?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Magda Malinowska
                </span></p><p>Unfortunately, it’s become more difficult to organize. I think people are more scared. After previous actions, some people got fired. And there’s been a shift in company policy. When Amazon started out in Poland, they hired people on permanent contracts. That gave people a feeling of stability and legal protection, which allowed them to fight back.</p>
<p>But now, there are a lot of people who are employed by agencies. The split among the workers is pretty bad. I’ve seen discussions online about how only certain types of workers are allowed to do overtime. Pay is so low that everyone wants to pick up more shifts, so weirdly being allowed to work even more becomes a matter of prestige. So, working overtime isn’t a penalty, it’s a prize. That situation is totally sick.</p>

              </div>
          
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Caspar Shaller
                </span></p><p>What are you doing to change that?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Magda Malinowska
                </span></p><p>Last year, we started a campaign about the firing of shop stewards and union representatives. Indeed, I wasn’t the only one who was sacked, there were others, too. And together with other unions, we organized a huge campaign to change the law. And it was successful: the government changed the law. Since the law came into effect in September it’s basically pointless to fire union officials. It’s still happening illegally, of course, but maybe it changes workers’ mentality a bit to know they have more legal rights. Maybe unions will get a little bit stronger. Or at least there won’t be a repetition of 2021 when so many people were sacked out of the blue.</p>
<p>Recently there was an election and the far-right government <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/10/poland-lewica-left-wing-alliance-opposition-donald-tusk-law-and-justice">lost</a>. So maybe there might be some change in how the state handles these cases. But we are not focused only on the law, we’re also trying to figure out how to strengthen our position in warehouses. And we will continue to educate workers and exchange ideas and experiences among people from my union and others. One important focus will be on inspecting labor standards and how workers can do that themselves. We will try to use health and safety as tool to make working conditions better.</p>

She added, "This is treating people like inventory in a way I've not seen."</p><p>Employee surveillance AI is a rapidly expanding but niche piece of a larger AI market that's exploded in the past year, following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. Generative AI quickly became the buzzy phrase for corporate earnings calls, and some form of the technology is automating tasks in just about every industry, from financial services and biomedical research to logistics, online travel and <a href="https://prod.ucwe.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Final-Web-Version-Report-Harnessing-the-Value-of-Gen-AI.1.pdf" target="_blank">utilities</a>.</p><p>Aware's revenue has jumped 150% per year on average over the past five years, Schumann told CNBC, and its typical customer has about 30,000 employees.

Schumann refers to the trillions of messages sent across workplace communication platforms every year as "the fastest-growing unstructured data set in the world."&nbsp;</p><p>When including other types of content being shared, such as images and videos, Aware's analytics AI analyzes more than 100 million pieces of content every day. In so doing, the technology creates a company social graph, looking at which teams internally talk to each other more than others.</p><p>"It's always tracking real-time employee sentiment, and it's always tracking real-time toxicity," Schumann said of the analytics tool. "If you were a bank using Aware and the sentiment of the workforce spiked in the last 20 minutes, it's because they're talking about something positively, collectively. The technology would be able to tell them whatever it was."</p><p>Aware confirmed to CNBC that it uses data from its enterprise clients to train its machine-learning models. The company's data repository contains about 6.5 billion messages, representing about 20 billion individual interactions across more than 3 million unique employees, the company said.&nbsp;</p><p>When a new client signs up for the analytics tool, it takes Aware's AI models about two weeks to train on employee messages and get to know the patterns of emotion and sentiment within the company so it can see what's normal versus abnormal, Schumann said.</p><p>"It won't have names of people, to protect the privacy," Schumann said. Rather, he said, clients will see that "maybe the workforce over the age of 40 in this part of the United States is seeing the changes to [a] policy very negatively because of the cost, but everybody else outside of that age group and location sees it positively because it impacts them in a different way."</p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107364640" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000329612" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107364640"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107364641-17062107841706210781-33053162930-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1706210784&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="FTC scrutinizes megacap's AI deals"><span></span><span></span></p></div><div><p>But Aware's eDiscovery tool operates differently. A company can set up role-based access to employee names depending on the "extreme risk" category of the company's choice, which instructs Aware's technology to pull an individual's name, in certain cases, for human resources or another company representative.</p><p>"Some of the common ones are extreme violence, extreme bullying, harassment, but it does vary by industry," Schumann said, adding that in financial services, suspected insider trading would be tracked.</p><p>For instance, a client can specify a "violent threats" policy, or any other category, using Aware's technology, Schumann said, and have the AI models monitor for violations in Slack, <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-12"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> Teams and Workplace by <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-13"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/">Meta</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>. The client could also couple that with rule-based flags for certain phrases, statements and more. If the AI found something that violated a company's specified policies, it could provide the employee's name to the client's designated representative.</p><p>This type of practice has been used for years within email communications. What's new is the use of AI and its application across workplace messaging platforms such as Slack and Teams.</p><p>Amba Kak, executive director of the AI Now Institute at New York University, worries about using AI to help determine what's considered risky behavior.</p><p>"It results in a chilling effect on what people are saying in the workplace," said Kak, adding that the Federal Trade Commission, Justice Department and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have all expressed concerns on the matter, though she wasn't speaking specifically about Aware's technology. "These are as much worker rights issues as they are privacy issues."&nbsp;</p><p>Schumann said that though Aware's eDiscovery tool allows security or HR investigations teams to use AI to search through massive amounts of data, a "similar but basic capability already exists today" in Slack, Teams and other platforms.</p><p>"A key distinction here is that Aware and its AI models are not making decisions," Schumann said. "Our AI simply makes it easier to comb through this new data set to identify potential risks or policy violations."</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>Privacy concerns</h2><div><p>Even if data is aggregated or anonymized, <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/census.pdf" target="_blank">research suggests</a>, it's a flawed concept. A <a href="https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf" target="_blank">landmark study</a> on data privacy using 1990 U.S. Census data showed that 87% of Americans could be identified solely by using ZIP code, birth date and gender. Aware clients using its analytics tool have the power to add metadata to message tracking, such as employee age, location, division, tenure or job function.&nbsp;</p><p>"What they're saying is relying on a very outdated and, I would say, entirely debunked notion at this point that anonymization or aggregation is like a magic bullet through the privacy concern," Kak said.</p><p>Additionally, the type of AI model Aware uses can be effective at generating inferences from aggregate data, making accurate guesses, for instance, about personal identifiers based on language, context, slang terms and more, according to <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=kmn0BhQk7p" target="_blank">recent research</a>.</p><p>"No company is essentially in a position to make any sweeping assurances about the privacy and security of LLMs and these kinds of systems," Kak said. "There is no one who can tell you with a straight face that these challenges are solved."</p><p>And what about employee recourse? If an interaction is flagged and a worker is disciplined or fired, it's difficult for them to offer a defense if they're not privy to all of the data involved, Williams said.</p><p>"How do you face your accuser when we know that AI explainability is still immature?" Williams said.</p><p>Schumann said in response: "None of our AI models make decisions or recommendations regarding employee discipline."</p><p>"When the model flags an interaction," Schumann said, "it provides full context around what happened and what policy it triggered, giving investigation teams the information they need to decide next steps consistent with company policies and the law."</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/01/25/ai-is-really-at-play-here-with-the-recent-tech-layoffs-says-jason-greer.html">AI is 'really at play here' with the recent tech layoffs</a></p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107364334" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000329554" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107364334"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107364335-17061866781706186675-33048845410-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1706186678&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="AI is 'really at play here' with the recent tech layoffs, says Jason Greer"><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

        <div>
                <p>In 2023 operations for the .GOV TLD transitioned from Verisign to Cloudflare. One interesting aspect of this transition was the different approaches to DNSSEC signing by Verisign and Cloudflare. Whereas Verisign uses offline signing with RSA (algorithm 8) and NSEC3, Cloudflare generally uses online signing with ECDSA (algorithm 13) and NSEC.</p>
<p>Although the parties agreed to transition using only RSA, we wanted to test the statement in RFC 8901 ("Multi-Signer DNSSEC Models") that says "NSEC and NSEC3 can be used by different providers to serve the same zone." After extensive testing by both parties, we found no reasons why it shouldn't work, and this approach was used for the transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is likely to be the first time that a signed zone of such significance was operated using NSEC and NSEC3 at the same time.</p>

<p>Everyone likes a good comic. Comedy, done well, adds much needed soul to life-exposing and magnifying the absurdities of life, reducing <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/stress" title="Psychology Today looks at stress" hreflang="en-GB">stress</a>, defusing social tensions, and generally increasing the quality of life. Of course, comedy, done poorly, is about as awkward as watching George W. Bush tap dance while waiting to endorse John McCain (Time magazines<a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/2008/top10/article/0,30583,1855948_1864014,00.html"> #1 most awkward moment of 2008</a>).
</p>

<p>But behind every punch line is a real live human sweating profusely to get a laugh. What are these people like? How did the comic become this way, constantly pushing the limit to get a reaction from others? What motivates the comic? How do comics perceive themselves? Let's start at the beginning. </p>
<p><strong>Origins of the Comic </strong></p>

<p>Samuel Janus and his colleagues studied the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/intelligence" title="Psychology Today looks at intelligence" hreflang="en-GB">intelligence</a>, educational level, family background, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/personality" title="Psychology Today looks at personality" hreflang="en-GB">personality</a> of 69 comedians, all of whom were said to be famous and successful. Data were collected using a variety of methods: clinical interviews, accounts of early memories, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/dreaming" title="Psychology Today looks at dreams" hreflang="en-GB">dreams</a>, handwriting analyses, projective tests, and the Weschsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).</p>

<p>Janus concluded that comedians tended to be superior in intelligence, but also felt misunderstood, angry, anxious, suspicious, depressed, and concerned with approval. Their early lives were frequently characterized by suffering, isolation, and feelings of deprivation; in many cases, the comedians learned to use <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/humor" title="Psychology Today looks at humor" hreflang="en-GB">humor</a> as a defense against <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/anxiety" title="Psychology Today looks at anxiety" hreflang="en-GB">anxiety</a>, converting their feelings of suppressed rage from physical to verbal <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/anger" title="Psychology Today looks at aggression" hreflang="en-GB">aggression</a>. However, many comedians were also <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/shyness" title="Psychology Today looks at shy" hreflang="en-GB">shy</a>, sensitive, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/empathy" title="Psychology Today looks at empathic" hreflang="en-GB">empathic</a> individuals whose comedic success was apparently due partly to an ability to accurately perceive the fears and needs of their audiences.</p>

<p>Seymour and Rhoda Fisher conducted a better-controlled study of professional humor producers, and summarized their results in a delightful book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pretend-World-Funny-Forever-Psychological/dp/0898590736/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229806854&amp;sr=1-1">Pretend the World is Funny and Forever: A Psychological Analysis of Comedians, Clowns, and Actors</a>. They assessed the personality, motivations, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/child-development" title="Psychology Today looks at childhood" hreflang="en-GB">childhood</a> recollections of 43 professional comedians (including 15 circus clowns) and scoured published biographical and autobiographical accounts of 40 comedians and clowns, from <a href="http://www.woodyallen.com/">Woody Allen</a> and <a href="http://www.jackiegleason.com/">Jackie Gleason</a> to <a href="http://www.jerrylewiscomedy.com/">Jerry Lewis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Lillie">Beatrice Lillie</a> (once dubbed the "Funniest Women in the World"). They also administered the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/rorschach-test" title="Psychology Today looks at Rorschach inkblot test" hreflang="en-GB">Rorschach inkblot test</a> and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) to identify themes and preoccupations in the thoughts of the comedians. As a control, they included a sample of 41 professional actors.</p>

<p>Fisher and Fisher found that professional comedians did not differ from actors in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/depression" title="Psychology Today looks at depression" hreflang="en-GB">depression</a> or overall psychological health, but did uncover several differences between the groups. The majority of the comics came from lower socioeconomic strata. Quite early, they displayed talent for being funny, often acting as the "class clown" in school. Many in the sample entered comedy professionally through their interest in music. Compared to the actors, the professional comedians had to take on considerably more responsibility at an early age. They were also more likely than the actors to describe the father in highly positive terms, and were more inclined to refer to the mother as a disciplinarian, an aggressive critic, non-nurturing, and non-maternal. This finding was also discovered in a sample of amateur humor producers: the more college students considered themselves to be comics the more they saw their mother as controlling and the father as softer in their childrearing practices.</p>

<p>Along similar lines, Steven Prasinos and Bennett Tittler investigated 88 adolescent Boy Scouts and found that the funnier Boy Scouts (assessed through peer nomination) tended to be more distanced from their families, reported less cohesion in their families than what was reported by their peers, and reported greater family conflict. The authors interpret these findings as suggesting that humor represents an attempt to relate from a distance. They also raise the interesting possibility that this distancing is precisely what enables these individuals to be funny, since it allows for a fresh perspective.</p>

<p>The Fishers present another intriguing explanation for the link between early life experiences and the development of the comic. They draw on Alfred Heilbrum's work who found a tendency for individuals who are raised by controlling, non-nurturing mothers to develop schizophrenia. Heilbrun found two types of men (there really needs to be more research on female comics!) who are raised by a non-nurturing mother. The "closed style" type was characterized by defenses such as isolation from social interactions and depression, while the "open style" type was characterized as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/extroversion" title="Psychology Today looks at extroverted" hreflang="en-GB">extroverted</a> and alert to ways of winning social approval-"broad scanners" of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/environment" title="Psychology Today looks at the environment" hreflang="en-GB">the environment</a>, always looking for cues of what people expect of them.</p>

<p>The Fishers related this open style personality to the comics in their sample and argued that the comic's style of relating to people may partly mirror their early adventures with their mother. Their idea is that he or she becomes an expert in "reading" his or her mother, and then later learns how to "scan the world in a very sensitive way, looking for contradictions to decode and reconcile, hunting out cues as to how to win approval and support" (p. 207).</p>



  


<p><strong>Motivations</strong></p>
<p>What motivates the comic? In their study, the Fishers noticed that professional comics displayed significantly more themes of contrasts and opposites. The Fishers hypothesized that the comedian learns, through early life experiences, that life is absurd. They then spend their lives telling jokes to help them understand the absurdity of their own position. They note that much of humor involves spotting and giving meaning to ambiguities, and that comedians are obsessed with instability. They hypothesized that this focus on inconstancy may represent an effort at mastery, and that the comedian seeks to adapt to a threat that was of painful intensity in their early childhood.</p>

<p>The researchers also noted that the professional comic frequently seemed to put up a screen by retreating behind a barrage of jokes, as suggested in interviews and inkblot responses, where the professional comics conjured up images about concealment. Compared to actors, they were more likely to refer to people wearing masks, creatures hiding, and objects that can't be distinguished properly because they are obscured by darkness.</p>

<p>Fisher and Fisher also found that the majority of professional comedians in their sample had imagery of smallness. The comics tended to have lower self-esteems and to say bad things about themselves. They argue that the comedian's focus on his or her smallness may be a result of the reduced significance he or she felt as a child and that much comic behavior is aimed at reducing the discrepancy of smallness between themselves and others. "There is no question but that size strategies pervade the comic's codes and metaphors...He is forever reducing or magnifying. He never reports things in their immediate proportions" (p. 216). They also note that the low <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/self-esteem" title="Psychology Today looks at self-esteem" hreflang="en-GB">self-esteem</a> and feeling of smallness existent among the professional comics may actually set the comic on a unique path. "We would emphasize...the possibility that in some paradoxical way these negative self-feelings provide a durable base for shaping one's <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/identity" title="Psychology Today looks at identity" hreflang="en-GB">identity</a> and going off on an independent trajectory" (p. 200).</p>

<p><strong>Self-Perception </strong></p>
<p>How does the comic view himself or herself? The Fishers found that they viewed themselves as healers. Many of the professional comedians expressed a dedication to being <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/altruism" title="Psychology Today looks at altruistic" hreflang="en-GB">altruistic</a>. The comic sees his or her central duty as that of making people feel that events are funny. At the same time, the professional comics also viewed humor as a technique for controlling and dominating the audience. Indeed, Fisher and Fisher were impressed at how this view of the comic as a fool-priest is consistent with scholarly reviews of the history of the clown, the court jester, and the fool. They also noted how the contemporary comic serves a similar function as the court jester in earlier times. On the one hand, the comic presents himself or herself as the silly fellow that jokes, amuses and entertains. On the other hand, the comic initiates opposing currents, uncovering truths that many people usually try to banish from awareness.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/article-inline-half/public/blogs/624/2008/12/2752-75862.jpg?itok=-Stcx8DI" alt="" title=""></p>
</div>
<p>This research suggests that humor in professional comedians serves as a defense or coping mechanisms in dealing with his or her early family experiences, and the burden of having to take care of oneself. This may motivate the comic to make people laugh in order to gain their acceptance, as well as drive the comic to reveal the absurdity of life to make sense of their own lives. As Mark Runco has noted, writing is often a form of problem-solving; many writers are motivated to write to solve problems in their lives. Comedy writers may use comedy in their writing to help them understand themselves and the world, and to do so in a fashion that controls the reader's emotions. Enough analysis. Whatever the reason for comics, thank goodness for them.</p>

    <span>Disclaimer:</span> These cost estimates are based on <a href="https://getdeploying.com/reference/how-we-estimate-costs">several assumptions</a>.
    Cloud provider prices may change over time, and your actual costs may differ.
</p>

<h2>Understanding cloud egress</h2>
<p>If you're a developer, chances are you've used cloud services for tasks like storing files, running your apps, or hosting websites.</p>
<p>These services are typically charged based on usage, but one of the costs you might not be aware of until you get your cloud bill is data egress.</p>
<p>It's important to understand how it works because data egress fees can quickly add up, <em>especially</em> if you're moving a lot of data out of the cloud.</p>
<p>Let's break down what data egress is, how much it costs, and what you can do to keep your data egress costs down.</p>
<h2>What is data egress?</h2>
<p>Data egress is the term used to describe data leaving a network, more specifically, <strong>data leaving your cloud provider's network</strong> out to the public internet. This can be data sent from a cloud provider to a user, or data sent from one cloud provider to another.</p>
<p>Cloud providers typically charge for egress based on the amount of data sent out of their network, and it's usually measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB) of data transfer per month.</p>
<h2>Data egress vs ingress</h2>
<p>While egress is the term used to describe data leaving a network, ingress is the term used to describe data entering a network. Ingress is typically free, while egress is charged.</p>
<p>That means, from the cloud provider's perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user <strong>uploads</strong> a file to a cloud storage service, that's considered ingress.</li>
<li>When the user <strong>downloads</strong> the file, that's considered egress.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why do cloud providers charge for egress?</h2>
<p>Cloud providers charge for egress because it costs them money to send data out of their network. They have to pay for the infrastructure and bandwidth required to send data to users.</p>
<p>Egress fees may also be used to discourage certain types of usage, such as moving large amounts of data across providers.</p>
<p>However, most cloud providers do offer a certain amount of free egress each month. For example, as an account-wide allowance (eg. 100 GB / mo), or pooled across the number of servers you have with them (eg. 1 TB / mo per server).</p>
<h2>Keeping egress costs down</h2>
<p>Here are some factors to consider when trying to keep egress costs down:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong> Cache and serve static assets closer to your users. That way, you can reduce the amount of data transferred from your cloud provider to your users.</li>
<li><strong>Compression:</strong> Compress your data before sending it to reduce the amount of data transferred. Gzip and Brotli are popular compression algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Data transfer pools:</strong> Consider using a cloud provider that offers a data transfer pool. This allows you to pool together the data transfer allowances of multiple services within the same account.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Set up usage and billing alerts to notify you when you're approaching your free allowance or a certain threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Private networking:</strong> Your cloud provider may offer free egress for data transferred between services within the same data center or region when using a private network. However, do watch out for NAT gateway charges and other fees that may apply.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Data egress is the cost of sending data out of a cloud provider's network to the public internet. It's important to understand how it works because data egress fees can quickly add up, especially if you're moving a lot of data out of the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can use this website to <a href="https://getdeploying.com/compare">compare cloud providers</a> and their egress costs to find which one is the best fit for your use case.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><h2 id="opml-is-underrated">OPML is underrated</h2>
<!-- atom-id: a23474ca-0fc0-4444-93ad-21d1d08cded9 -->

<p>As a response to the general <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456">enshittification</a>
of major platforms, I would say we are seeing a resurgence of the old
web’s ethos, with personal blogs gaining traction and the concept of the
<a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">small web</a> on the
rise. That might be colored by the digital communities I hang around in
(which are mostly dominated by programmers) but it does at least
empirically feel like a trend<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. That brings along with
it a new interest in open web standards. Among them is RSS<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>,
which both I, and I think a lot others, have increasingly integrated
into our digital routines to keep track of posts from people and sources
we’re following. RSS aligns perfectly with the movement towards more
personalized and controlled content consumption. Unlike the
algorithm-driven feeds of <q>other platforms</q> — which often
prioritize engagement over relevance or quality — RSS allows me to
curate my own information stream. This feels important to me, as it
gives me a level of autonomy over the content that shapes my views and
knowledge, as opposed to handing that power over to advertisers.</p>
<p>There is an issue, though. RSS feeds can be a bit clunky to manage
and keep track of. Their decentralized nature also makes discoverability
an issue. Enter <a href="http://opml.org/spec2.opml">OPML</a>, which is
an outliner format that is most commonly used to store <a href="http://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists">a list of feed
subscriptions</a>. I promise you; having a single file that stores all
the feeds you’re interested in is a gamechanger, as it makes it
significantly easier to organize, migrate, and share those feeds across
different platforms and devices. Here’s an example:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>&lt;?xml</span><span> version=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span> encoding=</span><span>"utf-8"</span><span>?&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">&lt;<span>opml</span><span> version=</span><span>"2.0"</span>&gt;</span>
<span id="cb1-3">  &lt;<span>head</span>&gt;</span>
<span id="cb1-4">    &lt;<span>title</span>&gt;A list of feeds I follow&lt;/<span>title</span>&gt;</span>
<span id="cb1-5">  &lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;</span>
<span id="cb1-6">  &lt;<span>body</span>&gt;</span>
<span id="cb1-7">    &lt;<span>outline</span><span> text=</span><span>"My favorite blog"</span><span> xmlUrl=</span><span>"https://a-cool-blog.tld/blog/feed.xml"</span><span> type=</span><span>"rss"</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><span>      htmlUrl=</span><span>"https://a-cool-blog.tld/blog"</span><span> description=</span><span>"You can also add a description"</span> /&gt;</span>
<span id="cb1-9">    <span>&lt;!-- more outline elements with feeds... --&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-10">  &lt;/<span>body</span>&gt;</span>
<span id="cb1-11">&lt;/<span>opml</span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Each outline item must have the type <code>rss</code> (that goes for
both RSS and Atom feeds) and must include the <code>xmlUrl</code>
attribute. Optionally, you can specify some more attributes, like adding
a title with <code>text</code>, a description with
<code>description</code> and a link to the blog front page with
<code>htmlUrl</code> — that added metadata can be very useful. Yes, it
is XML-based, which I admit isn’t exactly the easiest format to work
with, but it has a few advantages, which we’ll get back to.</p>
<p>With OPML, you don’t need separate applications or services to
categorize feeds. Categorization can be achieved within a single OPML
file through its outlining capabilities or by managing multiple OPML
files, each dedicated to a different category or use-case. It is a very
viable workflow to have one OPML file for your YouTube subscriptions,
another for your favorite Twitter/X and Mastodon users, one more for
news sites, and yet another for personal blogs — the world’s your
oyster. However, there aren’t many application that support nested OPML
outlines or categorizing based on different files, sadly, but there
should be! This is a call to action, developers: Perfect
side-project!</p>
<p>Beyond personal convenience, OPML has the potential to better the
<em>ecosystem</em> of the <q>small web.</q> By not only sharing an RSS
feed on your personal website, but also your list of subscribed feeds,
we’re effectively creating a recommendation system that is based on
concious curation, not statistical metrics. Your OPML file is now called
a <em><a href="https://blogroll.org/what-are-blogrolls/">blogroll</a></em>, and
you officially get to call yourself a <strong>90s web
developer</strong>. Jokes aside, I believe the simple fact that there is
a known person behind each recommendation is advantageous. Yes, this
might promote smaller digital social circles, but I personally think the
transparency of a known source is the best way to combat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubbles</a>.
That part is a whole sociological discussion in itself, so if you would
like to discuss it further, I would love chatting about it on <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~kmaasrud/inbox">my mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Now, getting back to the fact that OPML is XML-based; I’d like to
highlight an often-overlooked feature of this: The ability to use an XSL
stylesheet to display the OPML file rendered through a HTML template
when loaded in a browser. With this, you can add a short introduction
and guide to the format, making the blogroll more accessible to those
unfamiliar with it. It also opens the possibility to showcase each feed
with added context or descriptions.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Here is an example XSL stylesheet you can use:
</summary>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>&lt;?</span><span>xml</span><span> version=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span> encoding=</span><span>"UTF-8"</span><span>?&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>&lt;</span><span>xsl:stylesheet</span><span> version=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span> xmlns:xsl=</span><span>"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">  <span>&lt;</span><span>xsl:template</span><span> match=</span><span>"/opml"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">    <span>&lt;html</span><span> xmlns=</span><span>"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</span><span> xml:lang=</span><span>"en"</span><span> lang=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><main aria-role="main"><div><p>This is a <del>story</del> nightmare about the messy state of Microsoft’s DirectX shader compiler, and trying to wrangle it into a nicer experience for game developers. In some respects, we now build the DXC compiler better than how Microsoft does.</p><h2 id="setting-the-stage">Setting the stage</h2><p>For <a href="https://machengine.org/">Mach engine</a> we’ve been building an <a href="https://devlog.hexops.com/2024/mach-v0.3-released/#sysgpu">experimental graphics API called sysgpu</a> using Zig, aiming to be a <em>successor</em> and <em>descendant</em> of WebGPU for native graphics. It will support Metal, Vulkan, Direct3D, and OpenGL backends. As part of this, we need to compile shader programs into something that Direct3D 12 can consume. But what does it consume?</p><h2 id="a-brief-history-lesson">A brief history lesson</h2><p>The DirectX graphics API uses HLSL as its shading language of choice. In the past, with Direct3D 11 and earlier, this compiler was called ‘FXC’ (the ‘effects compiler’)</p><h3 id="fxc-is-deprecated-dxc-enters-the-scene-with-direct3d-12">FXC is deprecated, DXC enters the scene with Direct3D 12</h3><p>Unfortunately, FXC as a compiler is rather notoriously slow among game developers, with suboptimal code generation - meaning shaders often both compile and execute fairly suboptimally.</p><p>With the release of Direct3D 12 and Shader Model 6.0 (SM6), Microsoft officially deprecated the FXC compiler distributed as part of the Windows OS in favor of a new compiler called ‘DXC’ (‘directx compiler’), which exists as a public Microsoft-official fork of LLVM/Clang v3.7 <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler">Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler</a> and prebuilt binaries you can download.</p><p>In this Microsoft fork of LLVM, changes are meticulously annotated via <code>// HLSL Change Start</code> and <code>// HLSL Change End</code> comments making it clear who owns what code:</p><p><a href="https://devlog.hexops.com/img/2024/hlsl-change-start"><img src="https://devlog.hexops.com/img/2024/hlsl-change-start.png"></a></p><h3 id="what-a-directx-driver-eats-for-breakfast-dxbc-or-dxil">What a DirectX driver eats for breakfast: DXBC or DXIL</h3><p>Although HLSL is the language of choice for Direct3D programming, at the end of the day GPUs under the hood all have different compute architectures and requirements: the compiled binary form of a shader program that an Intel GPU needs is going to be different from what an NVIDIA GPU needs, same goes for AMD.</p><p>Microsoft’s role is to provide the nice game developer frontend APIs (like Direct3D, and the HLSL shanding language), while working with independent hardware vendors (IHV’s) like Intel/AMD/NVIDIA who write the drivers - bridging those nice frontend APIs to whatever is hopefully closest to hardware manufacturer’s instruction set architecture (ISA) under the hood. You can think of it like web browsers making sure JavaScript can run on both a Windows PC and a macOS Apple Silicon device, though graphics developers would spit at the suggested comparison.</p><p>DirectX versions 9-11 had driver manufacturers consuming what is called DXBC (DirectX Byte Code) - game developers would produce DXBC either using a CLI tool to compile their HLSL programs like <code>fxc.exe</code>, or at runtime using the <code>d3dcompiler</code> APIs, and then the driver’s job was to take that decently-optimized shader bytecode and turn it into the actual binary that the GPU would run. This bytecode was an undocumented, proprietary format really only shared between Microsoft and GPU driver manufacturers - excluding a few odd-ball Linux developers who cared to reverse engineer it for Proton.</p><p>With the advent of DirectX 12 and Shader Model 6.0, Microsoft aspirationally had intended to create their own standard IR called DXIR, but in 2021 they <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/commit/61c6573842be58a14e1dfc6b1b3def03d39d9988">removed all language suggesting they might do this</a>. The intent <em>was</em> for DXIR to be the ‘high level’, ‘unoptimized’ IR form which compilers (think: Rust) could target, and then the DXC compiler could lower DXIR into the optimized DXIL bytecode form, a new ‘low level’ post-optimization IR format, before handing it off to graphics drivers to muck with as they please before it gets translated to run on the actual hardware.</p><p>Asked about DXIR documentation, a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/2389#issuecomment-517076643">Microsoft employee</a> had noted this in 2019:</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, documentation on the lowering process [from DXIR to DXIL] is mostly non-existent. […]</p><p>Oh, and DXIR isn’t anything official, but just the first LLVM IR after CodeGen.</p></blockquote><p>As you’ll soon see, this theme of ‘there are no docs, just whatever our compiler actually does’ will become a common pattern.</p><h3 id="dxil">DXIL</h3><p>DXIL (pronunciation?) is the official format that DirectX 12 driver manufacturers consume <em>today</em>.</p><p>A game developer produces DXIL bytecode using the DXC compiler, which is a fork of LLVM/clang heavily modified to support HLSL compilation, and the DirectX APIs hand that DXIL over to the graphics driver which then converts the IR into their own intermediate languages, performing any secret sauce optimization passes on it, and ultimately boiling down to the actual machine code that will run on the GPU hardware.</p><p>Much like the old bytecode format DXBC which DXIL replaced, it is <em>also</em> an undocumented bytecode format, specifically it is LLVM’s version 3.7 post-codegen post-optimization-passes bitecode format. It is undocumented not because nobody wants to document it, but rather because the documentation is literally ‘whatever the Microsoft fork of LLVM v3.7 with all the HLSL changes we made, after CodeGen and optimization passes have occurred, actually emits as LLVM bitcode - plus a small custom container/wrapper file format on top.’</p><h3 id="correcting-the-microsoft-fork-of-llvm">Correcting the Microsoft fork of LLVM</h3><p>Microsoft themselves are well aware that a bunch of independent driver manufacturers relying on and expecting to consume a hyper-specific undocumented LLVM bitcode format specifically produced by their fork is, well, less than ideal - and also aware that their fork of LLVM is not super fun to maintain, either. Quoting <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/5773#issuecomment-1735794551">another Microsoft employee</a> (Sep 2023) who was asked about the potential of adding DirectX 9/10/11 support to the new/better DXC compiler, they stated:</p><blockquote><p>DXC’s fork of LLVM removed and/or damaged much of the code generation layer and infrastructure [of LLVM]. Given that, supporting DXBC generation in DXC would be a massive task to fix and restore broken LLVM functionality. Due to the large scale of this issue and resource constraints on our team we’re not going to address this issue in [the new] DXC [compiler] ever.</p><p>We may support DXBC generation in Clang in the future (we mentioned that in the original proposal to LLVM). That work is unlikely to begin for a few years as our focus will be on supporting DXIL and SPIR-V generation first.</p></blockquote><p>As noted above, in March of 2022, Microsoft had proposed and begun work on <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-adding-hlsl-and-directx-support-to-clang-llvm/60783">upstreaming HLSL compilation support directly into LLVM/clang proper</a> - work that is still ongoing today - and involved <em>adding back</em> legacy LLVM v3.7 bitcode writing support to modern LLVM/clang versions:</p><blockquote><p>By isolating as much of the DXIL-specific code as possible into a target we hope to minimize the cost on the community to maintain our legacy bitcode writing support.</p></blockquote><p>i.e. the plan to get away fromn their fork is to upstream HLSL and DXIL support to LLVM/clang proper.</p><h2 id="the-challenge-for-gamedevs-webgpu-etc">The challenge for gamedevs, WebGPU, etc.</h2><p>Graphics abstraction layers which aim to provide a unified interface to modern graphics APIs like Metal, Direct3D 12, and Vulkan.. ultimately need to provide a unified shading language as well. If you look today, you’ll find most WebGPU implementations which do this have had a goal of ‘in the future we might be able to emit DXIL directly..’ but in practice, none actually do.</p><p>Instead, basically every WebGPU implementation today behaves as follows:</p><ul><li>The WGSL textual language first gets translated to HLSL at runtime</li><li>HLSL is compiled into DXBC or DXIL using an HLSL compiler</li><li>The optimized DXBC/DXIL is handed to the graphics driver, which then gets converted to the various vendor-specific ILs before finally becoming machine code that runs on the GPU.</li></ul><h3 id="a-quick-detour-spir-v">A quick detour: SPIR-V</h3><p>Vulkan/SPIR-V does much the same as the above, in fact most drivers cannot assume SPIR-V is optimized at all - though some do, and this varies by mobile/desktop GPUs - and have more work to perform to get SPIR-V turned into a <em>driver-compiled</em> native binary.</p><p>Valve has <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Fossilize">Fossilize</a> and maintains caches of each specific (GPU, driver version, etc.) pairing along with the <em>actual</em> driver-compiled binary for a SPIR-V blob, to enable downloading ‘pre-cached shaders’ from Valve servers ahead of playing games for this reason: so that you don’t spend all day waiting for your computer to go brrr compiling and optimizing SPIR-V shaders into actual native code your GPU understands.</p><p>In other words, DXIL is always post-optimization-passes LLVM <em>bitcode</em>, while SPIR-V can or cannot be an an optimized form, and GPU manufacturers write their drivers based on what SPIR-V looks like in the wild - which may or may not be a pre-optimized form. SPIR-V is closer to hardware than a textual shading language, but still very far from native machine code a GPU understands.</p><p>Only Apple’s Metal graphics API supports compiling directly to the actual target hardware’s native binary format (thanks to that iron fist they hold over their hardware, I guess.)</p><h2 id="to-use-dxcompilerdll-or-not">To use dxcompiler.dll or not?</h2><p>Since WGSL-&gt;HLSL-&gt;DXIL is happening at runtime, WebGPU runtimes are faced with a challenge: do we use the new DXC HLSL compiler, or the old, officially deprecated FXC compiler which has worse performance and codegen quality? On the surface, this hardly sounds like a difficult choice!</p><p>However, despite this, many indie devs and game engines choose to use FXC by default. <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/i686-pc-windows-msvc/bevy/render/settings/enum.Dx12Compiler.html">Bevy game engine’s documentation</a> puts it really well:</p><blockquote><p>The Fxc compiler (default) is old, slow and unmaintained. However, it doesn’t require any additional .dlls to be shipped with the application.</p><p>The Dxc compiler is new, fast and maintained. However, it requires both <code>dxcompiler.dll</code> and <code>dxil.dll</code> to be shipped with the application. These files can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases">https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases</a>.</p></blockquote><p>As a result, much software defaults to the old, slow and unmaintained compiler. And it’s not just Bevy: <code>wgpu</code> Rust users, Dawn WebGPU users, etc. are all faced with this same question. It’s likely one of the reasons WebGPU does not support Shader Model 6.0+ functionality today - using the DXC compiler is not so pleasant: it is after all a large, clunky Microsoft fork of a C++ codebase from nearly a decade ago!</p><h2 id="well-why-not-just-statically-link-against-it">Well, why not just statically link against it?</h2><p>You can’t.</p><p>Firstly, there is the issue that <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/4766">Microsoft’s fork of LLVM doesn’t support statically linking</a>. On the surface, this appears just to be due to some cmake files assuming <code>SHARED</code> instead of <code>STATIC</code> when creating libraries, but if you dig into it - as I did - you’ll soon find it is <em>much</em> more involved than that.</p><p>Switching <code>SHARED</code> to <code>STATIC</code> everywhere in CMake files will appear to get you a build with ~15 different static libraries to link against (not pleasant compared to just one.) You might think using cmake <code>OBJECT</code> libraries could solve this, but with this you will quickly encounter an issue where although the cmake files are structured logically as dependants, they actually have implicit dependencies on eachother due to the HLSL changes Microsoft made. I am 80% sure you would need to rewrite every cmake file in the repository to support OBJECT libraries. I can say this, because I tried!</p><p>You might be thinking, linking against ~15 static libraries isn’t SO bad as long as the final executable is static, right?</p><p>Not so fast - many parts of DXC’s COM interface implementation is also explicitly designed to load itself as a DLL, i.e. to load <code>dxcompiler.dll</code> and <code>dxil.dll</code> as dynamic libraries and self-invoke methods.</p><p>OK, we just need to patch the implementation to not call <code>LoadLibraryW</code> then, basically, right?</p><h2 id="introducing-dxildll---the-proprietary-code-signing-blob-for-directx-shaders">Introducing dxil.dll - the proprietary code signing blob for DirectX shaders</h2><p>If you’ve ever built DirectXShaderCompiler from source, you might notice something: dxil.dll doesn’t get built. Why? It’s distributed in every release on GitHub, both for Windows (x86/arm) and Linux (x86 only).</p><p>Strange, I thought the compiler was supposed to be open source? Well, it wouldn’t be the first time<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/issues/766#issuecomment-1150271300">[0]</a><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK/issues/1521">[1]</a> I’ve encountered a Microsoft ‘open source’ repository that actually completely depends on some proprietary platform-specific code blobs behind the scenes.</p><p>Incidentally, I stumbled across the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/ShaderCache.html">D3D12 Shader Cache API specification</a> which mentions the existence of this proprietary code signing blob as a ‘good reason for invoking the shader compiler at runtime’:</p><blockquote><p>D3D12 will only accept signed shaders. That means that if any patching or runtime optimizations are performed, such as constant folding, the shader must be re-validated and re-signed, which is non-trivial.</p></blockquote><p>And in the recent <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases/tag/v1.8.2306-preview">‘preview release’ for Shader Model 6.8 functionality</a>, Microsoft notes how they appear to leverage this DLL to restrict new experimental shader functionality:</p><blockquote><p>The DXIL signing library (dxil.dll/libdxil.so) is not provided with this preview release. DXIL generated with this compiler targeting Shader Model 6.8 is not final, cannot be validated, and is not supported for distribution or execution on machines not running in developer mode.</p></blockquote><p>In other words: if you do not have dxil.dll, then your shaders will not be signed/validated. If your shaders are not signed/validated, then they cannot run on a Windows machine unless it is running in Developer Mode.</p><h2 id="platform-support-challenges">Platform support challenges</h2><p>For a second, I’d like to go back to something I wrote at the start of this article:</p><blockquote><p>For <a href="https://machengine.org/">Mach engine</a> […] we need to compile shader programs into something that Direct3D 12 can consume.</p></blockquote><p>I’d like for us to be able to perform offline shader compilation, and skip out on distributing the heavy DXC dependency, when desired.</p><p>But Microsoft only distributes a copy of dxil.dll for Windows (x86/arm) and Linux (x86). There’s no Linux aarch64 binary. There’s no macOS binary. In other words, you can’t produce builds of your cross-platform game for Windows using offline shader compilation on a mac, or in your Arm Linux CI pipeline. You need a Windows or x86_64 Linux machine to run the proprietary blob.</p><h2 id="recap">Recap</h2><p>To recap:</p><ul><li>We cannot build DXC as a static library, because the decades-old Microsoft fork of LLVM v3.7 has a very messy build-system.</li><li>Even if we could, we cannot build DXC as a static library <strong>because of the proprietary code-signing blob</strong>.</li><li>We cannot compile DirectX HLSL shaders offline on a Mac, or build our cross-platform game in an arm Linux CI pipeline, because Microsoft doesn’t distribute copies of <strong>the proprietary code signing blob</strong> for those platforms.</li></ul><h2 id="going-deeper">Going deeper</h2><h3 id="un-the-build-system">Un#$@&amp;%*! the build system</h3><p>The first problem I wanted to address was how to actually build this codebase into a single static library.</p><p>After several days of attempting to fix the implicit dependencies that changing the cmake virtual libraries from <code>DYNAMIC</code> -&gt; <code>OBJECT</code> surfaces, I gave up. Originally, my intent was to use their existing cmake build system (so as to not diverge from their codebase too much) and just swap the compiler with <code>zig cc</code> as the build toolchain for cross-compilation.</p><p>After it slowly and painfully became apparent that direction was not going to be <em>any</em> better than maintaining the entire buildsystem myself, I decided to just bite the bullet and rewrite the entire CMake build system they had, some ~10.5k lines of code, using <code>build.zig</code> instead. To make things simpler, I chose to build only the two parts we (and others) really care about as consumers of the code: the <code>dxcompiler.dll</code> library, and <code>dxc.exe</code> binary for offline compilation / testing. (we’ll deal with <code>dxil.dll</code> later.)</p><p>This resulted in somewhere around <a href="https://github.com/hexops/mach-dxcompiler/blob/bd0cfbe4230133d8d3b50eedf1a0d0c4a00f47d7/build.zig#L1-L956">~1k lines of build.zig logic</a>, and in practice it’s less than that because much of it is just related to running <code>git clone</code> on the source repository, having the ability for Zig package consumers to use a prebuilt binary instead of building the large C++ library from source, and header/source generation (though we’re still not done with that, thanks to llvm-tablegen)</p><h3 id="un-the-dynamic-library-dependency">Un#$@&amp;%*! the dynamic library dependency</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, DXC is written with the expectation that <code>dxcompiler.dll</code> and <code>dxil.dll</code> exist.

<p><em>This is the transcript of my RustConf 2023 talk: "Extending Rust's Effect
System", presented on September 13th 2023 in Albuquerque, New Mexico and
streamed online.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Rust has continuously evolved since version 1.0 was released in 2015. We've
added major features such as the try operator (<code>?</code>), const generics, generic
associated types (GATs), and of course: <code>async/.await</code>. Out of those four
features, three are what can be considered to be "effects". And though we've
been working on them for a long time, they are all still very much in-progress.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Yosh and I work as a Developer Advocate for Rust at Microsoft.
I've been working on Rust itself for the past five years, and I'm among other
things a member of the Rust Async WG, and the co-lead of the Rust Effects
Initiative.</p>
<p>The thesis of this talk is that we've unknowingly shipped an effect system as
part of the language in since Rust 1.0. We've since begun adding a number of new
effects, and in order to finish integrating them into the language we need
support for <em>effect generics</em>.</p>
<p>In this talk I'll explain what effects are, what makes them challenging to
integrate into the language, and how we can overcome those challenges.</p>
<h2 id="rust-without-generics">Rust Without Generics</h2>
<p>When I was new to Rust it took me a minute to figure out how to use generics. I
was used to writing JavaScript, and we don’t have generics there. So I found
myself mostly writing functions which operated on <em>concrete types</em>. I remember
my code felt pretty clumsy, and it wasn't a great experience. Not compared to,
say, the code the stdlib provides.</p>
<p>An example of a generic stdlib function is the <code>io::copy</code> function. It reads
bytes from a reader, and copies them into a writer. We can give it a file, a
socket, or any combination of the two, and it will happily copy bytes from one
into the other.  This all works as long as we give it the right types.</p>
<p>But what if Rust actually didn't have generics? What if the Rust I used to write
at the beginning was actually all we had? How would we write this <code>io::copy</code>
function? Well, given we're trying to copy bytes between sockets and file types,
we could probably hand-code individual functions for these. For our two types
here we could write four unique functions.</p>
<p>But unfortunately for us that would only solve the problem right in front of us.
But the stdlib doesn’t just have two types which implement read and write. It
has 18 types which implement read, and 27 types which implement write. So if we
wanted to cover the entire API space of the stdlib, we’d need 486 functions in
total. And if that was the only way we could implement <code>io::copy</code>, that would
make for a pretty bad language.</p>
<p>Now luckily Rust does have generics, and all we ever need is the one <code>copy</code>
function. This means we're free to keep adding more types into the stdlib
without having to worry about implementing more functions. We just have the one
<code>copy</code> function, and the compiler will take care of generating the right code
for any types we give it.</p>
<h2 id="why-effect-generics">Why effect generics?</h2>
<p>Types are not the only things in Rust we want to be generic over. We also have
"const generics" which allow functions to be generic over constant values. As
well as "value generics" which allow functions to be generic over different
values. This is how we can write functions which can take different values -
which is a feature present in most programming languages.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn </span><span>by_value</span><span>(</span><span>cat</span><span>: Cat) { .. }
</span><span>fn </span><span>by_reference</span><span>(</span><span>cat</span><span>: &amp;Cat) { .. }
</span><span>fn </span><span>by_mutable_reference</span><span>(</span><span>cat</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Cat) { .. }
</span></code></pre>
<p>But not everything that can lead to API duplication are things we can be generic
over. For example, it's pretty common to create different methods or types
depending on whether we take a value as owned, as a reference, or as a mutable
reference. We also often create duplicate APIs for constant values and for
runtime values. As well as create duplicate structures depending on whether the
API needs to be thread-safe or not.</p>
<p>But out of everything which can lead to API duplication, effects are probably
one of the biggest ones. When I talk about effects in Rust, what I mean is
certain keywords such as <code>async/.await</code> and <code>const</code>; but also <code>?</code>, and types
such as <code>Result</code>, and <code>Option</code>. All of these have a deep, semantic connection to
the language, and changes the meaning of our code in ways that other keywords
and types don't.</p>
<p>Sometimes we'll write code which doesn't have the right effects, leading to
<em>effect mismatches</em>. This is also known as the <em>function coloring problem</em>, as
described by Robert Nystrom. Once you become aware of <em>effect mismatches</em> you
start seeing them all over the place, not just in Rust either.</p>
<p>The result of these effect mismatches is that using effects in Rust essentially
drops you into a second-rate experience. Whether you're using const, async,
Result, or Error - almost certainly somewhere along the line you'll run into a
compatibility issue.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span><span> db: Option&lt;Database&gt; = ..;
</span><span>let</span><span> db = db.</span><span>filter</span><span>(|</span><span>db</span><span>| db.name? == "</span><span>chashu</span><span>");
</span></code></pre>
<p>Take for example the <code>Option::filter</code> API. It takes a type by reference and
returns a bool. If we try and use the <code>?</code> operator inside of it we get an error,
because the function doesn't return <code>Result</code> or <code>Option</code>. Not being able to use
<code>?</code> inside of arbitrary closures is an example of an effect mismatch.</p>
<p>But simple functions like that only scratch the surface. Effect mismatches are
present in almost every single trait in the stdlib too. Take for example
something common like the <code>Debug</code> trait which is implemented on almost every
type in Rust.</p>
<p>We could implement the <code>Debug</code> trait for our made-up type <code>Cat</code>. The parameter
<code>f</code> here implements <code>io::Write</code> and represents a stream of bytes. And using the
<code>write!</code> macro we can write bytes into that stream. But if for some reason we
wanted to write bytes asynchronously into, say, an async socket. Well, we can't
do that. <code>fn fmt</code> is not an async function, which means we can't await inside of
it.</p>
<p>One way out of this could be to create some kind of intermediate buffer, and
synchronously write data into it. We could then write data out of that buffer
asynchronously. But that would involve extra copies we didn't have before.</p>
<p>If we wanted to make it identical to what we did before, the solution would be
to create a <em>new</em> <code>AsyncDebug</code> trait which <em>can</em> write data asynchronously into
the stream. But we now have duplicate traits, and that's exactly the problem
we're trying to prevent.</p>
<p>It's tempting to say that maybe we should just add the <code>AsyncDebug</code> trait and
call it a day. We can then also add async versions of <code>Read</code>, <code>Write</code>, and
<code>Iterator</code> too. And perhaps <code>Hash</code> as well, since it too writes to an output
stream. And what about <code>From</code> and <code>Into</code>? Perhaps <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnOnce</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, and
<code>Drop</code> too since they're built-ins? And so on. The reality is that effect
mismatches are structural, and duplicating the API surface for every effect
mismatch leads to an exponential explosion of APIs. Which is similar to what
we've seen with data type generics earlier on.</p>
<p>Let me try and illustrate this for a second. Say we took the existing family of
<code>Fn</code> traits and introduced effectful versions of them. That is: versions which
work with <code>unsafe</code> <sup><a href="#unsafe-note">1</a></sup>, <code>async</code>, <code>try</code>, <code>const</code>, and generators. With one effect
we're up to six unique traits. With two effects we're up to twelve. With all
five we're suddenly looking at 96 different traits.</p>

<p>The problem space in the stdlib is really broad. From analyzing the Rust 1.70
stdlib, by my estimate about 75% of the stdlib would interact with the const
effect. Around 65% would interact with the async effect. And around 30% would
interact with the try effect. The exact numbers are imprecise because parts of
the various effects are still in-progress. How much this will result in
practice, very much will depend on how we end up designing the language.</p>
<p>If you compare the numbers then it appears that close to 100% of the stdlib
would interact with one or more effect. And about 50% would interact with two or
more effects. If we consider that whenever effects interact with each other they
can lead to exponential blowup, this should warn us that clever one-off
solutions won't cut it. I believe that the best way to deal with this is to
instead allow Rust to enable items to be generic over effects.</p>
<h2 id="stage-i-effect-generic-trait-definitions">Stage I: Effect-Generic Trait Definitions</h2>
<p>Now that we've taken a good look at what happens when we can't be generic over
effects, it's time we start talking about what we can do about it. The answer,
unsurprisingly, is to introduce effect generics into the language. To cover all
uses will take a few steps, so let's start with the first, and arguably most
important one: effect-generic trait definitions.</p>
<p>This is important because it would allow us to introduce effectful traits as
part of the stdlib. Which would among other things would help standardize the
various async ecosystems around the stdlib.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub trait </span><span>Into&lt;T&gt;: Sized {     
</span><span>    </span><span>fn </span><span>into</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; T;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>Into&lt;Loaf&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>Cat {     
</span><span>    </span><span>fn </span><span>into</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Loaf {
</span><span>        </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>nap</span><span>()
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let's use a simple example here: the <code>Into</code> trait. The <code>Into</code> trait is used to
convert from one type into another. It is generic over a type <code>T</code>, and has one
function "into" which consumes <code>Self</code> and returns the type <code>T</code>. Say we have a
type cat which when it takes a nap turns into a cute little loaf. We can
implement <code>Into&lt;Loaf&gt;</code> for <code>Cat</code> by calling <code>self.nap</code> in the function body.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub trait </span><span>AsyncInto&lt;T&gt;: Sized {     
</span><span>    async </span><span>fn </span><span>into</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; T;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>AsyncInto&lt;Loaf&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>Cat {     
</span><span>    async </span><span>fn </span><span>into</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Loaf {
</span><span>        </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>nap</span><span>().await
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>But what if the cat doesn't take a nap straight away? Maybe <code>nap</code> should
actually be an async function. In order to <code>await</code> nap inside the trait impl,
the <code>into</code> method would need to be async. If we were writing an async trait from
scratch, we could do this by exposing a new <code>AsyncInto</code> trait with an async
<code>into</code> method.</p>
<p>But we don't just want to add a new trait to the stdlib, instead we want to
<em>extend</em> the existing <code>Into</code> trait to work with the async effect. The way we
could extend the <code>Into</code> trait with the <code>async</code> effect is by making the async
effect <em>optional</em>. Rather than requiring that the trait is always sync or async,
implementors should be able to choose which version of the trait they want to
implement.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>maybe</span><span>(async)]
</span><span>impl </span><span>Into&lt;Loaf&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>Cat {     
</span><span>    #[</span><span>maybe</span><span>(async)]
</span><span>    </span><span>fn </span><span>into</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Loaf {
</span><span>        </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>nap</span><span>()
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The way this would work is by adding a new notation on the trait: "maybe async".
We don't yet know what syntax we want to use for "maybe async", so in this talk
we'll be using attributes. The way the "maybe async" notation works is that we
mark all methods which we want to be "maybe async" as such. And then mark our
trait itself as "maybe async" too.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>Into&lt;Loaf&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>Cat {     
</span><span>    </span><span>fn </span><span>into</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Loaf {
</span><span>        </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>nap</span><span>()
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>async Into&lt;Loaf&gt; for Cat {     
</span><span>    async </span><span>fn </span><span>into</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Loaf {
</span><span>        </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>nap</span><span>().await
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Implementors then get to choose whether they want to implement the sync or async
versions of the trait. And depending on which version they choose, the methods
then ends up being either sync or async. This system would be entirely
backwards-compatible, because implementing the sync version of <code>Into</code> would
remain the same as it is today. But people who want to implement the async
version would be able to, just by adding a few extra <code>async</code> keywords to the impl.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>async Into&lt;Loaf&gt; for Cat {
</span><span>    async </span><span>fn </span><span>into</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Loaf {
</span><span>        </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>nap</span><span>().await
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>Into&lt;Loaf, true&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>Cat {

</span><span>        }
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Under the hood the implementations desugars to regular Rust code we can already
write today. The sync implementation of the type returns a type <code>T</code>. But the
async impl returns an <code>impl Future</code> of <code>T</code>. Under the hood it is just a single
const bool and some associated types.</p>
<ul>
<li>good diagnostics</li>
<li>gradual stabilization,</li>
<li>backwards-compatibility</li>
<li>clear inference rules</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be reasonable to ask why we're bothering with a language feature, if
the desugaring ends up being so simple. And the reason is: effects are
everywhere, and we want to make sure effect generics feel like part of the
language. That not only means that we want to tightly control the diagnostics.
We also want to enable them to be gradually introduced, have clear language
rules, and be backwards-compatible.</p>
<p>But if you keep all that in mind, it's probably okay to think of effect generics
as mostly syntactic sugar for const bools + associated types.</p>
<h2 id="stage-ii-effect-generic-bounds-impls-and-types">Stage II: Effect-Generic Bounds, Impls, and Types</h2>
<p>Being able to declare effect-generic traits is only the beginning. The stdlib
not only exposes traits, it also exposes various types and functions. And
effect-generic traits don't directly help with that.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub fn </span><span>copy</span><span>&lt;R, W&gt;(
</span><span>    </span><span>reader</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> R,
</span><span>    </span><span>writer</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> W
</span><span>) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    R: Read,
</span><span>    W: Write;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let's take our earlier <code>io::copy</code> example again. As we've said <code>copy</code> takes a
reader and writer, and then copies bytes from the reader to the writer. We've
seen this.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub fn </span><span>async_copy</span><span>&lt;R, W&gt;(
</span><span>    </span><span>reader</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> R,
</span><span>    </span><span>writer</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> W
</span><span>) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    R: AsyncRead,
</span><span>    W: AsyncWrite;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now what would it look like if we tried adding an async version of this to the
stdlib today. Well, we'd need to start by giving it a different name so it
doesn't conflict with the existing <code>copy</code> function. The same goes for the trait
bounds as well, so instead of taking <code>Read</code> and <code>Write</code>, this function would
take <code>AsyncRead</code> and `AsyncWrite.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub fn </span><span>async_copy</span><span>&lt;R, W&gt;(
</span><span>    </span><span>reader</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> R,
</span><span>    </span><span>writer</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> W
</span><span>) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    R: async Read,
</span><span>    W: async Write;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now things get a little better once we have effect-generic trait definitions.
Rather than needing to take async duplicates of the <code>Read</code> and <code>Write</code> traits,
the function can instead choose the async versions of the existing <code>Read</code> and
<code>Write</code> traits. That's already better, but it still means we have two versions
of the <code>copy</code> function.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>maybe</span><span>(async)]
</span><span>pub fn </span><span>copy</span><span>&lt;R, W&gt;(
</span><span>    </span><span>reader</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> R,
</span><span>    </span><span>writer</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> W
</span><span>) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    R: #[maybe(async)] Read,
</span><span>    W: #[maybe(async)] Write;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Instead the ideal solution would be to allow <code>copy</code> itself to be generic over
the async effect, and make that determine which versions of <code>Read</code> and <code>Write</code>
we want. These are what we call "effect-generic bounds". The effect of the
function and the effect of the bounds it takes all become the same. In
literature this is also known as "row-polymorphism".</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>copy</span><span>(reader, writer)?;                </span><span>// infer sync
</span><span>copy</span><span>(reader, writer).await?;          </span><span>// infer async
</span><span>copy::&lt;async&gt;(reader, writer).await?; </span><span>// force async
</span></code></pre>
<p>Because the function itself is now generic over the async effect, we need to
figure out at the call-site which variant we intended to use. This system will
make use of <em>inference</em> to figure it out. That's a fancy way of saying that
the compiler is going to make an educated guess about which effects the
programmer intended to use. If they used <code>.await</code> they probably wanted the async
version. Otherwise they probably wanted the sync version. But as with any guess:
sometimes we guess wrong, so for that reason we want to provide an escape hatch
by enabling program authors to force the variant. We don't know the exact syntax
for this yet, but we assume this would likely be using the turbofish notation.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct </span><span>File { .. }
</span><span>impl </span><span>File {
</span><span>    </span><span>fn </span><span>open</span><span>&lt;P&gt;(</span><span>p</span><span>: P) -&gt; Result&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>    </span><span>where
</span><span>        P: AsRef&lt;Path&gt;;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>But effect-generics aren't just needed for functions. If we want to make the
stdlib work well with effects, then types will need effect-generics too. This
might seem strange at first, since an "async type" might not be very intuitive.
But for example files on Windows need to be initialized as either sync or async.
Which means that whether they're async or not isn't just a property of the
functions, it's a property of the type.</p>
<p>Let's use the stdlib's <code>File</code> type as our example here. For simplicity let's
assume it has a single method: <code>open</code> which returns either an error or a file.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct </span><span>AsyncFile { .. }
</span><span>impl </span><span>AsyncFile {
</span><span>    async </span><span>fn </span><span>open</span><span>&lt;P&gt;(</span><span>p</span><span>: P) -&gt; Result&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>    </span><span>where
</span><span>        P: AsRef&lt;AsyncPath&gt;;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to provide an async version of <code>File</code>, we again would need to
duplicate our interfaces. That means a new type <code>AsyncFile</code>, which has a new
async method <code>open</code>, which takes an async version of <code>Path</code> as an argument. And
<code>Path</code> needs to be async because it itself has async filesystem methods on it.
As I've said before: once you start looking you notice effects popping up
everywhere.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>maybe</span><span>(async)]
</span><span>struct </span><span>File { .. }
</span><span>
</span><span>#[</span><span>maybe</span><span>(async)] 
</span><span>impl </span><span>File {
</span><span>    #[</span><span>maybe</span><span>(async)]
</span><span>    </span><span>fn </span><span>open</span><span>&lt;P&gt;(</span><span>p</span><span>: P) -&gt; Result&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>    </span><span>where
</span><span>        P: AsRef&lt;</span><span>#</span><span>[maybe(async)] Path&gt;;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Instead of creating a second <code>AsyncFile</code> type, with effect generics on types
we'd be able to open <code>File</code> as async instead. Allowing us to keep just the one
<code>File</code> definition for both sync and async variants.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>maybe</span><span>(async)]
</span><span>fn </span><span>copy</span><span>&lt;R, W&gt;(</span><span>reader</span><span>: R, </span><span>writer</span><span>: W) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
</span><span>    </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = vec![</span><span>4028</span><span>];
</span><span>    </span><span>loop </span><span>{
</span><span>        </span><span>match</span><span> reader.</span><span>read</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf).await? {
</span><span>            </span><span>0 </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>return </span><span>Ok(()),
</span><span>            n =&gt; writer.</span><span>write_all</span><span>(&amp;buf[</span><span>0</span><span>..n]).await?,
</span><span>        }
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now I've sort of hand-waved away the internal implementations of both the <code>copy</code>
function and the <code>File</code> type. The way they work is a little different for the
two. In the case of the <code>copy</code> function, the implementation between the async
and non-async variants would be identical. If the function is compiled as async,
everything works as written. But if the function compiles as sync, then we just
remove the <code>.await</code>s and the function should compile as expected.</p>
<p>As a result of this "maybe-async" functions can only call sync or other
"maybe-async" functions. But that should be fine for most cases.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>File {
</span><span>    #[</span><span>maybe</span><span>(async)]
</span><span>    </span><span>fn </span><span>open</span><span>&lt;P&gt;(</span><span>p</span><span>: P) -&gt; Result&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt; {
</span><span>        </span><span>if </span><span>IS_ASYNC </span><span>{ .. } </span><span>else </span><span>{ .. }
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Concrete types like <code>File</code> are a little trickier. They often want to run
different code depending on which effects it has. Luckily types like <code>File</code>
already conditionally compile different code depending on the platform, so
introducing new types conditions shouldn't be too big of a jump. The key thing
we need is a way to detect in the function body whether code is being compiled
as async or not - basically a fancy bool.</p>
<p>We can already do this for the const effect using the <code>const_eval_select</code>
intrinsic. It's currently unstable and a little verbose, but it works reliably.
We should be able to easily adapt it to something similar for async and the rest
of the effects too.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-effects">What are effects?</h2>
<p>Systems research on effects has been a topic in computer science for nearly 40
years. That's about as old as C++. It's become a bit of a hot topic recently in
PL spheres with research languages such as Koka, Eff, and Frank showing how
effects can be useful. And languages such as Scala, and to a lesser extent
Swift, adopting effect features.</p>
<p>When people talk about effects they will broadly refer to one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Algebraic Effect Types:</strong> which are semantic notations on functions and contexts
that grant a permission to <em>do</em> something.</li>
<li><strong>Algebraic Effect Handlers:</strong> which are a kind of typed control-flow
primitive which allows people to define their own versions of <code>async/.await</code>,
<code>try..catch</code>, and <code>yield</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of languages which have effects provide both effect types and effect
handlers. These can be used together, but they are in fact distinct features. In
this talk we'll only be discussing effect types.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>meow</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) {}
</span><span>pub const unsafe fn </span><span>meow</span><span>() {}
</span></code></pre>
<p>What we've been calling "effects" in this talk so far have in fact been <em>effect
types</em>. Rust hasn't historically called them this, and I believe that's probably
why effect generics weren't on our radar until recently. But it turns out that
reinterpreting some of our keywords as effect types actually makes perfect
sense, and provides us with a strong theoretical framework for how to reason
about them.</p>
<p>We also have <code>unsafe</code> which allows you to call <code>unsafe</code> functions. The unstable
try-block feature which doesn't require you to <code>Ok</code>-wrap return types. The
unstable generator closure syntax which gives you access to the <code>yield</code> keyword.
And of course the <code>const</code> keyword which allows you evaluate code at
compile-time.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>async { </span><span>async_fn</span><span>().await }; </span><span>// async effect
</span><span>unsafe </span><span>{ </span><span>unsafe_fn</span><span>() };     </span><span>// unsafe effect
</span><span>const </span><span>{ </span><span>const_fn</span><span>() };       </span><span>// const effect
</span><span>try { </span><span>try_fn</span><span>()? };          </span><span>// try effect (unstable)
</span><span>|| { </span><span>yield</span><span> my_type };       </span><span>// generator effect (unstable)
</span></code></pre>
<p>In Rust we currently have five different effects: <code>async</code>, <code>unsafe</code>, <code>const</code>,
<code>try</code>, and generators. All six of these are in various stages of completion. For
example: async Rust has functions and blocks, but no iterators or drop. Const
doesn't have access to traits yet. Unsafe functions can't be lowered to <code>Fn</code>
traits. Try does have the <code>?</code> operator, but try blocks are unstable. And
generators are entirely unstable; we only have the <code>Iterator</code> trait.</p>
<p>Some of these effects are what folks on the lang team have started calling
"carried". Those are effects which will desugar to an actual type in the type
system. For example when you write <code>async fn</code>, the return type will desugar to
an <code>impl Future</code>.</p>
<p>Some other effects are what we're calling: <em>"uncarried"</em>. These effects don't desugar
to any types in the type system, but serve only as a way to communicate
information back to the compiler. This is for example <code>const</code> or <code>unsafe</code>. While
we do check that the effects are used correctly, they don't end up being lowered
to actual types.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span><span> x = try async { .. };
</span></code></pre>
<pre><code><span>1. -&gt; impl Future&lt;Output = Result&lt;T, E&gt;&gt;
</span><span>2. -&gt; Result&lt;impl Future&lt;Output = T&gt;, E&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>When we talk about carried effects, effect composition becomes important. Take
for example "async" and "try" together. If we have a function which has both?
What should the resulting type be? A future of Result? Or a Result containing a
Future?</p>
<p>Effects on functions are order-independent <em>sets</em>. While Rust currently does
require you declare effects in a specific order, carried effects themselves can
only be composed in one way. When we stabilized <code>async/.await</code>, we decided that
if an async function returned a Result, that should always return an <code>impl Future</code> of <code>Result</code>.  And because effects are <em>sets</em> and not dependent on
ordering, we can define the way carried effects should compose as part of the
language.</p>
<p>People can still opt-out from the built-in composition rules by manually writing
function signatures. But this is rare, and for the overwhelming majority of uses
the built-in composition rules will be the right choice.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>const fn </span><span>meow</span><span>() {}  </span><span>// maybe-const
</span><span>const </span><span>{}            </span><span>// always-const
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>const</code> effect is a bit different from the other effects. <code>const</code> blocks are
<em>always</em> evaluated during compilation. While <code>const</code> functions merely <em>can</em> be
evaluated during during compilation. It's perfectly fine to call them at runtime
too. This means that when we write <code>const fn</code>, we're already writing
effect-generics. This mechanism is the reason why we've gradually been able to
introduce const into the stdlib in a backwards-compatible way.</p>
<p>Const is also a bit strange in that among other things it disallows access to
the host runtime, it can't allocate, and it can't access globals. This feels
different from effects like say, <code>async</code>, which only allow you to do more
things.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>effect set</th><th>can access</th><th>cannot access</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>std rust</td><td>non-termination, unwinding, non-determinism, statics, runtime heap, host APIs</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
<tr><td>alloc</td><td>non-termination, unwinding, non-determinism, globals, runtime heap</td><td>host APIs</td></tr>
<tr><td>core</td><td>non-termination, unwinding, non-determinism, globals</td><td>runtime heap, host APIs</td></tr>
<tr><td>const</td><td>non-termination, unwinding</td><td>non-determinism, globals, runtime heap, host APIs</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>What's missing from this picture is that all functions in Rust carry an implicit
set of effects. Including some effects we can't directly name yet. When we write
<code>const</code> functions, our functions have a different set of effects, than if we
write <code>no_std</code> functions, which again are different from regular "std" rust
functions.</p>
<p>The right way of thinking about const, std, etc. is as adding a different
effects to the empty set of effects. If we start from zero, then all effects are
merely additive. They just add up to different numbers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in Rust we can't yet name the empty set of effects. In effect
theory this is called the "total effect". And some languages such as Koka do
support the "total" effect. In fact, Koka's lead developer has estimated that
around 70% of a typical Koka program can be total. Which begs the question: if
we could express the total effect in Rust, could we see similar numbers?</p>
<h2 id="stage-iii-more-effects">Stage III: More Effects</h2>
<p>So far we've only talked about how we could finish the work on existing effects
such as <code>const</code> and <code>async</code>. But one nice thing of effect generics is that they
would not only allow us to finish our ongoing effects work. It would also lower
the cost of introducing <em>new</em> effects to the language.</p>
<p>Which opens up the question: if we could add more effects, which effects might
make sense to add? The obvious ones would be to actually finish adding <code>try</code> and
generator functions. But beyond that, there are some interesting effects we
could explore. For brevity I'll only discuss what these features are, and not
show code examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>no-divergence</strong>: guarantees that a function cannot loop indefinitely,
opening up the ability to perform static runtime-cost analysis.</li>
<li><strong>no-panic</strong>: guarantees a function will never produce a panic, causing
the function to unwind.</li>
<li><strong>parametricity</strong>: guarantees that a function only operates on its arguments. That
means no implicit access to statics, no global filesystem, no thread-locals.</li>
<li><strong>capability-safety</strong>: guarantees that a function is not only parametric, but can't
downcast abstract types either. Say if you get an <code>impl Read</code>, you can't reverse
it to obtain a <code>File</code>.</li>
<li><strong>destructor linearity</strong>: guarantees that <code>Drop</code> will <em>always</em> be called,
making it a safety guarantee.</li>
<li><strong>pattern types</strong>: enables functions to operate directly on variants of enums
and numbers</li>
<li><strong>must-not-move types</strong>: would be a generalization of pinning and the
pin-project system, making it a first-class language feature</li>
</ul>
<p>Though there's nothing inherently stopping us from adding any of these features
into Rust today, in order to integrate them into the stdlib without breaking
backwards-compatibility we need effect generics first.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>effect </span><span>const  </span><span>= diverge + panic;
</span><span>effect core   = </span><span>const </span><span>+ statics + non_determinism;
</span><span>effect alloc  = core + heap;
</span><span>effect std    = alloc + host_apis;
</span></code></pre>
<p>This brings us to the final part of the design space: effect aliases. If we keep
adding effects it's very easy to eventually reach into a situation where we have
our own version of "public static void main".</p>
<p>In order to mitigate that it would instead be great if we could name specific
sets of effects. In a way we've already done that, where <code>const</code> represents "may
loop forever" and "may panic". If we actually had "may loop forever" and "may
panic" as built-in effects, then we could redefine <code>const</code> as an alias to those.</p>
<p>Fundamentally this doesn't change anything we've talked about so far. It's just
that this would syntactically be a lot more pleasant to work with. So if we ever
reach a state where we have effect generics and we want notice we maybe have one
too many notation in front of our functions, it may be time for us to start
looking into this more seriously.</p>
<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>Rust already includes effect types such as async, const, try, and unsafe.
Because we can't be generic over effect types yet, we usually have to choose
between either duplicating code, or just not addressing the use case. And this
makes for a language which feels incredibly rough once you start using effects.
Effect generics provide us with a way to be generic over effects, and we've
shown they can be implemented today as mostly as syntax sugar over
const-generics.</p>
<p>We're currently in the process of formalizing the effect generic work via the
A-Mir-Formality. MIR Formality is an in-progress formal model of Rust's type
system. Because effect generics are relatively straight forward but have
far-reaching consequences for the type system, it is an ideal candidate to test
as part of the formal model.</p>
<p>In parallel the const WG has also begun refactoring the way const functions are
checked in the compiler. In the past const-checking happened right before borrow
checking at the MIR level. In the new system const-checking will happen much
sooner, at the HIR level. This will not only make the code more maintainable, it
will also be generalizable to more effects if needed.</p>
<p>Once both the formal modeling and compiler refactorings conclude, we'll begin
drafting an RFC for effect-generic trait definitions. We expect this to happen
sometime in 2024.</p>
<p>And that's the end of this talk. Thank you so much for being with me all the way
to the end. None of the work in this talk would have been possible without the
following people:</p>

<p>Insiders in the Dev Channel will gain a set of new features such as <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/11/29/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26002-canary-channel/">energy saver</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/10/05/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25967-canary-channel/">scrollable quick settings</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/10/18/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25977-canary-channel/">QR codes for Wi-Fi sharing</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/11/08/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25992-canary-channel/">support for creating 7-zip and TAR archives in addition to ZIP in File Explorer</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/12/13/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26016-canary-channel/">Windows protected print mode</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/01/26/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26040-canary-channel/">voice clarity</a>, along with <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/11/08/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25992-canary-channel/">recent Server Message Block (SMB) protocol changes</a> and <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/01/26/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26040-canary-channel/">improvements to Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)</a>, and improvements across Settings and improvements for Bluetooth and Graphics as well. Note that apps such as Tips and WordPad will be removed after upgrading to this build.</p>
<p>The Canary and Dev Channels receiving the same builds is only temporary. <strong>During the times in which the Canary and Dev Channels are on the same builds (e.g. Build 26052), the window is open for Insiders in the Canary Channel to switch to the Dev Channel.</strong> At some point in the future, the Canary Channel will jump to higher build numbers and the window will be closed.</p>
<p>If you are a gamer, please take note that <strong>some popular games may not work correctly or crash when launched on these builds</strong>. Over time, we expect this experience to improve as bugs get fixed.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: As part of this move, rollouts for some features in the Dev Channel may get reset which means in a small number of cases features might disappear. As we ramp up feature rollouts, these features should return over time. Some features may begin rolling out to the Canary Channel first before the Dev Channel even if the two channels have the same build. </em></p>
<h2><strong>What’s new in Build 26052</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Sudo for Windows&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-sudo-for-windows">Sudo for Windows</a> provides a new, yet familiar way to elevate processes directly from the command-line.</p>

<p>The sudo command can be configured to run in three different modes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>In a new window:</strong> A new window will open in which the elevated command will run.</li>
<li><strong>With input disabled:</strong> The elevated command will run inline with its stdin closed in the window from which you’ve triggered elevation. You will not be able to interact with the elevated process.</li>
<li><strong>Inline:</strong> The elevated command will run inline in the window from which you’ve triggered elevation. This mode is most similar to the sudo experience on other platforms.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is recommended that you review the security considerations for <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-sudo-for-windows">each mode here</a> before enabling the sudo command on your machine.</p>
<p>Here is how you can enable the sudo command:&nbsp;<strong>Just navigate to Settings &gt; System &gt; For developers and toggle on the sudo command.</strong> Configure how the sudo command behaves by selected one of the modes in the drop-down menu (In a new window, with input disabled, inline).</p>
<p><em>NOTE: The setting for enabling Sudo may incorrectly be showing on Windows Server Insider Preview builds – this feature will not be available on Windows Server and the setting will be disabled in a future Server Insider Preview build.</em></p>

<h3><strong>Enhancements in Hearing Aid Support&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>As <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/10/18/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25977-canary-channel/">announced in October 2023</a>, Windows took a step forward in accessibility, allowing direct pairing, audio streaming, and smooth call handling for customers with <strong>Bluetooth® Low Energy Audio</strong> (LE Audio) supported hearing aids on LE Audio-compatible PCs. Now, we are thrilled to introduce a set of features that will take this support to the next level: We’re introducing new capabilities to control audio presets, ambient sounds, and experience enhancements to the <strong>Settings &gt; Bluetooth &amp; devices</strong> page.</p>
<p>Customers can now adjust the audio presets that they or their audiologist configured in their hearing aids, right from the Settings or Quick Settings UI in Windows. These controls allow customers to quickly adjust the behavior of their hearing aids to their preference for the environment they’re in. Preset options and availability will vary based on the model and configuration of hearing aids.</p>
<figure id="attachment_176860" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176860"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/Sound-L3-Hearing-Aids-UX.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/Sound-L3-Hearing-Aids-UX-1024x559.png" alt="Control ambient sound for hearing aids in Settings." width="595" height="325"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176860">Control ambient sound for hearing aids in Settings.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We’re also introducing capabilities for customers to adjust the volume of ambient sound captured by their hearing aids. These controls adjust the balance between streamed audio and sound picked up from the surrounding environment, helping customers choose what they want to focus on. Ambient sound control availability will vary based on the model of hearing aids.</p>
<p>These features require both your Windows device and hearing aid to support Bluetooth LE Audio. Note that not all Windows 11 PCs or hearing aids, even ones that support Bluetooth LE, have support for LE Audio. To learn more about LE Audio compatibility on Windows, please visit this link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/windows/check-if-your-windows-11-pc-supports-bluetooth-low-energy-audio-2b79c085-0353-4467-8306-ebb2657a91de">Check if your Windows 11 PC supports Bluetooth Low Energy Audio</a>. To learn more about LE Audio compatibility with hearing aids, consult your manufacturer or audiologist.</p>
<p>We’ve also enhanced the Bluetooth &amp; devices settings page to provide additional functionality. Customers will now be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor essential Bluetooth device details when available, such as battery life and connection status, through an expandable menu for each connected device.</li>
<li>For audio devices, effortlessly access the <strong>System &gt; Sound &gt; Properties</strong> page to control audio settings for that device.</li>
</ul>
<p>These new enhancements are available for hearing aids and all other devices on this page. To try out this feature, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Bluetooth &amp; devices &gt; Devices</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Audio mic test utility to test audio in different processing modes</strong></h3>
<p>Windows now offers a convenient way to test the difference between Default and Communication mode audio. This new utility can be found under the microphone properties via <strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Sound</strong>. You can select the mode and record/listen to audio in both modes, allowing you to easily compare audio processing modes for applications built for the Windows ecosystem. Some audio drivers come with special audio effects for communications, and the toggle lets users hear how audio captured in your microphone sounds when recorded by a communications application versus a non-communications application. It’s important to note that the utility is for testing purposes only and will not affect the actual mode of the audio. You can use this to try out the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/01/26/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26040-canary-channel/">Voice Clarity</a> feature in the last flight!</p>

<h2><strong>Changes and Improvements</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>[General]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Starting with Build 26-xx today, Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels will see the versioning updated under Settings &gt; System &gt; About (and winver) to version 24H2. <strong>This denotes that Windows 11, version 24H2 will be this year’s annual feature update. </strong><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information">As mentioned here</a>, Windows 11 will have an annual feature update cadence that releases in the second half of the calendar year.</li>
<li>Plugging in to use a Windows Mixed Reality headset will not work starting with this build. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/before-you-start">Windows Mixed Reality&nbsp;</a>is no longer available to users <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features">as Windows Mixed Reality has been announced as deprecated</a>. This includes the&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/install-windows-mixed-reality">Mixed Reality Portal&nbsp;app</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/using-steamvr-with-windows-mixed-reality">Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR</a> and Steam VR Beta.&nbsp;Existing Windows Mixed Reality devices will continue to work with Steam through November 2026, if users remain on their current released version of Windows 11 (version 23H2) and do not upgrade to this year’s annual feature update for Windows 11 (version 24H2). This deprecation does not impact HoloLens.</li>
<li>Microsoft Defender Application Guard (MDAG) is no longer available as a feature on demand starting with this build. Microsoft Defender Application Guard for Office and Edge <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features">has been announced as deprecated</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Copilot in Windows*]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We are trying out a new experience for Copilot in Windows that helps showcase the ways that Copilot can accelerate and enhance your work. This experience will show when you copy text – since Copilot supports helpful actions that you can take with text content. In this scenario, the Copilot icon will change appearance and animate to indicate that Copilot can help (there are several different treatments so you may notice a different visual effect). When you hover your mouse over the Copilot icon, it will provide a menu of actions that you can take, such as summarizing or explaining the copied text. If you select an action on the menu, it will launch Copilot with the action ready-to-go. We will also support the ability to launch Copilot if you start dragging an image – just drag the image file onto the Copilot icon in the taskbar, and Copilot will open. You can then drop the image into the text box in Copilot and type an action that you would like to take on the image content.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_176862" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176862"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/copilot-nudges.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/copilot-nudges.png" alt="Copilot actions you can take when you mouse over the Copilot icon on the taskbar after copying some text." width="246" height="234"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176862">Copilot actions you can take when you mouse over the Copilot icon on the taskbar after copying some text.</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>After <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/01/11/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23615-dev-channel/">temporarily disabling</a> this experience to fix an issue, we are trying out opening Copilot automatically when Windows starts on widescreen devices again with some Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels. This can be managed via Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Copilot. Note that this is rolling out so not all Insiders in the Dev Channel will see this right away.&nbsp;We’re trying this experience out on devices that have minimum diagonal screen size of 27” and pixel width of 1920 pixels and limited to primary display screens in multi-monitor scenarios. As a reminder, we regularly try out different experiences with Windows Insiders that may not ever ship, and others could show up in future Windows releases when they’re ready.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_176809" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176809"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/01/CopilotSettings.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/01/CopilotSettings-1024x784.png" alt="New Copilot Settings page." width="565" height="433"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176809">New Copilot Settings page.</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>[Taskbar &amp; System Tray]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We have updated the energy saver icon for desktop PCs (PCs without batteries). This icon is shown on the system tray when energy saver is enabled, under quick settings, and under Settings &gt; System power &amp; battery.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_176863" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176863"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/energy-saver-icon-changes.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/energy-saver-icon-changes.png" alt="Different energy saver icons on the system tray for desktop PCs and laptops." width="639" height="193"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176863">Different energy saver icons on the system tray for desktop PCs and laptops.</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>[File Explorer]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span dir="ltr"><strong>[ADDED 2/9]</strong> The preview thumbnail title in the taskbar, ALT + Tab and Task View for File Explorer windows will now indicate if that window includes multiple tabs.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Bluetooth]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Today, when discovering available Bluetooth devices to connect to, Windows filters out device classes that are uncommon. Customers who wish to override this filter and see all nearby devices available to pair can do so by choosing “Advanced” for the “Bluetooth devices discovery” setting. Starting with this build, we are removing that option and introducing some changes to the add device workflow to streamline this experience. Now, discovery will always scan for all devices, but only show common device types by default. Whenever an “uncommon” device is found during the discovery process, an option to “Show all devices” will be displayed to the customer.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Graphics]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Windows Insiders who use the Color Management Control Panel to make changes to their color profiles can now use the all-new Color management settings page located under <strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Display &gt; Color management</strong>. This new settings page will allow users to add or remove color profiles, as well as set default color profiles for the connected displays. In addition, auto color management can now be found on the new Color management settings page.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_176864" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176864"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/color-management-before-after.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/color-management-before-after-1024x464.png" alt="Old Color Management Control Panel and new Color Management settings page." width="633" height="287"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176864">Old Color Management Control Panel and new Color Management settings page.</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>[Registry Editor]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Registry Editor now supports limiting a search to the currently selected key and its descendants.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_176865" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176865"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/registry-search-subtree.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/registry-search-subtree.png" alt="New search in subtree option for searching in Registry Editor." width="388" height="240"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176865">New search in subtree option for searching in Registry Editor.</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>[Developer APIs]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Starting with this build, we are introducing the Power Grid Forecast API. This API empowers app developers to optimize app behavior, minimizing environmental impact by shifting background tasks to times when more renewable energy is available in the local electrical grid. The result is lower carbon emissions for app users. Please note that forecast quality varies by region and is not available globally. While the API is available in this build, we are still working on public documentation, sample code, and we have a couple of bug fixes checked in. All of this should make its way to Insiders in the coming weeks.</li>
<li>We are adding an energy saver notification callback setting GUID to represent the new energy saver experience introduced in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/11/29/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26002-canary-channel/">Build 26002</a>. Apps can subscribe to the energy saver status by passing the appropriate GUID to the PowerSettingRegisterNotification API and can implement different behaviors to optimize energy or performance depending on the current energy saver status. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/power/power-setting-guids">More details can be found in here</a>.</li>
<li>We are making a minor extension of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/powersetting/ne-powersetting-effective_power_mode">existing Effective Power Mode API</a> to interpret the new energy saver levels when determining the returned effective power mode. Documentation will be updated shortly.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Security]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Developers can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/seccng/cng-portal">Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG)</a> framework to help secure Windows keys with virtualization-based security (VBS). <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/advancing-key-protection-in-windows-with-vbs/ba-p/4050988">See this blog post here for details</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>[<strong>Settings</strong>]</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can go Settings &gt; Bluetooth &amp; devices &gt; Printers &amp; scanners to choose to setup <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/12/13/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26016-canary-channel/">Windows protected print mode</a> but clicking the setup button under “Printer preferences”. This experience will continue to be refined in future flights.</li>
<li>We moved the option to show <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/22/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22621-1906-and-22631-1906/">your Wi-Fi password</a> to the top of the Wi-Fi properties page under Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Wi-Fi.</li>
<li><strong>[ADDED]</strong> <span dir="ltr">We have updated the UI for Storage Spaces under Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; Storage Spaces to more intuitively reflect Spaces. Some key changes include: remove confusing and/misleading status icons, replace links to Disk Management with links to Disks &amp; Volumes, share drive labels and letter, when applicable, offering an explanation for a term when hovering over it, and adding upgrade and delete pool. This UI change should provide greater ease of storage management on Windows. &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Other]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We’ve adjusted the text in the notification when a PC detects a slow charger.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_176866" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176866"><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/slow-charger-notif.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/44/2024/02/slow-charger-notif.png" alt="Updated notification when a PC detects a slow charger." width="398" height="271"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176866">Updated notification when a PC detects a slow charger.</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>You can now use the Camera app to join a Wi-Fi network. Just scan a QR code with Wi-Fi details and a link will be provided that will open Settings to quickly get the new Wi-Fi profile added and connected. As a reminder, starting with <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/10/18/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25977-canary-channel/">Build 25977</a> in the Canary Channel you can create your own QR code for Wi-Fi and share it with others. This also works for mobile hotspots too.</li>

<h2><strong>Known issues</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>[General]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>[IMPORTANT NOTE FOR GAMERS – UPDATED!] Some popular games may not work correctly and cause a bugcheck (green screen) when launched on the most recent Insider Preview builds in the Canary Channel. Please be sure to submit feedback in Feedback Hub on any issues you see with playing games on these builds.</strong></li>
<li>Content in some video streaming apps from the Microsoft Store may not play. As a workaround, try streaming from a browser.</li>
<li>[<strong>NEW</strong>] We’re working on the fix for an issue causing an increase in Insiders experiencing black screens starting with Build 26040 (including when waking your PC from sleep). If you encounter this, pressing WIN + CTRL + Shift + B may resolve it.</li>
<li><strong>[ADDED]</strong> <span dir="ltr">A Display Connection section is incorrectly showing up under Settings &gt; System &gt; Display &gt; Graphics that when clicked, will crash Settings. This section will be removed in a future flight.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>[ADDED 2/9]&nbsp;IMPORTANT NOTE FOR DEV DRIVE USERS:</strong> Insiders on Build 26052 who have Dev Drives and might need to rollback <strong>will need to back up their Dev Drives BEFORE rolling back</strong> as rolling back will cause Dev Drives to break and data on them to be lost.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>[Widgets]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard navigation from settings subpages back to the top-level Settings page is broken.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Microsoft Store Update</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Reminders for Windows Insiders</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Canary and Dev Channels receive builds with features and experiences that may never get released as we try out different concepts and get feedback. Features may change over time, be removed, or replaced and never get released beyond Windows Insiders. Some of these features and experiences could show up in future Windows releases <strong>when they’re ready</strong>.</li>
<li>Many features in the Canary and Dev Channel are rolled out using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/windows/delivering-continuous-innovation-in-windows-11-b0aa0a27-ea9a-4365-9224-cb155e517f12">Controlled Feature Rollout technology</a>, starting with a subset of Insiders and ramping up over time as we monitor feedback to see how they land before pushing them out to everyone in these channels.</li>
<li>As the Canary and Dev Channels receive the same builds, some features may begin rolling out to the Canary Channel first before the Dev Channel.</li>
<li>While the Canary Channel is now on Windows 11, version 24H2, this is just temporary. At some point in the future, the Canary Channel will jump ahead to receiving new builds not matched to any specific release in a higher build series.</li>
<li>To get off the Canary or Dev Channel, <a href="https://aka.ms/HowtoCleanInstall">a clean install of Windows 11 will be required</a>. As a reminder – Insiders can’t switch to a channel that is receiving builds with lower build numbers without doing a clean installation of Windows 11 due to technical setup requirements.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The desktop watermark shown at the lower right corner of the desktop is normal for these pre-release builds.</li>
</ul>

<li>Check out <a href="https://aka.ms/flighthub">Flight Hub</a> for a complete look at what build is in which Insider channel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Copilot in Windows* in preview is being rolled out gradually to Windows Insiders in select global markets. The initial markets for the Copilot in Windows preview include North America, United Kingdom and parts of Asia and South America. It is our intention to add additional markets over time.</li>
</ul>
