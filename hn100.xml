            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/ice-and-the-smartphone-panopticon">https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/ice-and-the-smartphone-panopticon</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45767325">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure data-testid="cne-audio-embed-figure"></figure><p>Last week, as <em>ICE</em> raids ramped up in New York, city residents set about resisting in the ways they had available: confronting agents directly on sidewalks, haranguing them as they processed down blocks, and recording them on phone cameras held aloft. Relentless <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/11/ices-spectacle-of-intimidation">documentation</a> has proved something of an effective tool against President Donald Trump’s empowerment of <em>ICE</em>; agents have taken to wearing masks in fear of exposure, and the proliferation of imagery showing armed police and mobilized National Guard troops in otherwise calm cities has underlined the cruel absurdity of their activities. Activist memes have been minted on social media: a woman on New York’s Canal Street, dressed in a polka-dotted office-casual dress, flipping <em>ICE</em> agents off; a man in Washington, D.C., throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in August. The recent “No Kings” marches were filled with protesters in inflatable frog costumes, inspired by a similarly outfitted man who got pepper-sprayed protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon. Some might write the memes off as resistance porn, but digital content is at least serving as a lively defense mechanism in the absence of functional politics.</p><p>At the same time, social media has served as a reinvigorated source of transparency in recent weeks, harking back to the days when Twitter became an organizing tool during the Arab Spring, in the early twenty-tens, or when Facebook and Instagram helped fuel the Black Lives Matter marches of 2020. The grassroots optimism of that earlier social-media era is long gone, though, replaced by a sense of posting as a last resort. After Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-conflict-on-the-streets-of-chicago">in Chicago</a> earlier this month, the governor of Illinois, J.&nbsp;B. Pritzker, told residents to “record and narrate what you see—put it on social media.” But, if the anti-<em>MAGA</em> opposition is taking advantage of the internet, <em>ICE</em> and the Trump Administration are, too. Right-wing creators have been using the same channels to identify and publicize targets for raids. According to reporting in Semafor, the Trump-friendly YouTuber Nick Shirley’s videos of African migrant vendors on Canal Street seemed to help drive recent <em>ICE</em> sweeps of the area. <em>ICE</em> itself is also working to monitor social media. The investigative outlet <em>The Lever</em> found documents revealing that the agency has enlisted an A.I.-driven surveillance product called Zignal Labs that creates “curated detection feeds” to aid in criminal investigations. According to reporting in <em>Wired</em>, <em>ICE</em> also has plans to build out a team of dozens of analysts to monitor social media and identify targets. Recent videos, identified by 404 Media and other publications, have purportedly shown <em>ICE</em> agents using technology developed by the data-analytics firm Palantir, founded by Peter Thiel and others, to scan social-media accounts, government records, and biometrics data of those they detain. Social media has become a political panopticon in which your posts are a conduit for your politics, and what you post can increasingly be used against you.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new wave of digital tools has emerged to help surveil the surveillants. The apps ICEBlock, Red Dot, and DEICER all allow users to pinpoint where <em>ICE</em> agents are active, forming an online version of a whisper network to alert potential targets. Eyes Up provides a way for users to record and upload footage of abusive law-enforcement activity, building an archive of potential evidence. Its creator is a software developer named Mark (who uses only his first name to separate the project from his professional work); he was inspired to create Eyes Up earlier this year, when he began seeing clips of <em>ICE</em> abductions and harassment circulating on social media and worried about their shelf life. As he put it to me, “They could disappear at any given moment, whether the platforms decide to moderate, whether the individual deletes their account or the post.”</p><p>Ultimately, the app itself was also vulnerable to sudden disappearance. After launching, on September 1st, Eyes Up accumulated thousands of downloads and thousands of minutes of uploaded footage. Then, on October 3rd, Mark received a notice that Apple was removing the app from its store on the grounds that it may “harm a targeted individual or group.” Eyes Up is not alone. ICEBlock and Red Dot have been blocked from both Apple and Google’s app stores, the two largest marketplaces; DEICER, like Eyes Up, was removed by Apple. Pressure on the tech platforms seemed to come from the Trump Administration; after a deadly shooting at an <em>ICE</em> field office in Dallas in late September, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that ICEBlock “put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” Mark is contesting Apple’s decision about Eyes Up through its official channels, and the creator of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, has argued that his app should be treated no differently than services, such as Google’s Waze, that allow users to warn one another of highway speed traps. But for now they must try to make do with a limited reach.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The politicized removal of these tools reflects an irony—<em>ICE</em> is aggrieved that its own tactics have been turned against it. Mark described a “double standard”: applications of technology that are friendly to the Administration’s goals are going unchallenged, in part because tech companies have become increasingly willing to support the President’s whims. “It’s clear whose rules they’re following, who they are trying to win over,” Mark said. Like other forms of self expression, digital-communication technology has become dangerously circumscribed under Trump; only the tools that exist independent of Big Tech seem like safe bets for dissent. Posting clips of the polka-dotted-dress lady on social media might be cathartic, but it will take the resistance only so far.</p><p>Still, we record and we post because it’s better than the alternative, which is suffering governmental predations in silence. This past weekend, a friend of mine in Washington, D.C., where I live, sent a photo she had taken of armed National Guard members patrolling the Sunday-morning farmers’ market in Dupont Circle. Trump’s militarized policing has operated on and off in the city <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/25/trump-sends-in-the-national-guard">since August</a>, when the Administration seized control of the local police force, and residents have become all too accustomed to seeing camouflaged troops intrude on our daily routines. Most often, I encounter them walking through largely empty residential streets in the middle of the afternoon, and I take photos with my phone to mark the ominous superfluity of the exercise: our President’s extreme and dangerous response to a nonexistent emergency. Sharing footage is a small reminder that this is really happening.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms traditional full attention methods across various contexts, including short, long, and reinforcement learning (RL) scaling regimes.
At it's core is Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)—a refined version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06464" rel="nofollow">Gated DeltaNet</a> that introduces a more efficient gating mechanism to optimize the use of finite-state RNN memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Kimi Linear achieves superior performance and hardware efficiency, especially for long-context tasks. It reduces the need for large KV caches by up to 75% and boosts decoding throughput by up to <math-renderer data-run-id="f25158f9fd31eccbf36457b4050ca2f6">$6\times$</math-renderer> for context as long as 1M tokens.</p>
<p dir="auto">We open-sourced the KDA kernel in <a href="https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/tree/main/fla/ops/kda">FLA</a>, and released two versions model checkpoints trained with 5.7T tokens.</p>

<p>For years, one of my businesses has been a regular user of <strong>Wise</strong> (formerly TransferWise). Wise is a financial service that lets you send and receive money across currencies, often at a better rate and lower fee than traditional banks. Sounds great, right?</p>



<p>Until it isn’t.</p>



<p>This is our story – a sobering, frustrating, and frankly <em>appalling</em> experience that ended with our business and personal accounts being shut down, without any meaningful reason, support, or recourse.</p>



<p>And all we did? We <strong>updated our address</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>🏢 A Routine Change Turned Nightmare</strong></h2>



<p>Like many businesses, we recently moved into a new office. Alongside the usual updates to suppliers and records, we updated our <strong>physical address</strong> with Wise. Not long after, we received an email requesting us to <strong>verify</strong> the new address.</p>



<p>Fair enough – we had no problem with that.</p>



<p>Wise provided a dropdown list of acceptable documents: a lease agreement, rates notice, tax document, utilities bill, or telecommunications bill. Due to our company structure, most of those documents are in the name of our parent company or show our PO Box (which NZ Post requires, since they won’t deliver to our street address). But we had a <strong>telecommunications bill</strong> that ticked every box:</p>



<ul>
<li>Correct entity name ✅</li>



<li>Correct physical street address ✅</li>



<li>Even detailed our fibre connection at the new premises ✅</li>
</ul>



<p>So we uploaded it – and assumed that would be the end of it.</p>



<p><strong>We were so wrong.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>📞 The Call That Made No Sense</strong></h2>



<p>Days later, we received an email: our document was <strong>rejected</strong>. </p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="593" height="327" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 593w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>No clear reason. So, I called Wise and explained the situation to the customer service representative.</p>



<p>Her response left me stunned.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The document was rejected because it was a <em>tax invoice</em>, not a <em>bill</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wait… what?</p>



<p>I paused, trying to process this. I politely explained that in <strong>New Zealand, a “tax invoice” is a legal form of a bill</strong> – even down to the name “tax invoice” being a legal requirement by IRD, and that’s how telecommunications companies issue invoices here. But she refused to accept it.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It needs to say <em>Telecommunications Bill</em> at the top,” she insisted.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>“A tax invoice isn’t acceptable.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is simply <strong>not true</strong>, and completely out of touch with New Zealand’s business documentation standards. The rep wouldn’t budge.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>🧠 The “Solution” That Was Beyond Belief</strong></h2>



<p>Still trying to find a solution, I asked: <em>what do you recommend I do then?</em></p>



<p>Her answer?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You should find a local shared workspace, lease a desk under your company name, change your registered office to that address, and use that lease document to verify your address with us.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yes, you read that right.</p>



<p>Wise’s advice was to <strong>artificially lease a desk we didn’t need, change our registered address, and use that document</strong> – just to verify an address we actually operate from.</p>



<p>I asked to speak to a manager. That request was <strong>refused</strong>. She told me, flatly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I <em>am</em> providing you with the correct information.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A bit more back and forth… then the call <strong>was disconnected</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>📞 A Glimmer of Hope – Then The Hammer Falls</strong></h2>



<p>Later that day, I received a call back from Wise – not from a manager (because apparently, <strong>Wise doesn’t have managers</strong>), but from a more “senior” representative.</p>



<p>This rep was <strong>more empathetic</strong> and agreed the document should have been acceptable. She escalated the issue, resubmitted the document herself, and said she’d personally follow up if it was rejected again.</p>



<p>Progress, I thought.</p>



<p>Until the next morning.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>🚫 “We’ve Restricted Your Account”</strong></h2>



<p>I woke to an email with a stunning subject line:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>“We’ve restricted your account”</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="525" height="467" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png 525w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2-300x267.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>Just like that, our <strong>entire business account</strong> was locked. No warning. No reason. No discussion.</p>



<p>We could no longer send or receive money, use our Wise cards, or even contact support. The email stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Due to our current risk policies, your account will be closed in a few months. You will not be able to use support channels.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even worse? My <strong>personal Wise account</strong> was locked too. The same personal account which did have its address fully verified, by a rates invoice for my personal address.</p>



<p>Both had <strong>funds inside</strong>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="915" height="115" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4.png 915w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4-300x38.png 300w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4-768x97.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px"></figure>



<hr>



<h2><strong>🧾 An “Appeal” That Wasn’t an Appeal</strong></h2>



<p>The email offered an option to <strong>appeal</strong>. Naturally, I did.</p>



<p>The appeal process asked for our <strong>articles of incorporation</strong> and <strong>share registry</strong>. No problem.</p>



<p>Then it asked us to provide our preferred currency, and <strong>bank account details to refund the balances</strong>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="490" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-1024x490.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-1024x490.png 1024w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-300x144.png 300w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-768x368.png 768w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3.png 1059w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Wait… I thought this was an appeal? A chance to discuss and resolve the issue?</p>



<p>Nope.</p>



<p>That was the end. There was <strong>no opportunity to explain anything</strong>, no communication, no questions asked. The decision was made, and we were <strong>locked out</strong>, permanently.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>🔁 Let’s Recap</strong></h2>



<p>To summarise the absurdity of this:</p>



<ul>
<li>We moved office, and updated our address with Wise</li>



<li>We provided a legal, NZ-compliant <strong>telecommunications bill</strong> showing our entity and address</li>



<li>It was rejected because it was labelled a “Tax Invoice”</li>



<li>A rep told us to lease a coworking desk elsewhere just to get a different document</li>



<li>A senior rep agreed we were right, and escalated it</li>



<li>Then <strong>our accounts were shut down – with no explanation or recourse</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Even trying to call support now gets an automated message: “Because your account is restricted, we cannot connect you.”</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>⚠️ Our Final Word: Be Very, Very Careful</strong></h2>



<p>We had used Wise for <strong>years</strong>. Regular monthly supplier payments. International stock orders. Five-figure transactions. Never a problem – until this. A minor change triggered a totally flawed process that <strong>completely shut us out</strong>, with no transparency or logical path to resolution.</p>



<p>We’re not alone – a quick search shows <strong>many others facing similar horror stories</strong> with Wise.</p>



<p>So this is my word of warning:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>Don’t put all your eggs in the Wise basket.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re a business, don’t rely on them as your sole means of transferring funds. For us, it’s back to traditional banks – slower, yes, but at least <strong>they have humans you can talk to, and actual escalation paths</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>🧾 <strong>28th October update on our Wise debacle – it gets worse.</strong></h2>



<p>Following the so-called “appeal” (which gave us no option to provide any information), we received the unsurprising outcome: Wise has decided to <strong>keep our accounts closed</strong> as we had <strong>breached their acceptable use policy</strong>. 🤨</p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="559" height="271" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png 559w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5-300x145.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="718" height="242" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-6.png 718w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-6-300x101.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>What was surprising, however, was the <strong>reason</strong> they gave after I queried what was breached in Wise’s Acceptable Use Policy:</p>



<p>I was told my <strong>personal account</strong> was being closed for allegedly breaching their Acceptable Use Policy — specifically, section 1.4.e, which states <em>“you may not use your personal Wise account to receive business payments.”</em></p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="751" height="193" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7.png 751w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7-300x77.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s… news to me.</p>



<p>I’ve <strong>never</strong> used my personal account for business transactions — in fact, over 99% of transfers were to overseas family members. When I asked for clarification or examples, I got none. Just a vague statement and the very strange line:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Just because we can’t offer you our services going forward doesn’t mean that we think your business activities are illegal or illegitimate — it just means that we don’t support those types of activities.”</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="772" height="375" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8.png 772w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-300x146.png 300w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-768x373.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>What activities?! Again, <strong>no explanation provided.</strong></p>



<p>To make matters worse — our business account’s refund transfer <strong>failed</strong>. Why? Because it requires documentation — the <strong>same documentation</strong> Wise previously rejected for address verification, claiming a <em>telecommunications tax invoice isn’t a bill</em>.</p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="397" height="373" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9.png 397w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9-300x282.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>After a few days, the transfer was then cancelled as of course, Wise was unable to “verify” us.</p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="389" height="144" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-10.png 389w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-10-300x111.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>So now our <strong>funds are in limbo</strong>, their support ticket is marked “final response,” and our attempts to get clarity have gone nowhere. We’ve escalated the issue to <strong>Financial Services Complaints Ltd</strong>, Wise’s dispute resolution provider in New Zealand.</p>



<p>🎯 <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Nothing resolved.</p>



<p>Funds stuck. No clear reason. No accountability. Wise still gets a 0/10 from us.</p>



<p>This isn’t just poor service — it’s unacceptable.</p>



<p><strong>Think twice before trusting Wise with your money.</strong></p>

<p dir="auto">MinecraftHDL was the final undergraduate design project made by three students in the Electrical, Computer &amp; Software Engineering department at McGill University.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is by no means bug-free or even complete; It produces objectively inferior circuits to 'hand-made' redstone designs, and is not intended to be used in modded survival. It can generate almost any verilog circuit, however only simple designs will actually be testable in-game since any moderately-complex design will end up being longer than the maximum number of blocks loaded in Minecraft.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, we are currently unable to synthesize sequential circuits, aka any circuits with a loopback or feedback. That means no memory, no counters or any circuit that could hold a state.</p>
<p dir="auto">MinecraftHDL is an educational tool to illustrate on a macro-scopic scale how microelectronic digital circuits are designed and produced. It is a great way to introduce younger audiences to the world of digital design and can also be used to illustrate the difference between software and hardware design to undergraduate engineers taking their first RTL class.</p>

At the end of the gif I set both input numbers to '11' which is the binary representation of the number 3. Then I move to the output and we see that O3=1, O2=1, and O1=0, this gives the binary number '110' which is indeed 6.</p>

     <p>Recently I had a long call with an old friend who was facing an age-old
predicament that I’ve been seeing more and more these days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lucked out, worked hard, employer is crushing it, and now she’s sitting on a
large amount of paper money gains at her startup</li>
  <li>Company does a
<a href="https://www.joinprospect.com/learn/tender-offers">tender offer</a>, either
buying their stock back or allowing a third party to come in and buy shares</li>
  <li>Employees might be allowed to sell, say, 10% (or whatever) of their equity</li>
  <li>So here’s the question: do you sell, or do you roll the dice and risk it
longer?</li>
</ul>

<p>I took a tender offer on my early GitHub shares, and it comes up <em>a lot</em> in
emails and conversations with others I run across in the startup world. It’s a
decision can be annoyingly agonizing. And there’s a lot of conflicting advice
out there, each with different motivations behind it. I’ve added to that, too,
with lots of advice over the years of “look at all the alternatives in front of
you and make an even-headed decision”.</p>

<p>Anyway, fuck it, here’s the bottom line: <strong>take that money, queen</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="gambling-with-your-life">Gambling with your life</h2>

<p>I’ve found it helpful to look at your life as a gamble: a set of probabilities
that add up to whether or not you should make a decision a certain way. Assuming
you’re in this situation, you might be looking at a windfall of, say, half a
million to tens of millions of dollars. That’s wildly lucky, and can be
life-changing money.</p>

<p>Two massive motivators in this decision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s way easier to make more money when you already have money.</li>
  <li>Successful startups are an insane mix of timing and luck — no matter what
people who sell online courses will tell you — and if you’re at a point where
your imaginary gains are truly life-altering… you’ve already won. Now: try not
to lose.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m here to tell you: don’t fuck it up. It’s easy to assume two things, because
we’re <em>Startup People</em> who are <em>Bold</em> and certainly will <em>Change The World</em> (by
increasing query performance by 6%):</p>

<ul>
  <li>we assume that this will be just the first of many correct startup decisions
we will make and every four years we’ll be faced with this decision</li>
  <li>that the startup we’re at will only go up and to the right because that’s all
it’s ever done and surely it won’t face hard times both internally or
externally</li>
</ul>

<p>Successful startups sometimes fuck up. I interviewed at Zenefits about a month
before the first bad press came at them- back then it was one of the
fastest-growing companies of all time. One of the execs interviewed me and
guaranteed I’d become stupid rich if I joined. It was obvious to them they were
all going to be gazillionaires in no time at all. I came away with dozens of
utterly insane stories I continue to tell over drinks, and frankly was horrified
at how much of a clusterfuck everything internally was. But you talk to them and
they were all convinced they could do no wrong. (Except for head of
infrastructure- he was the most interesting person I interviewed with and we had
a fantastic discussion about how fucked up the infrastructure was. Figures that
the earliest to know something are the ones who see it break the most.)</p>

<p>All of this to say: it’s easy to become delusional while at a startup — in fact,
you could argue that the best startups have that cult-like delusion built into
their DNA. But things can change. Or the external structures can change. I don’t
have to tell you that tech is in a bubble right now; everyone knows it, everyone
knows it’s going to pop, but no one knows when or the extent of it. There have
been hundreds or thousands of startups over the decades, staffed with the best
and brightest, with revenue, with customers… and they’ve still bitten the
bullet. That’s the game. So don’t look a gift horse in the mouth; take the
horse’s wallet instead. (Sometimes my metaphors don’t always land.)</p>

<h2 id="its-a-forcing-function">It’s a forcing function</h2>

<p>You reading all this and thinking it doesn’t apply to you? That your startup is
<span><em>c r u s h i n g</em></span> it and that by
selling, you’re leaving <em>so much money</em> on the table? Good. One of the reasons I
wrote this in this way is to act like a forcing function: get you to be
horrified at the thought and make you critically analyze if holding on to your
stock makes sense or not. It’s like the advice of flipping a coin to make a
decision, and as the coin is in the air you’ll learn which decision it is that
you’re hoping it will land on.</p>

<p>I will say this, though: I did take a tender offer after I left GitHub, it was a
wildly stressful decision, but I have zero regrets today. I took something like
10% off the table, which had a positive impact on my abysmal emotional health at
the time, and had GitHub ultimately eaten it, I would have had at least
something left to show for all the work I had put into the company.</p>

<p>Amusingly enough, this post itself stemmed from conversations with
<a href="https://x.com/gallagherbilly">Billy Gallagher</a>, the founder of
<a href="https://www.joinprospect.com/">Prospect</a>, one of my angel investments. They do
scenarios and projections of early equity stakes, and I basically told him that
I’m too horrified of doing the retroactive math behind taking the tender and
dealing with all the stock fuckups GitHub subjected us to. It’s probably a large
number. But I don’t think about it at all today. Would have been helpful at the
time, sure, but the stress is a product of the time, and likely not one that
will stick with you forever… if that helps you make these decisions.</p>

<p>I also found it helpful to realize something logistical, too: the money you take
today is, you know, still money. You can invest it, diversify it, grow it. The
exponential growth of startup equity makes the more linear — but still
compounding — growth of “normal” investing feel like you’re just losing out, but
you’re still compounding that cash. It doesn’t just disappear.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-afford-to-not-be-perfect">You can afford to not be perfect</h2>

<p>So yeah- all of this is good to think about. Run the numbers. Model different
scenarios. Get a real understanding of the trade-offs here.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s helpful to “get permission” from someone — anyone — though. Like,
that it’s acceptable to make this tradeoff. When GitHub got acquired, one of the
best pieces of advice I got was: <em>you can afford to not be perfect</em>. There’s
this weird pressure out there that every single financial decision needs to be
optimized for every little bit of performance… but sometimes you can miss the
forest for the trees with that. You can also drive yourself mad, and forget why
you’re doing all this in the first place.</p>

<p>I’d also be remiss to not mention that this isn’t entirely a “rich person
problem”. I’ve known many paper millionaires who were functionally broke: they
had school debt, or were putting their partner through school, or had kids with
costly needs, or they were responsible for multiple families or generations who
were relying upon them. Liquidity in startups is increasingly harder to come by
these days. Life is constantly about planning for <em>the future</em>, whenever that
thing might come. Sometimes it’s helpful to think about <em>today</em>, too.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure data-testid="cne-audio-embed-figure"></figure><p>When Nick Watkins was a child, he pasted articles about space exploration into scrapbooks and drew annotated diagrams of rockets. He knew this because, years later, he still had the scrapbooks, and took them to be evidence that he had been a happy child, although he didn’t remember making them. When he was seven, in the summer of 1969, his father woke him up to watch the moon landing; it was the middle of the night where they lived, near Southampton, in England. He didn’t remember this, either, but he’d been told that it happened. That Christmas, he and his brother were given matching space helmets. He knew that on Christmas morning the helmets had been waiting in the kitchen and that, on discovering his, he felt joy, but this was not a memory, exactly. The knowledge seemed to him more personal than an ordinary fact, but he could not feel or picture what it had been like to be that boy in the kitchen.</p><p>When he was eight or nine, he read Arthur&nbsp;C. Clarke’s novel “2001: A Space Odyssey” over and over. At the beginning of the book, aliens implant images of tool-using into the minds of man-apes. Near the end, the main character, David Bowman, spools backward through memories of his life:</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>Not only vision, but all the sense impressions, and all the emotions he had felt at the time, were racing past, more and more swiftly. His life was unreeling like a tape recorder playing back at ever-increasing speed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Faces he had once loved, and had thought lost beyond recall, smiled at him.</p></blockquote><p>To Nick, these events—the images in the minds of the man-apes, David Bowman’s reliving of his life—were thrilling and otherworldly, with no connection to reality, brought about through the intervention of aliens, in distant, fictional worlds.</p><p>He became a physicist. He was drawn to statistical physics and quantum mechanics, whose concepts were best described in equations. The abstraction of these ideas suited him.</p><p>One morning in 1997, when he was thirty-five, he was sitting at breakfast, paging through the newspaper. He started to read an article by a columnist he admired, Michael Bywater. Time was an illusion, Bywater wrote, because you could roll it backward and relive it: “You choose a memory, focus on it, let the rest of the mind go blank, and wait.” Bywater described particular memories of his own, not only the sight but the sound and feel of them—“the special <em>weight</em> of girls in autumn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when they lean against you as you walk along.” For some reason, these sentences revealed all at once to Nick what in the whole course of his life he had not realized: that it was possible to see pictures in your mind and use those pictures to reëxperience your past.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>This was startling information. He knew, of course, that people talked about “picturing” or “visualizing,” but he had always taken this to be just a metaphorical way of saying “thinking.” Now it appeared that, in some incomprehensible sense, people meant these words <em>literally</em>. And then there was the notion of using those mental images to revisit a memory. It was an astonishing idea. Was it possible that this was a thing that people other than Bywater could do? Bywater had written about it quite casually, as though he took it for granted. Nick asked some people he knew, and all of them seemed to be able to do it.</p><p>He wondered whether there was something wrong with him—some kind of amnesia. He’d had no reason to worry about his memory before. He had a Ph.D. in physics; clearly his mind was functioning reasonably well. He knew the usual facts about his life—his parentage, the places he’d lived as a child, important things that had happened. It had never occurred to him that remembering could be more than that.</p><p>For many years, Nick would search for information about mental imagery, sporadically and alone. In the beginning, he did not yet know that his inability to visualize—this odd feature of his mind which appeared so insignificant that he hadn’t even noticed it for thirty-five years—would come to seem a central wellspring of his self. But then, in 2015, his condition was given a scientific name, aphantasia, and tens of thousands of people experienced the same shocked realization that he had. A flurry of research in the following decade would uncover associations between mental imagery and a bewildering variety of human traits and capacities: a propensity to hold grudges; autism; a vulnerability to trauma; emotional awareness; ways of making art and hearing music; memory of one’s life.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60873&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60873" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="Robber on roller coaster sticking up fellowriders." loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f80218837f0cdac35b772e/master/w_120,c_limit/a60873.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f80218837f0cdac35b772e/master/w_240,c_limit/a60873.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f80218837f0cdac35b772e/master/w_320,c_limit/a60873.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f80218837f0cdac35b772e/master/w_640,c_limit/a60873.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f80218837f0cdac35b772e/master/w_960,c_limit/a60873.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f80218837f0cdac35b772e/master/w_1280,c_limit/a60873.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f80218837f0cdac35b772e/master/w_1600,c_limit/a60873.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f80218837f0cdac35b772e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a60873.jpg"></picture></a><p><span>Cartoon by Seth Fleishman</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>But this was all in the future. In 1997, as much as he interrogated his acquaintances, Nick did not find anyone like him. He couldn’t be the only person who lacked this ability to visualize, he thought. Surely it was extremely unlikely that he was unique. But, until he encountered someone else, he had to admit that it was a working possibility.</p><p>He went online and started looking. Initially, he found only work from the nineteenth century. The first useful thing he came across was William James’s book “Principles of Psychology.” James referred to observations recorded in 1860 by Gustav Fechner, a German scientist and philosopher. Fechner had subjected his own “optical memory-pictures” to introspective scrutiny and deemed them weak and lacking:</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><div><p>With all my efforts, I cannot reproduce colours in the memory images of coloured objects.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I also never dream in colours, but all my experiences in dreams seem to me to proceed in a kind of twilight or night.</p><p>I can’t hold the image steadily for even a short time, but in order to observe it for a longer time, I have to recreate it again and again.</p><p>What was very unexpected to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is that it is easier for me to produce memory images&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with open eyes than with closed eyes.</p></div></blockquote></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Fechner didn’t pursue the subject, however, and it lay dormant until 1880, when it was taken up by Francis Galton, a British scientist who later became notorious as the father of eugenics. Galton, supposing that he could depend on scientists to give accurate answers, wrote to several of them with a query:</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>Think of some definite object—suppose it is your breakfast-table as you sat down to it this morning—and consider carefully the picture that rises before your mind’s eye.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Is the image dim or fairly clear?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Are the colours of the china, of the toast, bread-crust, mustard, meat, parsley, or whatever may have been on the table, quite distinct and natural?</p></blockquote><p>The responses he received were not at all what he had expected.</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>To my astonishment, I found that the great majority of the men of science to whom I first applied protested that mental imagery was unknown to them, and they looked on me as fanciful and fantastic in supposing that the words “mental imagery” really expressed what I believed everybody to suppose them to mean.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They had a mental deficiency of which they were unaware, and naturally enough supposed that those who were normally endowed, were romancing.</p></blockquote><p>Finding this Galton study came as a relief to Nick. Now at least he knew that there had been other people lacking mental imagery who’d lived normal lives, so it wasn’t a disease, or a symptom of a brain tumor. Galton had subsequently observed that women and children appeared to have more vivid imagery than the scientists did. “Scientific men as a class,” he concluded, “have feeble powers of visual representation.” Nick found this intriguing. Perhaps his own lack of imagery had somehow enhanced his scientific ability. He knew that there was, among some mathematicians, a kind of snobbery about images—a notion that, even in geometry, drawings were distractions from a purely analytical proof. But he also knew that there were any number of legends in the history of science of visions leading to discoveries. Einstein had visualized himself travelling alongside a beam of light, and this had led to his conception of relativity. The best-known instance that Nick was aware of was the German chemist August Kekulé, to whom the structure of the benzene ring had appeared in a dream:</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>Long rows&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all twining and twisting in snake-like motion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One of the snakes had seized hold of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. spent the rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis.</p></blockquote><p>At one point, Nick came across a paper from 1909 that stressed the importance of distinguishing between voluntary imagery (the ability to call up mental pictures at will) and involuntary imagery. Sometimes people who couldn’t call up images on purpose did experience them involuntarily—usually during migraines, or high, hallucinatory fevers, or in dreams, or the hypnagogic state just before sleep. This caught his attention because he was almost certain that he saw images in dreams, although he couldn’t be sure, since nothing remained of the images after he woke. If he was right, and he did see images in sleep, then it was strange that he couldn’t summon them at other times. Was he repressing them?</p><p>When he searched for scientific studies on imagery in the mid-twentieth century, he found very little. It seemed that the study of imagery had largely disappeared from scientific research from the nineteen-twenties to the fifties, owing in part to the dominance of behaviorism in America, which condemned inquiry into internal psychological states as unscientific. J.&nbsp;B. Watson, behaviorism’s founder, repudiated the existence of mental imagery altogether:</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>What does a person mean when he closes his eyes or ears (figuratively speaking) and says, “I see the house where I was born, the trundle bed in my mother’s room where I used to sleep—I can even see my mother as she comes to tuck me in and I can even hear her voice as she softly says good-night”? Touching, of course, but sheer bunk. We are merely dramatizing. The behaviorist finds no proof of imagery at all in this.</p></blockquote><p>Later, researchers would debate whether Watson became a behaviorist because he had no internal imagery, or whether he actually had strong imagery but denied it because of “ideological blindness.”</p><p>In the nineteen-seventies, Nick discovered, a few psychologists, liberated from mid-century behaviorist orthodoxy, had begun to explore imagery again. A British psychologist named David Marks, for instance, developed the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, which sought to measure a person’s ability to picture not only a stationary object but also movement (the characteristic gait of a familiar person), change (the shifting color of the sky at sunrise), and degree of detail (the window of a shop you frequently go to). But the psychologists in the nineteen-seventies were interested in people with typical imagery. When Nick searched for studies on people like himself, he found nothing.</p><p>Sometime in the early two-thousands, Jim Campbell, a Scottish surveyor in his mid-sixties, made an appointment with a neurologist at the University of Edinburgh named Adam Zeman. Jim had recently had a cardiac procedure, and afterward he’d noticed that he could no longer picture anything in his head. Before the surgery, he used to put himself to sleep by visualizing his children and grandchildren; now he couldn’t see anything at all.</p><p>Zeman had a general neurology practice—Parkinson’s, M.S., dementia—but he had also been interested in consciousness since he was a student. He speculated that one of the things that made humans different from other primates was their ability to mentally project themselves into the past or future, or into worlds that were purely imaginary. So he was fascinated to encounter, in Jim, a syndrome he had never heard of before, which appeared to be an excision of just this species-defining ability. And yet Jim was clearly very much a human—wry, reserved, down to earth. His neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive tests were all normal. If Jim had not described his condition, Zeman would not have known there was anything unusual about him.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Even questions designed to evoke imagery—Which is darker, grass or pine needles? Do squirrels have long or short tails?—Jim answered without hesitation. When Zeman asked him how he could answer without picturing these things, he said that he just knew. Zeman searched for recent scientific papers that could shed light on this strange condition but was unable to find anything useful. The case reminded him of blindsight—a rare phenomenon in which people who can’t see behave as though they can, picking up objects and avoiding obstacles. Their eyes and brains can take in visual information, but the information doesn’t rise to consciousness.</p><p>Zeman felt that Jim was not the sort of person who would make something like this up, but he wanted proof that his brain was functioning in an unusual manner. He recruited a control group of men of similar age and put them and Jim through cognitive tests in an MRI scanner. Here, he found the neurological correlate that he was looking for. Although Jim’s brain responded normally to tests of recognition (being shown images of famous faces), when he was asked to <em>generate</em> a mental image the scanner showed only faint brain activity, compared with the brain activity in the control group. Instead, there was activation in areas of the frontal lobe that were typically activated in situations of cognitive effort or dissonance. Jim was trying, but failing.</p><p>In 2010, Zeman, along with several colleagues, published these findings in the journal <em>Neuropsychologia</em>, terming the syndrome “blind imagination.” The science journalist Carl Zimmer noticed the study and wrote an article about it in <em>Discover</em> magazine. In the years that followed, a couple of dozen people contacted Zeman to tell him that they had the same condition, except they’d had it since birth. Zeman sent them questionnaires and tabulated their answers. At this point, he decided that lack of mental imagery was a valid syndrome that ought to have a name. After consulting with a classicist friend, he decided on “aphantasia,” <em>phantasia</em> being defined by Aristotle as the ability to conjure an image in the imagination. In 2015, Zeman co-wrote a paper in <em>Cortex</em> describing the condition as it appeared in twenty-one subjects: “Lives without imagery—Congenital aphantasia.”</p><p>An article about Zeman’s second paper appeared in the New York <em>Times</em>, and, after that, e-mails poured in. Around seventeen thousand people contacted him. Most were congenital aphantasics, and most not only lacked visual imagery; they could not mentally call up sounds, either, or touch, or the sensation of movement. Many had difficulty recognizing faces. Many said that they had a family member who was aphantasic, too. Most said that they saw images in dreams. Zeman recruited colleagues to work with him, and together they tried to reply to every correspondent.</p><p>Some people who wrote had once had imagery but lost it. About half of these had lost it as a consequence of physical injury—stroke, meningitis, head trauma, suffocation. The other half attributed their loss to a psychiatric cause—depersonalization syndrome, depression. A few told him that they thought they’d suppressed their capacity to visualize because traumatic memories had made imagery intolerable. Zeman learned that there had been a case in 1883, described by the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, in which a man, Monsieur X, had lost his imagery; at the same time, the world suddenly appeared alien to him, and he became intensely anxious. “I observed a drastic change in my existence that obviously mirrored a remarkable change in my personality,” Monsieur X wrote to Charcot. “Before, I used to be emotional, enthusiastic with a prolific imagination; today I am calm, cold and I lost my imagination.” Another nineteenth-century French neurologist, Jules Cotard, described a patient whose loss of mental imagery was accompanied by what became known as Cotard’s delusion, or walking-corpse syndrome—the belief that he was dead.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60541&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60541" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="Mountain climber looking at sage on mountain peak." loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f802186903ce4a69dcb009/master/w_120,c_limit/a60541.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f802186903ce4a69dcb009/master/w_240,c_limit/a60541.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f802186903ce4a69dcb009/master/w_320,c_limit/a60541.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f802186903ce4a69dcb009/master/w_640,c_limit/a60541.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f802186903ce4a69dcb009/master/w_960,c_limit/a60541.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f802186903ce4a69dcb009/master/w_1280,c_limit/a60541.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f802186903ce4a69dcb009/master/w_1600,c_limit/a60541.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f802186903ce4a69dcb009/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a60541.jpg"></picture></a><p><span>“I hope you brought me food that isn’t trail mix or energy bars.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Amy Hwang</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Zeman also received messages from people who appeared to have the opposite of aphantasia: they told him that their mental pictures were graphic and inescapable. There was evidently a spectrum of mental imagery, with aphantasia on one end and extraordinarily vivid imagery on the other and most people’s experience somewhere in between. Zeman figured that the vivid extreme needed a name as well; he dubbed it hyperphantasia. It seemed that two or three per cent of people were aphantasic and somewhat more were hyperphantasic.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Many of his correspondents, he learned, had discovered their condition very recently, after reading about it or hearing it described on the radio. Their whole lives, they had heard people talk about picturing, and imagining, and counting sheep, and visualizing beaches, and seeing in the mind’s eye, and assumed that all those idioms were only metaphors or colorful hyperbole. It was amazing how profoundly people could misunderstand one another, and assume that others didn’t mean what they were saying—how minds could wrest sense out of things that made no sense.</p><p>Some said that they had a tantalizing feeling that images were somewhere in their minds, only just out of reach, like a word on the tip of their tongue. This sounded right to Zeman—the images must be stored in some way, since aphantasics were able to recognize things. In fact, it seemed that most aphantasics weren’t hampered in their everyday functioning. They had good memories for facts and tasks. But many of them said that they remembered very little about their own lives.</p><p>Among the e-mails that Zeman received, there were, to his surprise, several from aphantasic professional artists. One of these was Sheri Paisley (at the time, Sheri Bakes), a painter in her forties who lived in Vancouver. When Sheri was young, she’d had imagery so vivid that she sometimes had difficulty distinguishing it from what was real. She painted intricate likenesses of people and animals; portraiture attracted her because she was interested in psychology. Then, when she was twenty-nine, she had a stroke, and lost her imagery altogether.</p><p>To her, the loss of imagery was a catastrophe. She felt as though her mind were a library that had burned down. She no longer saw herself as a person. Gradually, as she recovered from her stroke, she made her way back to painting, working very slowly. She switched from acrylic paints to oils because acrylics dried too fast. She found that her art had drastically changed. She no longer wanted to paint figuratively; she painted abstractions that looked like galaxies seen through a space telescope. She lost interest in psychology—she wanted to connect to the foundations of the universe.</p><p>Years later, she remembered that, one night at her parents’ house, when she was still in art school, she had stayed up very late painting. She suddenly felt a strong presence behind her, and, even as she kept working, she felt the presence ask her, What do you want? In her thoughts, she responded, I want to be a great painter, and I will do whatever I have to, except take drugs. Later, she thought, Well, that is what happened. My life is very hard, but my painting is so much better.</p><p>Sheri had been an artist before she lost her imagery, but there were others who had been aphantasic for as long as they could remember. Isabel Nolan, a well-known Irish artist, had recently discovered, in her forties, while reading about Zeman’s work in <em>New Scientist</em>, that other people could see pictures in their heads:</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>There was an element of like—fuck! is the only way I can put it. Horrified and cheated. I still feel a bit cheated.</p></blockquote><p>She wondered whether she had always been like this. When she was a child, her mother would occasionally go on business trips, and while she was away Isabel stayed with cousins who lived up the road. She remembered lying in bed one night at her cousins’ house, thinking, What if Mam dies? I can’t remember what she looks like. She was an anxious child, frightened of many things, but this particular thought stuck in her mind for years. Now she wondered how she could have been so upset at the thought that she couldn’t picture her mother unless she’d had a notion, some vestigial memory, that such a thing was possible.</p><p>Her fear of things vanishing had not gone away. In fact, it had expanded, from her mother to everything. She had lived in Dublin almost all her life, although it would probably have been better for her career if she’d moved to London. As it turned out, it hadn’t held her back—she would be representing Ireland in the Venice Biennale in 2026—but when she was younger she’d wondered if she was making a mistake. She thought that maybe she’d stayed because having the physical infrastructure of her past around helped her to remember it. For a long time, she had felt that everything around her was ephemeral, precarious, not to be relied on:</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>I was putting together a book in 2020, gathering about nine years of work and writing, and there was an awful lot of writing alluding to the fact of barely having a grasp on the world and how slippery it all is. I realized that my inability to recall things was really playing on my mind, and that my connection to my social world felt insubstantial. I wrote a lot about how touch was important to me, and how making work was setting down little anchors that reminded me that the world does exist.</p></blockquote><p>Surely this had something to do with not being able to picture anything when she wasn’t looking at it.</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>The world does disappear completely when you close your eyes.</p></blockquote><p>At a conference, she heard artists with vivid imagery say that they were often disappointed by their work because it could never match up to the glowing vision in their heads; she felt sorry for them. When she was working on something, she never knew how it would end up. Sometimes she started with an idea, like the cosmos; she liked to look at images of deep space and draw abstractions that resembled them. She thought a lot about subjective experience, but not her own experience in particular—more what it was like to be any human, wandering through the world. She didn’t feel that her work was an extension or expression of herself, so she didn’t mind criticism, or not being understood:</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>I don’t think I have a very strong sense of self, and it’s not something I’m super interested in.</p></blockquote><p>Was this because of her aphantasia? If her mind were filled with pictures, would her self feel fuller, more robust? When people learned that they were aphantasic, they tended to wonder whether this or that aspect of themselves was due to their lack of imagery; sometimes it had nothing to do with it, but in this case it did—several studies had found that people with vivid imagery tended to be more inward, absorbed in the drift of their own minds.</p><p>Someone had told Isabel about a British moral philosopher, Derek Parfit, who had no imagery. He had few memories and little connection to his past, although he felt strong emotions about people and ideas in the present. Parfit believed that a self was not a unique, distinct thing but a collection of shifting memories and thoughts which intersected with the memories and thoughts of others. Ultimately, he thought, selves were not important. What mattered was the moral imperatives that drove everyone, or ought to—preventing suffering, the future welfare of humanity, the search for truth.</p><p>Isabel, like Parfit, remembered very little about her life. She kept boxes of souvenirs—ticket stubs, programs—but unless she looked at these things, or a friend reminded her, she didn’t recall most of the places she’d visited or things she’d done. She imagined that this could be a problem in a relationship, if you didn’t remember what you’d done together and the other person got upset and accused you of not caring, though fortunately she’d never been with someone like that. When she went out with friends who were full of stories, she’d worry that she wasn’t entertaining enough; normally, she drew people out and got them talking so she didn’t have to:</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>I don’t really have a sense, with some friends—how well I know them. I’ve kind of forgotten. They’d be like, Oh, yeah, do you remember we went to the play that night? And sometimes I’d just pretend, I’d be like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think when my relationships are continuous, it’s much easier. You remember more because you’re constantly reëxercising the memories of stuff that you did together—you know, the time we went to Cologne and got hammered and lost our cameras, blah, blah, blah.</p></blockquote><p>It would be nice to remember all the funny stories that people told, but in the end she didn’t mind too much. She could just sit there and bask in the pleasure of being with old friends. It was the feeling that was important; she didn’t need to know what had happened years ago. In some ways, this made things easier—she mostly didn’t remember arguments or bad feelings. She hoped that the significant moments in her life, good and bad, had left their imprint on her in some way, but it was impossible to know:</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27994&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27994" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="Two men in suits standing in office." loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e872a23d709c643e6d95/master/w_120,c_limit/a27994.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e872a23d709c643e6d95/master/w_240,c_limit/a27994.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e872a23d709c643e6d95/master/w_320,c_limit/a27994.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e872a23d709c643e6d95/master/w_640,c_limit/a27994.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e872a23d709c643e6d95/master/w_960,c_limit/a27994.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e872a23d709c643e6d95/master/w_1280,c_limit/a27994.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e872a23d709c643e6d95/master/w_1600,c_limit/a27994.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e872a23d709c643e6d95/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a27994.jpg"></picture></a><p><span>“I’m all for democracy as long as we retain veto power.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Barbara Smaller</span></p></div></span></p></figure><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>I feel like my past is kind of imaginary.

One can feel a little disconnected from your own past.</p></blockquote><p>Clare Dudeney was an artist who worked in southeast London, in a warren of old factory buildings by the Thames. Against one wall of her studio was a wooden loom, above which large spools of cotton thread in a rainbow of colors were slotted on pegs. She made works in many media, all cornucopias of color: pieces of fabric dyed robin’s-egg blue or pistachio or hazelnut or citrine and pasted into collages, some so long that you couldn’t take them in at once and hung near open doors so that they rippled. She made murals of ceramic tiles painted with irregular shapes, like countries on a map, in powder-puff pink and celery and yellow and wheat; rectangular blocks of rough wood that she called woodcut paintings, with teal, red, cornflower, and lime pigment staining or filling the crevices and gouges of the surface; long clay worms, basket-woven and glazed—forest, mustard, chestnut—like ceramic macramé. She draped herself in colors, too: thick scarves and nubby sweaters that she knitted herself; geometric-patterned skirts.</p><p>In talking to a friend of hers, an aphantasic painter who was one of Zeman’s research subjects, Clare had realized that she was the opposite—hyperphantasic. Her imagery was extraordinarily vivid. There was always so much going on inside her head, her mind skittering and careening about, that it was difficult to focus on what or who was actually in front of her. There were so many pictures and flashes of memory, and glimpses of things she thought were memory but wasn’t sure, and scenarios real and imaginary, and schemes and speculations and notions and plans, a relentless flood of images and ideas continuously coursing through her mind. It was hard to get to sleep.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>At one point, in an effort to slow the flood, she tried meditation. She went on a ten-day silent retreat, but she disliked it so much—too many rules, getting up far too early—that she rebelled. While sitting in a room with no pictures or stimulation of any kind, supposedly meditating, she decided to watch the first Harry Potter movie in her head. She wasn’t able to recall all two hours of it, but watching what she remembered lasted for forty-five minutes. Then she did the same with the other seven films.</p><p>She tried not to expose herself to ugly or violent images because she knew they would stick in her mind for years. But even without a picture, if she even heard about violence her mind would produce one. Once, reading about someone undergoing surgery without anesthetic, she imagined it so graphically that she fainted. (In 2012, two Harvard psychologists published a study about visual imagery and moral judgment. They found that people with weak imagery tended to think more abstractly about moral questions and believe that good ends sometimes justified harmful means. But for people with strong imagery, the harmful means—injuries done to one person in order to save several others, say—formed such lurid pictures in their minds that they responded emotionally and rejected them.)</p><p>Even joyful images could turn on her. She’d had a cat that she loved; she was separated from her husband and living on her own, so she had spent more time with the cat than with any other creature. Then the cat died, and after his death she saw him everywhere—on the sofa, on the floor, on her bed, wherever he had been in life. She saw him so clearly that it was as though he were actually there in front of her. Her grief was made so much worse by this relentless haunting that she began to feel as if she would not be able to cope.</p><p>Her father was a physicist and for many years the deputy director of the British Antarctic Survey. When Clare was a child, he promised that one day he would take her to Antarctica, and finally, when she was in her thirties, in 2013, he did. There, on the boat, she found herself looking at a landscape so wholly unfamiliar that her brain struggled to make sense of it. At times, it barely appeared to her like a landscape at all, more like an abstract surface, without reference or meaning. The place was vast, and there were no people. Snow and ice formed strange patterns on the surface of the sea. As they travelled, the terrain kept changing, so her sense of alien newness persisted. It was as if, for the first time, she was seeing not through the cluttered, obscuring scrim of her visual memories but directly, at the world itself. Just looking at it was so demanding that it occupied her whole mind, so that she wasn’t thinking about anything else, she was just there. At the time, she was consulting on climate and sustainability issues, but after that trip she decided to become an artist.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Usually, her ideas for art works came not from anything external but from images in her head. For a while, she had made paintings based on her dreams. She kept a journal and a pen by the side of her bed so that she could describe what she’d dreamed the moment she woke. The more she wrote down her dreams, the more she remembered them; sometimes she would remember ten dreams in a single night. Eventually, the process began to fold in on itself—while she was still asleep, she’d begin to dream that she was taking notes on the dream, and planning how to draw what she saw.</p><p>When she thought about making a new piece, she often worked it out in her mind beforehand. Being hyperphantasic didn’t mean only that your imagery was bright and sharp; it meant that you could manipulate your images at will, zooming in and out, cutting and pasting, flipping and mirroring, creating pictures from scratch, assembling and disassembling complicated objects. Even when she was trying to evoke the colors of a landscape at a certain time of day, she did it not from life but from memory.</p><p>She didn’t know how common this was among artists, but there were some who she was fairly sure had worked from their imaginations rather than from life. J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;W. Turner, for instance, made rough sketches outdoors, but the seas and skies and light of his paintings all came from his head. There was an English portraitist working in the late eighteenth century whose prodigious powers of visualization had been described in a case study. The study didn’t name the painter but said that he’d inherited most of the clients of Sir Joshua Reynolds after Reynolds’s death, and had proceeded to take full advantage of this by painting three hundred portraits in a single year. The study’s author, a British physician named A.&nbsp;L. Wigan, reported:</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>This would seem physically impossible, but the secret of his rapidity and of his astonishing success was this: He required but one sitting, and painted with miraculous facility. I myself saw him execute a kit-cat portrait of a gentleman well known to me, in little more than eight hours; it was minutely finished, and a most striking likeness. On asking him to explain it, he said, “When a sitter came, I looked at him attentively for half-an-hour, sketching from time to time on the canvass. I wanted no more—I put away my canvass, and took another sitter. When I wished to resume my first portrait, I took the man and set him in the chair, where I saw him as distinctly as if he had been before me in his own proper person—I may almost say more vividly. I looked from time to time at the imaginary figure, then worked with my pencil, then referred to the countenance, and so on, just as I should have done had the sitter been there—<em>when I looked at the chair I saw the man!</em>”</p></blockquote></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>This painter’s imagery was so lifelike, however, that he began to confuse his mind’s pictures with reality, and succumbed to a mental illness that lasted thirty years.</p><p>Hyperphantasia often seemed to function as an emotional amplifier in mental illness—heightening hypomania, worsening depression, causing intrusive traumatic imagery in P.T.S.D. to be more realistic and disturbing. Reshanne Reeder, a neuroscientist at the University of Liverpool, began interviewing hyperphantasics in 2021 and found that many of them had a fantasy world that they could enter at will. But they were also prone to what she called maladaptive daydreaming. They might become so absorbed while on a walk that they would wander, not noticing their surroundings, and get lost. It was difficult for them to control their imaginations: once they pictured something, it was hard to get rid of it. It was so easy for hyperphantasics to imagine scenes as lifelike as reality that they could later become unsure what had actually happened and what had not.</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>I can imagine my hand burning, to the point where it’s painful. I’ve always been curious—if they put me in an fMRI, would that show up? That’s one of the biggest problems in my life: when I feel something, is it real?</p></blockquote><p>One hyperphantasic told a researcher that he had more than once walked into a wall because he had pictured a doorway.</p><p>Because their imaginative lives were so compelling, hyperphantasics tended to be inwardly focussed. This could mean that they were detached from reality, living in the remembered past and the imaginary future rather than in the actual present. But it could also mean that they were hyperaware of their internal reality, tuned in to the cues of their bodies and the shifts in their emotions. Some researchers hypothesized that the heightened awareness of these bodily and emotional signals were one reason that people with vivid imagery usually had strong memories of their pasts—these signals somehow helped to “anchor memories to the self.”</p><p>Hyperphantasics’ memories could be exceptionally detailed.</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>Someone might mention something like Did you ever skateboard as a kid? And then I have to watch out for the avalanche of every skateboarding experience I ever had. It’s like being in virtual reality and having a three-hundred-and-sixty-degree video of a thousand skateboarding experiences at the same time.</p></blockquote><p>Memories might take on quasi-physical forms in their minds. They might picture sheaves of recollections, or files of information, sitting on shelves in a mental warehouse. They might envision lists of facts about a particular place pinned to that place on a vast and detailed mental map that they saw spread out before them, like a hologram.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Reeder had tested children’s imagery and believed that most children were hyperphantasic. They had not yet undergone the synaptic pruning that took place in adolescence, so there were incalculably more neuronal connections linking different parts of their brain, giving rise to fertile imagery. Then, as they grew older, the weaker connections were pruned away. Because the synapses that were pruned tended to be the ones that were used less, Reeder thought it was possible that the children who grew up to be hyperphantasic adults were those who kept on wanting to conjure up visual fantasy worlds, even as they grew older. Conversely, perhaps children who grew up to become typical imagers daydreamed less and less, becoming more interested in the real people and things around them. Maybe some children who loved to daydream were scolded, in school or at home, to pay attention, and maybe these children disciplined themselves to focus on the here and now and lost the ability to travel to the imaginary worlds they’d known when they were young.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26838&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26838" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="Person looking at tiny free library named “Tiny Library of Babel.”" loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e87291b5efc596f6319c/master/w_120,c_limit/a26838.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e87291b5efc596f6319c/master/w_240,c_limit/a26838.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e87291b5efc596f6319c/master/w_320,c_limit/a26838.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e87291b5efc596f6319c/master/w_640,c_limit/a26838.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e87291b5efc596f6319c/master/w_960,c_limit/a26838.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e87291b5efc596f6319c/master/w_1280,c_limit/a26838.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e87291b5efc596f6319c/master/w_1600,c_limit/a26838.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/68f7e87291b5efc596f6319c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a26838.jpg"></picture></a><p><span>Cartoon by Adam Douglas Thompson</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Clare had not been discouraged from daydreaming as a child, and she had preferred it to the other common form of imaginative dissociation, reading. Daydreaming was more pleasurable for her because she had struggled to learn to read, and even once she knew how she’d found it slow going. When she received a diagnosis of dyslexia, as an adult, the tester told her that, rather than processing individual letters or sounds, she was memorizing pictures of whole words, which made it hard to recognize words in different fonts. Her visual sense was so overweening that reading was strenuous, because she was easily distracted by the squiggles and lines of the text.</p><p>Naturally, aphantasics usually had a very different experience of reading. Like most people, as they became absorbed, they stopped noticing the visual qualities of the words on the page, and, because their eyes were fully employed in reading, they also stopped noticing the visual world around them. But, because the words prompted no mental images, it was almost as if reading bypassed the visual world altogether and tunnelled directly into their minds.</p><p>Aphantasics might skip over descriptive passages in books—since description aroused no images in their minds, they found it dull—or, because of such passages, avoid fiction altogether. Some aphantasics found the movie versions of novels more compelling, since these supplied the pictures that they were unable to imagine. Of course, for people who did have imagery, seeing a book character in a movie was often unsettling—because they already had a sharp mental image of the character which didn’t look like the actor, or because their image was vague but just particular enough that the actor looked wrong, or because their image was barely there at all and the physical solidity of the actor conflicted with that amorphousness.</p><p>Presumably, novelists who invented characters also had a variety of responses to seeing them instantiated in solid form. Jane Austen wrote a letter to her sister in 1813 in which she described going to an exhibition of paintings in London and searching for portraits that looked like Elizabeth Bennet and Jane Bingley, two main characters from “Pride and Prejudice.” To her delight, she’d seen “a small portrait of Mrs Bingley, excessively like her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. exactly herself, size, shaped face, features &amp; sweetness; there never was a greater likeness. She is dressed in a white gown, with green ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always supposed, that green was a favourite color with her.” Austen did not see Elizabeth at the exhibition but hoped, she told her sister, to find a painting of her somewhere in the future. “I dare say Mrs D.”—she wrote, Darcy being Elizabeth’s married name—“will be in Yellow.”</p><p>One of the twenty or so congenital aphantasics who contacted Adam Zeman after his original 2010 paper was a Canadian man in his twenties, Tom Ebeyer. Ebeyer volunteered to participate in Zeman’s studies, and, after Zeman published his 2015 <em>Cortex</em> paper on congenital aphantasia, Ebeyer was one of the participants quoted in the <em>Times</em> article about it. After that, hundreds of aphantasics reached out to him on Facebook and LinkedIn. They asked him questions he didn’t know the answers to: Does this mean I have a disability? Is there a cure?</p><p>Many of Ebeyer’s correspondents felt shocked and isolated, as he had; he decided that what was needed was a online forum where aphantasics could go for information and community. He set up a website, the Aphantasia Network. He didn’t want it to be a sad place where people commiserated with one another, however. There were good things about aphantasia, he believed, and he began to write uplifting posts pointing them out. In one, he argued that aphantasia was an advantage in abstract thinking. When prompted by the word “horse,” a person with imagery would likely picture a particular horse—one they’d seen in life, perhaps, or in a painting. An aphantasic, on the other hand, focussed on the concept of a horse—on the abstract essence of horseness. Ebeyer published posts about famous people who had realized that they were aphantasic: Glen Keane, one of the leading Disney animators on “The Little Mermaid” and “Beauty and the Beast”; John Green, the author of “The Fault in Our Stars,” whose books had sold more than fifty million copies; J.&nbsp;Craig Venter, the biologist who led the first team to sequence the human genome; Blake Ross, who co-created the Mozilla-Firefox web browser when he was nineteen.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Ebeyer also wanted the Aphantasia Network to be a place where aphantasics could find recent scientific research. For instance, estimating the strength of a person’s imagery had been thoroughly subjective until Joel Pearson, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of New South Wales, in Australia, devised tests to measure it more precisely. In a paper from 2022, Pearson reported that when people with imagery visualized a bright object their pupils contracted, as though they were seeing a bright object in real life, but the pupils of aphantasics imagining a bright object stayed the same. Another study of his had shown that, although aphantasics had the same fear response (sweating) as typical imagers to a frightening image shown on a screen, when exposed to a frightening story they barely responded at all.</p><p>Ebeyer kept in touch with Zeman and published bulletins about his research. Zeman had found that aphantasics could solve many problems that would seem to require imagery, such as counting the number of windows in their home. This, Zeman hypothesized, was due to the difference between object imagery and spatial imagery. There were two streams of visual information in the brain that were, to a surprising degree, distinct from each other: one had to do with recognition of objects; the other, with guiding action through space. Aphantasics lacked object imagery, but they might have the kind of spatial imagery that would enable them to count windows. One aphantasic described his ability to do this as a kind of echolocation.</p><p>To Zeman, one of the most tantalizing promises of the study of mental imagery was the light it might shed on the neural correlates of consciousness. Connectivity in the brain seemed to be particularly important in both consciousness and aphantasia. fMRI studies had shown reduced connectivity in aphantasics, and Brian Levine, a neuropsychologist at the Baycrest Academy for Research and Education, in Toronto, had found that connectivity between the memory system and the visual-perceptual regions in the brain correlated to how well people remembered their lives. Many of the aphantasics who had written to Zeman identified themselves as autistic. Autism was thought to be a state of reduced long-range connectivity in the brain, so Zeman theorized that there could be a link. But autism had also been associated with thinking in pictures—Temple Grandin, for instance, the autistic writer and professor of animal science, described her autism that way—so clearly the link was not a simple one.</p><p>After creating the Aphantasia Network, Ebeyer received tens of thousands of messages from all over the world—Korea, Venezuela, Madagascar. He launched Aphantasia Network Japan, and made plans for a Spanish-language site. When the city of Rowlett, a suburb of Dallas, declared the world’s first Aphantasia Awareness Day, on February 21, 2023, his site published a celebratory post. Once hyperphantasia began to be written about, he started to hear from hyperphantasics as well. When he wrote a post about how some people could “hear” music in their heads, or relive touch or tastes, most responses were from aphantasics amazed to learn that such things were possible. But one person wrote to him describing a kind of auditory hyperphantasia:</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>I can—and do—listen to entire classical works in my head. The longest continuous one was the entire Verdi requiem, listened to internally on a long-haul flight. The imagery is very detailed. I can summon up a work and identify the instruments playing in an orchestral texture, or the registration being used in a particular organ piece. I can’t turn it off though. It’s in the background as I write (Schumann, third symphony, last movement). Sometimes a short passage will repeat endlessly, typically when I am stressed. And if I wake at night, it is usually with a short sequence of harmonies repeating themselves.</p></blockquote><p>This past January, Zeman and others published a short article in <em>Cortex</em> clarifying that the definition of aphantasia encompassed people with weak imagery. Ebeyer wrote a post in response, wondering whether this inclusive definition risked diluting the experiences of those with total aphantasia, such as himself. Might it threaten the cohesion of the aphantasia community? Aphantasia, at this point, wasn’t only a syndrome, after all—it was an identity.</p><p>In the course of his quest to learn about imagery, Nick Watkins, the physicist, came across an essay by Oliver Sacks. Sacks mentioned that he normally had almost no mental imagery but that, during a two-week period in his thirties when he’d been downing heroic quantities of amphetamines, he’d suddenly been able to retain images in his mind—though only images of things that he had just looked at. During that time, he also found it much more difficult to think in abstractions. When the drugs wore off, the images dissipated and his abstract thinking returned. This was an auspicious discovery, Nick thought, that you could somehow turn imagery on. He was certainly not going to take amphetamines himself—he was a pretty cautious person—especially if doing so might jeopardize his ability to think abstractly. But if amphetamines could work, maybe something else could, too.</p><p>He kept looking. He discovered that Aldous Huxley was aphantasic and that, in “The Doors of Perception,” he had written that he was expecting mescaline to change this, even if only for a few hours. (It didn’t.) Unsurprisingly, amid the recent research on psychedelics, this hope of arousing mental vision with drugs had been revived. In 2018, the <em>Journal of Psychedelic Studies</em> published a paper about an aphantasic man, S.E., who had taken ayahuasca and had an intensely emotional experience of visualizing, and then forgiving, his father, long dead, who had left him when he was very young. Afterward, S.E. was still able to see images, but only faintly. He and the paper’s authors concluded that his aphantasia had likely been psychological in origin, since it was resolved by his feeling that things between him and his father had been settled. Another paper, published in the same journal in 2025, described an autistic aphantasic woman in her mid-thirties who had eaten psilocybin truffles and experienced mental imagery for the first time. Her imagery persisted for many months, although it was not quite as vivid as during the trip itself.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Nick kept hoping that someone would find a way of stimulating imagery that didn’t involve drugs. On the other hand, as he learned more about people with imagery, he was less inclined to envy them. At first, he had thought that having imagery would be like having a VCR, being able to play home movies whenever you felt wistful. But, reading more about it, he had learned that memories and images could break in on you, unbidden and uncontrollable, and not necessarily happy ones. Even if the imagery wasn’t frightening, it would surely be a distraction. He had come to value the dark and quiet of his mind.</p><p>Nick knew that whenever Zeman talked about aphantasia he was at pains to emphasize that it was not a disorder, or even a bad thing. It was best described as an interesting variant in human experience, like synesthesia. Nick appreciated this about Zeman, and reckoned that it was probably the right thing to say, but he thought that, though aphantasia itself might be neutral, the memory loss that came with it was definitely a bad thing. Many others felt the same. At one point, Zeman had been contacted by an automotive engineer from Essex named Alan Kendle, who had realized that he was aphantasic while listening to a radio segment about the condition. This revelation affected him so strongly that he put together a book of interviews with aphantasics, identified just by their initials, to help others navigate the discovery. Some people he interviewed were unbothered—there was definitely a range of responses—but others saw it as a curse.</p><p>Many could remember very little about their lives, and even with the events they did remember they could not muster the feeling of what they’d been like. They knew that some things had made them happy and others had made them sad, but that knowledge was factual—it didn’t evoke any emotions in the present.</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>M.L.: It leaves me as an outsider. As a viewer of life, not particularly a participant. I don’t like holidays or sightseeing—what is the point? You go, you see things, you leave, and it is gone.

When aphantasics recovered from bereavement, or breakups, or trauma, more quickly than others, they worried that they were overly detached or emotionally deficient.

She had trouble recognizing people, including people she knew pretty well, so she tended to avoid social situations where she might hurt someone’s feelings. When she first discovered that she was aphantasic, she called her father, who was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and living in a nursing home in Oregon. He had been a musician in big bands—he had toured with Bob Hope and played with Les Brown and his Band of Renown. She asked him whether he could imagine a scene in his head, and he said, Of course. I can imagine going into a concert hall. I see the wood on the walls, I see the seats, I know I’m going to sit at the back, because that’s where you get the best sound. I can see the orchestra playing a symphony, I can hear all the different instruments, and I can stop it and go backward to wherever I want it to start up and hear it again. She explained to her father what aphantasia was, how she couldn’t see images in her mind, or hear music, either. On the phone, her father started to cry. He said, But, Melinda, that’s what makes us human.</p><p>Melinda had an extremely bad memory for her life, even for an aphantasic. She once had herself checked for dementia, but the doctor found nothing wrong. She had become aware when she was in second grade that she had a bad memory, after a friend pointed it out. In an effort to hold on to her memories, she started keeping a journal in elementary school, recording what she did almost every single day, and continued this practice for decades. When, in her sixties, she got divorced and moved into an apartment by herself, she thought it would be a good time to look through her journals and revisit her younger days. She opened one and began to sob because, to her horror, the words she had written meant nothing to her. The journals were useless. She read about things she had done and it was as though they had happened to someone else.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>It was not just the distant past that she had lost—she was continuously aware of the present slipping away as soon as it happened. She had already forgotten what her two sons had been like when they were little, the feeling of holding them:</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>It’s like, this is who they are, they were never anybody else, and that’s like a knife in my chest.</p></blockquote><p>Now her greatest fear was that, if she hadn’t seen her sons in a while, she might forget them altogether:</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>I have had to accept that my life is like water flowing through my fingers. It’s just experiences moving through my hand that I can’t hold onto.</p></blockquote><p>Although Nick had made his peace with his lack of imagery, he still grieved his inability to revisit his past. At one point, he came across the work of a Canadian psychologist, Endel Tulving, who, in the early nineteen-seventies, proposed that memory was not a single thing but two distinct systems: semantic memory, which consisted of general knowledge about the world, and episodic memory—recollection of experiences from your own life. Episodic memory, the sense of reliving the past, was, Tulving believed, unique to humans, and among the most astonishing products of evolution. This, Nick realized, was what he didn’t have. Learning that he lacked a profound human ability—one that, he had to assume, regenerated and immeasurably deepened your connection to your past life and the people in it who were now gone, including yourself as a child—well, there was nothing good about it. He would have preferred not to know.</p><p>He wrote to Tulving, who told him about a study to be conducted by Brian Levine, the Baycrest neuropsychologist, who had been a colleague of his in Toronto. The study would investigate exceptionally poor autobiographical memory in healthy adults—people who did not have amnesia or dementia or brain injury or psychological trauma. Levine later named this syndrome “severely deficient autobiographical memory,” or <em>sdam</em>. Nick was accepted as a participant and travelled to Toronto. The study found that the participants’ experience of <em>sdam</em> could be objectively corroborated, using a variety of methods, by comparing them to a control group. fMRI, for instance, showed reduced activation in the midline regions of their brains, an area normally associated with mental time travel.</p><p>Nick was surprised to hear that another participant in the study had described an even starker experience of episodic memory loss than his. She felt so detached from her past that the facts she knew about it felt to her no more personal than facts about someone else. He definitely didn’t feel that way. The things he knew about his life felt more personal to him than facts he knew about physics, say, even though he couldn’t inhabit them in the way that other people could. He realized that Tulving’s binary schema, which categorized all memory as either episodic or semantic, was too simple. His own memories were somewhere in between. He remembered that on the day that his mother died, in 2003, his sister had phoned him to say that their mother was being admitted to the hospital; he had taken a train from Cambridge to London, and he had phoned an old friend to meet him in London because he was worried that, in his distress, he might go to the wrong station and miss the second train he needed to catch, but the friend helped him, and he got on the right train, and it was around Guy Fawkes Night, fireworks going off outside the train window, and then he got to the hospital and was there for a while, and then his mother died. He knew these things, and the idea of his mother dying aroused emotion in him, but he couldn’t feel what it had been like to be in the train, or the hospital, and he could not remember his mother’s face.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>From an evolutionary point of view, he supposed, he had all the memory he needed: enough to know what and whom he had loved, and what he should try to avoid doing again. But to think about it that way was to miss what was most important—not the function of episodic memory but the experience of it. As he absorbed what it meant to lack episodic memory, he started wondering whether there were ways he could simulate it. He was attracted to the idea of video life-logging with wearable cameras—the footage would be a decent substitute for mental time travel. His childhood and early adulthood were lost to him, but if he started filming now he would be able to relive at least the last decade or two of his life.</p><p>On a trip to Pasadena, he went to the Apple Store and tried on a virtual-reality headset. This, he thought, must be what episodic memory is like. He knew it would probably be a long time before people accepted such technologies, but perhaps one day wearable cameras would be recognized as prosthetics for people with <em>SDAM</em>, no more remarkable than glasses. Then again, film would be very different from memory. Like memory, it would be partial, but, unlike memory, it would be accurate. This, he suspected, might not necessarily be a good thing. There was something to be said for a degree of blurriness and uncertainty in recalling the past; it was helpful in forgiving other people, and yourself.</p><p>At some point, Nick became interested in the ideas of a British philosopher, Galen Strawson, who claimed to have no sense of himself as a continuously evolving being—a creature whose self consisted of a coherent story about accumulating memories and distinctive traits. Strawson was, for that reason, uninterested in his past. He acknowledged that his life had shaped him, but he believed that whether or not he consciously remembered it didn’t matter to who he was now, any more than it mattered whether a musician playing a piece could call to mind a memory of each time he’d practiced: what mattered was how well he played. What was important, Strawson felt, was his life in the present. He liked to quote the third Earl of Shaftesbury, a British philosopher of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, who had felt the same way:</p><blockquote data-testid="blockquote-wrapper"><p>The metaphysicians&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. affirm that if memory be taken away, the self is lost. [But] what matter for memory? What have I to do with that part? If, <em>whilst I am</em>, I am but as I should be, what do I care more?</p></blockquote><p>Nick wasn’t sure he agreed with Strawson, and he certainly didn’t feel, as Strawson did, that his memory of his own life was unimportant, but he found the argument somewhat comforting. He still longed to relive important moments in his life, but it was easier to think about this experience as just one of many he hadn’t had, like paragliding, or visiting Peru, than as a void at the core of his self. Many people believed that their selves were made up largely of memories, and that the loss of those memories would be a self-ending catastrophe. But he knew now that there were also thousands of people like him, who had work and marriages and ideas and thwarted desires and good days and bad days and the rest of it. All they lacked was a past.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

      White clouds drift over a combined wind-solar installation in Shandong province, China. Beijing’s support for a rapid rollout of solar and wind power forms a stark contrast with the growing antipathy of the Trump administration towards renewables.

<p>To the south of the Monte Cristo mountain range and west of Paymaster Canyon, a vast stretch of the Nevada desert has attracted modern-day prospectors chasing one of 21st-century America’s greatest investment booms.</p>
<p>Solar power developers want to cover an area larger than Washington, DC, with silicon panels and batteries, converting sunlight into electricity that will power air conditioners in sweltering Las Vegas along with millions of other homes and businesses.</p>
<p>But earlier this month, bureaucrats in charge of federal lands scrapped collective approval for the Esmeralda 7 projects, in what campaigners fear is part of an attack on renewable energy under President Donald Trump. “We will not approve wind or farmer destroying [sic] Solar,” he posted on his Truth Social platform in August. Developers will need to reapply individually, slowing progress.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles away on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, it is a different story. China has laid solar panels across an area the size of Chicago high up on the Tibetan Plateau, where the thin air helps more sunlight get through.</p>
<p>The Talatan Solar Park is part of China’s push to double its solar and wind generation capacity over the coming decade. “Green and low-carbon transition is the trend of our time,” President Xi Jinping told delegates at a UN summit in New York last month.</p>
<p>China’s vast production of solar panels and batteries has also pushed down the prices of renewables hardware for everyone else, meaning it has “become very difficult to make any other choice in some places,” according to Heymi Bahar, senior analyst at the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>In 2010, the IEA estimated that there would be 410 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels installed around the world by 2035. There is already more than four times that capacity, with about half of it in China.</p>
<p>Many countries in Africa and the Middle East, even in petrostates such as Saudi Arabia, are rapidly developing solar power. “It’s a very cheap way to harness the sun,” says Kingsmill Bond, an energy strategist at think-tank Ember.</p>

<p>Its analysis suggests that, helped by rapid growth in solar and wind energy, renewables generated more electricity than coal-fired power plants during the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Progress in energy and other areas has damped some of the pessimism around global warming. In 2015, the UN predicted temperatures would rise by 4° C compared to pre-industrial levels by 2100. It now projects a rise of 2.6° C, if climate policies are followed through.</p>
<p>But for delegates set to gather in Belém, Brazil, next month for the COP30 climate summit, any jubilation will be tempered by the knowledge that the renewables revolution is a long way from being fulfilled. Emissions from the energy sector rose for the fourth straight year in 2024 to a record high, while the slower growth in US renewables means an ambitious target to triple global capacity by 2030 will probably be missed.</p>
<p>“It’s not job done, [IEA analysis] does throw some genuine caution out there,” says Mike Hemsley, deputy director at the Energy Transitions Commission think-tank.</p>
<p>Renewable energy has lowered wholesale power costs, but that has not necessarily fed through into the prices that consumers pay, while users in many countries have not yet switched to electricity for things like transport and domestic heating in the numbers required to reduce fossil fuel usage.</p>
<p>Calculations by the Energy Institute, the sector’s global body, show that the supply of oil, gas, and coal for energy—electricity generation, heating, industrial usage, and transport—in 2024 rose by more than the supply of energy from low-carbon sources, which also includes nuclear and hydropower. That has led some to argue that renewables are merely helping to meet climbing energy demand, rather than replacing fossil fuels.</p>
<p>“The world remains in an energy addition mode, rather than a clear transition,” said Andy Brown, president of the institute, as it launched its report in August.</p>

<h2>“Renewables is the place to be”</h2>
<p>At a solar farm operated by ReNew, one of India’s biggest green energy companies, hundreds of panels glint in the sharp desert sun of surrounding Rajasthan.</p>
<p>India, the world’s third largest carbon emitter, wants to develop 500 gigawatts of clean-energy capacity by 2030, and earlier this year reached 243 GW—meaning more than half of its current installed power capacity is now from renewables.</p>
<p>“Every group in India is now saying: ‘You know what, renewables is the place to be,” says Sumant Sinha, chair and chief executive of ReNew.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, blessed with both oil and sun, has developed around 4.34 GW of solar capacity as it tries to free up more oil for export, rather than burning it in its own power stations. It wants to build up to 130 GW by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>“It’s massive, what’s going on,” Marco Arcelli, chief executive of utility ACWA Power, which is part-owned by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, told the FT earlier this year. The company is developing 30 GW of renewables in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>South Africa has authorized at least 6 GW of renewable energy capacity since President Cyril Ramaphosa removed the capacity limit on private electricity providers in 2022, breaking years of reluctance among the ruling African National Congress to challenge the dominance of state monopoly utility Eskom.</p>

<p>Middle-class households in the country have also rapidly installed solar panels on their roofs to cope with years of planned rolling blackouts due to power shortages. It is part of a worldwide trend for smaller installations as homes and businesses tire of waiting for governments or big utilities to fix power shortages.</p>
<p>Solar panel installations of less than 1MW accounted for about 42 percent of global installations last year, according to BloombergNEF, almost double the 22 percent recorded in 2015. Factories, mosques, and farms in Pakistan have covered their roofs in Chinese-made solar panels to try to avoid surging tariffs for state-provided power.</p>

<p>“We’ve displaced tens of thousands of diesel generators,” says William Brent, chief marketing officer at Husk Power Systems, which has installed about 400 “mini-grids” of solar and batteries across Nigeria and India. These are helping pharmacies store medicines and shopkeepers keep drinks cool at around half the cost of power from the grid.</p>
<p>The construction of vast solar arrays in deserts and small installations on rooftops have largely been driven by the same underlying trend: falling costs. The huge surfeit of production capacity in China, which produced about eight out of 10 of the world’s solar modules in 2024, has pushed the cost of panels down by almost 90 percent over the past decade and dragged overall capital expenditure costs down 70 percent, according to analysts.</p>
<p>Yet even in places like India, fossil fuels still hold sway. Coal still generates more than 70 percent of the country’s power output and remains politically protected, employing hundreds of thousands directly and many more indirectly in some of India’s poorest regions. “India still has a massive way to go,” says Hemsley at the ETC.</p>
<p>PM Prasad, chair of state-owned Coal India, told the FT earlier this year that it was reopening more than 30 mines and launching up to five new sites, arguing that renewables were not yet capable of meeting fast-growing energy demand.</p>
<p>The painful process of acquiring large tracts of land for solar arrays in a country with millions of smallholder farmers has also led to delays across the renewables sector, many Indian developers grumble. More than 50 GW of renewable power projects are waiting to connect to an overstretched transmission network, estimates the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think-tank, and cleantech consultancy JMK Research.</p>

<p>Even as solar panels become more popular in Sub-Saharan Africa, millions of homes and businesses still rely on expensive and polluting diesel generators, and roughly 600 million people lack access to power.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Many people also lack the means to pay commercial rates for electricity, even before factoring in the extra levies needed to finance the cost of new transmission lines, a key enabler of renewables projects around the world.</p>
<p>Electricity storage capabilities also need to dramatically improve if countries want to rely more heavily on intermittent wind and solar farms and phase out backup fossil-fuel capacity.</p>
<p>Large-scale batteries are being deployed rapidly—spurred again by China’s prolific manufacturing output. James Mittell, director at developer Actis Energy, says costs have fallen so much that it is already possible in many markets to build large-scale battery and solar systems, which can deliver power with similar consistency to gas-fired power plants, but at lower cost. “It’s a complete game-changer,” he says.</p>
<p>But progress is also mixed on the second phase of any “transition” to renewable power: persuading consumers and industries to switch to equipment that runs on electricity rather than combustion processes using fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The share of electricity in final energy demand has flatlined in the US and the EU over the past few years, with the growth of electric cars offset by the difficulty of getting people to switch away from gas or oil heating systems to low-carbon electric ones such as heat pumps.</p>
<p>“For electricity [generation] we have a success story,” says Bahar, at the IEA. “For other sectors, it’s way more complicated.”</p>

<h2>Massive growth in China</h2>
<p>China and some parts of Southeast Asia stand out in terms of the portion of energy supplied by electricity increasing—in China’s case, from about 12 percent in 2000 to about 30 percent in 2023—as millions of citizens start driving electric cars and factories switch away from fossil-fueled boilers.</p>
<p>Ember points to data showing that renewables met 84 percent of China’s new electricity demand last year as evidence that coal-powered generation in the country is nearing its peak. “We’re confident renewables can meet all China’s [power] demand growth,” adds Hemsley at the ETC.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>But even here, challenges loom. Major electricity market reforms introduced by Beijing in July mean renewable energy developers no longer get a fixed price akin to that received by coal-fired generators and are instead more exposed to market forces.</p>
<p>“They clearly don’t want to harm the build out of renewables, but they just want it to be done on a more commercial basis,” says Neil Beveridge, who leads Bernstein’s energy analysis in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>But the IEA warns it will lower returns and cut the growth of renewables. “That [impact of the reform] is the biggest uncertainty in our outlook,” adds Bahar at the IEA.</p>
<p>A far sharper slowdown is already underway in the US, where incentives introduced as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 are rolled back by the second Trump administration. Tax credits have been cut and major projects blocked—spooking investors and leaving existing developers trying to stay afloat.</p>

<p>“It’s very difficult to make big capital decisions based on this,” says Reagan Farr, chief executive of Silicon Ranch, a solar developer. “We don’t have a bipartisan energy policy in the US, which is very bad for the industry and our economy.”</p>
<p>Ørsted, the world’s largest offshore wind company, has had to raise an extra $9 billion from investors after Trump’s hostility to the offshore wind sector prevented it from selling a stake in one of its major US projects.</p>
<p>His tariffs on products from China mean higher costs for solar projects. Analysts say more large-scale solar projects are likely to have their permits revoked or reviewed.</p>
<p>Developers are currently rushing to build, as they have until July 2026 to start construction to capture the tail-end of the tax credits. But some projects and companies are bound to fail. “We’re likely facing several more years of uphill battles for many large-scale projects,” says Abby Watson, president at Groundwire Group, a consultancy.</p>

<p>The IEA has halved its forecast for renewables growth by 2030 in the US to around 250 GW as a result of Trump’s policies. Analysts at Carbon Brief estimate the country will emit 7 billion tonnes more CO₂ equivalent by 2030 under Trump’s policies than if the country had met its obligations under the 2015 Paris agreement, which he is withdrawing from.</p>
<p>The reduction in renewables growth comes as the country’s electricity demand is rising due to the growth of data centers, many of which are looking to gas-fired or nuclear power stations because they need constant, steady power.</p>
<p>Gas turbine makers are struggling to keep up with demand, while new nuclear power plants are often delayed.</p>

<p>Retail electricity prices have already risen by 5 percent since July, according to the Energy Information Administration, and some experts caution they could rise further if supplies are constrained. “The writing is on the wall,” says Pol Lezcano, director of energy and renewables at the CBRE real estate group.</p>
<p>Supporters of renewable electricity argue that the US is missing out on a revolution in cleaner, cheaper technology sweeping the world, with some likening it to the aging cars on Cuba’s roads.</p>
<p>But the relationship between renewable generation and consumer energy bills is complicated. The free energy from the sun or the wind means that the wholesale price of renewable-generated power is lower, but developers still need to make a return on their investment, and grid operators may need to step in to ensure continuity of supply when the wind and the sun are low.</p>
<p>“Even as the cost of producing electricity from renewables falls, consumers may not see immediate or proportional reductions in their bills, raising questions over the impact of renewables on power affordability,” the IEA said in its latest report.</p>
<p>More broadly, the US’s focus on fossil fuels and pullback of support for clean energy further cedes influence over the future global energy system to China.</p>
<p>The US is trying to tie its trading partners into fossil fuels, pressing the EU to buy $750 billion of American oil, natural gas, and nuclear technologies during his presidency as part of a trade deal, scuppering an initiative to begin decarbonizing world shipping and pressuring others to reduce their reliance on Chinese technology.</p>
<p>But the collapsing cost of solar panels in particular has spoken for itself in many parts of the world. Experts caution that the US’s attacks on renewables could cause lasting damage to its competitiveness against China, even if an administration more favorable to renewables were to follow Trump’s.</p>
<p>“China has run far away in terms of competitiveness,” says Antonio Cammisecra, chief executive of ContourGlobal, an independent power producer.</p>
<p>“The US is capable of rebuilding, but it will take time.”</p>

<p>Qt Creator 18 adds experimental support for Development Containers and many more improvements.</p>
<!--more-->
<h4>Development Container Support</h4>

<p>Qt Creator 18 adds support for <a href="https://containers.dev/" rel="noopener">development containers</a> to automate setting up the development environment of a project. It detects a "devcontainer.json" file in your project directory and creates a Docker container for it. You can let Qt Creator auto-detect kits or specify custom kits and control other aspects like the command bridge (our service for communicating with remote devices) with Qt Creator specific customizations in the development container definition. Note that it is still experimental and does not support all aspects of development containers yet. <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtcreator-18.0/creator-how-to-load-extensions.html" rel="noopener">Enable the extension</a> to use this functionality. <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/qt-creator.git/about/src/plugins/devcontainer/README.md" rel="noopener">Find out more</a>.</p>
<h4>General UI</h4>
<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">We added an <em>Overview</em> tab on <em>Welcome</em> mode</span> that aggregates content from the other tabs. It suggests tutorials and examples based on your experience and needs, and highlights developer-targeted posts in the Qt blog.</p>
<p>The notifications received a facelift and are now part of the progress notification popups. Y<span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">ou can opt-out of this with <em>Environment &gt; Interface &gt; Prefer banner style info bars over pop-ups</em>.</span></p>
<h4>Editing</h4>
<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/editor_tabs.png?width=400&amp;height=55&amp;name=editor_tabs.png" width="400" height="55" loading="lazy" alt="editor_tabs" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/editor_tabs.png?width=200&amp;height=28&amp;name=editor_tabs.png 200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/editor_tabs.png?width=400&amp;height=55&amp;name=editor_tabs.png 400w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/editor_tabs.png?width=600&amp;height=83&amp;name=editor_tabs.png 600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/editor_tabs.png?width=800&amp;height=110&amp;name=editor_tabs.png 800w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/editor_tabs.png?width=1000&amp;height=138&amp;name=editor_tabs.png 1000w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/editor_tabs.png?width=1200&amp;height=165&amp;name=editor_tabs.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></span></p>
<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">We added the option to use tabbed editors (<em>Environment &gt; Interface &gt; Use tabbed editors</em>).</span> But remember faster ways of navigating your code, such as <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-editor-locator.html" rel="noopener">Locator filters</a> for opening files or jumping to specific class or symbol, <span>Follow Symbol</span>, <span>Find References</span>, the <span>Open Documents</span> and <span>File System</span> views, the edit location history <span>Window &gt; Go Back/Forward</span> and the corresponding keyboard shortcuts, and <span>Window &gt; Previous/Next Open Document in History</span> and the corresponding keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>For the C++ support w<span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">e updated Clangd/LLVM to the 21.1 release for our prebuilt binaries. Additionally,&nbsp;the built-in code model received a <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/qt-creator.git/tree/dist/changelog/changes-18.0.0.md?h=18.0#n85" rel="noopener">wide range of fixes</a> for newer C++ features. We added quick fixes for removing curly braces and for adding definitions for static data members.</span></p>
<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">For QML you can now download and use the latest QML Language Server even if you are using older Qt versions for your projects (in the QML Language Server settings in <em>Preferences &gt; Language Client</em>).</span></p>
<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">We also added support for GitHub Enterprise environments for GitHub Copilot.</span></p>
<h4><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">Projects</span></h4>
<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">We moved the ".user" files that contain the Qt Creator specific project settings into the ".qtcreator/" subdirectory of the project directory. Existing ".user" files from older projects are still updated for compatibility though.</span></p>
<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/projectmodewithtabs.png?width=398&amp;height=74&amp;name=projectmodewithtabs.png" width="398" height="74" loading="lazy" alt="projectmodewithtabs" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/projectmodewithtabs.png?width=199&amp;height=37&amp;name=projectmodewithtabs.png 199w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/projectmodewithtabs.png?width=398&amp;height=74&amp;name=projectmodewithtabs.png 398w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/projectmodewithtabs.png?width=597&amp;height=111&amp;name=projectmodewithtabs.png 597w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/projectmodewithtabs.png?width=796&amp;height=148&amp;name=projectmodewithtabs.png 796w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/projectmodewithtabs.png?width=995&amp;height=185&amp;name=projectmodewithtabs.png 995w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/projectmodewithtabs.png?width=1194&amp;height=222&amp;name=projectmodewithtabs.png 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px"></span></p>
<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">In Projects mode you can now choose to only show kits that are actually usable by the project, or only kits that the project is already configured for. We also split up the <em>Run</em> page into <em>Deploy Settings</em>&nbsp;and <em>Run Settings</em>, and together with the <em>Build Settings</em> moved them out of the kit selection to tabs in the content view. Normally the run configurations of the various build configurations are independent of each other. In Qt Creator 18 we have added the option to sync the run configurations within a single kit, or even between all kits that the project is configured for.</span></p>
<p><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">For CMake projects we now also support <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.25/manual/cmake-presets.7.html#test-preset" rel="noopener">Test Presets</a> and added a Locator filter "ct" for running CTest based tests. We also fixed building CMake&nbsp;projects for all build configurations (<span>Build &gt; Build Project for All Configurations</span>).</span></p>
<h4><span data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">Devices</span></h4>
<p>We added a configuration for various tools on remote Linux&nbsp;devices, like GDB server, CMake, clangd, rsync, qmake, and more, and the option to auto-detect them. This improves the configuration of remote devices as build devices. More is to come in future releases in this regard. You can now also decide if Qt Creator should try to automatically re-connect to devices at startup with a new <em>Auto-connect on startup</em>&nbsp;setting. We also fixed that it wasn't possibly to use rsync for deployment when building on a remote device as well as using a remote target device.</p>
<h4>Other Improvements</h4>
<p>Qt Creator 18 comes with many more improvements and fixes. For example the Git commit editor now provides many more actions on files, like staging, unstaging, and directly adding files to ".gitignore".</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 15:07:15 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://danieldelaney.net/normal/">https://danieldelaney.net/normal/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45760878">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><a href="https://danieldelaney.net/" id="logo"><span>Dd</span></a>






<p>I’m the person my friends and family come to for computer-related help. (Maybe you, gentle reader, can relate.) This experience has taught me which computing tasks are frustrating for normal people.</p>

<p>Normal people often struggle with converting video. They will need to watch, upload, or otherwise do stuff with a video, but the format will be weird. (Weird, broadly defined, is anything that won’t play in QuickTime or upload to Facebook.)</p>

<p>I would love to recommend Handbrake to them, but the user interface is by and for power users. Opening it makes normal people feel unpleasant feelings.</p>



<p>This problem is rampant in free software. The FOSS world is full of powerful tools that only have a “power user” UI. As a result, people give up. Or worse: they ask people like you and I to do it for them.</p>

<p>I want to make the case to you that you can (and should) solve this kind of problem in a single evening.</p>

<p>Take the example of <a href="https://danieldelaney.net/magicbrake/">Magicbrake</a>, a simple front end I built. It hides the power and flexibility of Handbrake. It does only <em>the one thing</em> most people need Handbrake for: taking a weird video file and making it normal. (Normal, for our purposes, means a small MP4 that works just about anywhere.)</p>

<p>There is exactly one button.</p>



<p>This is a fast and uncomplicated thing to do. Unfortunately, the people who have the ability to solve problems like this are often disinclined to do it.</p>

<p>“Why would you make Handbrake less powerful on purpose?”</p>

<p>“What if someone wants a different format?”</p>

<p>“What about [feature/edge case]?”</p>

<p>The answer to all these questions is the same: a person who needs or wants that stuff can use Handbrake. If they don’t need everything Handbrake can do and find it bewildering, they can use this. Everyone wins.</p>

<p>It’s a bit like obscuring the less-used functions on a TV remote with tape. The functions still exist if you need them, but you’re not required to contend with them just to turn the TV on.</p>



<p>People benefit from stuff like this, and I challenge you to make more of it. Opportunities are everywhere. The world is full of media servers normal people can’t set up. Free audio editing software that requires hours of learning to be useful for simple tasks. Network monitoring tools that seem designed to ward off the uninitiated. Great stuff normal people don’t use. All because there’s only one UI, and it’s designed to do <em>everything.</em></p>

<p>80% of the people only need 20% of the features. Hide the rest from them and you’ll make them more productive and happy. That’s really all it takes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><p> More than 70 countries signed the landmark <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/convention/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.N. Convention against Cybercrime</a> in Hanoi this weekend, a significant step in the yearslong effort to create a global mechanism to counteract digital crime. </p><p> The U.K. and European Union joined China, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria and dozens of other nations in signing the convention, which lays out new mechanisms for governments to coordinate, build capacity and track those who use technology to commit crimes.&nbsp; </p><p> In his speech at the event, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said cyberspace “has become fertile ground for criminals” and has allowed them to “defraud families, steal livelihoods, and drain billions of dollars from our economies.” </p><p> “The UN Cybercrime Convention is a powerful, legally binding instrument to strengthen our collective defences against cybercrime,” Guterres <a href="https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1m/k1mmr6e30l?fbclid=IwY2xjawNsbKBleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFEaEJoeEdZVm5jOHFrbUZwAR6naDVwPBo0PIG40vUDzWufVp-JMZnPlhXObSoo82Td1voIWEEcVPyLc4VCqw_aem_BZcBFnBsiMKuxTexgtKUBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>.&nbsp; </p><p> “Illicit flows of money, concealed through cryptocurrencies and digital transactions, finance the trafficking of drugs, arms, and terror. And businesses, hospitals, and airports are brought to a standstill by ransomware attacks.” </p><p> He added that the convention would be critical for governments in the Global South that need assistance and funding for the training required to address cybercrime — which the U.N. estimates costs $10.5 trillion around the world annually.&nbsp; </p><p> While many countries did not sign the treaty, the most notable missing signature was that of the U.S. </p><p> Officials at the State Department <a href="https://therecord.media/cybercrime-treaty-signing-hanoi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Recorded Future News on Friday</a> that Marc Knapper, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, and representatives from the U.S. Mission to Vietnam would be attending the signing.&nbsp; </p><p> The State Department confirmed on Monday that the U.S. did not sign the treaty.&nbsp; </p><p> “The United States continues to review the treaty,” a State Department spokesperson said in a brief statement.&nbsp; </p><p> The U.N. Convention against Cybercrime was adopted by the General Assembly <a href="https://therecord.media/un-general-assembly-approves-cybercrime-treaty-despite-industry-pushback" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in December 2024</a> and will enter into force 90 days after being ratified by the 40th signatory. Signatories will have to ratify the convention according to their own procedures.&nbsp; </p><p> At the ceremony, UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly argued that cybercrime is changing the face of organized crime and required global coordination to address. Waly said the convention would be a “vital tool” that will ensure “a safer digital world for all.” </p><p> U.N. officials said the convention would help governments address terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering and drug smuggling, all of which have been turbo-charged by the internet.&nbsp; </p><p> The U.N. noted that the convention is the first global framework “for the collection, sharing and use of electronic evidence for all serious offenses” — noting that until now there have been no broadly accepted international standards on electronic evidence.&nbsp; </p><p> It is also the first global treaty to criminalize crimes that depend on the internet and is the first international treaty “to recognize the non-consensual dissemination of intimate images as an offense.” </p><p> “It creates the first global 24/7 network where countries can quickly initiate cooperation,” the U.N. said. “It recognizes and promotes the need to build capacity in countries to pursue and cooperate on fast-moving cybercrimes.” </p><p> The convention has been heavily criticized by the tech industry, which has warned that it criminalizes cybersecurity research and exposes companies to legally thorny data requests. </p><p> Human rights groups warned on Friday that it effectively forces member states to create a broad electronic surveillance dragnet that would include crimes that have nothing to do with technology.&nbsp; </p><p> Many expressed concern that the convention will be abused by dictatorships and rogue governments who will deploy it against critics or protesters — even those outside of a regime’s jurisdiction.&nbsp; </p><p> It also creates legal regimes to monitor, store and allow cross-border sharing of information without specific data protections. Access Now’s Raman Jit Singh Chima said the convention effectively justifies “cyber authoritarianism at home and transnational repression across borders.”&nbsp; </p><p> Any countries ratifying the treaty, he added, risks “actively validating cyber authoritarianism and facilitating the global erosion of digital freedoms, choosing procedural consensus over substantive human rights protection.” </p><p> In his speech, Guterres referenced the backlash to the convention, telling member states that the treaty has to be a “promise that fundamental human rights such as privacy, dignity, and safety must be protected both offline and online.”&nbsp; </p><p> But at its core, according to Guterres, the convention solves one of the thorniest issues law enforcement agencies have faced over the last two decades. Countries have only recently begun to share digital evidence across borders but the convention would increase that practice.&nbsp; </p><p> “This has long been a major obstacle to justice — with perpetrators in one country, victims in another, and data stored in a third,” he said. “The Convention provides a clear pathway for investigators and prosecutors to finally overcome this barrier.” </p></span></p><div><div><p>Get more insights with the </p><p>Recorded Future</p><p>Intelligence Cloud.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform?mtm_campaign=ad-unit-record">Learn more.</a></p></div><div><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/?utm_source=therecord&amp;utm_medium=ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><figure><img alt="Recorded Future" fetchpriority="high" width="1000" height="500" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/format_webp/2025_0514_Record_Ads_970x250_1_d144dbf901.png"></figure></a></div><div><p><span>Tags</span></p><ul><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/united-nations">United Nations</a></li><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/un-cybercrime-treaty">UN Cybercrime Treaty</a></li><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime">Cybercrime</a></li></ul></div><div><p><span>No previous article</span></p><p><span>No new articles</span></p></div><div><p><a href="https://therecord.media/author/jonathan-greig"><img alt="Jonathan Greig" fetchpriority="auto" loading="lazy" width="384" height="384" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/format_webp/DSC_0283_1_a6f4e4e315.jpg"></a></p><div><figcaption><a href="https://therecord.media/author/jonathan-greig"><p>Jonathan Greig</p></a><p><span><p>is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

        <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) wants to become independent of technology from the USA – for fear of reprisals from Donald Trump, Handelsblatt has learned. The institution in The Hague wants to replace the Microsoft software currently used on workstations with OpenDesk.</p>
<!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->




  


<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<p>According to <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/technik/it-internet/software-strafgerichtshof-ersetzt-microsoft-durch-deutsche-loesung/100166382.html" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Handelsblatt</a>, the decision is to be seen against the backdrop of sanctions by the current US administration under President Donald Trump against employees such as Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan. <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Strafgerichtshof-Microsofts-E-Mail-Sperre-als-Weckruf-fuer-digitale-Souveraenitaet-10387368.html?from-en=1">Microsoft simply blocked his email access</a>. He therefore had to switch to the Swiss email service Proton. Since the ICC is highly dependent on service providers like Microsoft, its work is being paralyzed, it was stated in May.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the US government in Washington is examining further measures against the International Criminal Court, Handelsblatt further reports. This could also significantly restrict the institution's ability to work.</p>
<h3 id="nav_achieving__0">Achieving Digital Sovereignty</h3>
<p>The OpenDesk software is developed by the Center for Digital Sovereignty (Zendis), a federal company. Its task is to help resolve critical dependencies on individual technology providers.</p>
<!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->

  




<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<p>At the International Criminal Court, it's “only” about 1800 workstations that are to be freed from US dependency. However, Handelsblatt sees this as an indication that geopolitics is increasingly revolving around technology. Businesses and politicians recognize the dependence on US digital corporations as a problem, especially regarding the fact that the USA uses technology as a means of pressure.</p>
<p>The ICC is not alone in these ambitions. For example, the <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Souveraenitaet-Oeffentlicher-Gesundheitsdienst-setzt-verstaerkt-auf-Open-Source-10443399.html?from-en=1">Public Health Service wants to use OpenDesk</a>, and the <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Rahmenvertrag-MS-365-Alternative-OpenDesk-soll-die-Bundeswehr-erobern-10342327.html?from-en=1">German Armed Forces has a framework agreement with Zendis</a> has concluded a framework agreement on “sovereign communication and collaboration solutions” such as OpenDesk.</p>

<p>One thing that <strong>school doesn’t teach you</strong> (not even high school) is <strong>how to manage your personal finances</strong>.</p>

<p>As my eldest son’s birthday was approaching, we suggested that instead of asking for physical gifts, he ask for their equivalent in money. That way, he gathered a <strong>decent amount of capital for his first investment adventure.</strong></p>

<p>I explained to my kids that <strong>investing is like having a magic box</strong> that generates more money over time. To make it more visual and interactive, I decided to create a small app where they could <strong>see their investment grow day by day</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="from-idea-to-app">From Idea to App</h2>

<p>My first idea was to build a <strong>physical piggy bank with a display</strong>, showing the accumulated amount. However, that mixed up the concept of <strong>saving</strong> with <strong>investing</strong>, and also required buying extra hardware.</p>

<p>So I looked for a quicker, cheaper way: <strong>revive an old smartphone</strong> and create a simple app using plain HTML.</p>

<p>The result was <strong>D-i<del>n</del>vestments</strong>, a mix between <em>Diversions</em> and <em>Investments</em>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>The app is essentially <strong>a single HTML file</strong> that installs on the phone as a <strong>PWA (Progressive Web App)</strong>.</p>

<p>The phone is <strong>attached to the fridge</strong> and works as a <strong>panel or dashboard</strong> where my kids can see <strong>their money growing each day.</strong></p>

<p>I act as their <strong>investment agent</strong>, assigning <strong>realistic interest rates</strong> — high enough to keep them motivated, but moderate enough to reflect how the real world works.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="configuration-screen">Configuration Screen</h2>

<p>The app includes a screen where you can enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The kids’ names</li>
  <li>The invested amount</li>
  <li>The interest rate</li>
  <li>The start date</li>
</ul>

        <p><img src="https://roberdam.com/assets/images/pantacel1.jpg" alt="Configuration screen"></p><p>Configuration screen</p>
    
</div>



<p>With that data, the app automatically calculates and displays:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Daily gain</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Weekly gain</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Monthly gain</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Total updated balance</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="materials-used">Materials Used</h2>

  <li>A <strong>suction mount</strong> to attach it to the fridge</li>

</div>



<hr>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>The process is as simple as opening the link from a smartphone and tapping <strong>“Install”</strong> when prompted by the browser.<br>
From then on, it behaves like a native app.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="final-reflection">Final Reflection</h2>

<p>The goal wasn’t just to teach my kids the value of money, but to <strong>show them visually how investment and time work as allies.</strong></p>

<p>Each day, as they watch their small fund grow, <strong>they grasp the magic of compound interest</strong> — and that, more than any gift, is a lesson I hope will stay with them for life.</p>
