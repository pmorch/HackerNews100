            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ericwbailey.website/published/dungeons-and-dragons-taught-me-how-to-write-alt-text/">https://ericwbailey.website/published/dungeons-and-dragons-taught-me-how-to-write-alt-text/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41061755">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I played a lot of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">the pen-and-paper roleplaying game</a> in high school and college. I’m now conceptually more into <a href="https://dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World</a>’s approach, but I digress.</p>
<p>Unlike Tom Hanks, I avoided turning into a <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/tom-hanks-film-debut-was-a-drama-about-dungeons-dragons/">delusional murderer</a>. Instead, I deepened some friendships, had a lot of big laughs, learned some cool vocabulary, and had an indirect introduction to systems design. Importantly, I also annoyed the hell out of my high school principal.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Dungeons &amp; Dragons, there are two general flavors for how to play:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using miniatures and a map, or</li>
<li>Theater of the mind.</li>
</ol>
<p>We elected for theater of the mind more often than not. This was mostly because the rule books by themselves were expensive enough, and my friends and I were lower middle class.</p>
<p>Theater of the mind play means that the entire game is conducted verbally. The sole exception is your character sheet, which is a text and number-based armature you build the rest of your character from.</p>
<p>The narrative is shared amongst everyone by talking. The aesthetics of the game exist entirely in each player’s mind, and not communicated via moving little figures around on a map.</p>
<p>You can probably guess where this post is going now.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you%2C-random-dragon-magazine-issue">Thank you, random Dragon Magazine issue</h2>
<p>Because I cannot <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/half-ass">half-ass</a> anything, I went hard on immersing myself in the culture surrounding Dungeons and Dragons. This included subscribing to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_(magazine)">Dragon magazine</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t remember the issue number, or the original author. However, I do remember it was from an advice column. The problem was the person who was running the game wanting to enliven his descriptions, as they felt like their narration was both boring and confusing.</p>
<p>The advice for that problem was spectacular, and it boiled down to <strong>describing the most important thing first</strong>.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A large room with rough stone walls. Brownish moss clings to the walls, and trickles of brackish water also flow down parts of it. Broken furniture is scattered across on the floor. The ceiling is so high that you cannot see it. Also, there is a large red dragon attacking you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I’d want to know about the red dragon’s presence and activity a lot more than the quality of the masonry. There’s also another odd bit of putting too much detail on the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Let’s rephrase it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A huge dragon the color of a smoldering coal is attacking you! It is rearing its snake-like neck up to strike, head poised underneath a ceiling that is so high you cannot see it. Its dull black, iron-like claws dig into the floor of the rough stone room as it prepares to lunge at you. Broken furniture is scattered about, no doubt victims of previous altercations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve put the most important thing first. We then <strong>supply detail in an order that aids in understanding the main point</strong>, and discard information that is irrelevant to the overall concept we’re trying to communicate and mood we’re trying to evoke.</p>
<p>We now know:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s a big dragon, and it’s seriously pissed off,</li>
<li>There’s ample room for it to move around,</li>
<li>It can, and has previously made good on its threats, and that</li>
<li>There’s not a lot of places to take cover.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is explicit prioritization of information. It also demonstrates that informative information can also be entertaining.</p>
<h2 id="context%2C-context%2C-context">Context, context, context</h2>
<p>Observant readers may also note I’ve added some emotion with the exclamation point, as well as adding some more flowery language into the mix.</p>
<p>Alternative text descriptions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt">alt text</a>) are as much an art as much as they are a science.</p>
<p>A red dragon attack is <strong>a significant event</strong>, so additional detail and emotion helps. I feel confident in both editorializing the experience as well as punching it up, given that the larger goal is to communicate a frenetic, action-packed encounter.</p>
<p>The same also applies in reverse. <strong>Smaller, more succinct descriptions can be equally helpful</strong> in situations where the content is not a major contributor of the overall thing you’re trying to communicate.</p>
<p>In Dungeons &amp; Dragons this is a bit of an in-joke. Over-describing something trivial can lead to your players fixating on it, completely derailing the plot as they try and uncover the secrets behind something mundane that you had no pre-formulated plans for.</p>
<p>This is why you want to go with this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A worn, wooden mug full of cheap ale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A stout mug crafted from reclaimed lumber. It is poorly stained and worn smooth from years of heavy use. Twin iron bands are placed at the top and bottom, equally as worn and giving it a comfortable heft. A thin, frothy ale has been poured into it, smelling weakly of hops and strongly of alcohol. A single rivulet of ale pours down the side of the mug to stain the bar top the mug is placed on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, it’s a great description, but also not the point. The point is you’re in a seedy pub chasing down rumors about a goblin who somehow got its grubby little hands on a powerful magic artifact.</p>
<p>For alt text, we want to also consider the larger context of <strong>what you’re trying to communicate</strong>, <strong>why</strong>, and <strong>if the detail you provide helps that effort to communicate</strong>.</p>
<p>Consider the difference between a small badge that indicates a product has been recently-added to the storefront:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>New!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://x.com/NASA/status/1552750698114187269">this Tweet from NASA</a> showcasing a photo from the James Webb telescope:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A dramatic blade made of red gaseous wisps comes down top-to-bottom in the center of the image as smaller green wisps feather out in horizontal directions. A bright star shrouded in blue light is near the center of the bow-like blade. Blue dots in different sizes dot the background of the image, signifying neighboring stars.⁣</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tone-and-mood">Tone and mood</h2>
<p>These two concepts are the bread and butter of a roleplaying game experience. Consider:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The vizier prattles on, clearly in love with the sound of their own voice. Meanwhile, the rest of the court slumps—bored, exasperated, and succumbing to the stifling heat of the high summer. They are taking their cue from the sultan, some nakedly jealous of the cushioned throne he is slowly nodding off on.</p>
  <p>In the desperation of scanning the room to find something more interesting to look at, you catch the unblinking gaze of the court jester. His stare makes you feel like a butterfly pinned to a specimen spreading board. The room begins to slowly fade to black as you continue to lock eyes. A subtle foxfire aura begins to shimmer around his frame, while a placeless humming sound gets louder and louder. The heat of the room is forgotten as a chill runs down your spine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A white woman with short blue hair smirks at the camera and raises a glass to it. Her drink is a margarita, and the glass is beaded with sweat from the heat of the day. She is wearing a loose white shirt, and oversized red sunglasses are perched perfectly on her head. Her hair is slightly frizzy from the humidity, but her expression clearly communicates that she is unbothered by it. It is the golden hour, and the sun casts a warm, hazy amber glow on her skin. The table she is sitting at is wooden and well-worn. Behind her is a busy street, a blur of people going about their day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these descriptions are <strong>evocative</strong>.</p>
<p>As the author of both experiences I am trying to not only:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe what is physically present, but also</li>
<li>How all the qualities add up as a suggestion for how to feel when taken in as a composite whole.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the roleplaying game description, I am injecting an immediate sense of fear and menace into an otherwise boring situation. For the image description, I am I am creating a sense of relaxation and contentment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the introduction of the vizier may seem contradictory when compared to the dragon on a first read through. Remember that this is <strong>an editorialized experience</strong>.</p>
<p>The most important thing in this scene is the feelings of shock and fear when something unexpected and unsettling interrupts the mundane. In order to create that feeling, we need to first establish the humdrum experience of an boring, endless meeting in a stifling room.</p>
<h2 id="the-user-experience-of-assistive-technology">The user experience of assistive technology</h2>
<p>Another reason why I advocate for describing the most important thing first is because of how screen readers announce alt text. A screen reader will read it in a linear order, starting from the first word in the string and ending with the last.</p>
<p>Unlike other web content, there isn’t really any other special way screen readers can work with alt text strings—short of increasing or decreasing the speaking rate. This is also why things like bolding, italicizing, links, and paragraphs aren’t allowed.</p>
<p>Another important thing to know about screen readers is that they have dedicated keyboard commands to make them <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html#StartingAndStoppingNVDA">pause or stop announcing</a>. There are a few use cases for this behavior, but the most common one is, “Yup, I got it. Shut up now.”</p>
<p>Placing helpful, but ultimately non-critical information after the most important thing <strong>lets the person using the screen reader decide when they know enough to get what they need</strong>. It also saves them from wasting time re-listening to superfluous information if re-navigating to the image to glean some important detail (“Oh, what was the subject of that painting again?”).</p>
<h2 id="remember%2C-you-control-the-narrative">Remember, you control the narrative</h2>
<p>The person who runs the game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons has a responsibility to provide an entertaining and memorable experience for the other participants.</p>
<p><strong>You wield power as the person enabling and facilitating the experiences others have</strong>. This applies to roleplaying games as well as writing alt text.</p>
<p>This is why I believe <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/img-alt-attribute-alternate-description-decorative/">most contemporary images on the web are not decorative</a>. It’s also why I think it’s important to <a href="https://tink.uk/thoughts-on-skin-tone-and-text-descriptions.md-notes-on-synthetic-speech/">include details like race, gender, and ethnicity</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge this fact. For roleplaying games, it <a href="https://startplaying.games/blog/posts/tabletop-consent-guide-cj-mccullough">centers around <strong>consent</strong></a>. For alt text, it centers around <strong>autonomy</strong>.</p>
<p>We want to ensure that people who cannot see the image have <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#general-guidelines">the capability to understand it the same way as someone who can</a>. There is a huge amount of power in this act.</p>
<h2 id="skills-you-can-cultivate">Skills you can cultivate</h2>
<p>A decent amount of people are uncomfortable the first time they play a roleplaying game. Acting out a character in front of others can feel strange at first, but is also a feeling that passes the more you do it.</p>
<p>The same applies for writing alt text. The more often you practice it, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>The grim reality is <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/#alttext">the state of alt text on the web leaves a lot to be desired</a>. That said, writing it can be a joy and an art. If you’re looking for a new adventure to start, here are some resources that can help you on your quest:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>You can access data from <em>deleted forks</em>, <em>deleted repositories</em> and even <em>private repositories</em> on GitHub. And it is available forever. This is known by GitHub, and intentionally designed that way. </p><p>This is such an enormous attack vector for all organizations that use GitHub that we’re introducing a new term: <strong>Cross Fork Object Reference (CFOR)</strong>. A CFOR vulnerability occurs when one repository fork can access sensitive data from another fork (including data from private and deleted forks). Similar to an Insecure Direct Object Reference, in CFOR users supply commit hashes to directly access commit data that otherwise would not be visible to them. </p><p>Let’s see a few examples.</p><h2>Accessing Deleted Fork Data</h2><p>Consider this common workflow on GitHub:&nbsp;</p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>You fork a public repository</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>You commit code to your fork</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>You delete your fork</p></li></ol><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,msknWhH1EkTt7PchLIRCt3npCI.png" data-framer-height="1646" data-framer-width="2723" height="823" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/msknWhH1EkTt7PchLIRCt3npCI.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/msknWhH1EkTt7PchLIRCt3npCI.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/msknWhH1EkTt7PchLIRCt3npCI.png?scale-down-to=1024 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/msknWhH1EkTt7PchLIRCt3npCI.png?scale-down-to=2048 2048w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/msknWhH1EkTt7PchLIRCt3npCI.png 2723w" width="1361" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 100vw, (max-width: 999px) 100vw"></p><p>Is the code you committed to the fork still accessible?

As a result, it’s possible that confidential data and secrets are inadvertently being exposed on an organization's public GitHub repositories.</p><h2>How do you actually access the data?</h2><p>By directly accessing the commit.</p><p>Destructive actions in GitHub’s repository network (like the 3 scenarios mentioned above) remove references to commit data from the standard GitHub UI and normal git operations. However, this data still exists and is accessible (if you know the commit hash).

												<p>The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in “<strong>.top</strong>” has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in “.com.”</p>
<div id="attachment_68142"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68142" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishtrap.png" alt="" width="750" height="458" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishtrap.png 776w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishtrap-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-68142">Image: Shutterstock.</p></div>
<p>On July 16, the <strong>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</strong> (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD).</p>
<p>Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains.</p>
<p>“Based on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,” the <a href="https://www.icann.org/uploads/compliance_notice/attachment/1225/hedlund-to-wenxia-16jul24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICANN letter reads</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>ICANN’s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called <strong>Jiangsu Bangning Science &amp; Technology Co. Ltd</strong>. Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in <a href="https://interisle.net/insights/phishing-landscape-2024-an-annual-study-of-the-scope-and-distribution-of-phishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new phishing report</a> released today by the <strong>Interisle Consulting Group</strong>, which sources phishing data from several places, including the <strong>Anti-Phishing Working Group</strong> (APWG), <strong>OpenPhish</strong>, <strong>PhishTank</strong>, and <strong>Spamhaus</strong>.</p>
<p>Interisle’s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year.</p>

<p>ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science &amp; Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend.</p>
<p>For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published <em>more than a&nbsp;year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. </em></p>
<div id="attachment_68141"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68141" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/apwg-2013.png" alt="" width="784" height="512" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/apwg-2013.png 784w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/apwg-2013-768x502.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/apwg-2013-782x511.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-68141">Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being.</p></div>
<p>A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InterPlanetary File System</a> (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks — which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down — increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.<span id="more-68137"></span></p>
<p>Last year’s report from Interisle found that domain names ending in “.us” — the top-level domain for the United States — <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/why-is-us-being-used-to-phish-so-many-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were among the most prevalent in phishing scams</a>. While .us domains are not even on the Top 20 list of this year’s study, “.com” maintained its perennial #1 spot as the largest source of phishing domains overall.</p>
<p>A year ago, the phishiest domain registrar by far was <strong>Freenom</strong>, a now-defunct registrar that handed out free domains in several country-code TLDs, including .tk, .ml, .ga and .cf. Freenom went out of business after <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/sued-by-meta-freenom-halts-domain-registrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being sued by Meta</a>, which alleged Freenom ignored abuse complaints while monetizing traffic to abusive domains.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/05/phishing-domains-tanked-after-meta-sued-freenom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freenom’s demise</a>, phishers quickly migrated to other new low-cost TLDs and to services that allow anonymous, free domain registrations — particularly subdomain services. For example, Interisle found phishing attacks involving websites created on Google’s <strong>blogspot.com</strong> skyrocketed last year more than 230 percent. Other subdomain services that saw a substantial growth in domains registered by phishers include <strong>weebly.com</strong>, <strong>github.io</strong>, <strong>wix.com</strong>, and <strong>ChangeIP</strong>, the report notes.</p>
<div id="attachment_68156"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishingpostfreenom.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68156" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishingpostfreenom.png" alt="" width="749" height="369" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishingpostfreenom.png 891w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishingpostfreenom-768x378.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishingpostfreenom-782x385.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-68156">Source: Interisle Consulting.</p></div>
<p>Interisle Consulting partner <strong>Dave Piscitello </strong>said ICANN could easily send similar warning letters to at least a half-dozen other top-level domain registries, noting that spammers and phishers tend to cycle through the same TLDs periodically — including <strong>.xyz</strong>, <strong>.info</strong>, <strong>.support</strong> and <strong>.lol</strong>, all of which saw considerably more business from phishers after Freenom’s implosion.</p>
<p>Piscitello said domain registrars and registries could significantly reduce the number of phishing sites registered through their services just by flagging customers who try to register huge volumes of domains at once. Their study found that at least 27% of the domains used for phishing were registered in bulk — i.e. the same registrant paid for hundreds or thousands of domains in quick succession.</p>
<p>The report includes a case study in which a phisher this year registered 17,562 domains over the course of an eight-hour period — roughly 38 domains per minute — using .lol domains that were all composed of random letters.</p>
<p>ICANN tries to resolve contract disputes privately with the registry and registrar community, and experts say the nonprofit organization usually only publishes enforcement letters when the recipient is ignoring its private notices. Indeed, ICANN’s letter notes Jiangsu Bangning didn’t even open its emailed notifications. It also cited the registry for falling behind in its ICANN membership fees.</p>
<p>With that in mind, a review of <a href="https://www.icann.org/compliance/notices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICANN’s public enforcement activity</a> suggests two trends: One is that there have been far fewer public compliance and enforcement actions in recent years — even as the number of new TLDs has expanded dramatically.</p>
<p>The second is that in a majority of cases, the failure of a registry or registrar to pay its annual ICANN membership fees was cited as a reason for a warning letter. A review of nearly two dozen enforcement letters ICANN has sent to domain registrars since 2022 shows that failure to pay dues was cited as a reason (or <em>the</em> reason) for the violation at least 75 percent of the time.</p>
<p>Piscitello, a former vice president of security at ICANN, said nearly all breach notices sent out while he was at ICANN were because the registrar owed money.</p>
<p>“I think the rest is just lipstick to suggest that ICANN’s on top of DNS Abuse,” Piscitello said.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity has sought comment from ICANN and will update this story if they respond.</p>
<p>ICANN said most of its investigations are resolved and closed through the initial informal resolution stage, and that hundreds of enforcement cases are initiated during this stage with the contracted parties who are required to demonstrate compliance, become compliant, and/or present and implement remediation plans to prevent the recurrence of those enforcement issues.</p>
<p>“It is important to take into account that, prior to issuing any notice of breach to a registrar or registry operator, ICANN Compliance conducts an overall contractual compliance ‘health check’ of the relevant contracted party,” ICANN said in a written response to questions. “During this check, ICANN Compliance proactively reviews the contracted party’s compliance with obligations across the agreements and policies. Any additional contractual violation found during these checks is added to the Notice of Breach. It is not uncommon for parties who failed to comply with contractual obligations (whether they are related to DNS Abuse, RDDS, or others) to also be in arrears with ICANN fees.”</p>
<p><strong>Update, 11:49 p.m. ET:</strong> Added statement from ICANN. Clarified Piscitello’s former role at ICANN.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, a source told TechCrunch that they received an email from CrowdStrike offering them the gift card because the company recognizes “the additional work that the July 19 incident has caused.”&nbsp;</p>

	
	


<p>“And for that, we send our heartfelt thanks and apologies for the inconvenience,” the email read, according to a screenshot shared by the source. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/64uni_lions/status/1815928437774995555?s=46&amp;t=lLf2YRXhv7kG_Tw6dp_nCA">same email</a> was also posted on X by someone else. “To express our gratitude, your next cup of coffee or late night snack is on us!”</p>

<p>The email was sent in the name of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/about-crowdstrike/executive-team/daniel-bernard/">Daniel Bernard</a>, the company’s chief business officer, according to a screenshot of the email seen by TechCrunch According to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/david__exe/status/1815908023296221372?s=46&amp;t=lLf2YRXhv7kG_Tw6dp_nCA">one post</a> on X, in the United Kingdom the voucher was worth £7.75, or roughly $10 at today’s exchange rate.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, some of the people who posted about the gift card said that when they went to redeem the offer, they got an error message saying the voucher had been canceled. When TechCrunch checked the voucher, the Uber Eats page provided an error message that said the gift card “has been canceled by the issuing party and is no longer valid.”</p>

<p>CrowdStrike did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Friday, CrowdStrike released a faulty update that rendered around 8.5 million Windows devices unusable, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/">according to Microsoft</a>. The update caused the affected computers to be stuck at the infamous “blue screen of death,” or BSOD, a bright blue error screen with a message that is shown when Windows crashed or cannot load because of a critical software failure.</p>

	
	



<p>The outage caused delays at airports in Amsterdam, Berlin, Dubai, and London, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/US_Stormwatch/status/1814268813879206397">across the United States</a>. It also caused <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.beckersspine.com/orthopedic-spine-practices-improving-profits/60138-hospitals-halt-non-urgent-surgeries-amid-global-it-outage.html#:~:text=Hospitals%20across%20the%20U.S.%20postponed,affecting%20computers%20and%20servers%20worldwide.">several</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-german-hospitals-cancel-elective-operations-citing-global-it-outage-2024-07-19/">hospitals</a> to halt surgeries, and paralyzed countless businesses all over the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the outage began on Friday, CrowdStrike has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/">regularly published updates</a> on its efforts to figure out what caused the mass outage. In an update on Wednesday, the company said that because of a bug during the process to check that updates are ready to be released to customer devices, the faulty code “passed validation despite containing problematic content data.”</p>

	
	


<p>The company also published apologies from its CEO George Kurtz, as well as its chief security officer Shawn Henry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,” Kurtz <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/#:~:text=contacting%20CrowdStrike%20Support.-,Statement%20from%20our%20CEO,-Sent%202024%2D07">said in a message</a> published on the company’s site. “Nothing is more important to me than the trust and confidence that our customers and partners have put into CrowdStrike.

If the training data of most future models are also scraped from the web, then they will inevitably train on data produced by their predecessors. In this paper, we investigate what happens when text produced by, for example, a version of GPT forms most of the training dataset of following models. What happens to GPT generations GPT-{<i>n</i>} as <i>n</i> increases? We discover that indiscriminately learning from data produced by other models causes ‘model collapse’—a degenerative process whereby, over time, models forget the true underlying data distribution, even in the absence of a shift in the distribution over time. We give examples of model collapse for GMMs, VAEs and LLMs. We show that, over time, models start losing information about the true distribution, which first starts with tails disappearing, and learned behaviours converge over the generations to a point estimate with very small variance. Furthermore, we show that this process is inevitable, even for cases with almost ideal conditions for long-term learning, that is, no function estimation error. We also briefly mention two close concepts to model collapse from the existing literature: catastrophic forgetting arising in the framework of task-free continual learning<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Aljundi, R., Kelchtermans, K. &amp; Tuytelaars, T.

Finally, we discuss the broader implications of model collapse. We note that access to the original data distribution is crucial: in learning tasks in which the tails of the underlying distribution matter, one needs access to real human-produced data. In other words, the use of LLMs at scale to publish content on the Internet will pollute the collection of data to train their successors: data about human interactions with LLMs will be increasingly valuable.</p></div><div id="Sec2-section" data-title="What is model collapse?"><h2 id="Sec2">What is model collapse?</h2><div id="Sec2-content">
                <h3 id="FPar1">Definition 2.1 (model collapse)</h3>
                <p>Model collapse is a degenerative process affecting generations of learned generative models, in which the data they generate end up polluting the training set of the next generation. Being trained on polluted data, they then mis-perceive reality. The process is depicted in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#Fig1">1a</a>. We separate two special cases: early model collapse and late model collapse. In early model collapse, the model begins losing information about the tails of the distribution; in late model collapse, the model converges to a distribution that carries little resemblance to the original one, often with substantially reduced variance.</p>
              <p>This process occurs owing to three specific sources of error compounding over generations and causing deviation from the original model:</p><ul>
                <li>
                  <p><b>Statistical approximation error.</b> This is the primary type of error, which arises owing to the number of samples being finite, and disappears as the number of samples tends to infinity. This occurs because of a non-zero probability that information can get lost at every step of resampling.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><b>Functional expressivity error.</b> This is a secondary type of error, arising owing to limited function approximator expressiveness. In particular, neural networks are only universal approximators as their size goes to infinity. As a result, a neural network can introduce non-zero likelihood outside the support of the original distribution or zero likelihood inside the support of the original distribution. A simple example of the expressivity error is if we tried fitting a mixture of two Gaussians with a single Gaussian. Even if we have perfect information about the data distribution (that is, infinite number of samples), model errors will be inevitable. However, in the absence of the other two types of error, this can only occur at the first generation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><b>Functional approximation error.</b> This is a secondary type of error, arising primarily from the limitations of learning procedures, for example, structural bias of stochastic gradient descent<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 10" title="Mousavi-Hosseini, A., Park, S., Girotti, M., Mitliagkas, I. &amp; Erdogdu, M.

This error can be viewed as one arising in the limit of infinite data and perfect expressivity at each generation.</p>
                </li>
              </ul><p>Each of the above can cause model collapse to get worse or better. More approximation power can even be a double-edged sword—better expressiveness may counteract statistical noise, resulting in a good approximation of the true distribution, but it can equally compound the noise. More often than not, we get a cascading effect, in which individual inaccuracies combine to cause the overall error to grow. For example, overfitting the density model causes the model to extrapolate incorrectly and assigns high-density regions to low-density regions not covered in the training set support; these will then be sampled with arbitrary frequency. It is worth noting that other types of error exist. For example, computers have limited precision in practice. We now turn to mathematical intuition to explain how the above give rise to the errors observed, how different sources can compound and how we can quantify the average model divergence.</p></div></div><div id="Sec3-section" data-title="Theoretical intuition"><h2 id="Sec3">Theoretical intuition</h2><div id="Sec3-content"><p>Here we provide a theoretical intuition for the phenomenon of model collapse. We argue that the process of model collapse is universal among generative models that recursively train on data generated by previous generations. We quantify the sources of errors discussed in the previous section by examining two mathematical models, which prove to be simple enough to provide analytical expressions for quantities of interest, but also portray the phenomenon of model collapse: a discrete distribution in the absence of functional expressivity and approximation errors, and a multidimensional Gaussian approximation, portraying joint functional expressivity and statistical errors. We further illustrate the impact of all three jointly for a more complex setting of density estimation in Hilbert spaces in the <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1">Supplementary Materials</a>.</p><p>The overall stochastic process we consider, which we call learning with generational data, is the following. The dataset at generation <i>i</i> is <span>\({{\mathcal{D}}}_{i}\)</span>, comprising independent and identically distributed random variables <span>\({X}_{j}^{i}\)</span> with distribution <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>j</i> <span>∈</span> {1,…, <i>M</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>} denotes the size of the dataset. Going from generation <i>i</i> to generation <i>i</i> + 1, we aim to estimate the distribution of samples in <span>\({{\mathcal{D}}}_{i}\)</span>, with an approximation <span>\({p}_{{\theta }_{i+1}}\)</span>. This step is what we refer to as functional approximation, <span>\({p}_{{\theta }_{i+1}}={{\mathcal{F}}}_{\theta }({p}_{i})\)</span>. The dataset <span>\({{\mathcal{D}}}_{i+1}\)</span> is then generated by sampling from <span>\({p}_{i+1}={\alpha }_{i}{p}_{{\theta }_{i+1}}+{\beta }_{i}{p}_{i}+{\gamma }_{i}{p}_{0}\)</span>, with non-negative parameters <i>α</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>β</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>γ</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> summing to 1, that is, they represent proportions of data used from different generations. This corresponds to a mixing of data coming from the original distribution (<i>γ</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>), data used by the previous generation (<i>β</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) and data generated by the new model (<i>α</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>). We refer to this as the sampling step. For the mathematical models to come, we consider <i>α</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = <i>γ</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = 0, that is, data only from a single step are used, whereas numerical experiments are performed on more realistic choices of parameters.</p><h3 id="Sec4">Discrete distributions with exact approximation</h3><p>In this subsection, we consider a discrete probability distribution in absence of functional approximation and expressivity errors, that is, <span>\({\mathcal{F}}(p)=p\)</span>. In this case, model collapse arises only because of statistical errors from the sampling step. At first, the tails (low-probability events) begin to disappear as a result of the low probability of sampling them and, over time, support of&nbsp;the distribution shrinks. Denoting the sample size as <i>M</i>, if we consider state <i>i</i> with probability <span>\(q\le \frac{1}{M}\)</span>, the expected number of samples with value <i>i</i> coming from those events will be less than 1. In practice, this would mean that we lose information about them. Considering more generally some state <i>i</i> with probability <i>q</i>, using standard conditional probability, we can show that the probability of losing information (that is, sampling no data at some generation) is equal to 1 − <i>q</i>, implying that the distribution must converge to a delta function positioned at some state, with the probability of ending up at a certain state equal to the probability of sampling said state from the original distribution.</p><p>This can be shown directly by considering the process <span>\({{\bf{X}}}^{i}\to {\mathcal{F}}\,\to \)</span><span>\({p}_{i+1}\to {{\bf{X}}}^{i+1}\)</span> as a Markov chain, as <b>X</b><sup><i>i</i>+1</sup> only depends on <b>X</b><sup><i>i</i></sup>. Furthermore, if all the <span>\({X}_{j}^{i}\)</span> have the same value, then at the next generation, the approximated distribution will be exactly a delta function and therefore all of <span>\({X}_{j}^{i+1}\)</span> will also have the same value. This implies that the Markov chain contains at least one absorbing state and therefore, with probability 1, it will converge to one of the absorbing states. This is a well-known fact, of which a proof is provided in the <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1">Supplementary Materials</a>. For this chain, the only absorbing states are those corresponding to delta functions. As a result, as we follow the progress of model collapse, we are guaranteed to end up in a constant state, having lost all the information of the original distribution when the chain is absorbed. This argument also works in general owing to floating-point representations being discrete, making the Markov chain over the parameters of the model discrete. Thus, as long as the model parameterization allows for delta functions, we will get to it, because—owing to sampling errors—the only possible absorbing states are delta functions. On the basis of the discussion above, we see how both early model collapse, in which only the low-probability events get cut off, and late stage model collapse, in which the process begins to collapse into a single mode, must arise in the case of discrete distributions with perfect functional approximation.</p><h3 id="Sec5">Multidimensional Gaussian</h3><p>Following the discussion about discrete distributions, we now present a more generic result, which can be shown in the Gaussian approximation setting, in which each generation is approximated using the unbiased estimates of the mean and the variance. A similar result holds more generally, which we detail in the&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1">Supplementary Materials</a>.</p>

                  <p>Assume the original data are sampled from distribution <span>\({{\mathcal{D}}}_{0}\)</span> (not necessarily Gaussian), with non-zero sample variance. Assume <i>X</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> are fit recursively using the unbiased sample mean and variance estimators from the previous generation, <span>\({X}_{j}^{n}| {\mu }_{n},{\Sigma }_{n} \sim {\mathcal{N}}({\mu }_{n},{\Sigma }_{n})\)</span>, with a fixed sample size. Then,</p><div id="Equa"><p><span>$${\mathbb{E}}[{{\mathbb{W}}}_{2}^{2}({\mathcal{N}}({\mu }_{n},{\Sigma }_{n}),{{\mathcal{D}}}_{0})]\to \infty ;\,{\Sigma }_{n}\,\mathop{\to }\limits^{{\rm{a}}.{\rm{s}}.}\,0\,\,{\rm{a}}{\rm{s}}\,\,n\to \infty ,$$</span></p></div><p>in which <span>\({{\mathbb{W}}}_{2}\)</span> denotes the Wasserstein-2 distance between the true distribution and its approximation at generation <i>n</i>.</p>
                <p>In words, this implies that not only does the <i>n</i>th generation approximation diverge arbitrarily far from the original one but it also collapses to be zero variance as the number of generations increases, with probability 1.

For data generation from the trained models, we use a five-way beam search. We block training sequences to be 64 tokens long; then, for each token sequence in the training set, we ask the model to predict the next 64 tokens. We go through all of the original training dataset and produce an artificial dataset of the same size. Because we go through all of the original dataset and predict all of the blocks, if the model had 0 error, it would produce the original wikitext2 dataset. Training for each generation starts with generation from the original training data. Each experiment is run five times and the results are shown as five separate runs with different randomness seeds. The original model fine-tuned with real wikitext2 data obtains 34 mean perplexity, from the zero-shot baseline of 115, that is, it successfully learns the task. Finally, to be as realistic as possible, we use the best-performing model on the original task, evaluated using the original wikitext2 validation set, as the base model for the subsequent generations, meaning that—in practice—observed model collapse can be even more pronounced. Here we consider two different settings:</p><ul>

We find that models trained on generated data are able to learn some of the original task, but with errors, as seen from the increase in perplexity.</p></div><p><a data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y/figures/1" data-track-dest="link:Figure1 Full size image" aria-label="Full size image figure 1" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span></a></p></figure></div><p>It is important to note here that the observed behaviour is in line with the general intuition established in the section ‘Theoretical intuition’. To be precise, in all experiments, generational learning is only performed on a finite (usually small) number of generations, whereas claims of the section ‘Theoretical intuition’ are mostly presented in the limit of generations going to infinity. However, as seen from experiments on VAEs and GMMs in the&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1">Supplementary Materials</a>, convergence to delta functions and specific rates of such convergence are highly related to the specifics of the problem considered, and complete collapse may or may not occur, even after a small number of steps. This is further illustrated theoretically in the&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1">Supplementary Materials</a>, in which potentially notable divergence from the original model can occur even after a few generations.</p><p>Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#Fig1">1b,c</a> on the left shows histograms of individual data-point perplexities generated by the models of different generations as is evaluated by the first model developed with real wikitext2 training data. Here, over the generations, models tend to produce more sequences that the original model would produce with the higher likelihood. The observed effect is similar to that described for VAEs and GMMs in the&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1">Supplementary Materials</a>, in which—over the generations—models started to produce samples that would be produced with higher probabilities by the original model. At the same time, we discover that generated data have much longer tails, suggesting that some of the data would never be produced by the original model—these are the errors that accumulate because of the learning with generational data.</p>

We find that this causes the models to produce lower score continuations to avoid using repeats, which—as a result—causes the consequent models to perform even worse. Model perplexities shift across the generations towards more probable token sequences, as measured using the model trained on the original real data distribution. Further illustrations are provided in the&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1">Supplementary Materials</a>. In particular, enforcing this for the LLM experiments causes the perplexity to double compared with the original. Models remain as susceptible to model collapse, if not more.</p><p>The described process demonstrates that fine-tuning of language models does not curb the effects of model collapse and models that are being fine-tuned are also vulnerable. We find that, over the generations, models tend to produce more probable sequences from the original data and start introducing their own improbable sequences, that is, errors.</p></div></div><div id="Sec8-section" data-title="Discussion"><h2 id="Sec8">Discussion</h2><div id="Sec8-content"><p>We now discuss the implications of model collapse on the underlying learning dynamics of LLMs. Long-term poisoning attacks on language models are not new. For example, we saw the creation of click, content and troll farms, a form of human ‘language models’, whose job is to misguide social networks and search algorithms. The negative effect that these poisoning attacks had on search results led to changes in search algorithms. For example, Google downgraded farmed articles<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Google.

What is different with the arrival of LLMs is the scale at which such poisoning can happen once it is automated. Preserving the ability of LLMs to model low-probability events is essential to the fairness of their predictions: such events are often relevant to marginalized groups. Low-probability events are also vital to understand complex systems<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 21" title="Taleb, N. N. Black swans and the domains of statistics. Am.

This in turn causes the model to mis-perceive the underlying learning task. To sustain learning over a long period of time, we need to make sure that access to the original data source is preserved and that further data not generated by LLMs remain available over time. The need to distinguish data generated by LLMs from other data raises questions about the provenance of content that is crawled from the Internet: it is unclear how content generated by LLMs can be tracked at scale. One option is community-wide coordination to ensure that different parties involved in LLM creation and deployment share the information needed to resolve questions of provenance. Otherwise, it may become increasingly difficult to train newer versions of LLMs without access to data that were crawled from the Internet before the mass adoption of the technology or direct access to data generated by humans at scale.</p></div></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-mini.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="5%"></p><p>This latest generation continues to push the boundaries of cost efficiency, speed, and performance. Mistral Large 2 is exposed on la Plateforme and enriched with new features to facilitate building innovative AI applications.</p><h3 id="mistral-large-2">Mistral Large 2</h3><p>Mistral Large 2 has a 128k context window and supports dozens of languages including French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic, Hindi, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, along with 80+ coding languages including Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, and Bash.</p><p>Mistral Large 2 is designed for single-node inference with long-context applications in mind – its size of 123 billion parameters allows it to run at large throughput on a single node.
We are releasing Mistral Large 2 under the <a href="https://mistral.ai/licenses/MRL-0.1.md">Mistral Research License</a>, that allows usage and modification for research and non-commercial usages.</p><h5 id="general-performance">General performance</h5><p>Mistral Large 2 sets a new frontier in terms of performance / cost of serving on evaluation metrics. In particular, on MMLU, the pretrained version achieves an accuracy of 84.0%, and sets a new point on the performance/cost Pareto front of open models.</p><h5 id="code--reasoning">Code &amp; Reasoning</h5><p>Following our experience with <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/codestral/">Codestral 22B</a> and <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/codestral-mamba/">Codestral Mamba</a>, we trained Mistral Large 2 on a very large proportion of code. Mistral Large 2 vastly outperforms the previous Mistral Large, and performs on par with leading models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3 405B.</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-performance.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>A significant effort was also devoted to enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities. One of the key focus areas during training was to minimize the model’s tendency to “hallucinate” or generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or irrelevant information. This was achieved by fine-tuning the model to be more cautious and discerning in its responses, ensuring that it provides reliable and accurate outputs.</p><p>Additionally, the new Mistral Large 2 is trained to acknowledge when it cannot find solutions or does not have sufficient information to provide a confident answer. This commitment to accuracy is reflected in the improved model performance on popular mathematical benchmarks, demonstrating its enhanced reasoning and problem-solving skills:</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-code-generation.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>Performance accuracy on code generation benchmarks (all models were benchmarked through the same evaluation pipeline)</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-multiple.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>Performance accuracy on MultiPL-E (all models were benchmarked through the same evaluation pipeline, except for the "paper" row)</p><div><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-code-generation-2.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>Performance accuracy on GSM8K (8-shot) and MATH (0-shot, no CoT) generation benchmarks (all models were benchmarked through the same evaluation pipeline)</p></div><h5 id="instruction-following--alignment">Instruction following &amp; Alignment</h5><p>We drastically improved the instruction-following and conversational capabilities of Mistral Large 2. The new Mistral Large 2 is particularly better at following precise instructions and handling long multi-turn conversations. Below we report the performance on MT-Bench, Wild Bench, and Arena Hard benchmarks:</p><div><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-instruction.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>Performance on general alignment benchmarks (all models were benchmarked through the same evalutation pipeline)</p></div><p>On some benchmarks, generating lengthy responses tends to improve the scores. However, in many business applications, conciseness is paramount – short model generations facilitate quicker interactions and are more cost-effective for inference. This is why we spent a lot of effort to ensure that generations remain succinct and to the point whenever possible. The graph below reports the average length of generations of different models on questions from the MT Bench benchmark:</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-mtbench.png" alt="MT Bench benchmarks" width="100%"></p><h5 id="language-diversity">Language diversity</h5><p>A large fraction of business use cases today involve working with multilingual documents. While the majority of models are English-centric, the new Mistral Large 2 was trained on a large proportion of multilingual data. In particular, it excels in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Hindi.

<p>As I recently went through a journey of learning how to make use of deep learning (in the context of computer graphics), I&nbsp;thought it would be good to write down some notes to help others get up to speed quickly. The goal of this article is to make the reader familiar with terms and concepts used in deep learning and to implement a basic deep learning algorithm. This should make it easier to study and understand other deep learning resources. This article comes with the source code and a sample application written in HLSL/DirectX 12 available at <a href="https://github.com/boksajak/Dx12NN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/boksajak/Dx12NN</a>.</p>

<p>Deep learning algorithms are powered by artificial neural networks. These are collections of interconnected neurons (also called <strong>units</strong>), usually organized into <strong>layers</strong>. When a neural network has large number of layers, we say that the network is deep, giving us a name <strong>deep learning</strong>. Each neuron has its inputs connected to other neurons via weighted connections, performs a simple computation over them, and passes its output to other neurons.</p>
<p>The type of neural network that we’re going to use in this article is called <strong>multilayer perceptron (MLP)</strong>. It is relatively simple, but also powerful, and is widely used in practice (e.g., for neural radiance cache (NRC) and neural radiance fields (NeRFs)).</p>
<p>The MLP is constructed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Neurons are organized into layers, where first layer is called <strong>input layer</strong>, last layer is <strong>output layer</strong> and between them are <strong>hidden layers.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each neuron has its inputs connected to outputs of all neurons in the previous layer. Therefore, we say that MLPs are <strong>fully connected networks</strong>, see the Figure 1 for an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This network architecture forms a directed acyclic graph, meaning that information only flows in one way, starting in the input layer and propagating through hidden layers to the output layer. We say that such network is a <strong>feedforward network</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Note: Other network types, where information can also flow backwards (via <strong>feedback connections</strong>) are called <strong>recurrent networks</strong>. Some networks also have memory cells to store values from previous evaluations of the network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Number of neurons and layers in the network determines how powerful the network is. Larger networks have the ability to learn more complex functions (we say that they have a larger <strong>capacity</strong>) but are typically more difficult to train and slower to evaluate. When designing a deep learning algorithm, we need to find a network size which is just right for the task. E.g., the NeRF paper uses MLP with 9 hidden layers consisting of 256 neurons each, and NRC uses 5 hidden layers with 64 neurons.</p>
<p>Note that these networks are small enough that they can be implemented in compute shaders and executed per pixel. In practice, some clever optimizations are necessary but it’s not impossible to have a deep learning algorithm running in real-time on current GPUs. It is also common to run neural networks using types with reduced precision, like FP16 or even smaller.</p>

<p>All the computation that neural network does happens in the neurons. Output value of the neuron (also called its <strong>activation</strong>) is calculated as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, we sum up activations of all neurons from the previous layer connected to this neuron, weighted by the strength of the connection (this strength is also called the <strong>weight</strong>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We add <strong>bias</strong> of the evaluated neuron to the sum. Bias is a per-neuron value which helps to represent non-linear relationships between network inputs and outputs. Without the bias, output of the network for zero input could only be a zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We apply the <strong>activation function</strong> to this sum to produce final neuron activation. This must be a non-linear function, which introduces another non-linearity between inputs and outputs. Usually, we use a simple function like (max(0,x)). Without the activation function, outputs of the network could only be a linear combination of the inputs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>More formally, we can write neuron evaluation as:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">O_{i} = \sigma\left( \left( \sum_{j}^{M}{O_{j}*w_{ij}} \right) + b_{i} \right)</span></p>
<p>where <span data-katex-display="false">O_{i}</span> is the activation of the evaluated neuron, <span data-katex-display="false">\sigma</span> is the activation function, <span data-katex-display="false">M</span> is the set of input neurons connected to the evaluated neuron, <span data-katex-display="false">O_{j}</span> is the activation of the input neuron <span data-katex-display="false">j</span> from previous layer, <span data-katex-display="false">w_{ij}</span> is the weight of the connection between neurons <span data-katex-display="false">i</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">j</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">b_{i}</span> is the bias value of the evaluated neuron.</p>
<p>This means, that the output of the network for specific input is given by <strong>weights and biases</strong> and we need to set them accordingly to produce desired results. The process of adjusting weights and biases to make the network do what we want is called <strong>training</strong>.</p>

<p>Neural networks based on MLPs are usually used for one of two main tasks: classification and regression:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Categorizes the input into one (or more) predefined categories. These neural networks have one output neuron for each category and assign a probability of input belonging to each category as its output. E.g., we can have an input image of a hand-written digit and train the MLP to assign probability of the digit belonging into categories representing digits from 0 to 9. This exercise is a common “hello world” example in deep learning and there is a freely available set of images of hand-written digits called <a href="https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/mnist_datasets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MNIST</a> that can be used for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regression:</strong> For given input, the regression calculates a continuous numerical value on the output (also called a <strong>prediction</strong>). The goal is to train the network to perform a desired mapping between inputs and output values. E.g., the NRC algorithm trains the network to map inputs like surface position and normal to radiance values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In our sample application we will train the network to do regression, specifically it will learn to represent a 2D texture. We will provide UV coordinates of the texture as inputs, and we’ll expect RGB value of the corresponding texel on the output. We want it to learn the mapping:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\left( u,\ v \right) \rightarrow (R,\ G,\ B)</span></p>
<p>For this example, our network will have 2 neurons in the input layer, corresponding to the <span data-katex-display="false">u</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">v</span> coordinates in the texture. On the output, we will have 3 neurons corresponding to the RGB values of the texel. In practice, it is common to <strong>encode the input</strong> into different representation. A naïve encoding which simply assigns inputs to input neurons as they are is called <strong>identity,</strong> and while it works, some clever encoding schemes usually perform much better. We’ll talk more about input encodings in section 4. Note that the input layer doesn’t perform any computation – instead of calculating activation of the neurons in the input layer, we simply assign input values as their activations.</p>
<p>Before we can use the MLP, it must be trained to perform our desired mapping well. Training is relatively complex and will be described in section 3, so let’s now assume that we have trained the network, obtained the correct weights and biases and we want to calculate the network output (prediction) for given input – this process is also called <strong>inference</strong> and because the information flows forward through the network, it’s sometimes also called the <strong>forward pass</strong>.</p>

<p>With the architecture of the MLP in mind, let’s now implement the inference. Before we start, it is useful to make it clear how we index data of the neural network in the arrays of weights, biases, activations etc. We need to store activations and biases <em>per neuron</em>, and the weights <em>per connection</em> between neurons. It is easy to make a mistake in indexing when working with graphs (our neural network is a graph), so let’s define a few rules for our indexing scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will index layers starting from 0: input layer has index 0, and output layer has index <code><span>LAYER_COUNT</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span></code>. Because the input layer doesn’t do any computation, it might be possible to skip it and start indexing from the first hidden layer, but we want to keep things clear and simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections between neurons will “belong” to the layer they are leading to. This means that layer 0 (input layer) doesn’t have any connections, and layer index <code><span>LAYER_COUNT</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span></code> has connections from last hidden layer to the output layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neurons in each layer are indexed from 0 to <code><span>NUM_NEURONS_PER_LAYER</span></code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, let’s define some helper functions to access data in global arrays:</p>
<div>

<pre><code><span>uint</span><span> </span><span>getNeuronDataIndex</span><span>(</span><span>uint</span><span> </span><span>layer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>uint</span><span> </span><span>neuron</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Base offsets used in these functions are pre-calculated for each layer based on number of layers and number of neurons per layer in the network. Details can be found in the source code accompanying this article in the function createComputePasses.</p>
<p>With these in place, we can now implement a forward pass which:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Encodes input into <em>activations</em> array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterates through all the layers where computation happens (all except the input layer).</p>
<p>a.  Evaluates activation for each neuron in the layer.</p>

<p>Reads output from the activations array and returns it.</p>

<p>Note that our code has allocated an array called <strong>activations</strong> where we store activations of all neurons during the forward pass. But for inference we only need to store activations of 2 layers at any time: the one that we are evaluating and the previous layer. As an optimization, we can allocate two smaller arrays with the size <code><span>NUM_MAX_NEURONS_PER_LAYER</span></code> and ping-pong between them. However, during the training we will need to store activations for all neurons from the forward pass to perform a backpropagation pass.</p>

<p>In the previous code listing, we have used the macro called <code><span>ACTIVATION_FUNCTION</span></code> in the place where we want to evaluate the activation function. Let’s now define it – remember that this must be a non-linear function, but we can pick any function assuming that it is differentiable (it has a derivative). The derivative will be needed for training.</p>
<p>Some of the functions commonly used are ReLU (rectified linear unit), leaky ReLU and sigmoid:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\sigma_{ReLU}(x) = max(0,x)</span></p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\sigma_{LeakyReLU}(x) = \left( \begin{matrix} 0.01x, x &lt; 0 \\ x, x \geq 0 \\ \end{matrix} \right)</span></p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\sigma_{Sigmoid} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}</span></p>
<p>Even though ReLU and leaky ReLU are very simple, they work well and are widely used, e.g., by both NeRF and NRC papers. The 0.01 value (slope) in leaky ReLU implementation is a variable and you can experiment with different values. Usually, the whole network uses the same activation function, but it is not uncommon for output layer to have a different function than hidden layers.</p>
<p>Let’s now look at derivatives of these functions:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\sigma_{ReLU}^{'} = \left( \begin{matrix} 0,\ &amp; x &lt; 0\  \\ 1,\ &amp; x &gt; 0 \\ \end{matrix} \right)</span></p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\sigma_{LeakyReLU}^{'}\left( x \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} 0.01, x &lt; 0 \\ 1, x &gt; 0 \\ \end{matrix} \right)</span></p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\sigma_{Sigmoid}^{'}\left( x \right) = \sigma_{Sigmoid}\left( x \right)(1 - \ \sigma_{Sigmoid}\left( x \right))</span></p>
<p>Note: the derivative of ReLU and leaky ReLU is undefined at point zero, because the function is discontinuous there, but in practice we must use a value of 0 in that point.</p>
<p>For our sample application, we use leaky ReLU by default. Sigmoid function is also available, but the training takes a much longer time compared to ReLU and leaky ReLU.</p>

<p>In this article, we implement neural network training based on a common <strong>supervised learning</strong> method. Supervised learning means that we evaluate the neural network on inputs for which we know correct outputs that we’d like to get, and we adjust it to give us results closer to desired outputs. Each input is called a <strong>sample</strong> or an <strong>example</strong>, and all inputs available for training are called a <strong>training set</strong>.</p>
<p>For each sample from the training set, we start by comparing network’s prediction to the correct output using a <strong>cost function</strong>. This function tells us how good the prediction was (lower is better). Then, we will update weights and biases in a way that minimizes this cost function. This is done using an algorithm called <strong>gradient descent</strong>. The gist of it is that we first calculate how the cost function changes if we change individual weights and biases, and then we adjust them in a direction that lowers the cost. In the following text, we will often refer to “weights and biases”, but I’m only going to write “weights” to keep the text more readable. Keep in mind that what applies to weights also applies to biases here.</p>
<p>To know how to adjust the weights to lower the cost we need to calculate a value for each weight that tells us how the cost function changes when that specific weight changes. These are called <strong>partial derivatives</strong> of a cost function wrt. the weight. The vector of all partial derivatives of our weights is called a <strong>gradient</strong>.</p>
<p>Now we can imagine the cost function as a multi-dimensional surface. The gradient points in a direction where the cost function rises most steeply. We can think about stochastic descent as a ball rolling down the hill on this surface (position of the ball is given by the current network state and the cost function value). We want to get the ball as low as possible to minimize the cost. By calculating gradients (which point up the hill on this surface), and moving in opposite direction, we basically roll the ball downhill to some local minimum. Gradient is calculated using the algorithm called <strong>backpropagation</strong> which we’ll discuss in section 3.5. The process of adjusting the weights is also called an <strong>optimization</strong> of the network.</p>
<p>Once we have calculated the gradient, we can simply nudge the weights in an opposite direction by some small amount. This method of minimizing the cost function will eventually get us to a local minimum of the cost function. Note that this method doesn’t find a <em>global</em> minimum (unless it gets very lucky), but in practice this is not a huge issue for highly dimensional problems which typically have many local minima, with values similar to the global minimum.</p>
<p>We repeat this process many times to iteratively lower the cost. In each step, weights are not adjusted by the whole magnitude of the gradient, but we first multiply it by a small number (e.g., 0.0001) to take smaller steps. This multiplication constant is called a <strong>learning rate,</strong> and it tells us how fast the gradient descent should progress along the path to the local minimum. Without the learning rate, gradient descent would be taking very large steps, while being unstable and oscillating around the local minimum. Picking a right learning rate is critical in order to ensure that training will be stable, but also sufficiently fast. In practice, we will often have an <strong>adaptive learning rate.</strong> We will start with highest learning rate, and we lower it after each training step according to some schedule (e.g., linearly or exponentially). In practice, more advanced <strong>optimizers</strong> are used to adjust the weights, like the Adam optimizer that we’ll describe in section 5.</p>
<p>Learning rate is what we call a <strong>hyperparameter</strong> – it’s a parameter of a neural network implementation which is not learned by training, but rather set by a user. More advanced training algorithms have many hyperparameters. Important thing to realize is that we don’t always have to set hyperparameters manually, but we can have other optimizing algorithm (even one based on machine learning) finding the optimal values of hyperparameters for us.</p>
<p>Let’s now look at the overview of how the whole training algorithm with gradient descent works. The single <strong>training step</strong> does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Evaluate the network for each sample from a training set.</p>
<p>a.  Calculate a cost function for each sample, using the calculated and expected outputs.</p>
<p>b.  Calculate a gradient for each sample.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Average the gradients calculated in step 1b (so that we obtain one partial derivative value for each weight and bias in the network).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize the network: scale the averaged gradient by learning rate and subtract it from the current weights to obtain new weights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat from step 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Going through all the inputs in the training set is called an <strong>epoch</strong> and we’ll need many epochs before the network <strong>converges</strong> to a local minimum of a cost function. Going through all the inputs in every step can be cumbersome, as the algorithm goes through the whole data set every time. As an optimization, we can use a modified method called <strong>stochastic</strong> <strong>gradient descent (SGD)</strong>.</p>

<p>In practice, we don’t need to go through the whole training set before updating the weights. We can split the training set into a number of random subsets (<strong>batches</strong>) and update weights after processing every batch. This way, we will perform weight updates more often, achieving faster learning and consuming less memory. The downside is that our gradient is not so precise anymore and it doesn’t guide us to the local minimum along the shortest path. But if our subsets are good representatives of a whole training set, this doesn’t pose a big problem in practice. The process of using batches is also called <strong>mini-batching</strong>. SGD introduces at least two new hyperparameters – batch size and number of epochs to perform per training step.</p>
<p>Remember that our sample application wants to train the network to represent a 2D image, mapping UV coordinates to RGB texel values. We will use SGD for that, taking a batch of 2048 samples per each training step, and we’ll take one training step per frame. If we had to go through all the texels in every training step, the memory requirements and runtime performance would be unusable. For our example, we don’t even need to store the training set explicitly, we can simply generate desired number of random samples in run-time by randomly sampling the texture.</p>

<p>The training as described above can in theory run indefinitely – improving the predictions and getting the cost function lower and lower. It is unlikely that it will ever reach zero, due to constraints of the neural network architecture and learning algorithm. In practice, we have to decide at some point that training has reached the best state possible and stop. At first it seems that we can set a threshold for the cost function that we want to reach and stop after achieving it, but there is a problem: If we only measure the cost on training data, we won’t know how it will perform on real world data it has not seen before. This is the problem of <strong>generalization</strong>. We want the network to perform well also on general data that it has not seen during the training. As the training progresses, the neural network will start <strong>remembering</strong> the training data, instead of learning some general relationships between inputs and outputs, and it will fail to generalize well to new data. We also say that our model is <strong>overfitting</strong> in this case.</p>
<p>To solve this, we should also track a <strong>validation error</strong> measured on a data set which is separate from the training set. This error will be high at the beginning (just like the training error), and will get lower with training, but after some time it will start to rise again. This rise happens at the point when neural network stops generalizing well to data not seen by training, and it is the point when we should stop training. It is common to create a <strong>validation set</strong> from the training data that we have available by splitting it into 80% training set and 20% validation set. It is, however, necessary to make sure that training and validation sets don’t mix. This method of stopping the training when validation error start rising is called <strong>early stopping</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that some algorithms like NRC don’t ever stop training – they run in real time to make sure that neural network adapts to changes in the scene. Our sample application also runs the training continuously because for our use case, the generalization is not a problem, we simply want it to learn one input image as good as it can.</p>

<p>For our sample application, we will use a <strong>mean squared error (MSE)</strong> as a cost function:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left( target - output \right)^{2}</span></p>
<p>There are also other cost functions used in practice, like the <strong>L1 loss</strong> or <strong>L2 loss</strong>. We can use any function which gives lower score to better outcomes, but the function must have a derivative, which we’ll need for calculating the gradient.</p>
<p>Cost function is often also called a <strong>loss function</strong> and its value simply a <strong>loss</strong>. Cost functions can also have additional <strong>regularization</strong> terms which impose additional cost, e.g., for case when weights and biases get very large (this is called <strong>weight decay</strong>). This will force the weights to be as small as possible, which can help to prevent overfitting.</p>

<p>Let’s now discuss how we calculate the gradient using the <strong>backpropagation</strong> algorithm. As the name suggests, the algorithm starts at the output layer and continues <strong>backwards</strong> through the network. It is therefore also called the <strong>backward pass</strong> through the network.</p>
<p>The goal of this algorithm is to calculate partial derivative for each weight and bias wrt. cost function, which we designate as <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\partial cost}{\partial weight_{ij}}</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\partial cost}{\partial bias_{i}}</span>. Before we start let’s formally define some things we’ll need to calculate those partial derivatives:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">Z_{i} = \sum_{}^{}{w_{ij}O_{j} + b_{i}}</span></p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">O_{i} = \sigma(Z_{i})</span></p>
<p>where <span data-katex-display="false">Z_{i}</span> is the output of the neuron <span data-katex-display="false">i</span> without applying activation function, <span data-katex-display="false">w_{ij}</span> is a weight of the connection to the neuron <span data-katex-display="false">j</span>, <span data-katex-display="false">O_{j}</span> is the activation of connected neuron <span data-katex-display="false">j</span> , <span data-katex-display="false">b_{i}</span> is the bias value, <span data-katex-display="false">O_{i}</span> is the output with activation function applied, and <span data-katex-display="false">\sigma</span> is the activation function.</p>
<p>So how can we calculate these partial derivatives knowing the cost function value? The trick is to split calculations of <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\partial cost}{\partial weight_{ij}}</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\partial cost}{\partial bias_{i}}</span> into several derivatives which are easier to calculate and combine them using a chain rule. Let’s start with the simplest, which is <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\partial cost}{\partial bias_{i}}</span>. This is the same as <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\partial cost}{\partial Z_{i}}</span>, and is also called an <strong>error</strong> of the neuron:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\frac{\partial cost}{\partial bias_{i}} = \frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{i}} = \frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{#A5A5A5} \partial O_{i}} \bullet \frac{\color{#A5A5A5} \partial O_{i}}{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{i}}</span></p>
<p>We have now split <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\partial cost}{\partial bias_{i}}</span> into two simpler derivatives <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{#A5A5A5} \partial O_{i}}</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\color{#A5A5A5} \partial O_{i}}{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{i}}</span>. For the neuron in the output layer, <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{#A5A5A5} \partial O_{i}}</span> is just telling us how the cost changes when its activation changes. This is equal to the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to evaluated neuron. When we use the MSE cost function, this derivative is:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{#A5A5A5} \partial O_{i}} = c(target_{i} - O_{i})</span></p>
<p>where <span data-katex-display="false">c</span> is the constant coming from the derivation of MSE (in our sample where target is a 3-component vector, the <span data-katex-display="false">c</span> is equal to <span data-katex-display="false">2*\frac{1}{3} = 0.6\overline{66}</span>). In code, we can ignore this constant as it would only scale the whole gradient by the same number, and the gradient scale is already controlled by learning rate.</p>
<p>Next is the <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\color{#A5A5A5} \partial O_{i}}{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{i}}</span> value. This tells us how the output of the neuron changes when we apply the activation function. This is simply a derivative of the activation function which we described in section 2.4.</p>
<p>We have now calculated the partial derivative of the bias term of the neuron in the output layer, and we can use it to adjust this neuron’s bias. Next, let’s look at the derivatives of weights connecting to this neuron, splitting it again like:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{YellowGreen} \partial weight_{ij}} = \frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{i}} \bullet \frac{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{i}}{\color{YellowGreen} \partial weight_{ij}}</span></p>
<p>The term <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{i}}</span> is the same error that we calculated before, and the new term <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{i}}{\color{YellowGreen} \partial weight_{ij}}</span> tells us how the neuron value without activation function changes when we change that weight. This is a partial derivative of <span data-katex-display="false">(w_{ij}O_{j} + b_{i})</span> wrt. <span data-katex-display="false">w_{ij}</span>, which just boils down to the activation of the connected neuron:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\frac{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{i}}{\color{YellowGreen} \partial weight_{ij}} = \ O_{j}</span></p>
<p>While these derivatives look intimidating at first, they boil down to a very simple calculation:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\frac{\partial cost}{\partial bias_{i}} = \left( target_{i} - O_{i} \right) \bullet \sigma^{'}(O_{i})</span></p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\frac{\partial cost}{\partial weight_{ij}} = \frac{\partial cost}{\partial bias_{i}} \bullet O_{j}</span></p>
<p>With this knowledge, we can now implement gradient calculation for the output layer:</p>

<p>What remains is to calculate the same partial derivatives for the hidden layer, which is just slightly more complicated. Because the neurons in the hidden layer are connected to other neurons, their <span data-katex-display="false">\frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{#A5A5A5} \partial O_{i}}</span> values are not dependent on the cost function directly, but on the connected neurons.

<p><span data-katex-display="true">\frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{#A5A5A5} \partial O_{i}} = \sum_{j}^{}\frac{\color{DodgerBlue} \partial cost}{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{j}} \bullet \frac{\color{LightSalmon} \partial Z_{j}}{\color{#A5A5A5} \partial O_{i}}</span></p>

<p>Notice that in order to implement this, we had to store errors of the previously evaluated neurons. We can say that the error is propagating backwards through the neural network, giving this algorithm its name – backpropagation. We also need to store activations for all neurons, which was not necessary for the forward pass.</p>

<p>The code sample implements training as described above running on the GPU using Dx12 compute shaders. The whole training runs in 2 main kernel dispatches: <strong>gradient calculation</strong> and <strong>optimization</strong>. For gradient calculation, we run as many threads in parallel as we have training examples in the batch. Each thread generates a&nbsp;training example by randomly sampling a&nbsp;reference texture. Then it runs the forward pass to evaluate activations for the whole network, followed by the backpropagation pass to calculate the gradient. You may have noticed in the previous listings that we use InterlockedAdd operation to store the gradient. This is because we are interested in average gradient for all training examples in the batch, so we can add them all up and then divide the sum by the batch size before using it. The code for a gradient calculation step is:</p>

<p>There is one important aspect of training we haven’t covered yet and that’s the initial state of the network before we start the training. Initial weights and biases influence where our training starts and how fast can it approach the optimal solution, so a&nbsp;good initialization strategy is desirable. If we used some constant for all initial weights (e.g., zero or one), all activations and their gradients would be the same – the network wouldn’t be learning anything as every neuron would follow the same learning path (assuming we have a deterministic learning algorithm).</p>
<p>Because of this, we want to start with different initial weight and bias setting for each neuron to “break the symmetry”. Therefore, we initialize the network with some small random numbers centered around zero. We can take these numbers, e.g., from the uniform or normal distribution. To do that we must pick a range in which to generate random numbers, and in case of normal distribution also the standard deviation. These can either be hyperparameters tuned manually, or better, we can use one of the common strategies for setting them automatically. Such strategies are, e.g., <strong>LeCun uniform</strong>, <strong>Xavier uniform</strong> and their variations using normal distribution. These have been introduced in paper <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks</a>.</p>
<p>In our code sample we use the Xavier uniform initialization. It generates weights using a uniform random distribution within the range <span data-katex-display="false">\lbrack -x,x\rbrack</span>, where <span data-katex-display="false">x</span> is dependent on number of neurons in layers that the weight is connecting:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">x = \sqrt{\frac{6}{n_{previousLayer} + n_{currentLayer}}}</span></p>
<p>Random initial values for weights are enough to break the symmetry and ensure proper learning, and therefore it is common to initialize biases to zeroes, or some small constant.</p>

<p>So far, we have only used the identity input encoding. Meaning, we have simply passed our UV coordinates into two input neurons. In this section we are going to explore a more advanced input encoding, the <strong>frequency encoding</strong>, which greatly improves performance for our sample application.</p>

<p>This encoding was described in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08934" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeRF paper</a> under the name “positional encoding”, but I see it’s often referred to as the “frequency encoding”. Idea is to transform the input into higher-dimensional space using the following formula:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="true">\gamma\left( p \right) = \left( \sin\left( 2^{0}\pi p \right),\cos\left( 2^{0}\pi p \right), \ldots \sin\left( 2^{L - 1}\pi p \right),\cos\left( 2^{L - 1}\pi p \right) \right)</span></p>
<p>where <span data-katex-display="false">p</span> is the input value we want to encode, <span data-katex-display="false">L</span> is the number of frequencies we want to use (e.g., 8) and <span data-katex-display="false">\gamma</span> is a vector of encoded values. Note that with this encoding, we have greatly increased number of input neurons. For our sample application with 2 input values, and 8 frequencies, we get 32 input neurons.</p>
<p>Having inputs in higher-dimensional space will make it easier for neural network to discover more complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Implementation of this encoding can be found in the sample code in function called frequencyEncoding.</p>

<p>In the deep learning literature, you will often encounter a <strong>one-hot encoding</strong>. This is a very simple encoding where input is encoded into a vector of values, where only a single entry is 1, and others are 0 (we say that one value is hot). E.g., we can encode a fact that object belongs to certain category by having a vector of values representing each category, and setting value 1 for the selected category, while zeroing out others.</p>
<p>For more advanced encodings, I recommend looking at the <strong>one-blob encoding</strong>, introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Importance Sampling</a> paper, which extends one-hot encoding to have multiple entries activated, instead of just one. This essentially activates or shuts down parts of the network, depending on the input value.</p>
<p>Another useful encoding is a <strong>hash-grid encoding</strong> introduced in <a href="https://tom94.net/data/publications/mueller22instant/mueller22instant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding</a> paper.</p>

<p>So far, we have applied gradients during the training using a very simple way – we just multiplied it by the learning rate and subtracted it from current weights and biases. While this works, it is not optimal for several reasons: fixed learning rate is usually suboptimal at the beginning, when we want to take larger steps to proceed faster, but it is also suboptimal at the end, when it can oscillate around the optimal solution because the fixed step is too large to get into the valley of local minimum. In practice, we want to use an adaptive learning rate instead.</p>
<p>In this section we implement an improved optimizer called <em>Adam</em> (adaptive moment estimation), described in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a>. Adam adds two ingredients to the optimization process: adaptive learning rate and momentum.</p>
<p>We have described adaptive learning rate before, so let’s now look at the momentum. Remember our “ball rolling” example where we stated that minimizing the cost function is like rolling the ball on its surface to find a lowest point. Just like in real world, where the ball has certain momentum, we can add momentum to our algorithm by taking into consideration the gradients in previous steps and applying a weighted average of them, instead of just latest gradients. This way, we progress to the optimum faster and we have a higher chance of escaping shallow valleys with local minima to find even lower local minimum.</p>

<p>Adam optimizer works by tracking the first and second moments (mean and variance) of the gradient. This means that for each weight and bias, we have to track mean and variance of their partial derivatives. They are averaged over time and their decay is controlled by new hyperparameters <span data-katex-display="false">\beta_{1}</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">\beta_{2}</span>. The adjustment done to weight or bias is calculated using its gradient, mean, and variance in the following way:</p>
<div>

<pre><code><span>// Update mean and variance for this training step</span>

<p>The updated mean and variance are stored next to weights and biases. Note that we still have to set a base learning rate when using this algorithm, the paper suggests a value of 0.001. In practice, the default values suggested in the paper for <span data-katex-display="false">\beta_{1} = 0.9</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">\beta_{2} = 0.999</span> are used as well. The default value for <span data-katex-display="false">\varepsilon</span> which prevents division by zero is <span data-katex-display="false">10^{- 8}</span>. Values <span data-katex-display="false">\beta_{1}^{T}</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">\beta_{2}^{T}</span> are derived from <span data-katex-display="false">\beta_{1}</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">\beta_{2}</span> and adjusted after each training step as follows:</p>

<p>While the method for training described so far is fairly robust and efficient, there are several problems which we can encounter in practice, let’s briefly discuss some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Insufficient training data:</strong> when we have low amount of training data, or when the batch size of stochastic gradient descent is too low, we won’t be able to find a stable solution that generalizes well. Make sure to have sufficient data to get into local minimum of the cost function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-deterministic data:</strong> So far, we assumed that there is a deterministic relationship between the training inputs and target outputs. Breaking this assumption by having some random values can make it hard or impossible for training to converge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wrong learning rate:</strong> Having a learning rate too small will cause the training to proceed very slowly, while having it too large can make the training unstable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vanishing gradients:</strong> For deep networks, gradients in certain layers can become very small, slowing down or even stopping the training. This happens because for typical activation functions, large changes on some inputs can only cause small changes (or no changes) of the output. E.g., the negative part of the leaky ReLU outputs very small values. In this case, partial derivatives become smaller and smaller, and training doesn’t change the weights much. One of the possible solutions is to use different activation functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploding gradients:</strong> The opposite problem happens when gradients get very large and cause instability. As a solution, we can clamp gradients to some threshold value, limiting the rate at which they can change weights and biases – this is called the <strong>gradient clipping</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot more to deep learning than what I described so far in this article. Before we wrap up, I want to mention at least two topics worth studying next, that you will encounter often when reading deep learning papers focused on computer graphics: auto-encoders and convolutional networks.</p>
<p>Auto-encoder is a type of neural network consisting of encoder and a decoder. Encoder translates input data into more compact representation (in latent space) and decoder is used to decompress it to original representation. It can be used for applications like data compression, denoising and image reconstruction.</p>
<p>Convolutional networks (CNNs) are specialized networks used mostly in image processing. They contain 2 types of hidden layers: convolutional layers intended to detect certain features in images, and pooling layers which downsample intermediate results into more compact representation.</p>
<p>While I was first learning about deep learning, I found great insight in the paper titled “<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10715/reading/Kornick_et_al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multilayer Feedforward Networks are Universal Approximators</a>” from 1989. It says that MLPs with at least one hidden layer are <strong>universal approximators</strong>, meaning they can approximate any function to a degree allowed by the network capacity. It also says that failure to approximate given function can be attributed to inadequate learning, insufficient network capacity, or non-deterministic relation between network inputs and outputs. In practice, we can therefore use MLPs to replace parts of our algorithms which contain difficult functions mapping data from one space to another.</p>

<p>In this article, I have described a few concepts and algorithms used in deep learning that I found most interesting for my use case (representing an image using an MLP), but there is much more to explore. With the knowledge provided here, I hope that you’ll have more fun reading deep learning papers and resources and implement your own deep learning ideas.</p>
<p>I recommend looking at the book <em><a href="https://www.glassner.com/portfolio/deep-learning-a-visual-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Learning: A Visual Approach</a></em> by Glassner, the book <em>Deep Learning</em> by Goodfellow et al. which is <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freely available online</a>, deep learning videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3Blue1Brown</a>, neural network <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2017/03/09/how-to-train-neural-networks-with-backpropagation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogs by demofox</a>, paper titled “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277411157_Deep_Learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep learning</a>” by LeCun et al. from 2015, and graphics papers such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08934" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeRF</a> and <a href="https://d1qx31qr3h6wln.cloudfront.net/publications/mueller21realtime.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NRC</a>. When implementing neural networks, I recommend reading an article <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/wmma_on_rdna3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to accelerate AI applications on RDNA 3 using WMMA</a> for insights how to use AI accelerating instructions of current GPUs. Finally, I recommend experimenting with libraries like <a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pyTorch</a> which enable much faster prototyping, than implementing everything from scratch.</p>
<p>I want to thank Daniel Meister for helpful comments and suggestions.</p>

DuckDuckGo is currently turning up seven links when searching Reddit, but provides no data on where the links go or why, instead only saying that “We would like to show you a description here but the site won't allow us.” Older results will still show up, but these search engines are no longer able to “crawl” Reddit, meaning that Google is the only search engine that will turn up results from Reddit going forward. Searching for Reddit still works on <a href="https://www.404media.co/friendship-ended-with-google-now-kagi-is-my-best-friend/" rel="noreferrer">Kagi</a>, an independent, paid search engine that buys part of its search index from Google.</p><p>The news shows how Google’s near monopoly on search is now actively hindering other companies’ ability to compete at a time when Google is facing increasing criticism over the quality of its search results. And while neither Reddit or Google responded to a request for comment, it appears that the exclusion of other search engines is the result of a multi-million dollar deal that gives Google the right to scrape Reddit for data to train its AI products.</p><p>“They’re [Reddit] killing everything for search but Google,” Colin Hayhurst, CEO of the search engine Mojeek told me on a call.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third-heaviest element in the universe has been made in a way that offers a route for synthesising the elusive element 120, which would be the heaviest element in the periodic table.</p>
<p>“We were very shocked, very surprised, very relieved that we didn’t make any bad choices in setting up the instrumentation,” says <a href="https://heavyelementgroup.lbl.gov/our-group/jacklyn-gates">Jacklyn Gates</a> at&nbsp;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in California.</p>
    
<p>She and her colleagues created the element livermorium by smashing a beam of charged titanium atoms into a piece of plutonium. Titanium has never been used in such an experiment because it is tricky to turn it into a well-controlled beam and it takes millions of trillions of collisions to produce very few new atoms. Yet, physicists think a titanium beam will be crucial for creating the hypothetical element 120, also known as unbinilium, which would have 120 protons in its nucleus.</p>
<span></span><p>The researchers started with rare isotopes of titanium, which they <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2432353-some-metals-actually-grow-more-resilient-when-hot/">vaporised in a special oven</a> at 1650°C (around 3000°F). Next, they used microwaves to turn the hot titanium vapour into a charged beam, which could then be fed into a particle accelerator. When the beam reached roughly 10 per cent of the speed of light and collided with the plutonium target, the resulting debris hit <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2327468-worlds-most-sensitive-dark-matter-detector-tested-for-the-first-time/">a detector</a> that revealed signatures of exactly two atoms of livermorium.</p>
<p>Each atom rapidly decayed into other elements, as was expected – the stability of atomic nuclei decreases as the mass of an atom increases. But the measurement was so precise that there is only about a one in a trillion chance that the finding was a statistical fluke, says Gates. The researchers presented their findings on 23 July at the <a href="https://indico.phy.anl.gov/event/45/overview">Nuclear Structure 2024</a> conference at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois.</p>
<p><a href="https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~thoennes/">Michael Thoennessen</a> at Michigan State University says this experiment strengthens the case for the feasibility of creating element 120. “You have to do the groundwork and feel your way up to it. In this sense, this is a really important and necessary experiment,” he says.</p>
<p>Thoennessen says that creating unbinilium would have deep implications for our understanding of the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2395023-force-that-holds-atoms-together-measured-more-precisely-than-ever/">strong force</a>, which determines when heavy elements are stable or not. Studying unbinilium could also help us understand how exotic elements may have formed in the early universe.</p>
<p>The heaviest human-made element so far – element 118, also known as <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127951-up-and-atom-the-fights-to-put-people-into-the-periodic-table/">oganesson</a> – has two more protons than livermorium and was first synthesised in 2002. In the intervening years, researchers have <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24132190-500-inside-the-russian-factory-making-the-heaviest-atoms-in-the-universe/">struggled to make atoms any heavier</a> because that requires smashing together already very heavy elements, which tend to be unstable themselves. “This is really, really difficult business,” says Thoennessen.</p>
    
<p>But the new experiment makes the LBNL researchers optimistic. They plan to start the experiment aimed at creating element 120 in 2025, once they have replaced the plutonium target with the heavier element californium.</p>
<p>“I think we’re a lot closer to knowing what we have to do,” says Gates. “And having the chance to put a new element on the periodic table [is exciting]. So few people have that opportunity.”</p>

    <p>Note: This article assumes some introductory Haskell knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Just as algebra is fundamental to the whole of mathematics, algebraic data types (ADTs) are fundamental to many common functional programming languages. They’re the primitives upon which all of our richer data structures are built, including everything from sets, maps, and queues, to <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/advanced-library-design-building-a-bloom-filter.html">bloom filters</a> and <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hnn">neural networks</a>.</p>

<p>Algebraic data types and mathematical algebra have some similar looking operations. In fact, it’s common in type theory to use the algebraic notation to define algebraic data types, rather than the Haskell-style data type declarations:</p>

<p>In this essay, we’ll explore this coincidence and what that means for us as programmers. We’ll follow the path all the way to calculus.</p>

<h2 id="counting-inhabitants">Counting inhabitants</h2>

<p>As a first foray into the equivalence of algebraic data types and the algebra most of us are more familiar with, we’ll start with simple arithmetic. Specifically, we’ll start by counting the number of <em>inhabitants</em> (values) of a given type. Looking back at the examples:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>There are <strong>0</strong> ways to construct <code>Void</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Unit</code>, the type constructor, has <strong>1</strong> inhabitant (<code>Unit</code>, the data constructor).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Bool</code> has <strong>2</strong>. We can count the data constructors by hand, but we can also just simplify the algebraic expression to 2.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either a b</code> has as many as <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, combined. Again, the number of inhabitants looks exactly the same as the algebraic form, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a + b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(a, b)</code> has an inhabitant for each combination of <code>a</code>s and <code>b</code>s, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a \times b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>a -&gt; b</code> has <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>b</mi><mi>a</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b ^ a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Why? Think about <code>data Tri = Zelda | Link | Ganon</code>. Why are there eight inhabitants of <code>Tri -&gt; Bool</code>, but nine of <code>Bool -&gt; Tri</code>? It helps to write out each possible function. <sup id="fnref:answer"><a href="#fn:answer">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:bottom"><a href="#fn:bottom">2</a></sup></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="algebraic-manipulations">Algebraic manipulations</h2>

<p>Counting inhabitants is interesting and useful, but the connection runs much deeper! We can use it to gain insight into the nature of our datatypes. Let’s look at an example.</p>

<p>Consider <code>data Choice a = LeftChoice a | RightChoice a</code>, i.e. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a + a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. We can manipulate this using the familiar rules of algebra to the equivalent <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>×</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2 \times a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, or <code>type Choice' a = (Bool, a)</code>.</p>

<p>The manipulation was done using a rule we learned in grade school, before we’d ever heard of algebraic data types. What’s more, the rules of algebra were established centuries before algebraic data types were even invented. Yet the result makes sense. Our <code>Choice</code> data type tags each <code>a</code> as either a “left <code>a</code>” or a “right <code>a</code>.” Clearly it’s equivalent to <code>Choice</code>’s use of a boolean tag. Isn’t it remarkable that algebraic manipulations agree with our intuition?</p>

<p>Exercise for the reader: Explain why <code>Bool -&gt; a</code> is <em>not</em> equivalent to <code>Either a a</code>, but <em>is</em> equivalent to <code>(a, a)</code> both algebraically and intuitively.</p>

<p>Discovering I could do this felt very much like learning algebra for the first time – elegant, powerful, exciting. It raises the questions of what else one can do? How might we use this new tool? What new powers does it give us? Where does it fail?</p>

<h3 id="taylor-series">Taylor series</h3>

<p>We’re going to play fast and loose with notation for a moment. Bear with me.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the familiar <code>List</code> data type.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nil</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- or, with Haskell's special syntax</span>
<span>data</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span> <span>|</span> <span>a</span> <span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We can repeatedly expand the definition by expressing it with algebraic notation.</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi><mi>L</mi><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi><mi>L</mi><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi><mi>L</mi><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mo>…</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{align}
L &amp; = 1 + a L \\
  &amp; = 1 + a \left(1 + a L\right) \\
  &amp; = 1 + a + a^2 \left(1 + a L\right) \\
  &amp; = 1 + a + a^2 + a^3 \left(1 + a L\right) \\
  &amp; = 1 + a + a^2 + a^3 + \ldots
\end{align}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Remarkably, this makes sense. The last line tells us that a list is either <code>[]</code>, <code>[a]</code>, <code>[a, a]</code>, or <code>[a, a, a]</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>Neat trick, but let’s push our luck.

L &amp; = 1 / \left(1 - a\right) \\
L &amp; = 1 + a + a^2 + a^3 + \ldots
\end{align}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Let’s pause for a moment to remember that we’re dealing with <em>types</em>. And the expression <code>1 / (1 - a)</code> contains both a <em>negative</em> and a <em>fractional</em> type, neither of which have a meaning yet. Let’s consider what they could possibly mean. Algebra tells us that <code>(1 - a) + a</code> = <code>1</code>. So, this data types combines either a <code>1 - a</code> or an <code>a</code>, to get just <code>1</code>. What? The fractional type is just as unintelligible – given a <code>1 / a</code> and an <code>a</code>, we have… <code>1</code>. In either case it seems we get out less than we put in! Some research has been done on deciphering some <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~sabry/papers/rational.pdf">meaning from this mess</a>, but I can’t use negative and fractional types without adopting the additional language semantics they propose. One final note – though we took some morally objectionable steps, using types we don’t have any justification for, we came out fine on the other end.</p>

<p>For fun, let’s try our luck with binary trees.</p>

<h2 id="poking-holes-in-things">Poking holes in things</h2>

<p>It’s almost time for calculus on data types, and I want to get there just as desperately as you, dear reader, but we’ll require some motivation first. And so, it’s time for a brief interlude to think about poking holes in things. Yes, holes.</p>

<p>What do I mean by a hole? We want to find the places in our data structure where data could go, and remove it.</p>

<p>How many holes of type <code>a</code> can we find in a tuple?</p>

<p>We can make a few observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data types with no <code>a</code>s (constants) have no holes of type <code>a</code>.</li>
  <li>The number of holes in a sum is the sum of the number of holes in each side.</li>
  <li>The number of holes in a product is the number of positions in the product times the number of ways to make a hole in each of those positions.</li>
</ul>

<p>And with that we’ve finally made it. Ready for the big reveal? The rules we just saw are mysteriously similar to the familiar rules of differentiation.

<p>Let’s take a moment to marvel at the fact that differentiation, a tool developed by Newton and Leibniz over 300 years ago for physics, has made an unexpected appearance in the most discrete of settings. The correspondence was <a href="http://strictlypositive.org/calculus/">noticed in 2001</a> by Conor McBride.</p>

<h2 id="the-zipper">The zipper</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf">zipper</a> is a way to “focus” on one element of a data structure, in order to edit it efficiently. The name is meant to evoke “going up and down in the structure … analogous to closing and opening a zipper in a piece of clothing.”</p>

<p>I’ll demonstrate with a list.</p>

<div><pre><code>: -&gt; : -&gt; : -&gt; : -&gt; []
|    |    |    |
1    2    3    4
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s focus on the <code>3</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code>[] &lt;- : &lt;- : &lt;- FOCUS -&gt; : -&gt; []
      |    |      |      |
      1    2      3      4
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can move left:</p>

<div><pre><code>[] &lt;- : &lt;- FOCUS -&gt; : -&gt; : -&gt; []
      |      |      |    |
      1      2      3    4
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or right:</p>

<div><pre><code>[] &lt;- : &lt;- : &lt;- : &lt;- FOCUS -&gt; []
      |    |    |      |
      1    2    3      4
</code></pre></div>
<p>With each operation taking constant time.</p>

<p>What did we just accomplish? Normally editing an arbitrary list element is O(n), but each zipper operation is O(1).</p>

<p>Relating this back to holes, we see that our zipper was constructed by poking a hole in the list.</p>

<p>Reminder what lists look like:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L = 1 + aL</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>What results from poking out the <code>a</code>s?</p>

\end{align}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>a</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{align}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial a} &amp; = \frac{L}{1 - a} \\
&amp; = L^2
\end{align}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Looking back at the diagrams above, we can see that <code>L^2</code> is exactly the type of our focused structure, with one list pointing left and one pointing right.</p>

<p>What just happened? Differentiating a data structure gave us the type of its context, which can be used as a zipper. In fact, differentiation can be used to build zippers for arbitrary ADTs – trees, maps, etc.</p>

<h2 id="disappointing-news">Disappointing news</h2>

<p>Can we extend the analogy to integration? Why does differentiation make a surprise appearance here? Unfortunately, I can’t answer either question.</p>

<p>I frankly have no clue how to interpret integration. As for why the rules for differentiation and hole-poking are the same, the best I can do is to point out that our goal is nearly the same in either case. In differentiation, the goal is to see how a function varies as one of its variables varies. In hole-poking, the goal is to see how a data structure changes as we examine one type variable. In either case, we need to see how our data changes as we vary the variable, in each place it occurs.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Algebraic data types are aptly named, for they bear a remarkably strong resemblance to the algebra we’re familiar with. This allows us to count the inhabitants of a type and manipulate data types between equivalent forms. Further, we can extend the analogy as far as calculus, where differentiation helps us build zippers for any data type.</p>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>I called our data type manipulations a “coincidence,” but the connection actually rests on solid mathematical ground. Our tricks can be justified by the fact that ADTs <a href="https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/zippers/derivative.html#sec-2">form a semiring</a>.</p>

<p>We explored ADTs thoroughly, but only had time to scratch the surface of zippers. The rabbit hole is very deep, but I can send you straight to the bottom. Rather than taking the data structure view, Oleg Kiselyov advocates for zippers as the delimited continuation of a traversal, and has gone so far as creating a zipper filesystem, <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/zipper.html">ZipperFS</a>, and zippers with several holes. This is just one example of the large body of work on zippers.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Evolutionary biologist Natalie Pilakouta thought it would be an easy theory to test: fish living in Iceland’s geothermal hot springs prefer warmer water than do members of the same species that live in cooler lakes nearby. Yet, when she came to the end of her two-year study, what she found was inconclusive — given the choice, both populations of fish preferred the same, cooler waters. Her postdoctoral supervisor urged her to set aside the findings and move on to other studies: “It’s a failed experiment,” she was told. “You must have done something wrong.”</p><p>The words stung because publications are a crucial piece of academic currency, particularly for an early-career researcher, and she knew she’d face an uphill struggle to find a home for her results. Moreover, she felt a sense of urgency to share the counter-intuitive findings, which undermine the assumption that aquatic life might evolve a preference for higher temperatures in response to global warming.</p><p>Pilakouta, who is based at the University of St Andrews, UK, was one of the lucky ones. After submitting her findings to seven journals over six years, her study was finally published<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup> in January 2023. But her experience illustrates <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01389-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01389-7" data-track-category="body text link">academia’s oft-bemoaned ‘file-drawer problem’</a>, in which findings with null or negative results — those that fail to find a relationship between variables or groups, or that go against the preconceived hypothesis — gather dust in favour of studies with positive or significant findings. A 2022 survey of scientists in France, for instance, found that 75% were willing to publish null results they had produced, but only 12.5% were able to do so<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. Over time, this bias in publications distorts the scientific record, and a focus on significant results can encourage researchers to selectively report their data or exaggerate the statistical importance of their findings. It also wastes time and money, because researchers might duplicate studies that had already been conducted but not published. Some evidence suggests that the problem is getting worse, with fewer negative results seeing the light of day<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup> over time.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Funders, publishers and researchers are not sitting idle. Many journals now encourage teams to submit plans and protocols for experiments before conducting them, so that the journals can review the proposals and commit to publishing the results, whatever the outcome. Hundreds of journals now offer such ‘registered reports’, and the number of journals adopting this approach has doubled since 2018.</p><p>A laser focus on positive results is not the only way to do science, says Brian Nosek, executive director of the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Virginia. Nosek and a constellation of researchers across the world have been pushing to rewrite how research is conducted, challenging the very definition of success. This includes a crackdown on the nefarious side of science — misconduct such as plagiarism — but also a call to curb some of the ‘softer’ transgressions such as selective reporting, with a view to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02876-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02876-z" data-track-category="body text link">publishing more negative findings</a>. These changes have started to materialize across the publishing industry, as preprint servers proliferate and publishers adopt new manuscript formats, launch journals dedicated to null results and call for special issues.</p><p>“We can surely do better,” Nosek says.</p><h2><b>Hidden results</b></h2><p>Researchers have noted the file-drawer problem for decades. But the bigger problems it was causing did not become clear until the early 2010s, when they set out to reproduce the findings of several foundational experiments in psychology and medical science, and found that they could not. Scientists began to study the extent of this ‘replication crisis’ and the problem of publication bias.</p><p>Their research laid bare just how often negative results were being buried. In an analysis of more than 300,000 scientific conference presentations, informal posters or talks that scientists often endeavour to turn into papers, fewer than 40% were published in peer-reviewed journals, and negative or null findings were far less likely to be published than positive results<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>.</p><p>The extent of publication bias varies by discipline and by country, but the problem seems to have worsened over time. An analysis of 4,600 papers from 1990 to 2007 found that publication bias had increased by 22% over that period<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>There could be real-world implications to such a skew in publications. Among 74 registered clinical trials evaluating antidepressants, for example, nearly one-third remained unpublished; these trials were much more likely to show negative than positive results<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>. Judging by the publications alone, 94% of the trials looked as if they returned positive results, whereas a drug-approval panel judged that 51% did.</p><p>This selective reporting creates an inflated perception of drug efficacies, one compounded by meta-analyses — surveys of the published literature — that contain mainly studies with positive results.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The bias is present despite the fact that investigators conducting clinical trials in the United States are mandated by law to report their results, regardless of outcome; there can be billions of dollars at stake and trial participants who have given their time and expect the results to be published. These results illustrate “how high a hill there is to climb”, Nosek says.</p><p>Adding to the likelihood of bias, studies with negative or null findings are often given stricter scrutiny than those with positive findings, especially if the positive findings “confirm something we think is true”, says Steven Goodman, founder of the Stanford Program on Research Rigor and Reproducibility at the Stanford School of Medicine in California.</p><p>Jessica Payne, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, says that there’s still a perception that scientists must have had some flaw in their research design if a study returns negative or null results.</p><p>Indeed, according to a survey of 480 economists<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>, studies with null results are perceived to be less publishable, of lower quality and less important than studies with large and significant results, even when features such as sample size are held constant — a phenomenon known as the null result penalty. If anything, Goodman says, a study with a large effect size should be scrutinized much more than one with a null finding.</p><h2><b>Cultural bias </b></h2><p>The replication crisis made one fact crystal clear: incentive structures in academia are not always in line with research integrity and reproducibility. That has a large role in why so few negative studies are published, says Anne Scheel, a metascientist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.</p><p>At the crux of both academic misconduct and publication bias is the same ‘publish or perish’ culture, perpetuated by academic institutions, research funders, scholarly journals and scientists themselves, that rewards researchers when they publish findings in prestigious venues, Scheel says.</p><p>But these academic gatekeepers have biases, say some critics, who argue that funders and top-tier journals often crave novelty and attention-grabbing findings. Journal editors worry that pages full of null results will attract fewer readers, says Simine Vazire, a psychologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia and editor of the journal <i>Psychological Science</i>.</p><p>This creates a tight feedback loop between researchers and journals. To attract journals with findings that seem new and noteworthy, some scientists might be tempted to change their hypothesis after seeing the results, or to release only a portion of the data, or to perform statistical tricks, Nosek says.</p><h2><b>Positive solutions</b></h2><p>To encourage more researchers to report null results, journals and funders are trying several schemes. One of the most significant changes to come out of the replication crisis is the expansion of preregistration (see ‘Registrations on the rise’), in which researchers must state their hypothesis and the outcomes they intend to measure in a public database at the outset of their study (this is already the norm in clinical trials).</p><figure>

</figure><p>The preregistration model nudges researchers to be faithful to the original intent of their study, but it doesn’t address biases that might affect whether they submit their findings to a journal, nor the biases of journal editors and reviewers in deciding what to publish, Nosek says.</p><p>Instead, he and his colleagues have been focusing on promoting and evaluating the registered report model — similar to a preregistered report, but with the initial plan published by a journal, along with a commitment to peer-review and publish the results.</p><p>Preliminary data look promising: when Scheel and her colleagues compared the results of 71 registered reports with a random sample of 152 standard psychology manuscripts, they found that 44% of the registered reports had positive results, compared with 96% of the standard publications<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup> (see ‘Intent to publish’).

</figure><p>When the format launched in 2012, only a handful of journals published registered reports; now more than 300 offer the format, including <i>PLoS ONE</i> and <i>Nature</i>, which is published by Springer Nature (<i>Nature</i>’s news team is editorially independent from its journal team). Since starting to offer the format in February 2023, <i>Nature</i> has yet to publish any registered reports, but its sibling journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/research-articles?type=registered-report" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/research-articles?type=registered-report" data-track-category="body text link"><i>Nature Human Behaviour</i> has</a>.</p><p>Although the format has gained in popularity, there are still some kinks to be ironed out, researchers say. Earlier this year, Christine Blume, a sleep researcher at the University of Basel in Switzerland, published her first registered report<sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup> on how light affects human circadian rhythms in <i>Nature Human Behaviour.</i> Although she liked receiving feedback on her study design before data collection — “it made me feel that I had the best study design to answer the question I set out to address,” she says — she found it frustrating that the feedback process can span months, even though researchers have a limited time in which to spend grant money.</p><p>These practical concerns are important to address, Nosek says. He admits that his own paper about the quality of registered reports<sup><a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">8</a></sup> was not itself a registered report, because the grant money was expiring and the team didn’t have time to go through a lengthy approval process and complete its analysis. “We cannot dismiss pragmatics, but what we can do is think about how we lower the barrier so that more of these circumstances can be dealt with,” he says.</p><p>Journals that offer registered reports are not spread equally across disciplines; most are in psychology and, more recently, neuroscience. Few physical-science journals offer the format — even though null results, such as the failure of the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva in Switzerland to find new subatomic particles since the Higgs boson, have been an important part of progress. Emily Sena, a translational-medicine researcher and metascientist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, says that few academics in preclinical fields have been keen to try the format, especially when there is already so much red tape before researchers can begin their experiments.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The format has been slow to catch on among researchers, says Vazire. “We’re not receiving many registered-report submissions.”</p><p>Sena and her colleagues have been spreading the word about registered reports and helping journal editors to feel equipped to review submissions, she says. Some funders are providing cash incentives: in 2022, the <a href="https://www.cos.io/blog/funding-consciousness-research" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.cos.io/blog/funding-consciousness-research" data-track-category="body text link">Center for Open Science</a> offered up to US$50,000 to consciousness researchers willing to publish a registered report for their work.</p><p>It will be important to track how these interventions affect marginalized groups in academia, Sena says. Academics of colour are more likely to be on a fixed contract, so they have less wiggle room to embrace formats that might be better for science overall but less helpful for individual scientists, she says.</p><p>The Center for Open Science is planning to run trials in which researchers are randomly assigned to use either the standard publication model or a registered report, to evaluate the rigour, acceptance rate and timelines of the resulting publications. Results are expected by 2027.</p><p>Not every effort to reduce publication bias has borne fruit. One that has seldom worked, Nosek says, is to set up journals with the express purpose of publishing null results. These efforts are well intentioned, he says, but often do not work because a journal can become identified with studies that weren’t able to be published elsewhere. “It can’t provide the reward that researchers need,” he says.</p><p>Payne was a co-editor at one of these journals, <i>Experimental Results</i>, published by Cambridge University Press. After only three years, the journal ceased publication in 2023 despite carrying the “imprimatur of Cambridge”, she says.</p><p>There’s an increasingly popular do-it-yourself route to publishing negative results: posting a manuscript on a preprint server. Publishing a preprint can offer an opportunity to showcase research without the pressure of journal submission. This option can be especially helpful for early-career researchers, Pilakouta says. Still, it takes time to write up a result, regardless of where it appears, and publishing on preprint servers is unlikely to offer researchers enough of an incentive to justify the time, Goodman says.</p><h2><b>Null nuance</b></h2><p>Advocates acknowledge that not every study that returns a null result is worthy of publishing. Goodman says he encourages researchers to publish null and negative findings that are “informative”, meaning they come from studies and analyses that are designed rigorously, question previous results and open up fresh areas for exploration.</p><p>For example, there is a long-held idea that the womb is sterile — that the uterus and fetus are free of microorganisms. But, beginning in 2010, a series of papers found microbial contamination in the placenta, calling the hypothesis into question and suggesting that some complications of pregnancy could be linked to bacteria. It wasn’t until 2019 that a study of placental samples from 537 women — by far the largest number in an analysis of this kind — rigorously showed the absence of any bacterial signal. That study set a benchmark for investigating the microbiome of tissues that carry few microorganisms and that can therefore give rise to false-positive results, and suggested that bacterial infection is not a common cause of problems in pregnancy<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Blume says it’s important to extract something insightful from the data, even if they are inconclusive. For example, in 2022 she found that although artificial light suppresses the hormone melatonin, that didn’t equate to a change in sleep quality<sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>. The message that melatonin isn’t necessarily a proxy for sleep quality might have helped that study to get published, she says.</p><p>As long as researchers continue to seek publication in prestigious outlets, publication bias won’t go away, Goodman predicts. Still, he is surprised at how much progress has been made in the past decade: top-tier journals pledging to accept rigorous studies, regardless of outcome, would have been “unheard of” even five or ten years ago, he says.</p><p>Pilakouta now leads a laboratory and can set an example for her undergraduate and graduate students. But she’s also seen first-hand how deeply engrained the thirst for positive findings is. “It concerns me how early it starts,” she says. Next time she gets a null result, she says, she’s hopeful that it won’t take seven years to publish it.</p>

<p><b>Micromouse</b> is an event where small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot" title="Robot">robotic</a> mice compete to solve a 16×16 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze" title="Maze">maze</a>. It began in the late 1970s.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Events are held worldwide, and are most popular in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">U.S.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> and becoming popular in subcontinent countries such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.
</p><p>The maze is made up of a 16×16 grid of cells, each 180&nbsp;mm square with walls 50&nbsp;mm high.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> The mice are completely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot" title="Autonomous robot">autonomous robots</a> that must find their way from a predetermined starting position to the central area of the maze unaided. The mouse needs to keep track of where it is, discover walls as it explores, map out the maze and detect when it has reached the goal. Having reached the goal, the mouse will typically perform additional searches of the maze until it has found an optimal route from the start to the finish. Once the optimal route has been found, the mouse will traverse that route in the shortest achievable time.
</p><p>Competitions<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> and conferences<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> are run regularly.

<p>A version of Micromouse called the Half-Size Micromouse was introduced at the 30th All Japan Micromouse Competition in 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Instead of a 16×16 maze, the Half-Size competition uses up to a 32×32 maze. Cell and wall dimensions have been reduced by half,<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> providing a new challenge.
</p><p>There have been half-size competitions in Europe in Hungary in 2015<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> and the UK in 2018.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>Mice used in competitions employ the fundamental elements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_navigation" title="Robot navigation">robot navigation</a>, including mapping, planning, and localization. Additionally, they optimize their path through the maze using various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm" title="Search algorithm">search algorithms</a>. Common search algorithms use variations of the Bellman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill" title="Flood fill">flood-fill</a> method,<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm" title="Dijkstra's algorithm">Dijkstra's algorithm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" title="A* search algorithm">A* search algorithm</a>, among various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal" title="Graph traversal">graph traversal</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal" title="Tree traversal">tree traversal</a> algorithms.
</p>

<p>Mice can run at over three meters per second, depending on the maze design. Some of the best micromouse builders are Yusuke Kato,<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Ng Beng Kiat<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> and Fumitaka Nakashima.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The current world record is 3.921 seconds<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> and is held by Ng Beng Kiat.
</p><p>Performance in recent years has improved considerably. As of 2015, winning mice are likely to run with forward acceleration and braking well over 1g.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Cornering with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration" title="Acceleration">centripetal acceleration</a> as high as 2g is possible. Micromice are among the highest-performing autonomous robots.
</p><p>Most recently, robots are being equipped with a fan to create a partial vacuum under the mouse while it is running.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> The additional downforce available has made possible a huge improvement in performance. Compared to a non-fan mouse, the newer robots are likely to be able to achieve centripetal accelerations of 6g or more. Straight line accelerations can easily exceed 2.5g.

<h2>"Doors" in Solaris<sup><small>TM</small></sup>: Lightweight RPC using File Descriptors</h2>	

<blockquote>
<b>Jim Voll<br>
Senior Staff Engineer<br>
Solaris Products Group</b>
</blockquote>

<em>This new lightweight RPC mechanism, adapted from Sun's Spring O/S
project, will be inforporated into a future release of the
Solaris<sup><small>TM</small></sup> operating environment.  Developers
can refer to Solaris documentation for additional library and SPI
information.</em>

<h3>An Overview of Doors</h3>

<p>
A door is a "file" descriptor used to describe a procedure in a process
and optionally some additional state associated with the procedure.
Doors were initially designed as Spring object descriptors
used to encapsulate the state and capabilities of C++ objects. A
process which obtains a door is free to pass it, along with its
capabilities, to other processes in the system.
</p><p>
A server normally creates a door for some service it plans on
providing, and exports it to clients. Clients who obtain the door may
then invoke the service associated with the door using the synchronous
RPC semantics of a door <em>call</em> operation.
</p><p>
Conceptually, during a door invocation the client thread that issues
the door procedure call migrates to the server process associated with the door, and starts executing the procedure while in the address space of the server. When the service procedure is finished, a door <em>return</em> operation is performed and the thread migrates back to the client's address space with the results, if any, from the procedure call.
</p><p>
A client may pass data, including other doors, as arguments during a
door invocation, and the server procedure may return data, including
other doors, as results from an invocation.
</p><p>
Normally each door invocation from a client results in an active thread executing in the server (a server may choose to limit the number of threads available for incoming door invocations). The server must therefore be a MT-safe application. The doors interface provides a convenient mechanism for enabling high performance multithreaded programs since the creation and dispatching of threads is handled by the interface based on load.

</p><h3>Doors as File Descriptors</h3>

Using file descriptors to encapsulate doors allows many existing
UNIX<sup><small>(R)</small></sup> paradigms to be easily adopted for
use with doors.  Inventing a new name space for doors was widely viewed
as poor design alternative (e.g SVR4 IPC) and would have resulted in a
duplication of functionality already provided in UNIX.
<p>
File descriptors also provide a secure mechanism to encapsulate a door since the state associated with the door (procedure, process) is kept in the kernel. A user cannot construct a fake file descriptor to use as a door.
</p><p>
Some of the other important capabilities of file descriptors and how
they related to doors include the naming facility available with
<em>fattach(3c)</em>.

</p><h3>Naming</h3>

The <em>namefs</em> facility in SVR4 allows a process to bind a
STREAMS-based file descriptor to an object in filesystem name space
using <em>fattach(3)</em>. A logical extension to this facility allows
a door to be named in a similar manner (see Figure 1).
<p>
The protection mode of the file associated with a named door does not
provide strict access protection since a client may obtain access to
the door through means other than open(). (Example: A client is free to
pass a door to another process with weaker credentials.) This is also
true of STREAMS which are named via <em>fattach()</em> (see Figure 1).
</p><p>

</p><h3>Doors Implementation</h3>

The doors interface is exported from a user level shared library. The
library also controls the default server threads that are created in
response to incoming door requests on the server.
<p>
A new synchronization object, called a <em>shuttle</em>, was engineered to encapsulate the state associated with a door invocation. A shuttle provides the necessary state for process control such as signals and procfs operations, while allowing a direct scheduler hand-off operation between two threads.
</p><p>
Rather than placing a client thread on a sleep queue, signaling the
server and asking the scheduler to pick another thread to run, a
shuttle marks the current thread as sleeping, marks the server thread as running, and passes control directly to the server thread.

</p><h3>Server Threads</h3>

Server threads are normally created on demand by the doors library.
These server threads are created using the Solaris threads library with bound threads (each server thread runs on its own lightweight
process).

The first server thread is created automatically when the server issues a door <em>create</em> call. The server thread will inherit the scheduling class, and signal disposition of the thread issuing the door create. Door server threads use the Solaris thread library's default stack size. Once created, a server thread will place itself in a pool of
available threads and wait for a door invocation. New server threads
are created on demand when the available pool is depleted.

<h3>Benchmark Results</h3>

A simple benchmark was used to compare doors in Solaris 2.5 to other existing UNIX IPC mechanisms. The benchmark measures the round trip time associated with transferring control from a client thread in one process, to a server thread in another, and then back again. In the case of pipes and SVR4 messages, a single byte of data is passed.

</p><h3>Door Uses</h3>

A name service cache will be implemented in future Solaris versions, similar in nature to the DCE CDS clerk. A daemon process runs on the client machine and caches information from the configured name service such as files, NIS, or NIS+. The name service request interfaces, such as <em>getpwnam()</em>, communicate with the local name service cache daemon using a door named <em>fattach()</em>. Although most of the performance advantage of the name service cache is due to avoiding the setup and tear down cost associated with communicating with the name server (the connection to the name server is kept open by the daemon), doors do provide the fastest RPC mechanism for moving the results from daemon to the requestor. The automatic multithreaded dispatching provided by the doors interface makes a high performance implementation straightforward.

<h3>Future Work at SunSoft</h3>

To date, most of the performance work on Solaris doors concerns
transferring control from one address space to another. Future work
will optimize the transfer of data through such techniques as
copy-on-write transfers. Plans are also underway to use doors as a
general upcall mechanism in the kernel, enabling efficient
implementations of work such as scheduler activations and user level
file systems based on the <em>vnode</em> interface.
<p>
Initially developed as Spring object descriptors, doors are being used
as a part of a future high performance CORBA compliant ORB
implementation. As part of this work, a remote proxy service is being
investigated to allow the doors programming model to extend over the network. Doors can also be used as a local transport mechanism for ONC-RPC.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-content-update-preliminary-post-incident-report/">https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-content-update-preliminary-post-incident-report/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41053645">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is CrowdStrike’s preliminary Post Incident Review (PIR). We will be detailing our full investigation in the forthcoming Root Cause Analysis that will be released publicly. Throughout this PIR, we have used generalized terminology to describe the Falcon platform for improved readability. Terminology in other documentation may be more specific and technical.</p>
<h2>What Happened?</h2>
<p>On Friday, July 19, 2024 at 04:09 UTC, as part of regular operations, CrowdStrike released a content configuration update for the Windows sensor to gather telemetry on possible novel threat techniques.</p>
<p>These updates are a regular part of the dynamic protection mechanisms of the Falcon platform. The problematic Rapid Response Content configuration update resulted in a Windows system crash.</p>
<p>Systems in scope include Windows hosts running sensor version 7.11 and above that were online between Friday, July 19, 2024 04:09 UTC and Friday, July 19, 2024 05:27 UTC and received the update. Mac and Linux hosts were not impacted.</p>
<p>The defect in the content update was reverted on Friday, July 19, 2024 at 05:27 UTC. Systems coming online after this time, or that did not connect during the window, were not impacted.</p>
<h2>What Went Wrong and Why?</h2>
<p>CrowdStrike delivers security content configuration updates to our sensors in two ways: <em>Sensor Content </em>that is shipped with our sensor directly, and <em>Rapid Response Content</em> that is designed to respond to the changing threat landscape at operational speed.</p>
<p>The issue on Friday involved a Rapid Response Content update with an undetected error.</p>
<h3>Sensor Content</h3>
<p>Sensor Content provides a wide range of capabilities to assist in adversary response. It is always part of a sensor release and not dynamically updated from the cloud. Sensor Content includes on-sensor AI and machine learning models, and comprises code written expressly to deliver longer-term, reusable capabilities for CrowdStrike’s threat detection engineers.</p>
<p>These capabilities include Template Types, which have pre-defined fields for threat detection engineers to leverage in Rapid Response Content. Template Types are expressed in code. All Sensor Content, including Template Types, go through an extensive QA process, which includes automated testing, manual testing, validation and rollout steps.</p>
<p>The sensor release process begins with automated testing, both prior to and after merging into our code base. This includes unit testing, integration testing, performance testing and stress testing. This culminates in a staged sensor rollout process that starts with dogfooding internally at CrowdStrike, followed by early adopters. It is then made generally available to customers. Customers then have the option of selecting which parts of their fleet should install the latest sensor release (‘N’), or one version older (‘N-1’) or two versions older (‘N-2’) through Sensor Update Policies.</p>
<p>The event of Friday, July 19, 2024 was not triggered by Sensor Content, which is only delivered with the release of an updated Falcon sensor. Customers have complete control over the deployment of the sensor — which includes Sensor Content and Template Types.</p>
<h3>Rapid Response Content</h3>
<p>Rapid Response Content is used to perform a variety of behavioral pattern-matching operations on the sensor using a highly optimized engine. Rapid Response Content is a representation of fields and values, with associated filtering. This Rapid Response Content is stored in a proprietary binary file that contains configuration data. It is not code or a kernel driver.</p>
<p>Rapid Response Content is delivered as “Template Instances,” which are instantiations of a given Template Type. Each Template Instance maps to specific behaviors for the sensor to observe, detect or prevent. Template Instances have a set of fields that can be configured to match the desired behavior.</p>
<p>In other words, Template Types represent a sensor capability that enables new telemetry and detection, and their runtime behavior is configured dynamically by the Template Instance (i.e., Rapid Response Content).</p>
<p>Rapid Response Content provides visibility and detections on the sensor without requiring sensor code changes. This capability is used by threat detection engineers to gather telemetry, identify indicators of adversary behavior and perform detections and preventions. Rapid Response Content is behavioral heuristics, separate and distinct from CrowdStrike’s on-sensor AI prevention and detection capabilities.</p>
<h3>Rapid Response Content Testing and Deployment</h3>
<p>Rapid Response Content is delivered as content configuration updates to the Falcon sensor. There are three primary systems: the Content Configuration System, the Content Interpreter and the Sensor Detection Engine.</p>
<p>The Content Configuration System is part of the Falcon platform in the cloud, while the Content Interpreter and Sensor Detection Engine are components of the Falcon sensor. The Content Configuration System is used to create Template Instances, which are validated and deployed to the sensor through a mechanism called Channel Files. The sensor stores and updates its content configuration data through Channel Files, which are written to disk on the host.</p>
<p>The Content Interpreter on the sensor reads the Channel File and interprets the Rapid Response Content, enabling the Sensor Detection Engine to observe, detect or prevent malicious activity, depending on the customer’s policy configuration. The Content Interpreter is designed to gracefully handle exceptions from potentially problematic content.</p>
<p>Newly released Template Types are stress tested across many aspects, such as resource utilization, system performance impact and event volume. For each Template Type, a specific Template Instance is used to stress test the Template Type by matching against any possible value of the associated data fields to identify adverse system interactions.</p>
<p>Template Instances are created and configured through the use of the Content Configuration System, which includes the Content Validator that performs validation checks on the content before it is published.</p>
<h3>Timeline of Events: Testing and Rollout of the InterProcessCommunication (IPC) Template Type</h3>
<p>Sensor Content Release: On February 28, 2024, sensor 7.11 was made generally available to customers, introducing a new IPC Template Type to detect novel attack techniques that abuse Named Pipes. This release followed all Sensor Content testing procedures outlined above in the Sensor Content section.</p>
<p>Template Type Stress Testing: On March 05, 2024, a stress test of the IPC Template Type was executed in our staging environment, which consists of a variety of operating systems and workloads. The IPC Template Type passed the stress test and was validated for use.</p>
<p>Template Instance Release via <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-update-for-windows-hosts-technical-details/">Channel File 291</a>: On March 05, 2024, following the successful stress test, an IPC Template Instance was released to production as part of a content configuration update. Subsequently, three additional IPC Template Instances were deployed between April 8, 2024 and April 24, 2024. These Template Instances performed as expected in production.</p>
<h3>What Happened on July 19, 2024?</h3>
<p>On July 19, 2024, two additional IPC Template Instances were deployed. Due to a bug in the Content Validator, one of the two Template Instances passed validation despite containing problematic content data.</p>
<p>Based on the testing performed before the initial deployment of the Template Type (on March 05, 2024), trust in the checks performed in the Content Validator, and previous successful IPC Template Instance deployments, these instances were deployed into production.</p>
<p>When received by the sensor and loaded into the Content Interpreter, problematic content in Channel File 291 resulted in an out-of-bounds memory read triggering an exception. This unexpected exception could not be gracefully handled, resulting in a Windows operating system crash (BSOD).</p>
<h2>How Do We Prevent This From Happening Again?</h2>
<h3><strong>Software Resiliency and Testing</strong></h3>
<p>Improve Rapid Response Content testing by using testing types such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local developer testing</li>
<li>Content update and rollback testing</li>
<li>Stress testing, fuzzing and fault injection</li>
<li>Stability testing</li>
<li>Content interface testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Add additional validation checks to the Content Validator for Rapid Response Content. A new check is in process to guard against this type of problematic content from being deployed in the future.</p>
<p>Enhance existing error handling in the Content Interpreter.</p>
<h3><strong>Rapid Response Content Deployment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement a staggered deployment strategy for Rapid Response Content in which updates are gradually deployed to larger portions of the sensor base, starting with a canary deployment.</li>
<li>Improve monitoring for both sensor and system performance, collecting feedback during Rapid Response Content deployment to guide a phased rollout.</li>
<li>Provide customers with greater control over the delivery of Rapid Response Content updates by allowing granular selection of when and where these updates are deployed.</li>
<li>Provide content update details via release notes, which customers can subscribe to.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In addition to this preliminary Post Incident Review, CrowdStrike is committed to publicly releasing the full Root Cause Analysis once the investigation is complete.&nbsp;</em></p>
