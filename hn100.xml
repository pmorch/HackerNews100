</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Two representations of the data are available. The default representation uses a
strict schema per parser and converts known numbers to int/float JSON values.
Certain known values of <code>None</code> are converted to JSON <code>null</code>, known boolean
values are converted, and, in some cases, additional semantic context fields are
added.</p>
<p dir="auto">To access the raw, pre-processed JSON, use the <code>-r</code> cli option or the <code>raw=True</code>
function parameter in <code>parse()</code> when using <code>jc</code> as a python library.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>jc</code> accepts piped input from <code>STDIN</code> and outputs a JSON representation of the
previous command's output to <code>STDOUT</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="COMMAND | jc [SLICE] [OPTIONS] PARSER

<span>echo</span> STRING <span>|</span> jc [SLICE] [OPTIONS] PARSER</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, the "magic" syntax can be used by prepending <code>jc</code> to the command
to be converted or in front of the absolute path for Proc files. Options can be
passed to <code>jc</code> immediately before the command or Proc file path is given.
(Note: command aliases and shell builtins are not supported)</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="jc [SLICE] [OPTIONS] COMMAND
jc [SLICE] [OPTIONS] /proc/<path-to-procfile>"><pre>jc [SLICE] [OPTIONS] COMMAND

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Slice</h3>
<p dir="auto">Line slicing is supported using the <code>START:STOP</code> syntax similar to Python
slicing. This allows you to skip lines at the beginning and/or end of the
<code>STDIN</code> input you would like <code>jc</code> to convert.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>START</code> and <code>STOP</code> can be positive or negative integers or blank and allow
you to specify how many lines to skip and how many lines to process.
Positive and blank slices are the most memory efficient. Any negative
integers in the slice will use more memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, to skip the first and last line of the following text, you
could express the slice in a couple ways:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cat table.txt
      ### We want to skip this header ###
          col1       col2
          foo        1
          bar        2
      ### We want to skip this footer ###
$ cat table.txt | jc 1:-1 --asciitable

<p dir="auto">In this example <code>1:-1</code> and <code>1:4</code> line slices provide the same output.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using positive integers the index location of <code>STOP</code> is non-inclusive.
Positive slices count from the first line of the input toward the end
starting at <code>0</code> as the first line. Negative slices count from the last line

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exit Codes</h3>
<p dir="auto">Any fatal errors within <code>jc</code> will generate an exit code of <code>100</code>, otherwise the
exit code will be <code>0</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using the "magic" syntax (e.g. <code>jc ifconfig eth0</code>),
<code>jc</code> will store the exit code of the program being parsed and add it to the <code>jc</code>
exit code. This way it is easier to determine if an error was from the parsed
program or <code>jc</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Consider the following examples using <code>ifconfig</code>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>ifconfig</code> exit code</th>
<th><code>jc</code> exit code</th>
<th>Combined exit code</th>
<th>Interpretation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>0</code></td>
<td><code>0</code></td>
<td><code>0</code></td>
<td>No errors</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1</code></td>
<td><code>0</code></td>
<td><code>1</code></td>
<td>Error in  <code>ifconfig</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0</code></td>
<td><code>100</code></td>
<td><code>100</code></td>
<td>Error in  <code>jc</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1</code></td>
<td><code>100</code></td>
<td><code>101</code></td>
<td>Error in  both <code>ifconfig</code> and <code>jc</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p dir="auto">When using the "magic" syntax you can also retrieve the exit code of the called
program by using the <code>--meta-out</code> or <code>-M</code> option. This will append a <code>_jc_meta</code>
object to the output that will include the magic command information, including
the exit code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is an example with <code>ping</code>:</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setting Custom Colors via Environment Variable</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can specify custom colors via the <code>JC_COLORS</code> environment variable. The
<code>JC_COLORS</code> environment variable takes four comma separated string values in
the following format:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="JC_COLORS=<keyname_color>,<keyword_color>,<number_color>,<string_color>"><pre>JC_COLORS=<span>&lt;</span>keyname_color<span>&gt;</span>,<span>&lt;</span>keyword_color<span>&gt;</span>,<span>&lt;</span>number_color<span>&gt;</span>,<span>&lt;</span>string_color<span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Where colors are: <code>black</code>, <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>yellow</code>, <code>blue</code>, <code>magenta</code>, <code>cyan</code>,
<code>gray</code>, <code>brightblack</code>, <code>brightred</code>, <code>brightgreen</code>, <code>brightyellow</code>, <code>brightblue</code>,
<code>brightmagenta</code>, <code>brightcyan</code>, <code>white</code>, or  <code>default</code></p>
<p dir="auto">For example, to set to the default colors:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="JC_COLORS=blue,brightblack,magenta,green"><pre>JC_COLORS=blue,brightblack,magenta,green</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">or</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="JC_COLORS=default,default,default,default"><pre>JC_COLORS=default,default,default,default</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Disable Colors via Environment Variable</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can set the <a href="http://no-color.org/" rel="nofollow"><code>NO_COLOR</code></a> environment variable to any
value to disable color output in <code>jc</code>. Note that using the <code>-C</code> option to force
color output will override both the <code>NO_COLOR</code> environment variable and the <code>-m</code>
option.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Streaming Parsers</h3>
<p dir="auto">Most parsers load all of the data from <code>STDIN</code>, parse it, then output the entire
JSON document serially. There are some streaming parsers (e.g. <code>ls-s</code> and
<code>ping-s</code>) that immediately start processing and outputting the data line-by-line
as <a href="https://jsonlines.org/" rel="nofollow">JSON Lines</a> (aka <a href="http://ndjson.org/" rel="nofollow">NDJSON</a>) while
it is being received from <code>STDIN</code>. This can significantly reduce the amount of
memory required to parse large amounts of command output (e.g. <code>ls -lR /</code>) and
can sometimes process the data more quickly. Streaming parsers have slightly
different behavior than standard parsers as outlined below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: Streaming parsers cannot be used with the "magic" syntax</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ignoring Errors</h4>
<p dir="auto">You may want to ignore parsing errors when using streaming parsers since these
may be used in long-lived processing pipelines and errors can break the pipe. To
ignore parsing errors, use the <code>-qq</code> cli option or the <code>ignore_exceptions=True</code>
argument with the <code>parse()</code> function. This will add a <code>_jc_meta</code> object to the
JSON output with a <code>success</code> attribute. If <code>success</code> is <code>true</code>, then there were
no issues parsing the line. If <code>success</code> is <code>false</code>, then a parsing issue was
found and <code>error</code> and <code>line</code> fields will be added to include a short error
description and the contents of the unparsable line, respectively:</p>
<p dir="auto">Successfully parsed line with <code>-qq</code> option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
  &quot;command_data&quot;: &quot;data&quot;,
  &quot;_jc_meta&quot;: {
    &quot;success&quot;: true
  }
}"><pre>{
  <span>"command_data"</span>: <span><span>"</span>data<span>"</span></span>,
  <span>"_jc_meta"</span>: {
    <span>"success"</span>: <span>true</span>
  }
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Unsuccessfully parsed line with <code>-qq</code> option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
  &quot;_jc_meta&quot;: {
    &quot;success&quot;: false,
    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;error message&quot;,
    &quot;line&quot;: &quot;original line data&quot;
  }
}"><pre>{
  <span>"_jc_meta"</span>: {
    <span>"success"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"error"</span>: <span><span>"</span>error message<span>"</span></span>,
    <span>"line"</span>: <span><span>"</span>original line data<span>"</span></span>
  }
}</pre></div>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unbuffering Output</h4>
<p dir="auto">Most operating systems will buffer output that is being piped from process to
process. The buffer is usually around 4KB. When viewing the output in the
terminal the OS buffer is not engaged so output is immediately displayed on the
screen. When piping multiple processes together, though, it may seem as if the
output is hanging when the input data is very slow (e.g. <code>ping</code>):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ping 1.1.1.1 | jc --ping-s | jq
<slow output>"><pre><code>$ ping 1.1.1.1 | jc --ping-s | jq
&lt;slow output&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is because the OS engages the 4KB buffer between <code>jc</code> and <code>jq</code> in this
example. To display the data on the terminal in realtime, you can disable the
buffer with the <code>-u</code> (unbuffer) cli option:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ping 1.1.1.1 | jc --ping-s -u | jq
{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;reply&quot;,&quot;pattern&quot;:null,&quot;timestamp&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:&quot;64&quot;,&quot;respons...}
{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;reply&quot;,&quot;pattern&quot;:null,&quot;timestamp&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:&quot;64&quot;,&quot;respons...}
..."><pre><code>$ ping 1.1.1.1 | jc --ping-s -u | jq
{"type":"reply","pattern":null,"timestamp":null,"bytes":"64","respons...}
{"type":"reply","pattern":null,"timestamp":null,"bytes":"64","respons...}
...
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: Unbuffered output can be slower for large data streams.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using Streaming Parsers as Python Modules</h4>
<p dir="auto">Streaming parsers accept any iterable object and return an iterable object
allowing lazy processing of the data. The input data should iterate on lines
of string data. Examples of good input data are <code>sys.stdin</code> or
<code>str.splitlines()</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use the returned iterable object in your code, simply loop through it or
use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow">next()</a>
builtin function:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import jc

result = jc.parse('ls_s', ls_command_output.splitlines())
for item in result:
    print(item[&quot;filename&quot;])"><pre><span>import</span> <span>jc</span>

<span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>jc</span>.<span>parse</span>(<span>'ls_s'</span>, <span>ls_command_output</span>.<span>splitlines</span>())
<span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>result</span>:
    <span>print</span>(<span>item</span>[<span>"filename"</span>])</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Parser Plugins</h3>
<p dir="auto">Parser plugins may be placed in a <code>jc/jcparsers</code> folder in your local
<strong>"App data directory"</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Linux/unix: <code>$HOME/.local/share/jc/jcparsers</code></li>
<li>macOS: <code>$HOME/Library/Application Support/jc/jcparsers</code></li>
<li>Windows: <code>$LOCALAPPDATA\jc\jc\jcparsers</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Parser plugins are standard python module files. Use the
<a href="https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc/blob/master/jc/parsers/foo.py"><code>jc/parsers/foo.py</code></a>
or <a href="https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc/blob/master/jc/parsers/foo_s.py"><code>jc/parsers/foo_s.py (streaming)</code></a>
parser as a template and simply place a <code>.py</code> file in the <code>jcparsers</code> subfolder.
Any dependencies can be placed in the <code>jc</code> folder above <code>jcparsers</code> and can
be imported in the parser code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Parser plugin filenames must be valid python module names and therefore must
start with a letter and consist entirely of alphanumerics and underscores.
Local plugins may override default parsers.</p>

<a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html" rel="nofollow">XDG Base Directory Specification</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caveats</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Locale</h4>
<p dir="auto">For best results set the locale environment variables to <code>C</code> or
<code>en_US.UTF-8</code> by modifying the <code>LC_ALL</code> variable:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ LC_ALL=C date | jc --date"><pre><code>$ LC_ALL=C date | jc --date
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can also set the locale variables individually:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ export LANG=C
$ export LC_NUMERIC=C"><pre><code>$ export LANG=C
$ export LC_NUMERIC=C
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">On some older systems UTF-8 output will be downgraded to ASCII with <code>\\u</code>
escape sequences if the <code>C</code> locale does not support UTF-8 encoding.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Timezones</h4>
<p dir="auto">Some parsers have calculated epoch timestamp fields added to the output. Unless
a timestamp field name has a <code>_utc</code> suffix it is considered naive. (i.e. based
on the local timezone of the system the <code>jc</code> parser was run on).</p>
<p dir="auto">If a UTC timezone can be detected in the text of the command output, the
timestamp will be timezone aware and have a <code>_utc</code> suffix on the key name.
(e.g. <code>epoch_utc</code>) No other timezones are supported for aware timestamps.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use In Other Shells</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>jc</code> can be used in most any shell. Some modern shells have JSON deserialization
and filtering capabilities built-in which makes using <code>jc</code> even more convenient.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, the following is possible in <a href="https://ngs-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">NGS</a>
(Next Generation Shell):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="myvar = ``jc dig www.google.com``[0].answer[0].data"><pre>myvar = <span><span>`</span><span>`</span></span>jc dig www.google.com<span><span>`</span><span>`</span></span>[0].answer[0].data</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This runs <code>jc</code>, parses the output JSON, and assigs the resulting data structure
to a variable in a single line of code.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more examples of how to use <code>jc</code> in other shells, see this
<a href="https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc/wiki/Using-jc-With-Different-Shells">wiki page</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compatibility</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some parsers like <code>dig</code>, <code>xml</code>, <code>csv</code>, etc. will work on any platform. Other
parsers that convert platform-specific output will generate a warning message if
they are run on an unsupported platform. To see all parser information,
including compatibility, run <code>jc -ap</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You may still use a parser on an unsupported platform - for example, you may
want to parse a file with linux <code>lsof</code> output on a macOS or Windows laptop. In
that case you can suppress the warning message with the <code>-q</code> cli option or the
<code>quiet=True</code> function parameter in <code>parse()</code>:</p>
<p dir="auto">macOS:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cat lsof.out | jc -q --lsof"><pre>cat lsof.out <span>|</span> jc -q --lsof</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">or Windows:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type lsof.out | jc -q --lsof"><pre><span>type</span> lsof.out <span>|</span> jc -q --lsof</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Tested on:</p>

[this is an English translation of the <a href="https://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/post/o-trzech-takich-co-zhakowali-prawdziwy-pociag-a-nawet-30-pociagow/">original article in Polish</a>, we occasionally <a href="https://badcyber.com/several-polish-banks-hacked-information-stolen-by-unknown-attackers">publish</a> the best cyber <a href="https://badcyber.com/errors-threats-and-extortion-history-of-a-bank-hack-part-one">stories</a> from Poland in English]
</p>
<p>A train manufactured by a Polish company suddenly broke down during maintenance. The experts were helpless – the train was fine, it just wouldn’t run. In a desperate last gasp, the Dragon Sector team was called in to help, and its members found wonders the train engineers had never dreamed of.</p>
<p>In this story, we will take you on an unusual journey. A journey full of unexpected discoveries and events, a journey under pressure of time and money, as well as unusual technologies. A journey in which the train plays the most important role – although unfortunately it doesn’t move, even though it should. Fasten your seatbelts – or at least sit comfortably, because there are sharp turns ahead.</p>
<h3>Winning the tender, losing the service</h3>
<p>The story probably begins a little earlier, but we will enter the scene in spring 2022, when the maintenance for the first of eleven Impuls 45WE trains (made by Polish company Newag) operated by the Lower Silesian Railways ends. The maintenance is carried out by an independent train maintenance company called Serwis Pojazdów Szynowych, hereafter referred to as SPS, SPS won the tender to carry out the mandatory maintenance of the trains after a distance of 1,000,000 kilometres. The train manufacturer, Newag, also competed in the tender to carry out the maintenance, but the manufacturer’s bid was about 750k USD higher and the tender was eventually won by SPS, which offered to carry out the maintenance of 11 trains for around 5.5 mln USD.</p>
<p>Maintenance a train is a complicated affair – it has to be taken apart, the parts sent to the various manufacturers, checked, sent back, the train put back together again and tested. The SPS carries out the maintenance procedures according to the relevant maintenance manual (some 20,000 pages) provided by the manufacturer, but the train does not start after being put together. The computer says everything is fine, the train is ready to run – but it does not run. The inverters are not supplying voltage to the motors and no one has any idea why this is happening. Maintenance technicians search, check, verify, consult the manuals – they find no answer.</p>
<h3>Mysterious breakdowns</h3>
<p>The Lower Silesian Railway has eleven Impulses and, according to the schedule, another one is about to be sent for maintenance, while the first – instead of returning to work – is still sitting in the workshop. The second train is undergoing an identical maintenance, with identical results. Before the maintenance it was operating, after the maintenance it no longer wants to run. The work on getting the first train up and running, like the train itself, has not progressed one millimetre, while the manufacturer refuses to help. Two immobile trains are already sitting in the workshop. The third misses its inspection due to battery failure, so a fourth train (“from the future”) is sent to the maintenance instead. The maintenance company wants to take advantage of its presence to tow one of those that won’t run. When the fourth (running) train is connected to one of the stationary ones, the running one also comes to a standstill (the reason for this has not yet been established). In addition, at another workshop in another Polish town, Szczecin, another Impulse breaks down in very similar circumstances – it does not start up after servicing.</p>
<h3>Poland’s top hackers</h3>
<p>At a certain point, the problem becomes serious enough to be noticed by the media – the six longest trains of the Lower Silesian Railway out of service mean that timetables have to be reduced, replacement trains have to be sent to the tracks, and passengers travel in overcrowded,&nbsp; shorter trainsets. Newag explains that the trains were blocked by a “safety system” – but in the 20,000 pages of instructions, it is in vain to find even a mention of it. A day of train downtime in the workshop costs over 1000 USD in contractual penalties, and there are several trains stuck, so the tension level in the SPS is rising. Since neither the mechanics nor the electricians have a solution, someone types “Polish hackers” into Google and comes across an article about the Dragon Sector group’s successes in the CTF arena at the top of the results list. SPS makes contact with DS, whose representatives at first can’t believe the proposal they hear. Train hacking? Well, why not. The parties sign a contract. Dragon Sector members Michał “Redford” Kowalczyk and Sergiusz “q3k” Bazański, known for <a href="https://badcyber.com/two-guys-one-laptop/">hacking Toshiba laptops,</a> take on the project, and Kuba “PanKleszcz” Stępniewicz, who has experience in industrial automation, joins in. The team set off briskly to work, with Kuba taking a trip to the workshop. On site, they get a train that doesn’t move, two spare computers and the computer manufacturer’s SDK files. They start the work by tapping into the CAN bus, but it’s difficult to read the traffic without documentation of the protocols. They take a long time trying to dump the embedded software from the on-board computer. They have no documentation of the computer and the SDK only allows uploading new software, with no option to dump existing software. As they experiment with the older version of the software they found, uploading it to the first spare computer causes it to stop responding – they are left with only one working spare computer. Eventually, they find a debugging interface and download the device’s memory byte by byte.</p>
<p>The computer is based on the TriCore architecture, like many similar solutions in the automotive industry. Unfortunately, there is a lack of good disassemblers, so the researchers are improving Ghidra a bit and can finally look into the code. Admittedly, strings are missing, but the work is slowly moving forward. A month and a half goes by when the SPS passes on the bad news.</p>
<h3>As the deadline chases and trains break down</h3>
<p>The Lower Silesian Railway, unable to wait for its trains, decides to cooperate with Newag on the repair of broken trainsets and their maintenance, including trains which, according to the original tender, were yet to be sent for maintenance at SPS. The rupture of the contract with SPS is expected to take place in a week’s time. As is well known, nothing affects the intensity of the work as much as a very close deadline by which the result has to be shown, so the researchers set to work with redoubled energy. In the course of their work so far, they have downloaded the memory contents of a number of computers, both trains that are working and those that should only be working. Comparing these images is an ordeal, as almost every train has a different set of functions and a different version of software, but slowly they are starting to get a feel for something. They identify values in the computers’ memory that are set in one train and zeroed out in another. They can run tests at their desks – the computer, even when taken out of the train, lets it run for a while (before realising it’s missing the rest of the train) to show whether it’s ready to run the inverters.</p>
<p>There is less than a day left until the deadline for completion when they find the configuration of flags that gives the train a chance to run. Unfortunately, during the experiments, the last working on-board computer burns out. Yes, it burns – a capacitor burns (a rather random occurrence). After another brainstorm and many attempts to put the two damaged computers into one, they manage to repair the burnt one and at 2am, the night before doomsday, the researchers configure a computer to start the train. One of the researchers boards a train (of a different operator) to arrive with the presumably working computer at the workshop just before the representatives of the Lower Silesian Railway, who have announced a visit for 9:30 a.m. Unfortunately, the train on which the researcher travels to the maintenance company is late. Eventually, in the morning, the researcher with the computer arrives at the site, connects the pray-it-works-computer to the broken-down train, but the train does not start. Another brainstorm identifies one flag that was forgotten and at 8:42 the train manages to start. The Lower Silesian Railway delegation, seeing at 9:30 that the trains have a chance of getting back to life after all, does not break the contract with SPS.</p>

<h3>Why the train broke down</h3>
<p>Figuring out how to get the train to run wasn’t even half the battle – you still had to figure out why it broke down, and this is where the thrill ride begins.</p>
<p>Months of analysis and reverse engineering uncovered some extremely interesting conditions written into the software code of various trains supplied by Newag. After hundreds of hours spent on code dumped from dozens of trainsets, it was possible to identify some very interesting mechanisms causing sudden train sickness.</p>

<p>The numerical values 53.13845 and 17.99011 found in the computer code seemed familiar at first glance. It soon became apparent that these were GPS coordinates pointing to the vicinity of Bydgoszcz Główny Railway Station, specifically the PESA (another Polish train producer and maintenance center) site located next to it. Soon the coordinates of other maintenance centers that could carry out train repairs and maintenance in Poland were also found.

<p>Coordinate pairs define the workshop areas. A condition has been written in the computer code to disable the ability to run a train if it spends at least 10 days in one of these workshops. One of the workshops belongs to Newag itself – but a different logical condition was defined for its coordinates, presumably for testing purposes.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="946" height="476" src="https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png" data-src="https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png 946w, https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-300x151.png 300w, https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-768x386.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" srcset="https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png 946w, https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-300x151.png 300w, https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-768x386.png 768w"></figure>
<p>Other surprises were soon discovered. Among them was the blocking of a train when one of its components is replaced (verified by its serial number). An option to undo the lockout was also discovered – this did not require setting flags at computer memory level, just the right sequence of button clicks in the cab and on the on-board computer screen. When news of the successful launch of the Impulse hit the media, the trains received a software update that removed this ‘fix’ option. On another train, a code was found instructing it to ‘break down’ after a million kilometres.</p>
<h3>Checking the date is hard</h3>
<p>A rather funny situation was encountered on another train that refused to work on November 21, 2022, even though it was not in maintenance at the time. The computer reported that the compressor had failed, although the mechanics said that everything was fine with the compressor. Unfortunately, the train still did not raise the pantographs. Analysis of the computer code detected a condition forcing the failure, which sounded like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the day is greater than or equal to 21 and</li>
<li>if the month is greater than or equal to 11 and</li>
<li>if the year is greater than or equal to 2021</li>
</ul>
<p>then report a compressor failure. The situation was funny because the train had been scheduled for servicing in November 2021 (the year before the breakdown), but the condition did not work then by coincidence. The train went into maintenance a while earlier, and was not put back into service until January 2022 – and the sophisticated logic condition described above no longer met this date. Presumably, it was the software developer’s lack of skill in constructing IFs that made it necessary to wait until November 21, 2022 for the scheduled failure.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hardware surprise</h3>
<p>Surprises lurked not only in the software of the computers. In one train set, researchers discovered a device signed as a “UDP&lt;-&gt;CAN converter”, presumably enabling remote communication with the train. Removing it did not make anything stop working. Analysis showed that the on-board computer was sending lock status information to this device, and that the device itself was connected to a GSM modem.</p>
<h3>Not only in Wrocław</h3>
<p>Information that the SPS maintenance center succeeded in repairing Newag’s ‘broken’ trainsets quickly found its way to other companies as well. It turned out to be quite a common problem. In Wrocław they analysed 13 Impulses, but there were also broken ones running in Kolej Mazowieckie (one), two in Opole, four in Krakow, one in Zielona Góra, four in Szczecin and one in Warsaw. Fortunately, each was able to be repaired using a tool developed by our researchers that removes software locks from the on-board computer. In total, the researchers analysed the software of 29 trains and in all but five they found surprises beyond the official operating instructions.</p>
<h3>What’s next</h3>
<p>We leave it to the readers and customers of this company to assess the solutions used by the manufacturer. Interestingly, although there is litigation in the case, it is hard to find an institution in Poland that has done anything beyond kindly expressing interest in the matter. We are not aware of any action taken either by the Office of Consumer and Competition Protection or by the Railway Transport Office, which would seem to be competent to eliminate from the market practices that are damaging to local government organisations that are incurring considerable losses and to passengers who are forced to travel in crowds or use substitute transport for months. The only institution that has taken action that we are aware of is CERT Polska, notified of the discovery by the researchers. From the comment we received, it appears that CERT Polska has notified the “relevant authorities” and the case is being handled by law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>We congratulate the best Polish hackers on their interesting discovery and professional execution of the assignment. Remember, nothing motivates you like a deadline tomorrow morning.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was a late evening.</p>
<p>My colleague has just checked in the code that they’ve been writing all week. We were working on a graphics editor canvas, and they implemented the ability to resize shapes like rectangles and ovals by dragging small handles at their edges.</p>
<p>The code worked.</p>
<p>But it was repetitive. Each shape (such as a rectangle or an oval) had a different set of handles, and dragging each handle in different directions affected the shape’s position and size in a different way. If the user held Shift, we’d also need to preserve proportions while resizing. There was a bunch of math.</p>
<p>The code looked something like this:</p>

<p>That repetitive math was really bothering me.</p>
<p>It wasn’t <em>clean</em>.</p>
<p>Most of the repetition was between similar directions. For example, <code>Oval.resizeLeft()</code> had similarities with <code>Header.resizeLeft()</code>. This was because they both dealt with dragging the handle on the left side.</p>
<p>The other similarity was between the methods for the same shape. For example, <code>Oval.resizeLeft()</code> had similarities with the other <code>Oval</code> methods. This was because they all dealt with ovals. There was also some duplication between <code>Rectangle</code>, <code>Header</code>, and <code>TextBlock</code> because text blocks <em>were</em> rectangles.</p>
<p>I had an idea.</p>
<p>We could <em>remove all duplication</em> by grouping the code like this instead:</p>

<p>The code is half the total size, and the duplication is gone completely! So <em>clean</em>. If we want to change the behavior for a particular direction or a shape, we could do it in a single place instead of updating methods all over the place.</p>
<p>It was already late at night (I got carried away). I checked in my refactoring to master and went to bed, proud of how I untangled my colleague’s messy code.</p>
<h2>The Next Morning</h2>
<p>… did not go as expected.</p>
<p>My boss invited me for a one-on-one chat where they politely asked me to revert my change. I was aghast. The old code was a mess, and mine was <em>clean</em>!</p>
<p>I begrudgingly complied, but it took me years to see they were right.</p>
<h2>It’s a Phase</h2>
<p>Obsessing with “clean code” and removing duplication is a phase many of us go through. When we don’t feel confident in our code, it is tempting to attach our sense of self-worth and professional pride to something that can be measured. A set of strict lint rules, a naming schema, a file structure, a lack of duplication.</p>
<p>You can’t automate removing duplication, but it <em>does</em> get easier with practice. You can usually tell whether there’s less or more of it after every change. As a result, removing duplication feels like improving some objective metric about the code. Worse, it messes with people’s sense of identity: <em>“I’m the kind of person who writes clean code”</em>. It’s as powerful as any sort of self-deception.</p>
<p>Once we learn how to create <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">abstractions</a>, it is tempting to get high on that ability, and pull abstractions out of thin air whenever we see repetitive code. After a few years of coding, we see repetition <em>everywhere</em> — and abstracting is our new superpower. If someone tells us that abstraction is a <em>virtue</em>, we’ll eat it. And we’ll start judging other people for not worshipping “cleanliness”.</p>
<p>I see now that my “refactoring” was a disaster in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, I didn’t talk to the person who wrote it. I rewrote the code and checked it in without their input. Even if it <em>was</em> an improvement (which I don’t believe anymore), this is a terrible way to go about it. A healthy engineering team is constantly <em>building trust</em>. Rewriting your teammate’s code without a discussion is a huge blow to your ability to effectively collaborate on a codebase together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, nothing is free. My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication, and it was not a good trade. For example, we later needed many special cases and behaviors for different handles on different shapes. My abstraction would have to become several times more convoluted to afford that, whereas with the original “messy” version such changes stayed easy as cake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I saying that you should write “dirty” code? No. I suggest to think deeply about what you mean when you say “clean” or “dirty”. Do you get a feeling of revolt? Righteousness? Beauty? Elegance? How sure are you that you can name the concrete engineering outcomes corresponding to those qualities? How exactly do they affect the way the code is written and <a href="https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/">modified</a>?</p>
<p>I sure didn’t think deeply about any of those things. I thought a lot about how the code <em>looked</em> — but not about how it <em>evolved</em> with a team of squishy humans.</p>
<p>Coding is a journey. Think how far you came from your first line of code to where you are now. I reckon it was a joy to see for the first time how extracting a function or refactoring a class can make convoluted code simple. If you find pride in your craft, it is tempting to pursue cleanliness in code. Do it for a while.</p>
<p>But don’t stop there. Don’t be a clean code zealot. Clean code is not a goal. It’s an attempt to make some sense out of the immense complexity of systems we’re dealing with. It’s a defense mechanism when you’re not yet sure how a change would affect the codebase but you need guidance in a sea of unknowns.</p>
<p>Let clean code guide you. <strong>Then let it go.</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>

		</h2>
		<p>
			Computers have come a long way in the last 15 years!
		</p>

		<h2>
			Help! I installed something I found on the internet called
			worldofg002-&amp;@%-realgame.exe and now my computer is on fire?
		</h2>
		<p>
			World of Goo 2 has not yet been released. It will come out soon, in 2024.
		</p>

		<h2>
			I used to play the original World of Goo when I was a kid.
			Will this make me feel like a kid again?
		</h2>

		<h2>
			What platforms or consoles will it be on? Can I play it on my-
		</h2>
		<p>
			Dandy Wheeler, PR specialist: Yes, let's enjoy this moment, right now, where anything is possible.
			Can you play it on your 2004 Discman? Maybe. Let's just let the vast expanse of uncertainty
			fill our hearts with wonder, while we fill our bank accounts with exclusive distribution contracts.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Can I be on the soundtrack? I play djembe, bass clarinet, theramin, and cardboard boxes?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We've always wanted to assemble a soundtrack with performances from
			lots of different musicians. Do you play an instrument and have the ability to record yourself?
			<a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/about">Contact us here</a>
			if you'd like to try this out with us. Tell us which instrument(s) you play, and bonus points
			if you can link to audio or video of you playing something.
		</p>

		<h2>
			I speak one of Earth's many languages. Do you need help translating the game?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Bonjour! All our games have been community-translated, and we'd love to continue the tradition with World of Goo 2.
			<a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/about">Contact us here</a>
			if this sounds like a project for you!
		</p>

		<h2>
			I missed you, World of Goo!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

      

      

      <article role="main">
        <p>I was visiting family this past weekend and saw an iMac from 2007 and MacBook from 2008 destined for the trash. As the tech nerd of the family, I was asked if these machines were still useful at all. I also had a 2012 Macbook Air no one was using, so I figured I’d look into that one while I was at it.</p>

<h2 id="the-computers">The computers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>iMac5,1 from 2007. 1 GB of RAM.</li>
  <li>MacBook5,1 from 2008. 2 GB of RAM.</li>
  <li>MacBook Air5,2 from 2012. 8 GM of RAM.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you might expect, none of these machines can run a version of mac OS that is currently supported by Apple:</p>
<ul>
  <li>iMac5,1s can only be upgraded to 10.7.5 Lion (<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6584536">source</a>), which stopped being supported by Apple years ago. It has 1 GB of RAM (I think <a href="https://igotoffer.com/apple/imac-core-2-duo-2-16-20-inch">these are roughly the correct specs</a>).</li>
  <li>The latest OS a MacBook5,1 can handle is <a href="https://igotoffer.com/apple/macbook-5#Specifications">apparently OS X 10.11 El Capitan</a>, which is also no longer supported. It has 2 GB of RAM. (Here are what I think are <a href="https://igotoffer.com/apple/macbook-5">some accurate specs</a>.)</li>
  <li>I think the 2012 Air can handle High Sierra, but even that is not currently supported.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-note-on-securely-erasing-old-data">A note on securely erasing old data</h2>

<p>For a variety of reasons, including my own laziness, I didn’t worry too much about securely erasing the existing data on these particular computers. That was probably a mistake. I think the older two machines have rotating drives (HDDs), which are easier to erase securely than the more modern solid state drive found on the 2012 Air. I don’t have enough confidence to point you to a resource, other than maybe <a href="https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64">ShredOS</a> (which I kind of want to use just for the experience) and this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/how-to-securely-wipe-your-computer-devices/">this Wirecutter guide</a> on scrubbing solid state drives.</p>

<p>If I do end up either donating or trashing them, I may take steps to more securely erase everything on them, hopefully effectively securely deleting everything that’s <em>ever</em> been on them.</p>

<h2 id="a-lightweight-linux-distro">A lightweight Linux distro?</h2>

<p>I was most worried/focused on the 2007 iMac and the 2008 MacBook – given their age, I found them more interesting restoration projects, you could say. With no support from Apple for any of these computers, I looked to Linux. Given that the iMac has only 1 GB of RAM and the Macbook has 2 GB, I knew I needed a <em>lightweight</em> Linux distribution (aka “distro”).</p>

<p>In a past situations like this I have <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/11/08/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro.html">used Lubuntu</a> and <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2022/08/23/reviving-a-thinkpad-x40.html">Puppy Linux</a>, but figured I should look for something new to me and maybe more challenging. (Besides, Lubuntu felt <em>a little</em> too heavy for 1 GB of RAM, and I’m not sure if Puppy installs well with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI">UEFI</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="the-imac">The iMac</h2>

<p>I started with the iMac.</p>

<p>Step 1: I needed to find out if it has a 64-bit processor or a 32-bit one, something I’d need to know in order to pick a suitable distro and version of Linux.</p>

<p><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6584536">It turns out that iMac5,1s have a 64-bit processor, BUT “it has a 32-bit EFI and is not capable of booting into 64-bit mode.”</a>, which sounds like a real nightmare for someone facing the either/or choice of trying to install a 64- or 32-bit version of Linux. (In hindsight I would have been safe just to go with a 32-bit version.)</p>

<p>I decided to try a 64-bit iso first, figuring that it was preferable for finding software to install down the road.</p>

<h3 id="antix-linux">antiX Linux</h3>

<p>After a bit of research, I found <a href="https://antixlinux.com/">antiX Linux</a>, which is based on Debian (awesome), and recently <a href="https://antixlinux.com/antix-22-released/">published a new release called, logically, antiX-22</a> based on <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/">Debian bullseye</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://antixlinux.com/download/">downloaded</a> the 64-bit “full” antiX Linux iso file from Sourceforge and flashed it onto a USB stick using Pop_OS’s “USB Flasher” program (you can use <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Etcher</a> or something similar). My first goal was to try a live demo version of antiX to see how well it worked before installing it on to the computer hard drive.</p>

<h3 id="getting-antix-to-boot-from-usb-stick">Getting antiX to boot from USB stick</h3>
<p>With the USB stick and a keyboard plugged in, I turned on the iMac, pressing and holding down the Alt/Option key when I heard the familiar Apple start-up sound. I then clicked on the “EFI” boot option.</p>

<p>I was greeted by the antiX boot screen loaded just fine. So far so good.</p>

<p><img src="https://sts10.github.io/img/antix/bootscreen.jpg" alt="antiX UEFI boot screen"></p>

<p>But when I chose to launch antiX I was taken to a black (but lit) screen.</p>

<p>I had had some experience with this when <a href="https://sts10.github.io//2016/11/08/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro.html">getting Ubuntu on to a 2009 MacBook Pro 5 years ago</a>. I figured I needed to edit some GRUB settings.</p>

<p>I rebooted and held option/alt again to get back to the antiX boot menu. At this point, I hit ‘e’ instead of enter in order to edit the GRUB parameters. To learn more about the cause of the black screen, I tried a few options I knew that might give me more information, like adding <code>nosplash</code>, <code>debug</code>, and removing <code>quiet</code>. Thanks to these changes, I found out that the boot was hanging while the text “Waiting for /dev to be fully populated” was displayed.</p>

<!-- Adding `nomodeset nosplash` to the GRUB options got me to a command line, giving me a clue that the issue had to do with the video card in the machine. -->

<h4 id="partial-success-false-hope">Partial success? False hope?</h4>
<p>After <a href="https://download.tuxfamily.org/antix/docs-antiX-22/Boot_Menu/antiX-gfxboot.html#bo_antix">looking up other boot parameter options</a> and a lot of trial and error, I added the <code>nosplash failsafe disable=lxF</code> parameters and antiX’s GUI live demo booted. Success! However, I think the <code>failsafe</code> options tells antiX not to use the computer’s <em>video card</em>, which negatively affects performance. But at this point I’m not sure of another way to make the GUI launch….</p>

<p>(I think what I ultimately need to do is to get the computer to use the correct AMD/Radeon driver – it has a AMD RV530/M56-P [Mobility Radeon X1600] graphic card–, but as of this writing I’m not sure how to do that.)</p>

<p>Excited, I went to actually install antiX to this hard drive. After some fooling around with the partition sizing, I got antiX to install on the hard drive successfully. But every time I’d reboot the computer (now with the USB stick unplugged) I would always get thrown into a CLI (no GUI desktop). This happened seemingly no matter what GRUB parameters or kernel version I tried. Frustrating that I could get the live USB to work, but not the installed-on-harddrive antiX to work…</p>

<h3 id="mxfluxbox-to-the-rescue">MX+Fluxbox to the rescue</h3>

<p>Then I remembered something: In my search for a suitable distro, I had tried <a href="https://mxlinux.org/">MX Linux</a>, “a cooperative venture between the antiX and MX Linux communities” with its default Xfce desktop.</p>

<p>The live USB booted once I added <code>nomodeset</code> to the GRUB options. But once the GUI booted, I realized why MX Linux is branded as a “middle-weight” distro: running the Xfce desktop, it was indeed sluggish with just 1 GB of RAM. So at that point I switched to trying to install antiX, hopeful that it would work as smoothly as MX, but with less weight. As I learned, for whatever (video-related?) reasons, antiX just wasn’t easily installing on this machine.</p>

<p>But! Later I learned that MX officially supports a Fluxbox desktop option, which is lighter than Xfce. With fingers crossed, I tried installing the 32-bit version and, once I added <code>nomodeset nosplash</code> to the GRUB options (by hitting ‘e’), it worked pretty well on the machine. Not exactly speedy, but usable. Given the age of this machine and other issues I had trying to install any Linux distro on it, I figure it was worth trying to install a distro that I knew was at least functional.</p>

<p>When I went to install, I did have some drive formatting issues pop up (“Could not format <code>/root</code>” or something similar.) I used GParted to re-partition the drive to one big ext4 partition. Once that was done, I re-launched the MX installer and chose the simple partition option, making the entire hard drive <code>/root</code>. (I don’t remember if the installer gave me the choice of where to install GRUB, but if it did I almost certainly chose MBR.)</p>

<p>I then waited for the install to complete, then the system rebooted and I was good to go (and remove the live USB)!</p>

<p>I am still curious why MX worked where antiX did not. Maybe a kernel version difference? <!-- I would also be curious to compare performance of MX+Fluxbox vs. antiX with, say, IceWM on the same hardware...--></p>

<!-- So unfortunately, I'm leaving the iMac in a broken state. I would permanently run antiX from a USB stick in `failsafe` mode, but it's pretty sluggish. I'm considering loading [ShredOS](https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64), wiping the hard drive as thoroughly as I can, and tossing it. -->

<h3 id="comparing-mxfluxbox-vs-antix">Comparing MX+Fluxbox vs. antiX</h3>

<p>One interesting question this brings up is how MX+Fluxbox compares with antiX (using its defeault IceWM desktop), especially with regard to resource usage. My gut is that Fluxbox isn’t as light as IceWM, so a better comparison might be with both MX and antiX running Fluxbox, something I haven’t had a chance to do.</p>

<p>Regardless, if even to say I’ve done it, I wanted to get antiX running on some hardware. This is the attitude with which I turned to the MacBook5,1.</p>

<!-- I actually installed MX Linux with its Xfce desktop on a 2012 MacBook Air (with a luxurious 8 GB of RAM) after all of this. The install itself went smoothly (no GRUB parameter edits needed), and I was pretty happy with what I got out of the box with the Xfce desktop it comes with. The Fluxbox version gave a similar out-of-the-box completeness, though I will note that it didn't include an office suite (no biggie for me). -->

<h2 id="the-macbook">The MacBook</h2>

<p><img src="https://sts10.github.io/img/antix/macbook-5-1.png" alt="a MacBook5,1"></p>

<p>I had easier success with antiX and the rather beefy MacBook 5,1.</p>

<p>Using a USB stick with antiX 22 full/64-bit flashed, I rebooted the Macbook, holding alt/option when I heard the boot-up sound. I selected the EFI option and got to the now-familiar antiX boot screen. I hit ‘e’ to edit GRUB options and added <code>nosplash</code>, anticipating issues that I’d need information on, but the live demo GUI loaded right up! (Note that I don’t think antiX is using the NVIDIA graphics card…)</p>

<p>Excited, I clicked the GUI installer. Unfortunately, I think I hit an error around 12% of the way through the installation: something about an error while attempting to format the internal hard drive (<code>/sda</code>).</p>

<p>On a tip I found somewhere on the internet, I closed the installer and launched GParted, which is helpfully included in the antiX 22 live demo. This part below I’m not 100% sure on. Actually, it <strong>may misconfigure your hard drive in such a way that is difficult to recover from</strong>, so I would proceed with lots of <strong>CAUTION</strong>.</p>

<p>When you launch GParted in the antiX demo, it may ask for a system password. Apparently it’s <code>demo</code> (or maybe <code>root</code>).</p>

<p>Using GParted, I re-partitioned the hard drive to the following:
<!-- * `/dev/sda1` as the EFI partition. File system: fat 32; Mount Point: `/boot/efi`; Size: 256MB. Note that I think you need make this the "ESP" partition during the antiX Custom Installation wizard... --></p>
<ul>
  <li><code>/dev/sda1</code> as the boot partition. File system: ext4; Mount Point: <code>/boot</code>; Size: 2GB.</li>
  <li><code>/dev/sda2</code> as the root partition. File system: ext4; Mount Point: <code>/</code>; Label: <code>rootantix22</code>; Size: 48.3 GB (could likely get away with closer to 6GB, but I had plenty of storage to spare…)</li>
  <li><code>/dev/sda3</code> as the swap partition. File system: <code>linux-swap</code>; Mount Point is blank(?); Label: <code>swapantix</code>; Size: 2.62 GB (think you want this to match size of system RAM? I gave it a bit extra just in case)</li>
  <li><code>/dev/sda4</code> as the home partition. File system: <code>ext4</code>; Mount Point: <code>/home</code>; Label: <code>home</code>; Size: 179.7GB.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I clicked the check mark button at the top of GParted to have it do all this re-formatting, which took maybe 2 minutes. This had the bonus effect of deleting (maybe not very securely) the old data on the hard drive.</p>

<p>Once that was done, I relaunched the GUI antiX installer. I chose a custom install and, using drop-down menus, matched each partition with its assignment (root, swap, home, etc.). In the subsequent menus, I chose to, yes, install GRUB and to do it on MBR, which I think is important! (MBR is not the default.)</p>

<p>Once the installer was done, I rebooted the system and it launched right into antiX! Very cool.</p>

<p><img src="https://sts10.github.io/img/antix/antix.jpg" alt="antiX installed"></p>

<h3 id="troubleshooting-at-this-point">Troubleshooting (at this point)</h3>

<p>If, with the USB stick removed, you reboot the computer and it takes you to a command line login, don’t panic. Login in the credentials you set while installing antiX.</p>

<p>Once the prompt says <code>&lt;your_username&gt;@&lt;computername&gt;</code>, run <code>sudo nano /etc/default/grub</code> to edit GRUB setting. You’ll likely want them to match the settings you used to get the demo running (in my case, <code>nosplash failsafe disable=lxF</code>). Save the changes to the file (<code>Ctrl-O</code>, then enter) and exit nano (<code>Ctrl-X</code>), then run <code>sudo update-grub</code> to make the changes to the actual GRUB config files. Finally, run <code>sudo reboot</code> to restart the computer.</p>

<p>Note that, while the USB live demo uses the “Legacy” kernel, the installed version will try to use the <strong>latest</strong> kernel included in the antiX iso. So if you still have issues with the installed version of antiX that you <em>didn’t</em> with the live USB demo, it might be because of the use of the newer kernel. Currently, I’m not quite sure how to change this…</p>

<h3 id="using-antix">Using AntiX</h3>

<p>On this old MacBook and its relatively low 2 GB of RAM, AntiX seems pretty perfect for my needs. The default IceWM window manager is lightweight but modern-looking. The stability of Debian and its familiar <code>apt</code> CLI tool is comforting. I loved the choice of many window managers, which ranged in their feel and resource usage (and it’s wonderful that you can switch between them “live”, with little delay). And <a href="https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/another-case-of-waiting-for-dev-to-be-fully-populated/">the user forum</a> was super helpful when I had questions.</p>

<p>I will note that the default UI (with the IceWM window manager) is definitely more Windows-inspired than Mac-inspired – for example, a lot of user actions start with clicking the “antiX” button in the bottom left, a la the Windows “Start” button. While this is great for folks coming from (older versions of) Windows, I was a bit slow to get used to it. There are (of course) ways to make antiX look more like Mac OS (see <a href="https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/how-to-make-antix-look-like-macos-with-jwm/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/make-antix-look-like-macos/">here</a>), e.g. I could have added a dock like <a href="https://launchpad.net/plank">Plank</a>, but I worried about increased RAM usage. Not a big deal.</p>

<p>I was also a bit confused about how to use antiX as a “live USB”, by which I understand you load it onto a USB stick and carry it around to fire up on any computer you might have access to. As I understand it (a) this type of USB is distinct from just loading up the ISO on a USB stick (maybe since it includes persistence of storage and/or preferences), and (b) the best/easiest way to create one of these special “live” USBs is to use a normal antiX-flashed USB? It was a bit confusing to me. FWIW, <a href="https://sts10.github.io//2022/08/23/reviving-a-thinkpad-x40.html#installing-puppy-linux-to-the-hard-drive">I encountered a similar confusion with Puppy Linux</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t back this up with evidence, but in general I felt a bit more sure of myself dealing with MX Linux than with antiX.</p>

<h2 id="the-2012-macbook-air">The 2012 MacBook Air</h2>

<p>I also had a MacBookAir5,2 (13-inch, mid 2012, 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5, 8 GB of DDR3 RAM) kicking around. Despite it being 5 years younger than these other two machines, I think it could only run macOS High Sierra, which is also no longer supported by Apple. Linux time!</p>

<p>Given the 8 GB of RAM, and my good experience with MX Linux, I went with MX’s “flagship” Xfce install. Installation went very smoothly – don’t think I even needed to edit the GRUB parameters. I even liked the theming out the box. So this section of this post is pretty short! Given its younger age and its 8 GB of RAM, this is a pretty capable machine now!</p>

<p>Most of the small changes I ended up making were from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO7yd5yWN7c">great video on setting up and customizing MX+Xfce</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-group-photo-of-all-three">A group photo of all three</h2>

<p><img src="https://sts10.github.io/img/antix/all_3.jpg" alt="All 3 Macs, with Linux successfully installed"></p>

<p>Phew! So to recap, I got:</p>

<ul>
  <li>antiX (photographed using the IceWM desktop) on a MacBook5,1 (bottom left in photo, sorry about the glare)</li>
  <li>MX+Fluxbox on an iMac5,1 desktop (top middle)</li>
  <li>MX+Xfce on a MacBookAir5,2 (bottom right)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="appendix-a-ram-saving-tweaks-for-antix">Appendix A: RAM-saving tweaks for antiX</h2>

<p>Later on, I looked into some ways to conserve RAM on the MacBook5,1 with antiX on it. Here are some of the steps I took:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AntiX specific: Run <code>sudo cp /usr/local/bin/zram /etc/init.d &amp;&amp; sudo update-rc.d zram default</code> then reboot to enable zram at start-up. (<a href="https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/making-a-pentium-4-laptop-useful-with-antix/">source</a>)</li>
  <li>AntiX comes with Firefox ESR as the default browser. While I support that choice generally, it felt a bit heavy for my purposes, so I used the included package manager to install <a href="https://www.palemoon.org/">Pale Moon browser</a> and made it the default and preferred browser. I also did this on the iMac. (I tried <a href="https://www.seamonkey-project.org/">SeaMonkey</a> first but it didn’t play audio out of the box and I didn’t feel like fixing that.)</li>
  <li>Try alternate desktops! AntiX makes it pretty darn easy to try other desktops: In fact, you can switch <em>without</em> rebooting or even logging out, something I don’t think I’ve seen before. In the antiX (Start) menu, you just go to Desktop and pick a desktop to try. I tried Minimal-IceWM desktop environment, which did lower RAM consumption, but removed, among other things, the GUI volume control in the bottom left of the main task bar (this gives you an idea of just how minimal the window manager is).</li>
</ol>

<p>After taking these steps on the antiX MacBook, with the default terminal open, running <code>free -m</code> informs that I have 131MB used. With Pale Moon open and playing a YouTube video, usage bumps up to 485MB. Impressive!</p>

<h2 id="appendix-b-theming">Appendix B: Theming</h2>

<p>Given how often I was re-installing distros this weekend, I couldn’t really bring myself to start working on a theme/aesthetic for the laptop (in case I had to soon after start over with a new installation or something). But I think that’d be a fun follow-up project.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.antixforum.com/">antiX forum</a> has some posts about looks, including <a href="https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/how-to-make-antix-look-like-macos-with-jwm/">how to model it after macOS</a>. For a dock for antiX, I might I’ve heard a lot about <a href="https://github.com/ricotz/plank">Plank</a>, but have also seen that it eats about 25 mb of RAM.</p>

<p>I generally liked how MX Linux looks out of the box, especially the flagship Xfce version on the MacBook Air. The theme is called mx-comfort, and the icons are <a href="https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme">Papirus</a>, an icon set I actually had admired and used before.</p>

<!-- First, I want to try out the other built-in Desktops (window managers) to see if I like any more than Rox IceWM, starting with plain ol' "IceWM" (which I think is a choice). -->

<!-- As for themes and icons, [in the past](https://sts10.github.io/2017/04/18/xfce-and-other-linux-notes.html) I used the now-defunct Paper theme and icons for Xfce. This time around I might try [Papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme), [Flat Remix](https://github.com/daniruiz/flat-remix-gnome), or [We10X](https://github.com/yeyushengfan258/We10X-icon-theme). To be honest I'm not sure which of these general "Linux" themes (maybe they're GTK?) will work on antiX, but I figure it's worth a shot. -->

<h2 id="epilogue-a-lesson-learned">Epilogue: A Lesson Learned</h2>

<p>Brimming with confidence, I tried to install antiX on yet another old Mac: a MacBook Pro 3,1, which was still running Ubuntu 16.04 from <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/11/08/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro.html">this post</a>.</p>

<p>After a couple of failed boots and install attempts (the last of which was trying to use antiX 19.5 because apparently I could get the right Nvidia driver (legacy-340xx) with Debian Buster?), I seem to have somehow deleted or corrupted <strong>GRUB</strong>. I think during one of my failed install attempts, I unchecked the box to “install GRUB” (still wondering why that’s possible?). Either that or I told the installer to install GRUB on a partition that didn’t exist?</p>

<h3 id="recovering">Recovering</h3>
<p>This situation was, for me, very tricky and frustrating to recover from. Eventually, I used the antiX 22 live demo to install a fresh copy of antiX 22, paying special attention to create a partition for “/boot” and telling the installer to install GRUB on “MBR”. I think this did what I wanted: give me a clean installation of GRUB and a /boot partition upon which to install an “easier” distro that would hopefully clean up the remaining artifacts from my failed antiX install.</p>

<p>So, rather than try to boot antiX again (it hadn’t been working on that machine), I stuck in a different USB that I had flashed with a simpler (but still lightweight) distro called <a href="https://www.bodhilinux.com/">Bodhi Linux</a>, one I had wanted to try anyway. I figured an easy-to-install distro (based on Ubuntu) would <strong>install easily</strong> AND hopefully resolve any remaining issues from my failed antiX installations.</p>

<p>Sure enough, after a bit longer than I would have guessed, Bodhi Linux installed successfully! I ran a <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt dist-upgrade</code> to get it up-to-date, then crossed my fingers and rebooted. I don’t think I had to use any special GRUB boot parameters. All good!</p>

<p><img src="https://sts10.github.io/img/antix/bodhi.jpeg" alt="Bodhi Linux installed"></p>

<p>My takeaway here is that antiX is <em>not</em> advertised as a beginner-friendly distro for a reason. (I was relieved that the Bodhi Linux installer didn’t ask me any confusing questions!) If you’re not paying attention, it can bite ya! MX Linux may be a bit more beginner friendly, but you still need to read the installation wizard carefully!</p>

<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
                        </header>

<p>Across Europe, welfare systems are increasingly deploying predictive risk assessments. The scores they produce can have life-changing implications for some of the continent’s most vulnerable populations. Over the past two years, Lighthouse Reports and its media partners have used freedom-of-information laws to obtain and take apart these systems from the inside out. <a href="https://www.lighthousereports.com/investigation/suspicion-machines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our reporting</a> has travelled across the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, and Serbia and found evidence of discrimination, privacy invasions and fundamental design flaws — and told the stories of those most affected.</p>
<p>Lighthouse Reports partnered with Le Monde to investigate an algorithm deployed by France’s <em>Caisse Nationale des Allocations Familiales</em> (CNAF), the agency responsible for the French social security system. The algorithm, deployed for more than 10 years, attempts to predict which benefit recipients are committing fraud. All of the more than 13 million households, — representing nearly half the population — who receive some type of benefit are assigned a risk score. Using French freedom-of-information laws, Le Monde obtained the source code for three risk-scoring models deployed by the CNAF between 2010 and 2023.</p>
<p>This far-reaching access enabled <em>Le Monde</em> and Lighthouse to take apart the model and test which types of people were more likely to be flagged for investigation. In December of 2023, we co-published a <a href="https://www.lighthousereports.com/investigation/frances-digital-inquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four-part</a> series based on the results of our analysis, interviews with insiders, and testimony of benefit recipients flagged for investigation.</p>
<p>In this methodology, Lighthouse and <em>Le Monde</em> explain how we analysed the CNAF’s algorithm to demonstrate that it systematically targets people in the most precarious situations while making it nearly impossible for the better off to be investigated.</p>
<p>France is an early member of a club of European nations that have deployed risk scoring in their welfare system. In 2010, officials deployed an algorithm that scores and ranks the country’s millions of benefit recipients by their alleged fraud risk. Until now, benefit recipients have had little insight into the risk score assigned to them — but hundreds of thousands have experienced the consequences.</p>
<p>Those flagged as high risk are subject to special investigations where fraud controllers are empowered to visit people’s homes unannounced, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2021/02/20/l-entretien-avec-l-agent-de-la-caf-a-ete-une-humiliation-les-beneficiaires-du-rsa-dans-l-enfer-des-controles_6070648_3224.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">count toothbrushes</a> to guess how many people live there, question their neighbours and scour bank records. Of the more than 100,000 people flagged annually for such investigations, nearly seven in ten are selected because of a high risk score. For vulnerable recipients who struggle to navigate the complex rules of the French social security system, the risk of their benefits being reclaimed or terminated is high — even if they unintentionally committed mistakes.</p>
<p>Use of the social security system in France is widespread and benefits like family subsidies are used by people across the socioeconomic spectrum. We set out to investigate whether there are patterns in which profiles received the highest scores. Our analysis found that the model systematically assigns higher scores to vulnerable people, including single parents, people who struggle to pay bills, and people who receive disability benefits. This includes characteristics that are explicitly protected under French anti-discrimination law and arguably, are what led them to need benefits in the first place.</p>
<section id="section-1">
<h2>Materials &amp; Preparation</h2>
<p>Over the past two years, digital rights groups <em>La Quadrature du Net and Changer de Cap</em> have tirelessly <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/2022/12/23/notation-des-allocataires-febrile-la-caf-senferme-dans-lopacite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned</a> for greater transparency for algorithms deployed in the public sector. In late 2022, they successfully argued in front of France’s Commission for Access to Administrative Documents (CADA) that the CNAF should have to release the source code for previous versions of its risk assessment algorithm. Their own analysis of many of the same materials we received can be found <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/2023/11/27/notation-des-allocataires-lindecence-des-pratiques-de-la-caf-desormais-indeniable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>In June of 2023, Le Monde requested the source code and documentation for the CNAF’s fraud detection model. The CNAF disclosed redacted source code for the current model, which has been deployed nationally since 2020. While most of the variable names in the code were redacted (ie. renamed to “variable_1”, ”variable_2”), ten variables were still visible. It is unclear whether this was intentional.</p>
<p>The agency sent full source code for the models used between 2010 – 2014 and 2014 – 2020 with variable names left unredacted. In addition to disclosing source code, the CNAF also disclosed aggregate statistics from 2020 to today concerning investigations started by their current model.</p>


</section>
<section id="section-2">
<h2>The Models </h2>
<p>The three risk-scoring models disclosed by CNAF are constructed using logistic regression, a relatively simple machine learning algorithm. Similar to other supervised machine learning algorithms, logistic regression combs through datasets in order to learn which characteristics are most predictive of a target (e.g. mistake or note mistake).</p>
<p>The CNAF trains its models on households who were randomly investigated as part of the <em>Paiement à bon droit Fraudes</em> (PBDF), an annual survey. Unlike other models we have investigated, this means that the CNAF’s model is presumably trained on a large, representative training dataset.</p>
<p>In a training manual obtained by <em>Le Monde</em> for the current model, the CNAF writes that its investigations are labelled according to the amount of money the CNAF has overpaid the beneficiary. According to the manual, it decides to train its model to detect monthly overpayments of €600 euros or more that have occurred over a period of at least six months. It justifies this choice of label because it is “neither too rare nor too frequent” and “covers 98% of fraudulent payments.”</p>
<p>All of the three models are written in SAS, a programming language designed for statistical analysis. In order to calculate the risk score, the code first loads a number of variables. Each of the possible values a variable can take on, such as <em>has_children or no_children</em>, is then assigned a coefficient (ie. weight) between -0.81 and +0.89. The coefficients are added to create a raw score between -12.89 and 9.83. Finally, the raw score is run through a squasher function that outputs a probabilistic risk score between 0 and 1, where 1 is the highest risk of fraud. A raw score of 0 corresponds to a risk score of 0.5.</p>
<p>In order to ‘squash’ the raw score, logistic regression models use a sigmoid function. This means that the relationship between the raw score and the risk score is not linear. Rather, the risk score rises steeply towards one at the centre and then levels off as it approaches one.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1782" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1782"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-980x400.png" alt="" width="980" height="400" srcset="https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-980x400.png 980w, https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-300x123.png 300w, https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-768x314.png 768w, https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-1536x628.png 1536w, https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-1500x613.png 1500w, https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot.png 1630w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1782">Sigmoid function where the x-axis is the raw score and the y-axis is the risk score.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This non-linear relationship makes it difficult to quantify the impact of different variables on the raw score. The effect of a variable on a <em>raw score</em> is always the same whereas the effect of a variable on the risk score changes depending on how high or low the risk score is. A variable will have the most effect on the risk score when the raw score is close to zero.</p>
<p>For the purposes of our analysis, we use the raw score whenever we compare the effect of different traits. We use the risk score whenever we want to illustrate how different traits move an individual closer to or further away from the high-risk threshold that flags someone for investigation.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-3">
<h2>Analysis &amp; Results</h2>
<p>Nearly half of France’s population is scored each year by the model. In principle, this means that a wide variety of people are at risk of being flagged for an investigation. We wanted to test which profiles receive high scores in practice and why. For the purposes of our analysis, we focused on the model deployed between 2014 and 2020 because it was the most recent unredacted version — although we also tested the 2010 to 2014 model.</p>
<p>Our analysis looked at all of the 33 variables used by the 2014 to 2020 model, but we were especially interested in testing variables related to a beneficiary’s demographic features and their financial resources. We were further interested in variables relating to characteristics covered by French anti-discrimination law, which prohibits direct or indirect discrimination on the basis of family status, age, disability and “economic vulnerability.”</p>
</section>
<section id="section-4">
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>In response to a request for information, the CNAF released aggregated outcome data on the effectiveness of its model. The data covers the more than 700,000 investigations that have been started by the model since 2019.</p>
<p>Of the households flagged by the model, 35 percent had to repay part of their benefit to the CNAF. This amounts to an average of €821 euros repaid per investigation for a total of approximately €604 million euros since 2019. Seventeen percent of investigations started by the model conclude that the CNAF actually owes money to the beneficiary.</p>
<p>We could not compare the model’s performance against randomly-started investigations from the same timespan. However, a document disclosed by CNAF states that approximately 15 percent of random investigations in the 2016 and 2017 <em>Paiement à bon droit Fraudes</em> survey concluded that a beneficiary owed money to the CNAF.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-5">
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>In order to calculate risk scores, the CNAF’s model uses 33 variables that in total can take on over 100 values. These variables range from the age of a beneficiary’s children to the types of benefits they receive to the number of addresses they have lived at. More than half of the variables relate to the demographics of a beneficiary and their financial resources. The rest relate to their interactions with the CNAF and changes to their address.</p>
<p>When we examined the individual impact of the values these variables can take on, we found stark differences. Generally speaking, variables that capture precarity increase risk scores. You can see Appendix II for the full single variable results.</p>
<p>– For variables related to financial resources, having a high income dramatically reduces a beneficiary’s risk score. Meanwhile, having a low disposable income and receiving benefits for low-income households increase a beneficiary’s risk score.</p>
<p>– For variables related to a beneficiary’s characteristics, being young and receiving disability benefits increase a beneficiary’s risk score.</p>
<p>– For variables related to a beneficiary’s family and relationships, having children, especially if they are older than 18, increases a beneficiary’s risk score. Being divorced and declaring a change to your family situation (e.g. a child moving out, a new partner) dramatically increases a beneficiary’s risk score.</p>


</section>
<section id="section-6">
<h2>Profiles</h2>
<p>After establishing which variables had the most substantial impact on scores, we created profiles — combinations of variables — to see which types of people were especially at risk of being flagged.<br>
We constructed profiles of benefit recipients based on some of the most impactful characteristics from the single variable findings.</p>
<p>For each profile, we kept our variables of interest constant. For example, for our struggling parent profile we set the <em>has children</em> variable to True and their <em>income per household member</em> to the value <em>€577 to €942 euros</em>. See Appendix I to see which variables we kept constant for each profile. We then varied all other variables to calculate the minimum, maximum and average raw score per profile. Finally, each of these was fed through the sigmoid function and converted to a risk score. For a more detailed explanation of how we calculated the average risk score, see Appendix III.</p>
<p>While CNAF’s model is deployed nationally, investigations are carried out by regional CNAF offices. This means that the risk score distribution — and hence high risk cutoff — presumably is different per region. Statistics provided by the CNAF however show that 89 percent of the beneficiaries flagged by the model have a risk of score of 0.6 or higher. We therefore used 0.6 as an approximate high risk cutoff.</p>

<p>We found large disparities in which profiles were more likely to pass the high risk threshold that would leave them flagged for an investigation. A family with stable income has an average risk score of just 0.33. Nearly all other variables would have to be set to values that increase their risk score for them to pass the high risk threshold. Meanwhile, a person who works and receives disability has an average risk score of 0.66, which is already past the high risk threshold.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-7">
<h2>Threshold Effect</h2>
<p>The majority of the variables related to a beneficiary’s behaviour capture their interactions with the social security system over the last 18 months. The values for these variables — as well as other variables — are divided by hard cutoffs. We do not know how these cutoffs were determined, but the result is that small changes in behaviour can impact the risk score in erratic ways.</p>
<p>The variable <em>Months since last email sent to CNAF</em>, for example, can take on three values. If it has been less than two months since the beneficiary has sent an email to the CNAF in the last 18 months, their risk score moves down. If the last email they sent was between 3 and 4 months ago, their score moves up. The minute it has been 5 months, instead of 4 months, since they last sent an email their score again decreases.</p>

<p>We found that the seemingly arbitrary cut-offs used by CNAF’s risk-scoring model could push beneficiaries who would otherwise not be flagged over the high-risk threshold.</p>
<p>A beneficiary with a risk score of 0.52 will not be flagged investigation. But if it has been between 3 and 4 months since they last sent an email to the CNAF, they will suddenly be at risk of being flagged.</p>


</section>
<section id="section-8">
<h2>Limitations </h2>
<p>Obtaining access to runnable code / risk-scoring models is difficult. The materials we acquired enable us to test the model and gain far-reaching insight into how it would score different types of people. Nonetheless, we were not able to access key materials that would have allowed us to carry out deeper analysis.</p>
<p>An important limitation of our approach is that we do not know the relationship between the different variables that we analysed. For example, having a child between 12 and 18 (which increases risk scores) is likely correlated to being above 34 (which decreases risk scores). In practice, this means that certain types of people may receive lower or higher scores than the profiles we constructed suggest.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the limited data we could find on which demographic groups are investigated in general by the CNAF align with our results concerning which groups are more likely to be flagged. An analysis of investigations in 2015 published by the CNAF showed that single parent families were subject to more than double the number of investigations compared to their share in the beneficiary population. The CNAF did not respond to our request for more current statistics.</p>

<p>Another limitation is that we were not able to obtain granular outcome data (ie. whether someone who was flagged by the model had to repay money to the CNAF). In an ideal world, we would have had outcome data broken down by protected categories both inside and outside of the input variables. This would enable us to test whether the model flags women or people of an ethnic background at disproportionate rates. In addition, this would enable us to test whether the different demographic groups flagged by the model actually make more mistakes and compare false positive rates between groups.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-9">
<h2>The CNAF’s Response</h2>
<p>The CNAF did not respond to a detailed list of questions from Lighthouse Reports and <em>Le Monde</em> requesting, among other things, clarification on specific variables and more comprehensive statistics on the beneficiary population. Instead, the CNAF responded with a general statement and agreed to an on-the-record interview.</p>
<p>In its statement, the CNAF claimed that the goal of its risk-scoring model is not to “establish a risk score, but rather to classify files according to their degree of complexity.” It also pointed out that some investigations started by the model conclude that the CNAF actually owes the beneficiary money.</p>
<p>The agency defended the variables it uses in its model, arguing that they are statistically substantiated and are used “without discriminatory intent.” It did not provide evidence to back up its claim that the variables are statistically substantiated. In an interview with <em>Le Monde</em>, CNAF director Nicolas Grivel confirmed that the agency has never audited any of its models for bias or discrimination.</p>
<p>The CNAF wrote that it had been reflecting on its use of algorithms and the “heightened expectations when it comes to the transparent use of data.” It continued that it had convened a multi-disciplinary team of sociologists, data scientists and public policy specialists to examine its use of risk-scoring. The CNAF ended by stating that conclusions of the team are expected in 2024 and will be published as a “contribution to public debate on these important issues.”</p>

		<h3>The Omnichord will be re-produced to commemorate the 70th anniversary of our company.</h3>
		<div id="title2">　<p> In the 1980s, the electronic musical instrument 'Omnichord' gained tremendous popularity among gadget-loving music lovers for its quirky look and tone. We have been receiving requests to resurrect the Omnichord for a long time. And this year, 2023, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of Suzuki Musical Instruments Manufacturing, we will reproduce the Omnichord! It is scheduled to be released around the fall of 2023. We will update the information on this page from time to time. *The photo is the old model OM-27.</p><p> <span><a href="#title"><strong>LATEST NEWS 2023.10.17▼</strong></a></span><br> <img src="https://csj-concierge.com/suzukimusic/uploads/seo/OM-27-1024x7041.jpg"><br>*A photo above is older model, OM-27.</p></div>		</div>
				<div>
		<h3>What is Omnichord</h3><p>
		It was developed as an electronic musical instrument with an automatic accompaniment function (auto bass chord) equipped with a harp sensor. Anyone can easily play chords, including those who are new to musical instruments and those who are less adept with traditional &nbsp;instruments. It is played using multiple chord buttons lined up in the centre and a touch sensitive strum plate on the right. Whilst pressing the chord buttons, tap the plate with your finger or slide up and down to play 4 octave sounds to effectively accompany a song. Not only is it easy to play, but its unique appearance and tone makes it a hidden favorite both in Japan and overseas for artists who want to try something different and for non-musicians who want to play music!		</p></div>
				<div>
		<h3>History of the Omnichord</h3><p>
		Originally development started with a request from an overseas sales company to make an electronic musical instrument like an auto-harp. It started with the electronic musical instrument 'PC-27' and the first Omnichord 'OM-27' was born with improvements to the interface and functions. Since then, as technology has advanced, we have created numerous models through trial and error in adding more chords, timbres, and designs.		</p></div>

		<h3>About the form and size</h3>
		<p><span>NEWS 2023.4.25</span> <img src="https://csj-concierge.com/suzukimusic/uploads/seo/the_new_modelEN.jpg"><br><strong>The form and size have been decided!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;The shape of the new Omnichord is based on the still very popular previous models of the OM-27, OM-36 and OM-84, with the curved shape on the left side of the body. In addition, the overall dimensions are one size smaller than the OM-27, making it a compact size that is easier to carry around. Regarding the OM-27, OM-36 and OM-84, which became the basis for the shape of the new Omnichord, we will introduce a little more information&nbsp; along with the history of Omnichord.</p><p><strong>[New model] Size: 460×250 mm</strong><br><strong>[OM-27] Size: 520 x 280 mm</strong></p><p><strong>OM-27 released in 1981</strong><br>In these days the Omnichord is an electronic musical instrument used by a wide variety of different users, including artists and electronic musical instrument enthusiasts, both in Japan and overseas, but when they first went on sale in Japan, there was the concept of "Let's ignore the fixed and difficult music theory and think more casually”. We aimed to create an electronic musical instrument, using our experience as an educational musical instrument manufacturer that could be used at home, at school, on trains, planes and ideal for adults and children alike. Although it is no longer available for sale, instructional textbooks were also made for those who play Omnichord for the first time.</p><p><img src="https://csj-concierge.com/suzukimusic/uploads/seo/OM-text.jpg"></p><p><strong>About the form</strong><br>The Omnichord is characterized by its streamlined body. According to 'Omnichord Communication Paper No. 1' published in Japan in 1982, this shape seems to express the thinking of a more futuristic musical instrument, with the shape as a motif, symbolizing the form of an overflowing happy tear. The body colour of the OM-27 was brown, red, and ivory. *The image is the colour lineup of the OM-27.</p><p>[OM-27 specifications] Size: 520 x 280 mm Weight: 1.7 kg Body color: Brown, Red, Ivory <br>[OM-36/84 specifications] Size: 520 x 280 mm Weight: 1.4 kg Body color: OM-36 (beige),</p><p>OM-84 (grey, ivory)<br><img src="https://csj-concierge.com/suzukimusic/uploads/seo/OM-27-color.jpg"></p><p><strong>About specifications</strong><br>The Omnichord is the world's first electronic musical instrument with auto-accompaniment, equipped with an auto-harp sensor. Various functions were added to the successor models as technology progressed, but the style of playing by touching the chord buttons and metal strum plates lined up in the centre and being lightweight and easy to carry anywhere was already established from around this time. With the idea that "There's no dream of a fully automatic electronic instrument! Let's just sing the melody!" As a keyword, the OM-27 had a total of 27 chords of Eb, Bb, F, C, G, D, A, E, B Major, Minor, Seventh and the tone is one harp pattern. With the OM-36/84, major seventh and augment had been added, expanding the total to 84 chords. In addition, the OM-84 had two patterns of harp sounds, and a memory function that had enabled the player to record chords. This function was groundbreaking at the time, allowing you to play more freely. *The image is OM-84.</p><p>※1 From “Omnichord Communication Paper No.1” published in 1982.<br><img src="https://csj-concierge.com/suzukimusic/uploads/seo/OM-84small.jpg"></p></div>

Labour income is likely significantly lower, and economic dynamism is weaker – with poorer choice, worse product quality and fewer economic opportunities – than in a counterfactual world where big corporations were less dominant,” it added.</p><p>Some members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have acknowledged that prices rises have risen to boost profits.</p><p>Last year, Isabel Schnabel, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said that “on average, profits have recently been a key contributor to total domestic inflation, above their historical contribution”.</p><p>Jung and the Common Wealth economist Chris Hayes said a tax on the estimated $4tn of excess global profits was needed alongside moves to break up monopolistic practices that allowed firms to exploit their market power.</p><p>Jung said the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/03/ever-higher-interest-rates-wont-solve-the-problem-of-greedflation" data-link-name="in body link"> Bank of England</a> had fallen behind in the debate and needed to “catch up”.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><a href="https://www.lanternbioworks.com/" rel="">Lantern Bioworks</a><span> says they have </span><a href="https://www.luminaprobiotic.com/" rel="">a cure for tooth decay</a><span>. Their product is a genetically modified bacterium which infects your mouth, outcompetes all the tooth-decay-causing bacteria, and doesn’t cause tooth decay itself. If it works, it could make cavities a thing of the past (you should still brush for backup and cosmetic reasons).</span></p><p>I talked to Lantern founder Aaron Silverbook to get an idea of how this works, both in a biological and an economic sense. Aaron was very knowledgeable and forthcoming, although he uses the phrase “YOLO” somewhat more often than most biotech founders. This post isn’t a verbatim interview transcript, just a writeup of what I learned based on his answers. </p><p><em>[Conflict of interest notice: Lantern is mostly rationalists and includes some friends. My wife consulted for them early on. They offered my wife and me free samples (based on her work, not as compensation for writing this post); she accepted, and I’m still debating. Consider this an attempt to spotlight interesting work that people I like are doing, not a hard-hitting investigation.]</em></p><p><strong>1: What is BCS3-L1?</strong></p><p><span>BCS3-L1 (brand name “Lumina”) is a genetically-modified strain of the tooth decay bacterium </span><em>streptococcus mutans.</em></p><p><em>S. mutans</em><span> lives on your teeth and metabolizes any spare sugar that comes its way into the waste product lactic acid. If too much </span><em>s. mutans</em><span> gets together in one place, all the lactic acid dissolves the tooth’s enamel coating, causing cavities.</span></p><p>BCS3-LI has four main genetic modifications:</p><ol><li><p>It produces a weak antibiotic, mutacin-1140, which kills competing oral bacteria.</p></li><li><p>It’s immune to mutacin-1140, so it doesn’t kill itself.</p></li><li><p>It metabolizes sugar through a different chemical pathway that ends in alcohol instead of lactic acid.</p></li><li><p>It lacks a peptide that its species usually uses to arrange gene transfers with other bacteria.</p></li></ol><p>The antibiotic helps it win the Darwinian competition in your mouth to become King Of The Oral Bacteria. The alcohol metabolism means it won’t produce lactic acid (and so won’t cause tooth decay). The peptide knockout prevents it from transferring genes back and forth with other bacteria that might either inactivate it or leak its advantage.</p><p><strong>1.1: Where did this come from? Who invented it?</strong></p><p><span>Professor Jeffrey Hillman of the University of Florida. In 1985, he was surveying the microorganisms on his graduate students’ teeth (as you do). One grad student had an unusual strain of </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> with a natural version of mutations 1 and 2 (it produced mutacin-1140, and was resistant to it). Hillman realized the potential, and spent the next few decades adding mutations 3 and 4 and testing the results. </span></p><p><strong>1.2: So how did it end up with a tiny startup in 2023?</strong></p><p><span>Professor Hillman started a company “Oragenics” and applied for FDA approval. The FDA demanded a study of 100 subjects, all of whom had to be “age 18-30, with removable dentures, living alone and far from school zones”. Hillman wasn’t sure there even </span><em>were </em><span>100 young people with dentures, but the FDA wouldn’t budge from requiring this impossible trial. Hillman gave up and switched to other projects (including </span><a href="https://www.oragenics.com/" rel="">an intranasal COVID vaccine</a><span>!)</span></p><p><span>Aaron heard this story and figured that brash, move-fast-and-break-things Silicon Valley biotech might be able to find an alternative route to commercialization. The strain was off-patent, so he first tried to synthesize it himself from the clues in Hillman’s published papers. When that didn’t work, he </span><a href="https://www.oragenics.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/163/oragenics-enters-into-agreement-with-lantern-bioworks-for" rel="">made a deal</a><span> with Oragenics for 10% of profits in exchange for samples and the full </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/18ZDSe92LgLmS0sUbosvNxByii_1kjnEj" rel="">recipe</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>2: How do you use it?</strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m2SEWL_rrlQLEi1OiD9K5XbO_7RQ8iMX/edit" rel="">To apply</a><span>, you brush your teeth with a special pumice-based product that removes your existing tooth bacteria, then swab it on with a q-tip.</span></p><p>One dose is sufficient; once you use it, it’s in your mouth approximately forever.</p><p><strong>2.1: As users kiss their loved ones, who kiss others in turn, will this spread exponentially and take over the world?</strong></p><p>There was originally some concern about this, but no. </p><p>Remember, the original bacterium was found in the wild, in a random grad student’s mouth forty years ago. There must be thousands of people walking around with various naturally-occurring BCS3-L1-like things. So probably this isn’t a risk for some kind of weird pandemic.</p><p>Existing mouth bacteria have fortified their position and have a strong home field advantage. This is why you need to brush your teeth with the special product to apply Lumina.</p><p><span>Lantern’s safety documents note that couples who kiss constantly do end up with similar oral microbiomes. So maybe </span><em>enough </em><span>kissing - especially kissing just after a dental cleaning when your existing bacteria are at their weakest - could spread the strain accidentally, very slowly. This rate of spread would be comparable to the rate of spread of every other mouth bacterium.</span></p><p><strong>2.2: When a user kisses their newborn baby, will it spread to the baby?</strong></p><p>Okay, this one is true. </p><p>Babies have no existing mouth bacteria, and get theirs from their parents’ kisses. Not necessarily their first kiss as a newborn (newborns have no teeth, and BCS3-L1 needs teeth to live), but their first kiss after teeth grow in. If you get this, you’re probably getting it for your whole future family line.</p><p><strong>2.3: If you wanted to get rid of it, could you?</strong></p><p>Some kind of extreme course of oral antibiotics that nukes everything growing in your mouth would probably eradicate BCS3-L1, but this hasn’t been tested and would have side effects.</p><p><strong>3: Is it dangerous to have bacteria secreting an antibiotic in your mouth? Does this mean you’re on a weak antibiotic all the time?</strong></p><p>There are already bacteria secreting antibiotics in your mouth. Microbes are in constant war with other microbes, and antibiotics are one of their favorite weapons - remember, penicillin comes from a fungus.</p><p>Because bacteria secrete just enough antibiotic to clear their local area, these are tiny quantities, much less than you’d get from taking a medical-grade antibiotic pill. Lantern says the levels of mutacin-1140 dilute to irrelevance “tens of microns” away from the secreting bacteria. In any case, it’s a weak antibiotic that doesn’t survive the digestive tract (Hillman originally hoped to market the antibiotic too, but found it didn’t get absorbed and broke down too quickly). </p><p>Neither the grad student with the original strain nor any of Hillman’s test subjects had any noticeable health issues.</p><p><span>See also Lantern’s </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mDJCTO2QySmQOZQcajYReDCA1MFpKs-EZ5E0VNu50Fo/edit" rel="">Safety Review FAQ</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>3.1: Is it bad to disrupt your normal mouth microbiome?</strong></p><p><span>When talking about BCS3-L1 “taking over” the mouth, this just means it takes over the </span><em>streptococcus mutans</em><span> niche. There are still other bacteria and fungi in the mouth. </span></p><p>The mutacin antibiotic might still disrupt these other bacteria (probably not fungi). But strains like BCS3-L1 already exist in the wild (eg the original grad student), and lots of bacteria and fungi secrete antibiotics, so it doesn’t seem like having mutacin-secreting organisms in your mouth makes you some extreme oral microbiome outlier. </p><p>If you eat a normal Western diet, your mouth microbiome is already pretty far from the design specs, and it’s unclear if using Lumina makes things worse.</p><p><strong>3.2: Will the other bacteria develop resistance to the antibiotic?</strong></p><p>Mutation 4 prevents BCS3-L1 from “leaking” its own resistance. Although in theory other bacteria could develop resistance, mutacin-1140 is a hard antibiotic to develop resistance to, and the other bacteria would have to do it in the short period before BCS3-L1 kills them off and establishes its own home field advantage. In practice, Professor Hillman found that BCS3-L1 remained dominant over many years and nothing developed resistance to it.</p><p>Even if a mutacin-resistant strain does develop in one person’s mouth, it will have a hard time getting to anyone else’s mouth, so widespread immunity is unlikely.</p><p><strong>4: Is it dangerous to have bacteria secreting alcohol in your mouth? Will you get drunk?</strong></p><p>Most people already have some alcohol-secreting bacteria in their bodies. </p><p><span>(there’s a condition called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-brewery_syndrome" rel="">auto-brewery syndrome</a><span> where those bacteria get out of control and produce enough alcohol to make someone drunk. It’s vanishingly rare in real life, but more common </span><a href="https://www.tampaflduilawyer.com/defenses/involuntary-intoxication/auto-brewery-syndrome/" rel="">in the legal system</a><span>: “You gotta believe me, Officer, it was just auto-brewery syndrome!”)</span></p><p><span>The average person has enough of these bacteria in their gut to have a natural blood alcohol level - even after zero drinks - of about 0.1 mg/dl. Under</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mDJCTO2QySmQOZQcajYReDCA1MFpKs-EZ5E0VNu50Fo/edit" rel=""> pessimistic assumptions</a><span>, BCS3-L1 will add another 0.2 mg/dl, bringing the total to 0.3. This is still a pretty normal number that some people have naturally (it would bring the average customer from the ~50th to the ~80th percentile of natural blood alcohol). It’s also far from the usual threshold for feeling tipsy (30 mg/dl) or too drunk to drive (80 mg/dl). </span></p><p>Under more realistic assumptions, the amount of alcohol produced by BCS3-L1 probably isn’t significant even by the very low standards of natural blood alcohol concentrations.</p><p><strong>4.1: Are there some unusual scenarios where this amount of alcohol might matter?</strong></p><p>I don’t think Lantern has studied Breathalyzers. Since the alcohol is directly in your mouth, it might have disproportionate effect on a Breathalyzer compared to alcohol in your blood. I think it’s probably still too low to matter, but this is a wild guess.</p><p><span>There is conjecture that “non-alcoholic steatohepatitis”, a liver disease in which non-alcoholics get the same kind of liver damage that alcoholics usually get, might be associated with endogenous blood alcohol in the high normal range. If I’m understanding </span><a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25956735/" rel="">this paper</a><span> right, it’s probably because the gut produces levels of alcohol consistent with auto-brewery syndrome, the liver goes into overdrive and metabolizes it away (prevents auto-brewery syndrome from developing), but the liver is damaged in the process the same as if it had to go into overdrive to metabolize normal binge drinking. Since BCS3-L1 produces much less alcohol than auto-brewery, I think it wouldn’t cause non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, even though it might produce final blood alcohol levels similar to those associated with the condition.</span></p><p><span>I was originally worried that Lumina might activate Antabuse, an anti-alcoholism drug that prevents drinking by causing a very unpleasant (sometimes dangerous) reaction to ethanol. There are some past cases of Antabuse being activated by really trivial quantities, like the alcohol in a chicken marsala dish or a mouth wash. But no, I think BCS3-L1 is less than this too. Chicken marsala </span><a href="https://www.southernearlychildhood.org/can-kids-eat-chicken-marsala/" rel="">can contain</a><span> several grams of alcohol per serving, but BCS3-L1 probably only produces a few milligrams per day. If you swallow 1/10 of your mouthwash, that’s about 200 mg of alcohol - again, BCS3-L1 is probably only a few milligrams a day. Antabuse usually activates around a BAC of 5 mg/dl; BCS3-L1 only gives you a BAC of about 0.3 mg/dl.</span></p><p>Again, this really is a tiny amount of alcohol.</p><p>There might be other edge cases like these. Lantern offers a $100 bounty to anyone who can come up with one they haven’t thought of yet (and sometimes extra if you’re willing to help them research them).</p><p><strong>4.2: Has anyone tested this in real life?</strong></p><p>As mentioned before, the mutacin-releasing strain (with mutations 1 and 2) exists in the wild and was extensively tested by Professor Hillman.</p><p>The full strain with all four mutations has undergone some testing by Dr. Hillman, but nobody had officially infected themselves with it until two months ago, when Aaron finally synthesized it and tried it on himself. He says he’s usually “a lightweight” as far as alcohol goes, and hasn’t felt any different over the past two months.</p><p>When first infected, BCS3-L1 makes up almost 100% of the microbiome (because you deliberately removed all your other bacteria, then infected yourself with it). Over time, other bacteria creep back in; over an even longer period (years?), BCS3-L1 reclaims lost territory and reaches a steady state. But the point is that Aaron probably has already passed his period of highest BCS3-L1 activity, and felt nothing.</p><figure data-component-name="Image3Dynamic"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 2912w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_4368,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 4368w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png" sizes="100vw" alt="Graph showing bacteria levels starting high, then going down, then going back up." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 2912w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_4368,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 4368w" width="1456"></picture></div></figure><p>My wife infected herself about a month ago, and I haven’t noticed her having worse judgment or becoming more impulsive.

Sell to ordinary people in the US for a few hundred dollars.</p></li></ul><p><span>Lantern spent $400,000 acquiring rights and synthesizing the organism.

So to start, they’ll be selling Lumina in </span><a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prospectus-on-prospera" rel="">Prospera</a><span>, a libertarian charter city in Honduras. Prospera allows the sale of any biotech product under an informed consent rule: as long as the company is open about risks and the patient signs a waiver saying they were informed, people can do what they want.</span></p><p><span>By good luck, Prospera will soon be hosting </span><a href="https://wiki.vitalia.city/" rel="">a two month super-conference</a><span> of biotech and crypto entrepreneurs/enthusiasts. Aaron thinks they sound like the sorts of people who might want an experimental cavity-preventing bacterium and have $20,000 to spend, so he’s hoping to sell at least twenty doses. But also, anyone else who wants the product can go on a medical tourism trip to Prospera and get it in their </span><a href="https://garmclinic.com/" rel="">experimental-treatment clinic</a><span>.</span></p><p>To move beyond the demographic of people willing to fly to Prospera and pay $20,000, Lantern will need FDA permission. The FDA has already set unreachable standards for any drug approval study, so Aaron wants to try a different route.</p><p><span>The FDA has lower standards for probiotics than for drugs. And technically, a bacterium which you take in order to change your natural microbiome is a probiotic. The genetic modifications are no disqualification; a few genetically-modified probiotics have already been approved. Some are almost as creative as Lumina: </span><a href="https://zbiotics.com/" rel="">Zbiotics</a><span> is a genetically engineered </span><em>Bacillus</em><span> species which sits in your stomach and (supposedly; I have not investigated this claim) prevents hangovers by metabolizing alcohol byproducts for you.</span></p><p>Aaron thinks the FDA will most likely see things his way. If that works out, he has to do six months of animal studies (routine, there are companies that handle this) in order to qualify as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) and sell his product as a probiotic supplement. </p><p><strong>5.1: Is it kind of crazy that you can get this approved as a probiotic supplement?</strong></p><div><p><span>If the FDA approves Lumina as safe, would that be the system as designed, or a loophole that works because nobody expected probiotics to be this disruptive? I’m not sure.</span></p><p><span>Do the six months of animal studies involve testing whether the animals get drunk or not? I can’t imagine there is any regulation that animal testers have to do this. But if not, how do they address the most plausible objection to the product? I trust Aaron and am glad he’s found a way to make this happen, but this is a surprising way for the system to work.</span></p></div><p>The FDA does have the option of reviewing their studies and asking additional questions, which might include questions about the drunkenness or other concerns.</p><p><strong>5.2: Can’t people transfer the bacterium among themselves without paying Lantern?</strong></p><p>Yes. The recipient would either have to wait until just after a high-powered teeth-cleaning session at the dentist’s, or research how to give themselves a dentist-quality teeth-cleaning. Then they would find someone who had already bought the bacterium, swab their teeth with a q-tip, and apply it to their own teeth.</p><p><span>(this would risk transferring other salivary pathogens; to avoid this, you could use the more involved process described </span><a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/defying-cavity-lantern-bioworks-faq/comment/44992945" rel="">here</a><span>)</span></p><p>Aaron thinks of this as a mostly altruistic project, and although he wouldn’t mind getting rich, he doesn’t begrudge anyone who is desperate enough to read up on dentistry and swab their friends’ teeth.

<p>Google is dealing with its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/android-14-patches-ransomware-storage-bug-but-some-users-will-lose-data/">second "lost data" fiasco</a> in the past few months. This time, it's Google Drive, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-drive-is-investigating-sync-issues-as-users-complain-of-lost-files/">mysteriously losing files</a> for some people. Google acknowledged the issue on November 27, and a week later, it posted what it called a fix.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel like Google is describing this issue correctly; the company still calls it a "syncing issue" with the Drive desktop app versions 84.0.0.0 through 84.0.4.0. Syncing problems would only mean files don't make it to or from the cloud, and that doesn't explain why people are completely losing files. In the <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606/google-drive-files-suddenly-disappeared-the-drive-literally-went-back-to-condition-in-may-2023?hl=en&amp;sjid=9779374175483664470-NA">most popular</a> issue thread on the Google Drive Community forums, <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246232590">several</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246259260">users</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246980076">describe</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246762363">spreadsheets</a> and documents going missing, which all would have been created and saved in the web interface, not the desktop app, and it's hard to see how the desktop app could affect that. Many users peg "May 2023" as the time documents stopped saving. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246116775">Some say</a> they've never used the desktop app.</p>
<p>Drive has multiple ways of syncing files, which complicates any explanation or diagnosis of what's going on. The most suspect mode in the whole fiasco is the default "file streaming," mode which is actually cloud-first. Files get <em>removed</em> from your computer and stored in the cloud, saving space and leaving only a web link in their place. Perhaps a "syncing" issue could remove files from your computer before uploading (that still doesn't explain the claims of missing web documents, though).</p>
<p>Google still hasn't explained what exactly happened or how it's been fixed, but just reading through these instructions makes the issue sound rather complicated. This isn't just a simple case of fixing this "syncing" issue by shipping a new version and having everyone's files reappear.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/14286582">Google's recovery instructions</a> outline a few ways to attempt to "recover your files." One is via a new secret UI in the Google Drive desktop app version 85.0.13.0 or higher. If you hold shift while clicking on the Drive system tray/menu bar icon, you'll get a special debug UI with an option to "Recover from backups." Google says, "Once recovery is complete, you'll see a new folder on your desktop with the unsynced files named Google Drive Recovery." Google doesn't explain what this does or how it works.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Option No. 2 is surprising: use of the command line to recover files. The new Drive binary comes with flags for '--recover_from_account_backups' and '--recover_from_app_data_path', which tells us a bit about what is going on. When Google first acknowledged the issue, it warned users not to delete or move Drive's app data folder. These flags from the recovery process make it sound like Google hopes your missing files will be in the Drive cache somewhere. Google also suggests trying Windows Backup or macOS Time Machine to find your files.</p>
<p>Google locked the issue thread on the Drive Community Forums at 170 replies before it was clear the problem was solved. It's also marking <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/14286582?sjid=2808826510676647677-NC#recoverui">any additional threads</a> as "duplicates" and locking them. Taking away the space to diagnose the issue and communicate fixes adds to the sense that Google is more interested in PR damage control than helping users. It also doesn't allow people to reply to the "solution" post, so it's hard to evaluate the fix's efficacy since Google shut down the easiest avenues for user feedback and support.</p>
<p>Of the few replies before Google locked the thread, most suggested that Google's fix did not work. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=247228495">One user</a> calls the fix "complete BS," adding, "The “solution” doesn’t work for most people." <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=247231608">Another says,</a> "Google Drive DELETED my files so they are not available for recovery. This "fix" is not a fix!" There are <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246651550">lots</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246762363">of other</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=247203919">reports</a> of the fix not working, and not many that say they got their files back. The idea that Drive would have months-old copies of files in the app data folder is hard to believe.</p>
<p>Drive isn't just a consumer product, it's also aimed a businesses looking for terabytes of file storage, with paid tiers that can be priced into the stratosphere. Drive is a product that will live and die by how much users trust it. Bugs will happen, but I would have expected Google's response to align with normal IT downtime procedures: a status page with constant updates and a full postmortem explaining what went wrong and how Google fixed it. Instead, we got days of silence, locked forum posts, and vague explanations.</p>

For those who don’t know me, I’m a demographer. I study population. And my first love in fantasy was, of course, Middle Earth.</p><p id="89a8">As I’m back in a LOTR kick, I got curious: how many people live in Middle Earth? Being a demographer, I was mainly interested in the data side of things.</p><p id="72d9">Tolkien is frustratingly vague about population. He almost never gives us estimates of settlement sizes, and many of the larger metropolises of Middle Earth (like Pelargir) never actually appear on the page. Sizable armies make frequent appearances, yet because his adventurers almost exclusively traverse the wilds of Middle Earth, we rarely see where those soldiers are coming from.</p><p id="0e80">Nonetheless, devoted fans have attempted to cobble together some numbers. Stephen Wigmore is one of the most prominent attempts. Here are his articles:</p><p id="692c"><a href="http://www.stephenwigmore.com/2012/08/populations-of-middle-earth-lord-of.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Rohan and Gondor</a></p><p id="cd07"><a href="http://www.stephenwigmore.com/2012/08/populations-of-middle-earth-lord-of_19.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Eriador</a></p><p id="9b21"><a href="http://www.stephenwigmore.com/2016/11/populations-of-middle-earth-earliest.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Elves</a></p><p id="7f9c"><a href="http://www.stephenwigmore.com/2016/10/populations-of-middle-earth-how-many.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Battle of Unnumbered Tears</a></p><p id="912f"><a href="http://www.stephenwigmore.com/2016/09/the-population-of-numenor-through-2nd.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Numenor</a></p><p id="ed0b"><a href="http://www.stephenwigmore.com/2015/08/the-population-of-lothlorien.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Lothlorien</a></p><p id="1e75"><a href="http://www.stephenwigmore.com/2013/02/populations-of-middle-earth-lands-of.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The lands of “The Hobbit”</a></p><p id="955c">There have been some other online attempts, but most arrive at a similar place, for one simple reason:</p><p id="7cfb"><strong>Almost every attempt to estimate population in Middle Earth extrapolates from army sizes.</strong></p><p id="b777">This is no surprise since those are some of the only numbers Tolkien <em>does </em>provide and, furthermore, historically, this is also how ancient populations in the real world are often estimated, so there are some credible rules-of-thumb out there.</p><p id="98f1">So, to begin with, I wanted to take a new approach.</p></div><div><div><h2 id="c71c">How Many People COULD Live in Middle Earth?</h2><p id="049e">Let’s start from a novel place: assuming Middle Earth were <em>normal</em>, governed under normal demographic and agricultural rules for a society circa 1200 AD, how many people <em>could </em>survive in the regions we know from Tolkien’s legendarium?</p><p id="7bb5">To do this, I first had to divide Middle Earth into recognizable regions. Here are the regions I use:</p><figure></figure><p id="6a38">Then I had to classify each region according to its population-relevant traits: climate, geography, water access, etc. Then I assigned population densities to each region based on its terrain mixes, with densities drawn from modern scholarly estimates of Medieval population densities. So for example, Belgium and the Netherlands had very high population densities over 100 people per square mile, whereas Mongolia or Scotland had very low, under 4 and sometimes under 1 person per square mile. So, for example, “Minhiriath” (yellowish central west coast) is coded as having about 2/3 of its land potentially arable land, 0% mountains, 14% forest, 5% swamp, 0% steppe, 10% coastal, 5% riparian, and 0% tundra. “Iron Hills” (upper right reddish) on the other hand is 12% arable, 68% mountain, 12% steppe, and 8% riparian. And so on, for every region, making my best guesses.</p><p id="fa6a">Now, an aside, here’s a map of Europe’s borders superimposed on Middle Earth:</p></div><div><p id="c68c">The takeaway here is that <em>my regions are smaller than most European countries</em>. Take a relatively well-defined region like “Minhiriath,” center left. It’s a pretty big chunk of land on Tolkien’s map. And yet, it’s basically the size of Belgium and the Netherlands together, or a small share of England’s Medieval holdings in France. All of Rohan is perhaps the size of Hungary. Gondor is smaller than France, and I split Gondor into several regions. Middle Earth’s polities are pretty modestly sized!</p><p id="a482">We can use the sizes and terrains described above to yield implied population densities. Again, these are <em>not </em>the densities that <em>actually </em>prevail in Middle Earth; they are the densities that <em>would </em>prevail <em>if Middle Earth behaved like Medieval Europe</em>.</p><p id="55cd">Here’s a simpler map of regions with labels:</p><figure></figure><p id="28a5">So, what population densities do we get under these assumptions?</p><p id="8ad7">Here’s a graph:</p></div><div><p id="6fea">The most densely settled part of Middle Earth in this model is Lossarnach around Pelargir, at about 71 per square mile. That’s higher than most actual Medieval countries — but again, Lossarnach is a <em>lot smaller </em>than most countries, so the existence of a small high-density region is plausible. Belfalas, Anorien, Central Gondor, and Ithilien are all rather high. So is Erebor and its environs, as well as Eregion. The surprise contenders here are the Anduin Vale, the Enedwaith, and the western reaches of Eriador towards Lindon. That the Shire is fairly dense is no surprise, nor is Arthedain or Nurn. But Minhiriath also seems fairly dense. In this model, Rhun is slightly more densely settled than Rohan!</p><p id="bb54">Here it is as a map of population densities:</p></div><div><p id="8918">So how many people could live in Middle Earth?</p><p id="d0d6"><strong>It’s reasonable to assume that <em>if Middle Earth were populated in a similar pattern with regards to subsistence resources as Medieval Europe</em>, that Middle Earth could have approximately 26 million people. This is a sharp contrast to prior fan estimates of about 3 million people in northwestern Middle Earth!</strong></p><p id="9926">You can see there’s a pretty significant population center around eastern Gondor in the south, the Anduin Vale, Eregion, and western Arnor. This all fits LOTR lore: Eregion had a large population of humans, Elves, and dwarves at various times, Arnor was once heavily settled, Gondor has always been a major population hub… the only real issue is the Anduin Value. On that I think maybe we just have to assume Tolkien under-described an actually-once-thriving society, or they just faced too-constant of orc rais or something. Meanwhile, the east is clearly less densely settled, giving rise to the more steppe-like culture of Rhun, Khand, the Wainriders, the Balcoth, etc.</p><p id="0a50">But then we have to ask: what do you mean by <em>people? </em>Middle Earth has elves, dwarves, men, hobbits, orcs… who counts for population purposes?</p><p id="c466">My operating assumption here is basically that though hobbits are small, their voracious appetites mean they need similar land-per-Hobbit as humans need. Plus, though they may have high caloric needs, they also live underground, so can use a larger percentage of available land. Likewise, though Elves are immortal and thus can subsist on I suppose little or nothing so could theoretically reach extremely high densities, in practice Elves also have slow reproduction, are leaving for Valinor, and appear to have a preference for uncrowded living, so again, similar density as we would guess from humans seems reasonable.</p><p id="01a3">Dwarves are the only real problem. What do dwarves eat? Can a dwarven city subsist on its own? I’m not sure. In theory dwarves muck about with this kind of calculation because they can turn low-population mountain regions into population centers. But since dwarf populations are quite localized in just Erebor and the Blue Mountains in TA 3019 (the period of the Lord of the Rings), I’m not too worried about this.</p><p id="0929">Orcs… well, we’ll come back to orcs.</p></div></div><div><h2 id="0111">Army Sizes</h2><p id="1972">How big are the armies of Middle Earth? This should help guide us towards how many people <em>actually do</em> live in Middle Earth.</p><p id="4e90">Again, Tolkien is frustratingly vague. But in TA 3019, we can make some guesswork. Minas Tirith, Osgiliath, Rammas Echor, and Cair Andros together are defended by, we are led to believe, fewer than 5,000 full-time professional soldiers and guardsmen. At the muster of Gondor’s fiefs, fewer than 5,000 additional soldiers show up. However, this muster is not a complete muster: we know for example the fiefs of Lebennin, Dol Amroth, and Lossarnach did not send their full musters because they were fending off the corsairs of Umbar. Likewise the fiefdoms in central Gondor, as Aragorn is able to gather men as he goes alongside his undead armies.</p><p id="410f">On the whole, my guess is Gondor’s total muster is around 25–40,000 men. That includes local guardsmen, militia, professional soldiers, household guards, naval marines (Gondor had a navy!), etc. Of those, fewer than 15,000 are actually deployable in an expeditionary force, and that’s before the Siege of Gondor really takes off, dinting their numbers.</p><p id="e812">Rohan we know fielded 18,000 riders a century or two before TA 3019, plus additional infantry raised as militia. Theoden rides to aid Minas Tirith with just 6,000, but that’s because he’s in a hurry not because he only has 6,000. It’s reasonable to suppose Rohan can field maybe 25,000 men at total fighting strength, but nowhere near that much <em>on campaign</em>. As I’ll note below, the true figures for Rohan may be a bit lower.</p><p id="a7bd">At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, there are at least 3 times as may Haradrim riders as riders of Rohan, so 18–20,000, presumably plus additional infantry. Saruman’s army has perhaps 10–15,000 orcs, plus some thousands of Dunlanders.</p><p id="8c8e">Stepping back to TA 2941 at the Battle of Five Armies, we know that Thranduil goes into the field with about 2,000 Elven warriors, and the Iron Hills dwarves show up with under 700 Dwarves. There are a few hundred men of Lake Town in the mix as well. These armies are said to be outnumbered several times by the goblins, suggesting at least 9,000 goblins, perhaps as many as 15,000. Of course, it’s plausible that neither the Dwarves, Elves, or Lake Towners were deploying their whole strength, as none of them anticipated fighting a major set piece battle against an evil army.</p><p id="fdd2">What can we conclude about population from these figures?</p><p id="21d8">Wigmore arrives at somewhat similar guesses about army size as I do. Take Rohan: he suggests 15,000 riders and 20,000 infantry. This is a lot more than I suggest, but the difference is mostly on the infantry side where we both admit there’s a lot of squish. Then he does some multiplication. He assumes that Riders are somewhat equivalent to knights and that the infantry are equivalent to Anglo-Saxon freemen, so this isn’t a census of the male population. He suggests perhaps there are 7 more men per rider, and 3 more men per infantrymen. So, formally, the prime-age male population is:</p><p id="8523">(Riders X 8 ) + (Infantry X 4) = Prime Age Males</p><p id="34b4">That yields 200,000 men. Then he assumes prime-age men are 1/3 of the population (+1/3 prime age women, +1/3 children), yielding 600,000 people in total. In total, that’s a ratio of 16 civilians per soldier.</p><p id="f4dc">How plausible is this?</p><p id="574c">One way to check it would be to look at major battles and wars of the Middle Ages, check army sizes, then compare to populations, to see what typical conversion ratios are. I didn’t do a full census, but just checked a few famous battles:</p><figure></figure><p id="9056">There is nowhere with a ratio as low as 17, and the only close cases are Vikings and Georgia defending itself on its home turf. On average, battlefield armies clock in at about 1 soldier per 60–120 civilians in the supporting population. So if we assume that Rohan as a deployable army of 10,000–20,000 men, and that there will be 60–120 civilians per soldier, that yields a Rohan population of… 600,000 to 2.4 million. For comparison, my geographically based estimate was 819,000. Here’s how these look in a graph:</p><figure></figure><p id="a3bd">So Wigmore’s estimates are at the very low end, and are consistent with Rohan only actually being able to field 10,000 men at the most, and with relatively intense mobilization at that. The geographic data supports the idea of a field army of between 6,800 and 13,000, which to be honest seems about right!</p><p id="08f7">What if we turn to Gondor? Wigmore puts Gondor’s population at perhaps 1 million. The geographic approach puts it at 4 million (excluding Ithilian which I’m assuming is depopulated). And what do we get if we assume an army of between 15,000 and 35,000 with 60–120 civilians per soldier? About 900,000–4.2 million.</p><figure></figure><p id="4f03">Again, Wigmore’s figure is <em>just </em>in the realm of plausibility. The geographic data here implies something on the high end of historic army ratios.</p><p id="49eb">Next we can turn to Thranduil’s realm. We know Thranduil fields at least 2,000 elves in his army; Wigmore suggests 3,000 is a plausible number. He supposes that 1/4 Elven adult males is a warrior, and there are 1.5 times as many women and children as there are adult males (fewer kids due to lower Elven reproduction rate vs. lifespan). That yields 30,000 elves in Mirkwood. But, much of Mirkwood is depopulated! Using Fonstad’s map of Thranduil’s realm, we can guess that Thranduil’s people occupied about 1/6 of northern Mirkwood, so their implied geographic estimate is about 52,000.</p><p id="fbd2">Turning to army sizes, the matter does become complicated. Elderly elves can still fight. The child share of Elven population is extremely small. To be frank, I think we should treat Elves like Vikings or Georgians: they mobilize at a rate of 20–40 civilians per warrior rather than 60–120. Here’s what we get:</p><figure></figure><p id="5d22">Wigmore here seems much too low; even the geographic estimate is too low compared to army ratios. On the other hand, the elves who remain in Middle Earth may be <em>uniquely martial</em>. So, what ratio would we need to have to produce Wigmore’s estimate or the geographic estimate? Well, the ratio of Soldiers to Geographic Estimate is 17, while the ratio of Soldiers to Wigmore Estimate is 10. Were 1/10th of Elves combatants in Thranduil’s realm? Maybe so!</p><p id="1d6f">But if you’re following along here, you can see there may be an argument for an appreciably higher population. In all three areas where we have estimates, Wigmore’s figures seem to be at the very low end. Meanwhile, in the one area we have considerable population, the Shire, Wigmore countenances populations of perhaps 150,000 Hobbits: in TA 1975 the perhaps 20,000 Hobbits of the Shire contribute likely under 200 archers to the host of Earnur against the Witch King, even though the evil is literally at their gates: that’s a ratio of 100:1! But in the Battle of Baywater, there are under 500 Hobbits, perhaps under 400, of perhaps 150,000 Hobbits: a ratio of 300:1 literally in their own backyard!</p><p id="c059">Is it a coincidence that Shire populations are so inflated relative to Hobbit military capabilities? No, for two reasons: first, Hobbits are peacable folk. But more importantly: we <em>actually have detailed descriptions of civilian life in the Shire</em>. One imagines that if Tolkien gave us stories of farmers in Minhiriath, we’d all suppose Minhiriath to be densely populated! In Wigmore’s telling, Hobbits make up perhaps 5% of the total population of northwestern Middle Earth (1 in 20!). In my geographic estimates, they make up just 1.4% (1 in 71). Given that Sauron has apparently <em>not heard of the Shire</em>, Hobbits making up 1–2% of Middle Earth’s population makes quite a lot more sense than 5%.</p></div><div><div><h2 id="2c4b">Toward a Resolution</h2><p id="4186">One key factor my geographic approach does not account for is history. As noted, it suggested 313,000 people in North Mirkwood. That’s because the model had no method for identifying the effect of hordes of demon spiders. Likewise, the model estimates some residents of Dagorlad, Fangorn, the Dead Marshes, and other obviously depopulated areas. More generally, it doesn’t account for the real problem of general structural pressures for depopulation: marauding orcs, plagues, bandits and highwaymen making life miserable in the absence of a functional state, etc.</p><p id="6d5d">So I add one more variable: a depopulation variable. Basically, I take my geographic estimate and then weight it downwards by some depopulation factor. Here are the factors I use:</p></div><div><p id="0885">It’s a bit arbitrary, I know. But in general I have applied depopulation rates which try to push populations closer to army- or Wigmore-estimated numbers, to figure out some kind of consensus figure that incorporates all the available information. In other cases, like for Minhiriath for example, I use depopulation rates based on limited descriptions of the landscape in Tolkien’s work.</p><p id="8473">So, here’s what population densities <em>now </em>look like:</p></div><div><p id="3bda">This yields a total population of northwest Middle Earth of about 7.6 million humans, elves, dwarves, and hobbits. As you can see, much of Middle Earth is extremely sparsely settled. The major population centers become Gondor, Rohan, the Shire, Lothlorien, and Eregor/Dale.</p><p id="6d0b"><em>Updated info from Update 1 here:</em></p><p id="1d54">I initially said there was also a significant population in Minhiriath. I have revised that. When Boromir crosses through Enedwaith, it is utterly depopulated. Tolkien describes it as populated only be wild-men in the western woods of Eryn Vorn. The region once was home to a vast metropolitan shipyard and Vinyalonde/Lond Daer, but that is long since abandoned by TA 3019. The relevant error on my part was categorization: I treated Minhiriath as arable land. But Tolkien is clear Minhiriath is actually <em>forestland</em> that has been logged beyond all recognition for millennia, and then scorched and burnt repeatedly by Sauron. While it once had a bustling population with known urban hubs at Tharbad and Lond Daer, by TA 3019 there has been an epic collapse in Minhiriath’s population. A good analog for this is the collapse of Maya population in the late classic period, when, even before the arrival of Europeans, Maya overpopulation caused a resource crisis which led to a population collapse, which led to the collapse of urban centers, which led to the jungle taking over former farmlands, which led to there never being a population recovery for the Maya. Minhiriath’s case isn’t identical, but it has obvious resonances, so I have pushed its population way down, as also to a lesser extent in Enedwaith.</p><p id="233b"><em>End update</em></p><p id="e923">By the way, for fun, we can instead use Wigmore’s estimates, and then extrapolate from the <em>relative densities</em> he estimates vs. my estimates above to impute similar relative densities for areas Wigmore doesn’t describe, to guesstimate what densities would need to be to give ~3 million residents of Middle Earth. Here it is:</p><figure></figure><p id="d6bc">Now <em>that </em>is a map of some wide-open-spaces! That definitely captures the LOTR movies vibe of totally empty countrysides!</p><p id="b9cc">But I think it’s wrong. Is Rohan really the most densely settled part of Middle Earth? Its biggest urban center, Edoras, as I’ll describe below, is peanuts compared to Minas Tirith (or, likely even moreso, Pelargir). Its landscape is described as far less village-covered than the Shire. I think this map assumes far too much that <em>because a region doesn’t appear in the main story, it is therefore depopulated</em>. Wigmore’s implied population map is basically just a map of population centers observed by the books — it would be foolish to assume that’s actually the entire population of Middle Earth!</p><p id="4971"><strong>The best estimate of human, Elven, Dwarven, and Hobbit populations in Middle Earth is about 7.6 million. </strong><a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@lymanstone/how-many-hobbits-middle-earth-population-by-people-group-60c5c9d0c5b1"><strong>In the next post, I’ll break this down for the four populations.</strong></a></p></div></div><div><h2 id="bdf3">Notes on Minas Tirith, Bree, Edoras, and Lake Town</h2><p id="2465">We only have detailed descriptions of three cities in Middle Earth: Minas Tirith, Lake Town, Edoras, and Bree. I want to take a moment to estimate their population. To do this, I will use their exact dimensions as described in Karen Wynn Fonstad’s fabulous <em>Atlas of Middle Earth</em>, and multiply that by plausible estimates of urban density.</p><p id="9b08">But what is a plausible estimate of urban density?</p><p id="4d79">For that, I use several well-studied medieval population centers: London, Paris, Constantinople, Antioch, etc. Here are some general figures for built up area and population:</p><figure></figure><p id="65ae">So you can see, there’s a LOT of fluctuation, but we are talking pretty routinely about tens of thousands of people per square mile.</p><p id="36b4"><strong>Lake Town</strong></p><p id="4a05">Here’s Fonstad’s map:</p><figure></figure><p id="002a">That yields a total area of Lake Town of about 81,000 square feet. If we assume Bruges-like density since that’s a similar kind of settlement, that gives us…. just 250 people in Lake Town, which we know is wrong, since Lake Town sends at least a few hundred <em>fighting age males</em> to the Battle of Five Armies, and that’s after a dragon attack killing many and with many left behind to rebuild.</p><p id="abe5">If we instead assume that 200 fighters make up Lake Towns “army,” our army ratios give us 12000 to 24000 people in Lake Town, which is <em>way too high. </em>If instead we assume Lake Town sent <em>almost a full census</em> of its fighting-age males to the Battle of Five Armies as a show of force, that gives us about 1500 people in Lake Town, for a density of 413,000 people per square mile.</p><p id="fcd7">On the whole, these numbers don’t work out. Lake Town doesn’t work out rationally, unless you assume there are considerable shoreside settlements (and maybe there are some!). But I think 1500 people in Lake Town and an appreciably bigger overall settlement are reasonable guesses. Wigmore puts it something like 500–700, but that makes hash of the one reported army size.</p><h2 id="9b18">Bree and Breeland</h2><p id="2195">When the Hobbits arrive in Bree, how many people are there in that town?</p><p id="db48">Well, here’s Fonstad’s representation of Bree and Breeland (which includes the towns of Archet, Comb, and Staddle):</p><figure></figure><p id="8567">Tolkien says there are at least 100 “stone houses of the big folk.” At a reasonable family size per house of 6, that gives you 600 humans in stone houses. Assuming a similar Hobbit population, that gives you 1200 people. But then you have to consider there may have been additional houses which weren’t stone! It’s unclear if Tolkien meant to say only 100 houses <em>in total</em>. If we take Fonstad’s map as gospel, the built-up area of Bree (about 1/2 the area instead the hedge, dike, and hill) is about 0.6 square miles. Using the population density of Florence, another inland settlement in a hilly area that in the medieval period was not built out to its walls, that would give us about 4500 people in Bree. If we then use Fonstad’s relative areas of Bree, Archet, Coomb, and Staddle, and assume 20% lower density in the outlying settlements, we get 1400 more people in Breeland, for about 6,000 peope in Breeland total.</p><p id="a846">But maybe we’ve overestimated Bree’s density. If we cut density in half, we end up at 3,000 people in all Breeland, of which 2250 in Bree proper. I think estimating Breeland at 3,000–6,000 is reasonable. It’s the largest settlement in the region, and if we take all of my designated Arthedain region to have about 190,000 people in the whole area, a largest settlement of 6,000 is plausible. Medieval Europe was <em>much </em>more urbanized than Arthedain, and had about 10% of the population in “urban” areas over 5,000 people. If we assume Bree to be the only such center, at 6,000, that makes 5% of the population in “urban” centers. At 3,000, it’s 2.5%. Neither of these seems crazy to me, though I’m biased towards maybe 3,000–4,000 people in Breeland.</p><h2 id="a674">Minas Tirith</h2><p id="05c0">In Minas Tirith we finally come to one of the real urban centers of Middle Earth. Here’s Fonstad’s map:</p><figure></figure><p id="2f32">These measurements put the total square footage of Minas Tirith at just around 1 square mile.</p><p id="2aec">What density should we apply to this?</p><p id="06fd">Well, I think we have a near perfect match. Here’s a map of Antioch:</p><figure></figure><p id="19f4">A fortress, garrison city between a river and a mountain. Also, Wigmore notes that Tolkien seems to have explicitly modeled a lot of Gondor on the Byzantines: it’s possible part of the inspiration for Minas Tirith actually came from Antioch! Certainly the Siege of Gondor proceeds with remarkable similarity to the crusader siege of Antioch in many regards.</p><p id="5080">So I take Antioch’s 1095 density of about 40,000 people per built-up mile to apply to Minas Tirith, yielding a population ultimately of around 42,000 people in Minas Tirith. This yields the idea that Minas Tirith can durably maintain 300–800 professional soldiers from its own resources, which is nice since the conventional figures in the fandom for the Minas Tirith Citadel Guards is around 250–1000. So a city of 40,000 Gondorians seems about right from what we know of Minas Tirith’s local military capacity.</p><p id="1229">Now, this does put about 20% of Anorien’s population in one big city, an area of concern. But I think we can justify this on historic grounds: Gondor’s population really <em>had </em>concentrated in a few defensible areas by TA 3019! Minas Tirith was the consolidated descendants of refugees of Minas Ithil Osgiliath, Ithilien, and northern Anorien. High threat from violence does tend to generate population concentration in defensible areas.</p><p id="a10b">So I think 42,000 people in Minas Tirith is a credible estimate. Of course, by the Siege of Gondor, most residents had been evacuated southwards to safer places, so the city as we see it in <em>Return of the King</em> is not at full population.</p><h2 id="84be">Edoras</h2><p id="3d09">Finally, we come to Edoras. Here’s Fonstad’s map:</p><figure></figure><p id="e881">This gives us a city of about 0.3 square miles. Again, I think Antioch is a good comparison for a steep hilly fortress town which also serves as a military site and administrative capitol. This gives us about 12,000 people in Edoras. That puts about 2% of Rohan’s population in an urban settlement (assuming there are no others over 5,000?), which is a bit low, but if we assume that the Rohirrim prefer to live with lots of pastureland and that many are pastoralists, it makes sense.</p><p id="f282">So, final verdicts:</p><p id="7d32"><strong>Lake Town-</strong> Maybe 1000–1500 people, but the settlement has gotta be a bit bigger than Tolkien lets on</p><p id="3c07"><strong>Breeland- </strong>3,000–4,000 men and hobbits combined</p><p id="0ff8"><strong>Minas Tirith-</strong> 42,000 inside the walls, and more out in the Pelennor</p><p id="7af4"><strong>Edoras-</strong> 12,000 inside the walls, and plausible tons of farmsteads within a few hours ride</p></div></div></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://danluu.com/p95-skill/">https://danluu.com/p95-skill/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38560345">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Reaching 95%-ile isn't very impressive because it's not that hard to do. I think this is one of my most ridiculable ideas. It doesn't help that, when stated nakedly, that sounds elitist. But I think it's just the opposite: most people can become (relatively) good at most things.</p> <p>Note that when I say 95%-ile, I mean 95%-ile among people who participate, not all people (for many activities, just doing it at all makes you 99%-ile or above across all people). I'm also not referring to 95%-ile among people who practice regularly. The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_weird_trick_advertisements">one weird trick</a>" is that, for a lot of activities, being something like 10%-ile among people who practice can make you something like 90%-ile or 99%-ile among people who participate.</p> <p>This post is going to refer to specifics since <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/926493613097439232">the discussions I've seen about this are all in the abstract</a>, which turns them into Rorschach tests. For example, Scott Adams has a widely cited post claiming that it's better to be a generalist than a specialist because, to become "extraordinary", you have to either be "the best" at one thing or 75%-ile at two things. If that were strictly true, it would surely be better to be a generalist, but that's of course exaggeration and it's possible to get a lot of value out of a specialized skill without being "the best"; since the precise claim, as written, is obviously silly and the rest of the post is vague handwaving, discussions will inevitably devolve into people stating their prior beliefs and basically ignoring the content of the post.</p> <p>Personally, in every activity I've participated in where it's possible to get a rough percentile ranking, people who are 95%-ile constantly make mistakes that seem like they should be easy to observe and correct. "Real world" activities typically can't be reduced to a percentile rating, but achieving what appears to be a similar level of proficiency seems similarly easy.</p> <p>We'll start by looking at Overwatch (a video game) in detail because it's an activity I'm familiar with where it's easy to get ranking information and observe what's happening, and then we'll look at some "real world" examples where we can observe the same phenomena, although we won't be able to get ranking information for real world examples<sup id="fnref:S"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:S">1</a></sup>.</p> <h3 id="overwatch">Overwatch</h3> <p>At 90%-ile and 95%-ile ranks in Overwatch, the vast majority of players will pretty much constantly make basic game losing mistakes. These are simple mistakes like standing next to the objective instead of on top of the objective while the match timer runs out, turning a probable victory into a certain defeat. See the attached footnote if you want enough detail about specific mistakes that you can decide for yourself if a mistake is "basic" or not<sup id="fnref:O"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:O">2</a></sup>.</p> <p>Some reasons we might expect this to happen are:</p> <ol> <li>People don't want to win or don't care about winning</li> <li>People understand their mistakes but haven't put in enough time to fix them</li> <li>People are untalented</li> <li>People don't understand how to spot their mistakes and fix them</li> </ol> <p>In Overwatch, you may see a lot of (1), people who don’t seem to care about winning, at lower ranks, but by the time you get to 30%-ile, it's common to see people indicate their desire to win in various ways, such as yelling at players who are perceived as uncaring about victory or unskilled, complaining about people who they perceive to make mistakes that prevented their team from winning, etc.<sup id="fnref:A"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:A">3</a></sup>. Other than the occasional troll, it's not unreasonable to think that people are generally trying to win when they're severely angered by losing.</p> <p>(2), not having put in time enough to fix their mistakes will, at some point, apply to all players who are improving, but if you look at the median time played at 50%-ile, people who are stably ranked there have put in hundreds of hours (and the median time played at higher ranks is higher). Given how simple the mistakes we're discussing are, not having put in enough time cannot be the case for most players.</p> <p>A common complaint among low-ranked Overwatch players in Overwatch forums is that they're just not talented and can never get better. Most people probably don't have the talent to play in a professional league regardless of their practice regimen, but when you can get to 95%-ile by fixing mistakes like "not realizing that you should stand on the objective", you don't really need a lot of talent to get to 95%-ile.</p> <p>While (4), people not understanding how to spot and fix their mistakes, isn't the only other possible explanation<sup id="fnref:D"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:D">4</a></sup>, I believe it's the most likely explanation for most players. Most players who express frustration that they're stuck at a rank up to maybe 95%-ile or 99%-ile don't seem to realize that they could drastically improve by observing their own gameplay or having someone else look at their gameplay.</p> <p>One thing that's curious about this is that Overwatch makes it easy to spot basic mistakes (compared to most other activities). After you're killed, the game shows you how you died from the viewpoint of the player who killed you, allowing you to see what led to your death. Overwatch also records the entire game and lets you watch a replay of the game, allowing you to figure out what happened and why the game was won or lost. In many other games, you'd have to set up recording software to be able to view a replay.</p> <p>If you read Overwatch forums, you'll see a regular stream of posts that are basically "I'm SOOOOOO FRUSTRATED! I've played this game for 1200 hours and I'm still ranked 10%-ile, [some Overwatch specific stuff that will vary from player to player]". Another user will inevitably respond with something like "we can't tell what's wrong from your text, please post a video of your gameplay". In the cases where the original poster responds with a recording of their play, people will post helpful feedback that will immediately make the player much better if they take it seriously. If you follow these people who ask for help, you'll often see them ask for feedback at a much higher rank (e.g., moving from 10%-ile to 40%-ile) shortly afterwards. It's nice to see that the advice works, but it's unfortunate that so many players don't realize that watching their own recordings or posting recordings for feedback could have saved 1198 hours of frustration.</p> <p>It appears to be common for Overwatch players (well into 95%-ile and above) to:</p> <ul> <li>Want to improve</li> <li>Not get feedback</li> <li>Improve slowly when getting feedback would make improving quickly easy</li> </ul> <p>Overwatch provides the tools to make it relatively easy to get feedback, but people who very strongly express a desire to improve don't avail themselves of these tools.</p> <h3 id="real-life">Real life</h3> <p>My experience is that other games are similar and I think that "real life" activities aren't so different, although there are some complications.</p> <p>One complication is that real life activities tend not to have a single, one-dimensional, objective to optimize for. Another is that what makes someone good at a real life activity tends to be poorly understood (by comparison to games and sports) even in relation to a specific, well defined, goal.</p> <p>Games with rating systems are easy to optimize for: your meta-goal can be to get a high rating, which can typically be achieved by increasing your win rate by fixing the kinds of mistakes described above, like not realizing that you should step onto the objective. For any particular mistake, you can even make a reasonable guess at the impact on your win rate and therefore the impact on your rating.</p> <p>In real life, if you want to be (for example) "a good speaker", that might mean that you want to give informative talks that help people learn or that you want to give entertaining talks that people enjoy or that you want to give keynotes at prestigious conferences or that you want to be asked to give talks for $50k an appearance. Those are all different objectives, with different strategies for achieving them and for some particular mistake (e.g., spending 8 minutes on introducing yourself during a 20 minute talk), it's unclear what that means with respect to your goal.</p> <p>Another thing that makes games, at least mainstream ones, easy to optimize for is that they tend to have a lot of aficionados who have obsessively tried to figure out what's effective. This means that if you want to improve, unless you're trying to be among the top in the world, you can simply figure out what resources have worked for other people, pick one up, read/watch it, and then practice. For example, if you want to be 99%-ile in a trick-taking card game like bridge or spades (among all players, not subgroups like "ACBL players with masterpoints" or "people who regularly attend North American Bridge Championships"), you can do this by:</p> <ul> <li>learning the basics of the game</li> <li>reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2sUtmsk">a beginner book on cardplay</a></li> <li>practicing applying the material</li> </ul> <p>If you want to become a good speaker and you have a specific definition of “a good speaker” in mind, there still isn't an obvious path forward. Great speakers will give directly contradictory advice (e.g., avoid focusing on presentation skills vs. practice presentation skills). Relatively few people obsessively try to improve and figure out what works, which results in a lack of rigorous curricula for improving. However, this also means that it's easy to improve in percentile terms since <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1442945072144678914">relatively few people are trying to improve at all</a>.</p> <p>Despite all of the caveats above, my belief is that it's easier to become relatively good at real life activities relative to games or sports because there's so little delibrate practice put into most real life activities. Just for example, if you're a local table tennis hotshot who can beat every rando at a local bar, when you challenge someone to a game and they say "sure, what's your rating?" you know you're in shellacking by someone who can probably beat you while playing with a shoe brush. You're probably 99%-ile, but someone with no talent who's put in the time to practice the basics is going to have a serve that you can't return as well as be able to kill any shot a local bar expert is able to consitently hit. In most real life activities, there's almost no one who puts in a level of delibrate practice equivalent to someone who goes down to their local table tennis club and practices two hours a week, let alone someone like a top pro, who might seriously train for four hours a day.</p> <p>To give a couple of concrete examples, I helped <a href="http://blog.leahhanson.us/speaking.html">Leah</a> prepare for talks from 2013 to 2017. The first couple practice talks she gave were about the same as you'd expect if you walked into a random talk at a large tech conference. For the first couple years she was speaking, she did something like 30 or so practice runs for each public talk, of which I watched and gave feedback on half. Her first public talk was (IMO) well above average for a talk at a large, well regarded, tech conference and her talks got better from there until she stopped speaking in 2017.</p> <p>As we discussed above, this is more subjective than game ratings and there's no way to really determine a percentile, but if you look at how most people prepare for talks, it's not too surprising that Leah was above average. At one of the first conferences she spoke at, the night before the conference, we talked to another speaker who mentioned that they hadn't finished their talk yet and only had fifteen minutes of material (for a forty minute talk). They were trying to figure out how to fill the rest of the time. That kind of preparation isn't unusual and the vast majority of talks prepared like that aren't great.</p> <p>Most people consider doing 30 practice runs for a talk to be absurd, a totally obsessive amount of practice, but I think Gary Bernhardt has it right when he says that, if you're giving a 30-minute talk to a 300 person audience, that's 150 person-hours watching your talk, so it's not obviously unreasonable to spend 15 hours practicing (and 30 practice runs will probably be less than 15 hours since you can cut a number of the runs short and/or repeatedly practice problem sections). One thing to note that this level of practice, considered obessive when giving a talk, still pales in comparison to the amount of time a middling table tennis club player will spend practicing.</p> <p>If you've studied pedagogy, you might say that the help I gave to Leah was incredibly lame. It's known that having laypeople try to figure out how to improve among themselves is among the worst possible ways to learn something, good instruction is more effective and having a skilled coach or teacher give one-on-one instruction is more effective still<sup id="fnref:C"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:C">5</a></sup>. That's 100% true, my help was incredibly lame. However, most people aren't going to practice a talk more than a couple times and many won't even practice a single time (I don't have great data proving this, this is from informally polling speakers at conferences I've attended). This makes Leah's 30 practice runs an extraordinary amount of practice compared to most speakers, which resulted in a relatively good outcome even though we were using one of the worst possible techniques for improvement.</p> <p>My writing is another example. I'm not going to compare myself to anyone else, but my writing improved dramatically the first couple of years I wrote this blog just because I spent a little bit of effort on getting and taking feedback.</p> <p>Leah read one or two drafts of almost every post and gave me feedback. On the first posts, since neither one of us knew anything about writing, we had a hard time identifying what was wrong. If I had some awkward prose or confusing narrative structure, we'd be able to point at it and say "that looks wrong" without being able to describe what was wrong or suggest a fix. It was like, in the era before spellcheck, when you misspelled a word and could tell that something was wrong, but every permutation you came up with was just as wrong.</p> <p>My fix for that was to hire a professional editor whose writing I respected with the instructions "I don't care about spelling and grammar fixes, there are fundamental problems with my writing that I don't understand, please explain to me what they are"<sup id="fnref:F"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:F">6</a></sup>. I think this was more effective than my helping Leah with talks because we got someone who's basically a professional coach involved. An example of something my editor helped us with was giving us a vocabulary we could use to discuss structural problems, the way <a href="https://amzn.to/2GPPmYE">design patterns</a> gave people a vocabulary to talk about OO design.</p> <h3 id="back-to-this-blog-s-regularly-scheduled-topic-programming">Back to this blog's regularly scheduled topic: programming</h3> <p>Programming is similar to the real life examples above in that it's impossible to assign a rating or calculate percentiles or anything like that, but it is still possible to make significant improvements relative to your former self without too much effort by getting feedback on what you're doing.</p> <p>For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/926492239081197569">here's one thing Michael Malis did</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>One incredibly useful exercise I’ve found is to watch myself program. Throughout the week, I have a program running in the background that records my screen. At the end of the week, I’ll watch a few segments from the previous week. Usually I will watch the times that felt like it took a lot longer to complete some task than it should have. While watching them, I’ll pay attention to specifically where the time went and figure out what I could have done better. When I first did this, I was really surprised at where all of my time was going.</p> <p>For example, previously when writing code, I would write all my code for a new feature up front and then test all of the code collectively. When testing code this way, I would have to isolate which function the bug was in and then debug that individual function. After watching a recording of myself writing code, I realized I was spending about a quarter of the total time implementing the feature tracking down which functions the bugs were in! This was completely non-obvious to me and I wouldn’t have found it out without recording myself. Now that I’m aware that I spent so much time isolating which function a bugs are in, I now test each function as I write it to make sure they work. This allows me to write code a lot faster as it dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to debug my code.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the past, I've spent time figuring out where time is going when I code and basically saw the same thing as in Overwatch, except instead of constantly making game-losing mistakes, I was constantly doing pointlessly time-losing things. Just getting rid of some of those bad habits has probably been at least a 2x productivity increase for me, pretty easy to measure since fixing these is basically just clawing back wasted time. For example, I noticed how I'd get distracted for N minutes if I read something on the internet when I needed to wait for two minutes, so I made sure to keep a queue of useful work to fill dead time (and if I was working on something very latency sensitive where I didn't want to task switch, I'd do nothing until I was done waiting).</p> <p>One thing to note here is that it's important to actually track what you're doing and not just guess at what you're doing. When I've recorded what people do and compare it to what they think they're doing, these are often quite different. It would generally be considered absurd to operate a complex software system without metrics or tracing, but it's normal to operate yourself without metrics or tracing, even though you're much more complex and harder to understand than the software you work on.</p> <p><a href="https://danluu.com/hn-comments/#what-makes-engineers-productive-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-5496914">Jonathan Tang has noted that choosing the right problem dominates execution speed</a>. I don't disagree with that, <a href="https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/">but doubling execution speed is still decent win that's independent of selecting the right problem to work on</a> and I don't think that discussing how to choose the right problem can be effectively described in the abstract and the context necessary to give examples would be much longer than the already too long Overwatch examples in this post, maybe I'll write another post that's just about that.</p> <p>Anyway, this is sort of an odd post for me to write since I think that culturally, we care a bit too much about productivity in the U.S., especially in places I've lived recently (NYC &amp; SF). But at a personal level, higher productivity doing work or chores doesn't have to be converted into more work or chores, it can also be converted into more vacation time or more time doing whatever you value.</p> <p>And for games like Overwatch, I don't think improving is a moral imperative; there's nothing wrong with having fun at 50%-ile or 10%-ile or any rank. But in every game I've played with a rating and/or league/tournament system, a lot of people get really upset and unhappy when they lose even when they haven't put much effort into improving. If that's the case, why not put a little bit of effort into improving and spend a little bit less time being upset?</p> <h3 id="some-meta-techniques-for-improving">Some meta-techniques for improving</h3> <ul> <li>Get feedback and practice <ul> <li>Ideally from an expert coach but, if not, this can be from a layperson or even yourself (if you have some way of recording/tracing what you're doing)</li> </ul></li> <li>Guided exercises or exercises with solutions <ul> <li>This is very easy to find in books for "old" games, like chess or Bridge.</li> <li>For particular areas, you can often find series of books that have these, e.g., in math, books in the Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series (SUMS) tend to have problems with solutions</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Of course, these aren't novel ideas, e.g., Kotov's series of books from the 70s, Think like a Grandmaster, Play Like a Grandmaster, Train Like a Grandmaster covered these same ideas because these are some of the most obvious ways to improve.</p> <h3 id="appendix-other-most-ridiculable-ideas">Appendix: other most ridiculable ideas</h3> <p>Here are the ideas I've posted about that were the most widely ridiculed at the time of the post:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">It's not uncommon for programmers at trendy tech companies to make $350k/yr or more</a> (2015, stated number was $250k/yr at the time)</li> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/monorepo/">Monorepos can be reasonable</a> (2015)</li> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/cpu-bugs/">We should expect to see a lot more CPU bugs</a> (2016)</li> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">Markets are not incompatible with discrimination</a> (2014)</li> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">Computers are getting slower in some ways</a> (2017)</li> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/">Empirical evidence on the benefit of types is almost non-existent</a> (2014)</li> <li>It's reasonable to write technical posts on a subject that avoid domain-specific terminology</li> </ul> <p>My posts on compensation have the dubious distinction of being the posts most frequently called out both for being so obvious that they're pointless as well as for being laughably wrong. I suspect they're also the posts that have had the largest aggregate impact on people -- I've had a double digit number of people tell me one of the compensation posts changed their life and they now make $x00,000/yr more than they used to because they know it's possible to get a much higher paying job and I doubt that I even hear from 10% of the people who make a big change as a result of learning that it's possible to make a lot more money.</p> <p>When I wrote my first post on compensation, in 2015, I got ridiculed more for writing something obviously wrong than for writing something obvious, but the last few years things have flipped around. I still get the occasional bit of ridicule for being wrong when some corner of Twitter or a web forum that's well outside the HN/reddit bubble runs across my post, but the ratio of “obviously wrong” to “obvious” has probably gone from 20:1 to 1:5.</p> <p>Opinions on monorepos have also seen a similar change since 2015. Outside of some folks at big companies, monorepos used to be considered obviously stupid among people who keep up with trends, but this has really changed. Not as much as opinions on compensation, but enough that I'm now a little surprised when I meet a hardline anti-monorepo-er.</p> <p>Although it's taken longer for opinions to come around on CPU bugs, that's probably the post that now gets the least ridicule from the list above.</p> <p>That markets don't eliminate all discrimination is the one where opinions have come around the least. Hardline "all markets are efficient" folks aren't really convinced by academic work like <a href="https://amzn.to/2Or7Z9k">Becker's The Economics of Discrimination</a> or summaries like <a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">the evidence laid out in the post</a>.</p> <p>The posts on computers having higher latency and the lack of empirical evidence of the benefit of types are the posts I've seen pointed to the most often to defend a ridiculable opinion. I didn't know when I started doing the work for either post and they both happen to have turned up evidence that's the opposite of the most common loud claims (there's very good evidence that advanced type systems improve safety in practice and of course computers are faster in every way, people who think they're slower are just indulging in nostalgia). I don't know if this has changed many opinion. However, I haven't gotten much direct ridicule for either post even though both posts directly state a position I see commonly ridiculed online. I suspect that's partially because both posts are empirical, so there's not much to dispute (though the post on discrimnation is also empirical, but it still gets its share of ridicule).</p> <p>The last idea in the list is more meta: no one directly tells me that I should use more obscure terminology. Instead, I get comments that I must not know much about X because I'm not using terms of art. Using terms of art is a common way to establish credibility or authority, but that's something I don't really believe in. Arguing from authority doesn't tell you anything; adding needless terminology just makes things more difficult for readers who aren't in the field and are reading because they're interested in the topic but don't want to actually get into the field.</p> <p>This is a pretty fundamental disagreement that I have with a lot of people. Just for example, I recently got into a discussion with an authority who insisted that it wasn't possible for me to reasonably disagree with them (I suggested we agree to disagree) because they're an authority on the topic and I'm not. It happens that I worked on the formal verification of a system very similar to the system we were discussing, but I didn't mention that because I don't believe that my status as an authority on the topic matters. If someone has such a weak argument that they have to fall back on an infallible authority, that's usually a sign that they don't have a well-reasoned defense of their position. This goes double when they point to themselves as the infallible authority.</p> <p>I have about 20 other posts on stupid sounding ideas queued up in my head, but I mostly try to avoid writing things that are controversial, so I don't know that I'll write many of those up. If I were to write one post a month (much more frequently than my recent rate) and limit myself to 10% posts on ridiculable ideas, it would take 16 years to write up all of the ridiculable ideas I currently have.</p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1a-lhjmfPw">Skyline</a>: 99%-ile isn't that good</li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1292574538912456707">James Clear</a>: 90%-ile isn't that good</li> <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193015/http://jinfiesto.posterous.com/how-to-seem-good-at-everything-stop-doing-stu">Josh Infiesto</a>: 80%-ile isn't that good</li> <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/personal-best">Atul Gawande</a>: coaching / feedback is powerful and underrated</li> </ul> <p><small>Thanks to Leah Hanson, Hillel Wayne, Robert Schuessler, Michael Malis, Kevin Burke, Jeremie Jost, Pierre-Yves Baccou, Veit Heller, Jeff Fowler, Malte Skarupe, David Turner, Akiva Leffert, Lifan Zeng, John Hergenroder, Wesley Aptekar-Cassels, Chris Lample, Julia Evans, Anja Boskovic, Vaibhav Sagar, Sean Talts, Emil Sit, Ben Kuhn, Valentin Hartmann, Sean Barrett, Kevin Shannon, Enzo Ferey, Yuri Vishnevsky, and an anonymous commenter for comments/corrections/discussion.</small></p>   </div></div>]]></description>

At the time, their main source of leverage was a plan to all quit and join Altman and President Greg Brockman at a new AI group within Microsoft.</p><p><span></span><span><p>The employees didn't have to go through with this in the end. Altman and Brockman and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ilya-sutskever-not-at-openai-party-celebrating-sam-altman-ceo-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>most of the C-suite</u></a> are back at OpenAI. New board members are in place, with additions coming.</p><p>Now, the truth behind that core Microsoft threat is coming out. Some Microsoft insiders told BI that hiring everyone from OpenAI was seen internally as a last resort. And for at least some of those OpenAI employees, there's relief that they don't actually have to go work for Microsoft.</p><p>"It was sort of a bluff that ultimately worked," explained one former employee who's still in touch with current staffers. This person, and others who spoke with BI, asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.</p><p>One current OpenAI employee admitted that, despite nearly everyone on staff signing up to follow Altman out the door, "No one wanted to go to Microsoft." This person called the company "the biggest and slowest" of all the major tech companies — the exact opposite of how OpenAI employees see their startup.</p><h2>Pressure to sign</h2><p>Given the absence of interest in joining Microsoft, many OpenAI employees "felt pressured" to sign the open letter, the employee admitted. The letter itself was drafted by a group of longtime staffers who have the most clout and money at stake with years of industry standing and equity built up, as well as higher pay. They began calling other staffers late on Sunday night, urging them to sign, the employee explained.</p><p>"We all left these big corporations to move fast and build exciting things," the employee said. "The bureaucracy of something as big as Microsoft is soul crushing."</p><p>While OpenAI staffers would have followed through with their threat and joined Microsoft, they probably would have left at the first opportunity for other AI startups such as Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Cohere, the employee added.</p><h2>Looking down on legacy tech</h2><p>Another former OpenAI employee agreed, saying people working at the San Francisco-based startup "look down on what they consider legacy companies" and "see themselves as innovators who are radically changing the world."</p><p>OpenAI products like ChatGPT and DALL-E kicked off the current <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-impact-big-surprise-openai-meta-yann-lecun-ai-chatbot-2023-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>AI craze in tech</u></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-companies-that-have-raised-at-least-50-million-this-year-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>investing</u></a>. The startup's avowed goal is artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which it defines as technology that can "outperform humans at most economically valuable work." It's a lofty goal well outside the norm for Microsoft, and some people at OpenAI think the enterprise software giant would not have been capable of continuing the mission.</p><p>"Even though we have a partnership with Microsoft, internally, we have no respect for their talent bar," the current OpenAI employee told BI. "It rubbed people the wrong way to entertain being managed by them."</p><p>OpenAI declined to comment, while Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.</p><h2>Money, the great motivator</h2><p>Beyond the culture clash between the two companies, there was another important factor at play for OpenAI employees: money. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-unique-compensation-package-among-tech-companies-ppu-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>Lots of it</u></a> was set to disappear before their eyes if OpenAI were to suddenly collapse under a mass exodus of staff.</p><p>"Sam Altman is not the best CEO, but millions and millions of dollars and equity are at stake," the current OpenAI employee said.</p><p>Not only are OpenAI employees paid very well in cash, with base salaries typically starting at $300,000, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-unique-compensation-package-among-tech-companies-ppu-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>typical equity package</u></a> is worth $2 million over four years, and much more for some workers.</p><h2>A laughable idea</h2><p>Microsoft agreed to hire all OpenAI employees at their same level of compensation, but this was only a verbal agreement in the heat of the moment.</p><p>Another OpenAI employee openly laughed at the idea that Microsoft would have paid departing staffers for the equity they would have lost by following Altman.</p><p>A scheduled tender offer, which was about to let employees sell their existing vested equity to outside investors, would have been canceled. All that equity would have been worth "nothing," this employee said.</p><p>The former OpenAI employee estimated that, of the hundreds of people who signed the letter saying they would leave, "probably 70% of the folks on that list were like, 'Hey, can we, you know, have this tender go through?'"</p><p>Thanks to the success of their big bluff, Altman is back and the tender offer is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/openai-tender-offer-on-track-despite-leadership-fracas-sources.html#:~:text=The%20tender%20offer%20will%20value,to%20discuss%20private%20communications%20freely." data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"><u>going on as planned</u></a>, valuing OpenAI at more than $80 billion. It was even extended through January 5, according to CNBC, giving employees more time to become millionaires — if they aren't already.</p><h2>Furious Microsoft employees</h2><p>Some Microsoft employees, meanwhile, were furious that the company promised to match salaries for hundreds of OpenAI employees. The offer came after Microsoft had laid off more than 10,000 employees, frozen salaries, and cut bonuses and stock awards this year.</p><p>"How many loyal employees who stayed at Microsoft while working 12+ hours daily and living in constant fear of being laid off all year?" one Microsoft employee told BI.

  <p>Today, we are releasing StableLM Zephyr 3B: a new chat model representing the latest iteration in our series of lightweight LLMs, preference tuned for instruction following and Q&amp;A-type tasks. This model is an extension of the pre-existing StableLM 3B-4e1t model and is inspired by the <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta" target="_blank"><span>Zephyr 7B model from HuggingFace</span></a>. With StableLM Zephyr's 3 billion parameters, this model efficiently caters to a wide range of text generation needs, from simple queries to complex instructional contexts on edge devices.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Training Insights</strong></p><p>The development of StableLM Zephyr 3B focused on creating a model that performs well in text generation and aligns human preferences. Inspired by Zephyr 7B, we adapted its training pipeline, with the first step being supervised fine-tuning on multiple instruction datasets, including UltraChat, MetaMathQA, Evol Wizard Dataset, &amp; Capybara Dataset. In the second step, we aligned the model with the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm utilizing the UltraFeedback dataset. This dataset is from the OpenBMB research group and comprises 64,000 prompts and corresponding model responses. Recently released models, such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta" target="_blank"><span>Zephyr-7B</span></a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1" target="_blank"><span>Neural-Chat-7B</span></a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/allenai/tulu-2-dpo-70b" target="_blank"><span>Tulu-2-DPO-70B</span></a>, successfully used Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, Stable Zephyr is one of the first models of this type yet with the efficient size of 3B parameters.</p><p><strong>Model Performance</strong></p><p>Benchmarked on platforms such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685" target="_blank"><span>MT Bench</span></a> and <a href="https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/" target="_blank"><span>AlpacaEval</span></a>, StableLM Zephyr 3B demonstrates superior capabilities in generating contextually relevant, coherent, and linguistically accurate text.&nbsp;</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1701968880793_17040">
  <p>More details on our testing, datasets, and safety can be found in our <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b" target="_blank"><span>model card</span></a>. In summary, our performance tests have shown that StableLM Zephyr 3B is capable of surpassing models of larger size tailored for similar use cases, showcasing the power and efficiency inherent in this new model.</p><p><strong>Enabling Diverse Applications</strong></p><p>StableLM Zephyr 3B is a lightweight yet accurate model equipped to handle multiple linguistic tasks efficiently and accurately. The model has been strengthened to assist in instructional and Q&amp;A-type tasks. It's versatile enough for various complex applications, from crafting creative content like copywriting and summarization to aiding in developing instructional design and content personalization. Additionally, it offers a powerful and insightful analysis based on the input data. All this is accomplished while retaining its efficient 3 billion parameter size, 60% smaller than  7b models, enabling use on devices lacking the computational power of dedicated high-end systems.</p><p><strong>Commercial Applications</strong></p><p>If you want to use this model for your commercial products or purposes, please contact us <a href="https://stability.ai/contact"><span>here</span></a> to learn more. </p><p>You can also stay updated on our progress by signing up for our <a href="https://stability.ai/home#newsletter"><span>newsletter</span></a>, following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/stabilityai" target="_blank"><span>Twitter</span></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stability.ai/" target="_blank"><span>Instagram</span></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stability-ai" target="_blank"><span>LinkedIn</span></a>, and joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/stablediffusion" target="_blank"><span>Discord Community</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>One of my ongoing fixations with the web is how improvements in technology inform web design. In an earlier post this year I <a href="https://daniel.do/article/its-the-future-stop-using-jpegs/#some-background">wrote about my theory</a> that the increasing pixel density of displays galvanized the shift from photography to vector illustrations in the early to mid 2010s.</p>
<p>In recent years there has been a design trend that runs counter to this. Illustrations still rule in web design, but instead of clean, flat shapes there has been an emergence of texture, usually as part of a design’s lighting or shading and <em>usually</em> a “noisy” or grainy texture.</p>

</a>
<p>I’m not hip enough to know if this style has been assigned a pithy label, but I do enjoy it. At the same time, I find it frustrating — because as far as I can tell (the lack of examples I have seen in the wild supports this theory) there isn’t an easy way to replicate these illustrations with SVGs. They can probably be exported as such from illustration programs but it’s likely these applied textures are raster or if they are vector, quite large in size.</p>
<p>SVGs are an interesting subject to me, because the specification for them is dense and there are usually multiple ways to accomplish an effect. Most SVGs are simply exported directly from a graphics program and have a lot of inefficiencies etc… which has led to the emergence of tools like <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert on the subject (I feel like the older I get, the less I feel like I can claim that about anything) but in recent years have taken to hand tuning and occasionally writing my own SVGs from scratch so I am not a complete novice either.</p>
<p>I decided to give creating an SVG using this illustration style a shot. My goal was to use the regular SVG specification to write a simple illustration that had this noisy, textured shadow effect. An additional goal was for this illustration to be moderately flexible, something that could easily be turned into a component in Svelte or React and changed for different shapes and colors. For more direct inspiration, I looked to the designer Josh Warren who has experimented a lot with using this style and simple geometry to nice effect:</p>

<h2 id="basic-shape-and-gradient"><a href="#basic-shape-and-gradient" aria-label="basic shape and gradient permalink"></a>Basic shape and gradient</h2>
<p>Drawing a circle or square in an SVG is really easy. There are primitives for them.</p>
<div>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>svg</span> <span>viewbox</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>0 0 100 100<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
	<span><span><span>&lt;</span>circle</span> <span>cx</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>cy</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>r</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50"></circle>
</svg>
</div>
<p>The tricky part is everything else. If you want to apply a gradient, you can specify that as the <code>fill</code> - but what if you want a gradient that changes with the base color you specify? So you don’t have to define a custom gradient with specific colors if you want to reuse the component. Then you’ve entered <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/mask">mask</a> territory. The way masks work in SVGs is that you use the “colors” black and white to how you want a mask to work. It’s a little confusing, but I’ve tried to keep the code example simple.</p>
<p>(As an aside, I have to give huge kudos to MDN’s excellent documentation, this project could not have been done without it!)</p>
<p>This can actually be optimized a little more. We know we’re going to use the same circle shape multiple times, so we can define it once in <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code>, assign it an id and simply reference it with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use"><code>use</code></a> element. This makes the code a little more DRY:</p>

<p>So we’ve got the shape and a gradient going, but how do we add a texture to that gradient? The answer is with a filter. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Filter_effects">MDN’s documentation on SVG Filters</a> goes into better detail on the nuts and bolts of how filters work. I also found this <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/02/19/svg-filter-effects-creating-texture-with-feturbulence/">excellent article</a> that goes into great detail about creating textures for SVGs.</p>
<p>To create noise, I used the <code>&lt;feTurbulence&gt;</code> filter which is explicitly for generating artificial textures but required quite a bit of fiddling to get to my liking. Then, I had to use other filter effects to eliminate color variance and blend naturally with the fill color selected, and finally apply the filter to the circle.</p>

<p>Adding a nice fill color and making the gradient a little more subtle and there we go!</p>
<p>With some additional playing around I was able to create <a href="https://danielimmke.github.io/noisy-shapes">an illustration</a> I was quite happy with. It’s not perfect, and notably renders differently in Safari than other browsers but it achieves what I set out to accomplish.</p>
<p>You can also check out the code in the <a href="https://github.com/danielimmke/noisy-shapes">repository</a>.</p>
<p>This method could certainly be improved with additional experimenting. It’s still a far cry from the complexity of some of the illustrations I linked, but I think it could potentially be refined to be usable in more situations.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A few days ago was the 30th anniversary of the first time I wrote an HTML document.&nbsp; Back in 1993, I took a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> posting of the “Incomplete Mystery Science Theater 3000 Episode Guide” and marked it up.&nbsp; You can see <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/cwru/mst3keg/mst3kf.html">the archived copy</a> here on meyerweb.&nbsp; At some point, the markup got updated for reasons I don’t remember, but I can guarantee you the original had uppercase tag names and I didn’t close any paragraphs.&nbsp; That’s because I was using <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> as a shorthand for <code>&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</code>, which was the style at the time.</p>

<p>Its last-updated date of December 3, 1993, is also the date I created it.&nbsp; I was on lobby duty with the <a href="https://films.cwru.edu/">CWRU Film Society</a>, and had lugged a laptop (I think it was an Apple PowerBook of some variety, something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_180">a 180</a>, borrowed from my workplace) and a printout of <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt"> the HTML specification</a> (or maybe it was “<a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html">Tags in HTML</a>”?) along with me.</p>

<p>I spent most of that evening in the lobby of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Strosacker_Auditorium,_Case_Western_Reserve_University,_Cleveland,_OH_(28593864547).jpg">Strosacker Auditorium</a>, typing tags and doing find-and-replace operations in Microsoft Word, and then saving as text to a file that ended in <code>.html</code>, which was the style at the time.&nbsp; By the end of the night, I had more or less what you see in the archived copy.</p>

<p>The only visual change between then and now is that a year or two later, when I put the file up in my home directory, I added the toolbars at the top and bottom of the page&nbsp; —  toolbars I’d designed and made a layout standard as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University">CWRU</a>’s webmaster.&nbsp; Which itself only happened because I learned HTML.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I was fortunate enough to be able to relate some of this story to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Hodgson">Joel Hodgson</a> himself.&nbsp; The story delighted him, which delighted me, because delighting someone who has been a longtime hero really is one of life’s great joys.&nbsp; And the fact that I got to have that conversation, to feel that joy, is inextricably rooted in my sitting in that lobby with that laptop and that printout and that Usenet post, adding tags and saving as text and hitting reload in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">Mosaic</a> to instantly see the web page take shape, thirty years ago this week.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/choose-your-ip/">https://tailscale.com/blog/choose-your-ip/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38559192">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Tailscale assigns every one of your nodes a private IPv4 address. We do this from the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1015/100.x-addresses/">CGNAT range</a>,
which is typically used by ISPs that have run out of public IPv4 addresses. Starting today, you have control over what
IP address from that range is assigned to your nodes. This gives you the ability to decide what subset of the CGNAT
range your tailnet uses to avoid conflicts with other applications.</p>
<h2 id="globally-unique-to-locally-unique">Globally unique to locally unique</h2>
<p>In the early days of Tailscale we decided to allocate every node a unique IP address within the Tailscale universe. This
was particularly handy for <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing/">node sharing</a>, when you let someone from another tailnet access a node in
your tailnet, they got to see it as the same CGNAT address. It also met our needs when we were an early-stage startup;
the CGNAT <code>100.64.0.0/10</code> range has some four million IP addresses, plenty for an experimental project that may or may
not be interesting to users. It turns out people like to use Tailscale and we are running out of IPs.</p>
<p>We had a few options — we could add other private IP address ranges to the CGNAT space we allocate, but this would have
at best been a stopgap. Or, we could have required all users to use IPv6 addresses, as we already also allocate nodes
and addresses from the much larger pool of IPv6 ULA addresses. We all know how well IPv6 adoption has gone —  this would
have broken legacy software our customers use that does not support IPv6. Rather, we decided to no longer allocate
globally unique CGNAT addresses, and allow the reuse of CGNAT addresses in different tailnets.</p>
<p>It also gives us the flexibility to allow enterprises to limit the range of CGNAT IP addresses that get allocated to
their tailnets, for compatibility with other systems that allocate from parts of the CGNAT range.</p>
<h2 id="jump-into-your-own-pool">Jump into your own pool</h2>
<p>Along with flexible addressing, we are launching a beta feature to let you define the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1304/ip-pool/">IP pool</a> that
your nodes are assigned from the CGNAT range. This is done as part of your tailnet policy:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>    <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>"acls"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"..."</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>"nodeAttrs"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"target"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"autogroup:admin"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"ipPool"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"100.81.0.0/16"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>},</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"target"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"group:dev"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"ipPool"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"100.85.0.0/16"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>},</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With this <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls/#node-attributes">node attribute</a> set, all new nodes managed by admins in your tailnet will be
assigned an IP from the range: <code>100.81.0.0/16</code>, whereas nodes managed by members of <code>group:dev</code> will be assigned an IP
from a subset from the range: <code>100.85.0.0/16</code>.</p>
<h2 id="change-ip-of-existing-nodes">Change IP of existing nodes</h2>
<p>Before these changes, IPv4 addresses were immutable. With locally unique IPv4, however, you can change the address for any node in your tailnet in a couple clicks, even nodes that have been shared to you!</p>

</video>
<h2 id="natural-solutions">NATural solutions</h2>
<p>Address reuse causes no issue in the common case of a perfectly private tailnet, but if not implemented carefully, it
could wreak havoc with node sharing. If I try to share my node <code>100.65.1.1</code> with you, and you already have a node
numbered <code>100.65.1.1</code>, where do your packets go?</p>
<p>To address this (no pun intended), we assign shared nodes a new IP address from the tailnet it is shared into. Each
Tailscale node collects a new IP address for each share. Assigning multiple addresses to an interface causes a lot of UX
pain with some software, so instead nodes in the shared-to tailnet 1-1 NAT packets destined for the shared node, right
before they flow into the WireGuard tunnel.</p>
<p>This means the tailnet of the shared node never has to be aware of the IP addresses assigned to it in other tailnets,
which greatly simplifies accounting.</p>
<p>Now, each tailnet can have up to four million nodes with IPv4 addresses. If you are the sort of enterprise that needs
more than that, let’s chat.</p>
<p>One thing you can rely on with IPv4: whatever the problem, Network Address Translation is part of the solution.</p>

<p dir="auto">Open source tools and guidelines for sending webhooks easily, securely, and reliably</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">Webhooks are becoming increasingly popular and are used by many of the world's top companies for sending events to users of their APIs. However, the ecosystem is fragmented, with each webhook provider using different implementations and varying quality. Even high quality implementations vary, making them inherently incompatible. This fragmentation is a pain for the providers and consumers, stifling innovation.</p>
<p dir="auto">For consumers, this means handling webhooks differently for every provider, relearning how to verify webhooks, and encountering gotchas with bespoke implementations. For providers, this means reinventing the wheel, redesigning for issues that have already been solved (security, forward compatibility, etc.).</p>
<p dir="auto">We propose a simple solution: standardize webhooks across the industry. This design document outlines our proposal, a set of strict webhook guidelines based on the existing industry best practices. We call it "Standard Webhooks".</p>
<p dir="auto">We believe "Standard Webhooks" can do for webhooks what JWT did for API authentication. Adopting a common protocol that is consistent and supported by different implementations will solve the above issues, and will enable new tools and innovations in webhook ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="auto">To achieve this, we have created an open source and community-driven set of tools and guidelines for sending webhooks.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What are Webhooks?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Webhooks are a common name for HTTP callbacks, and are a way for services to notify each other of events. Webhooks are part of a service's API, though you can think of them as a sort of a "reverse API". When a client wants to make a request to a service they make an API call, and when the service wants to notify the client of an event the service triggers a webhook ("a user has paid", "task has finished", etc.).</p>
<p dir="auto">Webhooks are server-to-server, in the sense that both the customer and the service in the above description, should be operating HTTP servers, one to receive the API calls and one to receive the webhooks.It's important to note that while webhooks usually co-exist with a traditional API, this is not a requirement, and some services send webhooks without offering a traditional API.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Read the specification</h2>
<p dir="auto">The latest draft specification can be found at <a href="https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md">spec/standard-webhooks.md</a> which tracks the latest commit to the master branch in this repository.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example ecosystem benefits of Standard Webhooks</h2>
<p dir="auto">We believe "Standard Webhooks" can do to webhooks what JWT did to API authentication. Having a common protocol that is consistent will enable a variety of implementations to interoperate, reducing the development burden on webhook consumers and enabling new uses. Some of these benefits include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>API Gateway signature verification: signature verification is a common challenge for webhook consumers. Standard Webhooks makes it possible for verification to be implemented directly in the API gateway, easily solving verification for consumers.</li>
<li>Having a set of libraries for signing and verification make webhook verification easier for scenarios where API gateways can't be used.</li>
<li>Workflow automation tools (such as Zapier, Make, Workato, and tray.io) can implement the signature verification themselves to ensure a secure integration and save the need for integration builders to reinvent the wheel every time.</li>
<li>Standard Webhooks will enable building tools to automatically generate SDK for webhook consumers that in addition to verifying the signature can also validate the schemas (using JSON Schema, OpenAPI or AsyncAPI definitions).</li>
<li>Many more...</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Related efforts</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are a few complementary or partially overlapping efforts to standardize asynchronous event communication. This specification is compatible with the rest of them, and can either reuse existing efforts or benefit further from collaboration with them. The most notable of such efforts are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.openapis.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenAPI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/" rel="nofollow">AsyncAPI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloudevents.io/" rel="nofollow">CloudEvents</a></li>
<li><a href="https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures.html" rel="nofollow">IETF HTTP Message Signatures</a></li>
<li><a href="http://resthooks.org/" rel="nofollow">REST Hooks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://webhooks.fyi/" rel="nofollow">Webhooks.fyi</a> - a collection of useful webhooks resources (not a standardization effort).</li>
