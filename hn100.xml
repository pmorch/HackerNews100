<p>I’m a full-time instructor in Python and Pandas, teaching in-person courses at companies around the world (e.g., Apple and Cisco) and with a growing host of online products, including <a href="https://store.lerner.co.il/">video courses</a> and a <a href="https://bambooweekly.com/">paid newsletter with weekly Pandas exercises</a>. Like many online entrepreneurs, I’ve experimented with a host of different products over the years, some free and some paid. And like many other online entrepreneurs, I’ve had some hit products and some real duds. </p>

<p>A number of years ago, I decided to advertise some of my products on Facebook. I ran a bunch of ads, none of which were particularly successful, mostly because I didn’t put a lot of effort into them. I decided to try other things, and basically forgot about my advertising account.</p>



<p>It was only a year or so ago that I thought that maybe, just maybe, I should do some advertising on Facebook (now Meta). I went to my advertising page, and was a bit surprised to see that my account had been suspended for violating Meta’s advertising rules. I decided that this was weird, but didn’t think about it too much more, and went on to do other, more productive things.</p>



<p>Just a few months ago, I again visited my ad management page, and again saw the notice that I was not allowed to advertise because I had violated their rules. This time, for whatever reason, I decided that I was going to look into this further. I didn’t see any indication of what rules I had broken, and I knew for a fact that I hadn’t done anything other than advertise courses in Python and Pandas. I didn’t quite know what to do, but there was a button marked, “Click here to appeal.” So I clicked it, assuming that someone at Meta would reach out to me, saying, “Whoops!”</p>



<p>Nope: About 30 minutes later, I got e-mail from Meta saying that they had reviewed my case, I had definitely violated their policy, and now I was <em><strong>banned for life</strong></em> from ever advertising on a Meta platform. Here’s the e-mail that I got:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x.png" alt="" width="620" height="445" srcset="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x.png 1134w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x-300x215.png 300w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x-1024x735.png 1024w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x-768x551.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></figure>



<p>Going to my advertising management page indeed brought up a similar message:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-1024x615.png" alt="" width="652" height="392" srcset="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-1024x615.png 1024w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-300x180.png 300w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-768x461.png 768w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x.png 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px"></figure>



<p>And of course, when I click on the “Business support home,” I get a truly scary message:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-1024x808.png" alt="" width="729" height="576" srcset="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-1024x808.png 1024w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-300x237.png 300w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-768x606.png 768w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x.png 1520w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px"></figure>



<p>All of this seemed utterly bizarre to me. What could I possibly have said or done that would get me permanently restricted? And is there any way that I can get out of this situation?</p>



<p>I decided to turn to my network on (where else?) Facebook, to see if anyone had any ideas. I also turned to LinkedIn, in case someone there might have some insights.</p>



<p>The good news? I got an answer right away from a friend on LinkedIn. He told me that he also had problems advertising his Python training courses on Meta platforms because — get this —&nbsp;Meta thought that he was dealing in live animals, which is forbidden.</p>



<p>That’s right: I teach courses in Python and Pandas. Never mind that the first is a programming language and the second is a library for data analysis in Python. Meta’s AI system noticed that I was talking about Python and Pandas, assumed that I was talking about the animals (not the technology), and banned me. The appeal that I asked for wasn’t reviewed by a human, but was reviewed by another bot, which (not surprisingly) made a similar assessment.</p>



<p>As I said, that was the good news. So, what’s the bad news?</p>



<p>I’ve been in the computer industry for a while, and have no small number of contacts. Three friends who have worked at Meta (two current, one past) offered to check into this for me.</p>



<p>The first friend looked into it, and found that there was nothing to be done. That’s because Meta has a data-retention policy of only 180 days, and because my account was suspended more than one year before I asked people to look into it, all of the evidence is now gone. Which means that there’s no way to reinstate my advertising account.</p>



<p>Now, I’m not a big believer in “there’s nothing to be done,” especially when it comes to companies and software, both of which are created and managed by people. But this friend seemed convinced, so I moved onto a second one. He didn’t get any further. And the third friend? He didn’t seem to make any headway, either.</p>



<p>The bottom line seems to be that Meta’s AI made a mistake, a big one. (You can be sure that I’ll be using this example when I teach courses on machine learning.) The fact that both the original judgment and the appeal were handed by AI is pretty ridiculous.</p>



<p>But even more absurd is the fact that because I didn’t react to their ban within a certain amount of time, there now seems to be no way for me to undo it. Which means that when I start to advertise my courses again —&nbsp;and I’m actually planning to do so in the near future —&nbsp;Meta won’t be seeing any of my money, whereas companies like Google, who seem to employ at least <em>some</em> humans in their advertising department —&nbsp;will.</p>

              <p>Bandcamp’s entire union bargaining team, the eight union members democratically elected by their peers to negotiate their first union contract, were laid off when Epic Games sold Bandcamp to music licensing company Songtradr on Monday.&nbsp;</p><p>Songtradr told 404 Media that it did not have any union membership information when it made its decision on which employees it would keep as part of the sale, but the union told me Songtradr invited them to a meeting with Songtradr’s CEO last week. 404 Media has viewed the invitation, which shows Bandcamp’s bargaining team were invited and that Songtradr’s CEO Paul Wiltshire planned to attend.</p><p>“Songtradr had no access to union membership information and we executed our employment offer process with full-consideration of all legal requirements,” Jalila Singerff, director of communications at Songtradr, told 404 Media in an email. “We carried out a comprehensive, full company evaluation that involved a detailed examination of each role. This evaluation considered several factors such as product groups, job functions, employee tenure, performance evaluations, the importance of roles for smooth business operations, and whether a similar function already existed at Songtradr including our experience of running it and associated requirements.”</p><p>Songtradr didn’t immediately respond to my question about inviting the union bargaining team to a meeting last week.&nbsp;</p><p>Epic Games, a fantastically wealthy company that owns the Unreal Engine, Epic Games Store, and in recent years has seen incredible profits thanks to the huge popularity of <em>Fortnite</em>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/arts/music/epic-games-bandcamp.html?ref=404media.co#:~:text=The%20world%20of%20independent%20music,online%20video%20games%20like%20Fortnite.">acquired Bandcamp</a> in 2022. At the time, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/bandcamp-joining-epic-games-to-support-fair-open-platforms-for-artists-and-fans?ref=404media.co">Epic said</a> that Bandcamp would “play an important role in Epic’s vision to build out a creator marketplace ecosystem for content, technology, games, art, music and more.” The union, Bandcamp United, won recognition in May 2023 through an election administered by the NLRB.</p><p>In September, a little more than a year after Epic acquired Bandcamp, Songtradr <a href="https://www.songtradr.com/blog/posts/songtradr-bandcamp-acquisition?ref=404media.co">announced</a>&nbsp; that it will acquire Bandcamp as Epic cut around 830 jobs across the company. Epic and Songtradr agreed to an “asset sale” of Bandcamp, meaning Songtradr is only buying parts of Bandcamp as opposed to the entire company. As part of this process, Epic has laid off about half of Bandcamp’s staff, the other half of the staff have accepted job offers to work on Bandcamp at Songtradr.</p><p>“On Monday, October 16, 2023 over half of Bandcamp was laid off as a result of Epic Games’ divestiture to Songtradr,” Bandcamp United said in a statement. “Of those laid off, 40 were in the union bargaining unit out of a total 67 members. None of the eight (8) democratically elected bargaining team members received a job offer.”</p><p>Bandcamp United said that the layoffs cut Bandcamp’s editorial team in half, with 12 out of 13 union-eligible support staff “made redundant.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Not all Bandcamp employees will receive offers from Songtradr,” Songtradr <a href="https://twitter.com/songtradr/status/1709986126117630051?s=20&amp;ref=404media.co">said</a> on October 5. “Bandcamp requires some adjustments to ensure a sustainable and healthy company that can serve its community of artists and fans long into the future.”</p><p>“It feels as though many of the aspects that make Bandcamp human—that make it a balm in an algorithm- and profit-driven music industry—have been gutted through these layoffs,” Atoosa Moinzadeh, a laid off member of Bandcamp’s editorial team, said in a statement.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-how-it-works" dir="auto"><a href="#how-it-works">How it Works</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">LocalSend uses a secure communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other using a REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS, and the TLS/SSL certificate is generated on the fly on each device, ensuring maximum security.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information on the LocalSend Protocol, see the <a href="https://github.com/localsend/protocol">documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-getting-started" dir="auto"><a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">To start LocalSend from source code, follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Install <a href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="nofollow">Flutter</a></li>

<p>Since e-books first emerged as a way for readers to consume content digitally, publishers and authors have required content aggregators to apply Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to the e-books <img src="https://www.libraryjournal.com/binaries/content/gallery/Jlibrary/lj-sponsored-images/ebsco-logo-with-com.jpg/ebsco-logo-with-com.jpg/Jlibrary%3Atwofifty">they sell to libraries to prevent the unauthorized use, copying, and redistribution of these materials. While this practice has given publishers and authors peace of mind that sales won’t be lost to piracy or other unauthorized sharing, it has placed undue restrictions on readers who rely on institutional access to e-books.</p>

<p>For instance, DRM typically limits how much an e-book reader can print and how long they can check it out from the library. These limitations can make it difficult for students and academics to use e-books in their research. Some users might require more time with a particular resource, and yet this title might disappear from their device before they’ve had a chance to complete their work.</p>

<p>Even worse, DRM often limits the accessibility of materials for readers with disabilities. Downloaded content that is DRM-protected can only be opened with software that is compatible with the technology, such as Adobe DRM. This means that users can only read downloaded e-books in programs that support Adobe DRM, such as Adobe Digital Editions or Bluefire Reader.</p>

<p>When users have accessibility needs and use specific software to read e-books, these DRM-related limitations can have a big impact: forcing a user who reads with an assistive technology to use Adobe Digital Editions might mean they can’t read that book at all, if their screen reader or text-to-speech software isn’t compatible with Adobe Digital Editions. (Reading the title online is still possible, but for many users, this might not be a convenient option—and so they rely on the ability to download content.)</p>

<p>Although piracy is a serious issue for publishers, content aggregators have been arguing for years that offering DRM-free access to institutions would not add to the problem. “The malicious users aren’t logging into their library’s website to find DRM-free titles to pirate,” says Jon Elwell, director of content strategies for EBSCO. “They are just cracking the DRM.” Unfortunately, software that strips an e-book of its DRM protections is readily available online.</p>

<p>With this fact in mind, content aggregators have been working to convince publishers to let them sell DRM-free content to libraries—and these efforts are paying off. For example, EBSCO has been offering DRM-free content to libraries for more than a year, and the company now has more than 140,000 DRM-free titles available.</p>

<h3>Benefits of DRM-Free Content</h3>

<p>Why is this trend significant? With DRM-free e-books, library patrons have a much richer user experience. They are free to interact with the content just as they would with printed materials, yet with all of the benefits that a digital format enables—such as greater portability and accessibility.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.libraryjournal.com/binaries/content/gallery/Jlibrary/lj-sponsored-images/amanda-jones-1186891-unsplash.jpg/amanda-jones-1186891-unsplash.jpg/Jlibrary%3Athreehundred">“A DRM-free title is a digital book in its purest form,” Elwell observes. “If you want to chunk some sections up to share with a group you are working with, you can do it. If you want to download it so you can reference it later, you can do it. If you want to take notes and mark it up like a print book and have those notes to reference for the rest of your academic career, you can do it. You can even copy and paste sections to save yourself time. It allows the content to truly function as a digital title and to take advantage of everything that means.”</p>

<p>Not only does this remove barriers to research and scholarship, but DRM-free access also makes it easier for colleges and universities to offer e-books or e-book chapters for use by an entire class. “This marries well with course adoption,” Elwell notes.</p>

<p>A review of the usage data on DRM-free e-books suggests that users appreciate the flexibility this model provides. “We studied all of the content in the past year that was purchased and available in both 1-user and DRM-Free unlimited user models, and we found that DRM-Free content was getting significantly more use than the exact same titles in 1-user models,” Elwell says.</p>

<p>This increased usage benefits both libraries and publishers. “Usage is currency,” he explains. “If we know that we can enhance the value of an asset by ensuring that it’s used more frequently, that’s a good thing.”</p>

<h3>Key Considerations</h3>

<p>DRM-free content is relatively new at this scale, and publishers are still trying to figure out a pricing model that is sustainable for them. In turn, librarians are struggling to navigate this new landscape and come up with a purchasing model that makes the most sense for their institution.</p>

<p>While pricing for unlimited-user, DRM-free e-books is higher than the cost of traditional 1-user versions protected by DRM technology, DRM-free materials are also seeing more usage—and so the cost per use is ultimately lower. Even with all of the benefits afforded by DRM-free content, librarians might have to make tough choices about which titles to purchase in which formats.</p>

<p>Library purchasing agents should think carefully about what types of content they want to acquire DRM-free, based on how they expect readers will want to interact with these materials, Elwell advises. For example, a review of EBSCO data reveals that education and law are two subjects in particular where students prefer to download copies that remain on their devices, so they can continue to refer to these resources. If librarians are aware of this trend, they might consider buying DRM-free titles in these subject areas.</p>

<p>“Librarians can serve their patrons most effectively by investing strategically in DRM-free content and watching usage trends closely to make well-informed buying decisions,” Elwell concludes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To ensure digital sovereignty and democratise access to LLMs, SiloGen and TurkuNLP research group at the University of Turku launch a consortium with a key focus to develop the world’s largest open source language model, covering all official European languages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to compute access totaling approximately 15 million GPU hours, the initiative is dedicated to ensure that data utilized in these models accurately represent European languages, also covering the English-speaking world. The initiative is conducted in close collaboration with key European institutions and agencies, and is committed to adhering to European regulations. Beyond Europe, the open source initiative will democratise access to LLMs and enable the development of use-case specific downstream applications.</p>

<p>The consortium, led by SiloGen and the TurkuNLP research group at the University of Turku, stands apart from many other initiatives in that it uniquely combines resources to build LLMs:</p>

<ul><li>World-class LLM team, including professors and leading scholars like <strong>Filip Ginter</strong>, <strong>Jussi Karlgren</strong>, <strong>Sampo Pyysalo</strong>, <strong>Magnus Sahlgren</strong>, <strong>Aarne Talman</strong> among others, as well as others involved out of Silo AI’s more than 150 PhDs and 300 AI experts,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Data resources covering all European languages and code, including <a href="https://hplt-project.org/">High-Performance Language Technology (HPLT) data</a>, and other collected and curated data, and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Access to compute, including software infrastructure to train LLMs and access to the<a href="https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/"> LUMI supercomputer </a>and other hardware and cloud services for LLM training.</li>
</ul><p>In addition to a world-class team, the consortium has access to, and experience with, the LUMI supercomputer, which as one of the European High-Performance Computing (EuroHPC) undertakings is the third largest supercomputer in the world and the largest in Europe. Having built LLMs on LUMI for more than a year, the team has developed a distinctive software layer for training LLMs effectively and efficiently on the AMD-based hardware. As part of the EU-funded HPLT project, the data for this initiative has been collected and curated since early 2022 to provide a representative basis for LLM development. Combining all of this with a total of 15 million GPU hours, Silo AI and TurkuNLP are uniquely positioned to train a family of language models, including the world's largest open LLM.</p>

<p><img alt="Sampo Pyysalo lähikuvassa." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2d0ab279-5ba5-494c-9bc6-3d56fa27050d" src="https://www.utu.fi/sites/default/files/inline-images/Sampo.Pyysalo-248.jpg" width="1000" height="740" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>University Research Fellow in data analysis Sampo Pyysalo is the principal investigator of the High Performance Language Technologies consortium at Turku.</em></p>

<p>“LLMs are rapidly reshaping how we access information and interact with technology. As their impact grows, it is increasingly important to assure that the models are developed in a transparent and reproducible manner and made openly available to ensure accountability and equal access to the technology. From a European perspective, it is also critical that models are designed from the outset to prioritize multilinguality and an equitable approach to all languages. The High Performance Language Technologies (HPLT) project is addressing these goals through the creation of open European data resources and language models and delighted to partner in this consortium with SiloGen and Silo AI, an industry leader with shared goals", says Sampo Pyysalo, University of Turku Research Fellow and HPLT principal investigator..</p>

<p><img alt="Peter Sarlin lähikuvassa." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0b39d04b-d7b0-40b5-8661-43ca59ded0e5" src="https://www.utu.fi/sites/default/files/inline-images/Peter%20Sarlin%2C%20CEO%20and%20Founder%20of%20Silo%20AI.jpg" width="1000" height="701" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>Peter Sarlin is the CEO and co-founder of Silo AI.</em></p>

<p>“We are honored to contribute to the development of open LLMs. The development of base models aligned with European values is imperative for our digital sovereignty. This initiative helps to ensure that underlying models are based on data and information representing the citizens and organisations of the region, and overall compliance with regulation, data privacy and other vital concerns. And eventually we need sovereignty on how downstream applications and value creation happen. This requires trusted and secure approaches to independent base models that enable fine-tuning for domain-specific needs. This way we can ensure digital sovereignty, while advancing technological development,” says <strong>Peter Sarlin</strong>, CEO and co-founder of Silo AI.</p>

<p>The TurkuNLP research group’s extensive experience in NLP and LLMs aligns with Silo AI’s and SiloGen’s commitment to contribute to world-class research on generative AI. The alignment, combined with the resources of the consortium, provides a robust foundation for redefining the boundaries of what is possible in the world of open source language models. Together with the LLM development platform, this opens a unique path for companies to create value using independent, trusted and secure base models with a possibility to finetune, instruct and control LLMs for domain-specific needs.</p>

<p><strong>TurkuNLP research group</strong><br><em>The TurkuNLP group of the University of Turku was founded in 2001 and has been carrying out research in natural language processing for over 20 years with a focus on machine learning applications to the automatic analysis and generation of text. TurkuNLP is the leading Finnish research group in large generative language models and one of the partners in the Horizon EU High Performance Language Technologies project, which is currently creating the next generation of European language models on the LUMI supercomputer.</em></p>

<p><strong>Silo AI&nbsp;</strong><br><em>Silo AI is one of Europe’s largest private AI labs – a trusted AI partner that brings competitive advantage to product R&amp;D. We build AI-driven solutions and products to enable smart devices, autonomous vehicles, industry 4.0, and smart cities. Silo AI provides its customers a unique access to world-class AI expertise, covering a team of more than 300 AI experts and more than 150 PhDs, as well as the Silo OS infrastructure to speed up AI development and deployment. Established in 2017, Silo AI is on a mission to build a European flagship AI company, with offices currently in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Canada.</em></p>

<p><strong>SiloGen</strong><br><em>SiloGen is a large-scale initiative with the aim of building generative AI technology for Europe’s digital sovereignty. It is gathering some of Europe’s leading generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) experts, as well as access to data sources, powerful computational resources and infrastructure to train, run and operate LLMs. SiloGen has been operational since late 2022 and is currently working on its technology at full speed with clients like Allianz, Sandvik and Tietoevry. Its core focus is to improve downstream and domain-specific applications and to ensure companies can utilize trustworthy models for private, confidential and proprietary data. As a trusted provider SiloGen offers base and specialized models as well as a development suite to ensure accurate, trustworthy and robust downstream applications</em>.&nbsp;<br>

<p>Apple has recently made bold <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=apple+carbon">claims</a> about respecting the environment across business decisions. ♻️ And it seems to be making strides in many areas, like using recycled materials in products and clean energy in many aspects of its operations. 🎉</p>



<p>That’s why a deviation from this posture at last month’s event stood out: Only iPhone 15 models benefit from a new feature that is designed to protect batteries, <em>despite the feature likely being possible on earlier models.</em> The new feature is: iPhone 15 (and 15 Pro) owners can limit their phones to not charge past 80%.<sup data-fn="05902993-d9c4-4170-8921-1c3224296e38"><a href="#05902993-d9c4-4170-8921-1c3224296e38" id="05902993-d9c4-4170-8921-1c3224296e38-link">1</a></sup> That may not appeal to everyone, but doing so, according to Apple, reduces “the wear on your battery and improve[s] its lifespan by reducing the time your iPhone spends fully charged”. 🌎 👍</p>



<p>Wait, how can we assume that the feature is possible on earlier models? -&gt; Well, iPhones dating back at least to the iPhone 8 era <em>already</em> support a very similar “charge to 80%” option called Optimized Charging.<sup data-fn="a2cf8422-4828-4fcc-98ee-55c9ad78a160"><a href="#a2cf8422-4828-4fcc-98ee-55c9ad78a160" id="a2cf8422-4828-4fcc-98ee-55c9ad78a160-link">2</a></sup> The difference is that Optimized Charging operates by limiting your phone’s charging to 80% when your iPhone is normally idle (typically in the middle of the night).<sup data-fn="90e98f77-acc1-43d2-9c98-599d88558f4e"><a href="#90e98f77-acc1-43d2-9c98-599d88558f4e" id="90e98f77-acc1-43d2-9c98-599d88558f4e-link">3</a></sup> The <em>new</em> 80% charging feature (that’s limited to iPhone 15 models) doesn’t try to be as smart, and simply applies the limit all day long. (I asked Apple to comment on why this feature is not also available in previous models <sup data-fn="59b5a285-2161-414d-8e7e-decbada463eb"><a href="#59b5a285-2161-414d-8e7e-decbada463eb" id="59b5a285-2161-414d-8e7e-decbada463eb-link">4</a></sup> and will update this story if they respond.) Presumably there’s nothing preventing Apple from pushing a software update to enable this in older phones. </p>



<p>If batteries last longer that means less waste and healthier devices for those who want to make this trade off. This feature is driven by customer demand; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884725/apple-iphone-15-pro-optimized-charging-80-percent-how-it-works">there was even speculation</a> that it shipped as an “apparent response to the battery <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230812/p11#a230812p11">longevity complaints</a> that have proliferated around last year’s iPhone 14 models”. Comments across several articles <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/16n2m4t/comment/k1c2ybg/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">and</a> reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/16peac9/iphone_15_exclusive_feature/">threads</a> openly wonder why <em>only</em> iPhone 15 models get the feature. (After posting this article, I started listening to one of my favorite podcasts ATP, and John Siracusa also <a href="https://overcast.fm/+R7DVfvsX4/16:12">wondered out loud</a> why this is limited to iPhone 15 as well.) Meanwhile, Samsung phones’ similar Battery Protect feature works for models going back multiple years.<sup data-fn="9ebd1906-d31d-4981-91ed-3eb183c707d5"><a href="#9ebd1906-d31d-4981-91ed-3eb183c707d5" id="9ebd1906-d31d-4981-91ed-3eb183c707d5-link">5</a></sup></p>



<p>It’s one thing when feature-gating is for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/07/13/iphone-ios-15-missing-features-old-phones/7948107002/">animated backgrounds in the Weather app</a> or features that are hardware constrained, but when it’s for something that can clearly reduce waste globally and protect customers’ devices, they should make an exception.</p>

<p>So for Earth’s-sake, please take the easy win and enable this for more phones, Apple.</p>







<p>There is very lively discussion on Reddit, where it’s trending at #1 both on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/17b7ua8/the_new_ios_option_to_charge_battery_to_up_to_an/">r/ios</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/17b8gu6/the_new_ios_option_to_charge_battery_to_up_to_an/">r/apple</a>. There are a bunch of worthy suggestions there on how to improve the feature even more, but one thing’s clear: iPhone users would love to see this come to more devices.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Cambridge, MA 10/17/2023 –</p><p>Zero ASIC, a semiconductor startup, came out of stealth today to announce early access to its one-of-a-kind <strong>ChipMaker</strong> platform, demonstrating a number of world firsts:</p><ul><li>3D chiplet composability enabling billions of new silicon products</li><li>Fully automated no-code chiplet-based chip design</li><li>Zero install interactive RTL-based chip emulation</li><li>Roadmap to 100X reduction in chip development costs</li></ul><p><em>“Custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) offer 10-100X cost and energy advantage over commercial off the shelf (COTS) devices, but the enormous development cost makes ASICs non-viable for most applications,”</em> said Andreas Olofsson, CEO and founder of Zero ASIC. <em>“To build the next wave of world changing silicon devices, we need to reduce the barrier to ASICs by orders of magnitude. Our mission at Zero ASIC is to make ordering an ASIC as easy as ordering catalog parts from an electronics distributor.”</em></p><h2>ChipMaker Platform</h2><p>Traditional chip design costs over $100M and takes expert teams 2-3 years to go from concept to production. Chiplet-based design offers a compelling solution to both the time and cost problem of custom ASICs by hiding all the complexities of circuit design inside a reusable validated chiplet. Zero ASIC has gone one step further by creating a platform that enables automated design, validation, and assembly of System-in-Packages from a catalog of known good chiplets. The company’s ChipMaker web based tools allows users to test out their custom designs quickly and accurately before ordering physical devices, using cloud FPGAs to implement the RTL source code of each chiplet in a custom SoC.</p><h2>eFabric Active Interposer</h2><p>Existing 2D/2.5D chiplet design approaches are fundamentally limited in shoreline bandwidth, wiring distances, and flexibility. To address these problems, Zero ASIC has developed eFabric, an active grid-like 3D interposer that improves die-to-die communication efficiency and composability. The eFabric supports integration of ultra-critical processing blocks using 3D attached eBrick chiplets and integration of off-package IO functions using 2D attached UCIe based ioBrick chiplets. The eFabric architecture enables unprecedented chiplet-based performance levels and flexibility:</p><ul><li>Billions of unique System-In-Package assembly options</li><li>512 Gb/s/mm on-fabric bisection bandwidth</li><li>128 Gb/s/mm chiplet 2D bandwidth</li><li>128 Gb/s/mm2 chiplet 3D bandwidth</li><li>&lt;0.1 pJ/bit 3D interconnect energy efficiency</li></ul><h2>eBrick 3D Chiplets</h2><p>To enable plug-and-play chiplet composability, Zero ASIC has created a complete set of electrical and mechanical 3D chiplet standards specifications. The effectiveness of these standards have been demonstrated through the design of a number of interoperable 2 mm x 2 mm chiplets called eBricks:</p><ul><li>Quad-core RISC-V Linux capable dual-issue processor</li><li>5 K LUT embedded FPGA</li><li>3 MB SRAM -3 TOPS machine learning accelerator</li></ul><h2>Target Markets and Availability</h2><p>Zero ASIC’s composable chiplet ASICs are ideally suited for a diverse set of energy and supply chain challenged applications including robotics, automotive safety, aerospace and defense, 5G/6G communication, test and measurement, software defined radio, smart manufacturing, medical diagnostics,  and high performance computing. The ChipMaker design and emulation platform can be accessed immediately at zeroasic.com. Zero ASIC will be showing live demonstrations of the ChipMaker platform at the Open Compute Platform Summit (Open Chiplet Economy Center) October 17-19, in San Jose, CA. Customized ASICs sampling in Q3 2024.</p><h2>About Zero ASIC</h2><p>Zero ASIC is a semiconductor company building an automated chiplet-based design and manufacturing platform offering orders of magnitude reduction in the time, cost, and risk of developing unique customer-driven ASICs for high performance systems. Zero ASIC is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

You may not have heard of it because they run these systems in-house vs using a commercial service.<p>My company switched to 100% remote dev envs a couple years ago. When you cut a branch it spins up a VM and you can connect to it from VS Code (native or browser based) or just plain SSH. It works great. The lag is not noticeable at all. Dev envs are fully provisioned and up to date with all tooling and dependencies so you don't need to bother with managing any of it locally. Given a choice I don't think any dev at my company would go back.

And giving developers data and secrets was often either insecure or complicated, depending on the codebase.</p><p>With codespaces, people can just jump straight into a working project, without pulling any client code or secrets or data onto their machine. It still requires maintenance sometimes but at least when I fix the codespace config I know everyone will definitely benefit from the changes.</p><p>The main downside is it's pretty expensive (if you have, say, 10 devs using it all day every day) compared to "free".</p><p>If you work on just a few projects, and/or you have very sophisticated systems across the board (like every site has an on-rails setup script with useful sanitized dev data, and secure SSO'd secrets management), I doubt it's worth it.</p><p>But in our case, a relatively junior dev being able to spin up a working dev version of a site they've never worked on in 5 minutes with no issues, so they can knock out a 3 hour change and maybe never work on it again, is a big money saver.</p><p>It's also meant that we can more easily standardize everyone's laptops without having to consider how well they work as bare metal dev machines (which has meant we can move everyone to fairly cheap macbook airs without people moaning about their tooling or storage size etc.)</p><p>I also like that access to a lot of stuff becomes directly mediated moment to moment by someone's github access (which for us also runs through our sso, cloudflare zt etc).</p><p>We're doing it in a slightly clunky way though - we use docker compose still, inside the codespace. I like this approach personally bc it feels like we're less locked in to the platform. For us it also made the initial migration easier. I think it also makes debugging the environment a bit easier because you don't need to keep rebuilding constantly on changes, you can just dcb dcup...

Unfortunately, we <i>can't</i> use cloud environments for a reasonable chunk of our work, so that really means we're get forgotten about until we complain loudly enough, no matter how friendly I am with the relevant teams.

They use workstation grade hardware (A6000 GPU, threadrippers) that offer better performance/price than similarly sized cloud offerings which use datacenter type hardware. To actually tick all same boxes you'd need to go for much larger instance types.
Plus it would be questionable whether one could realize the scaling benefit of the cloud because those machines are more pets than cattle, killing them over night and bringing up a clean system the next day would likely upset dozens of different workflows and tweaked setups.
And then the software expects <i>network filesystems</i> with low latency random access, not blob storage...
They did the cost calculations, buying hardware is cheaper in the long run, including ops.</p><p>And then there are customers that have extremely stringent security demands. Segregated networks, video surveillance, no data must leave the premises. Convincing them to move the data into the cloud might not be impossible but it would be a big recertification ordeal for one cloud vendor. And then we'd be locked into that vendor until we could get something else. And we have several such customers.

At every company I've ever worked for, "cloud development" is nothing but a Linux VM that gets provisioned for you in AWS, a file watcher that syncs your local files to the VM, and some extra CLI tools to run builds and tests on the VM. And every time I've used this, the overhead of verifying the syncing is up to date, the environment is consistent between my laptop and VM is the same, all this other mess...every time I end up just abandoning "cloud dev" and doing things on my laptop. God forbid you change a file in your cloud VM and forget to sync in the reverse direction. Not only is local development more reliable, but it's also faster (no remote network hop in the critical path of building things).

I have a handful of servers in my basement that I use vscode+remote-ssh to work with. The benefit is that I can jump from my desktop to my laptop without any fuss. I can leave long-running scripts online for like an experimental batch job and attach to that from any machine, even when I am not home thanks to wireguard/tailscale. It is very nice knowing my dev env is always there in the state I last left it. This also gives the nice benefit of being able to choose your developer env (windows or mac) while running your dev/code/system on a linux system for example. It also gets you around architecture issues, like if your laptop is arm-based and your app needs x86.<p>I was initially kinda opposed to this and preferred "bare metal development" on my local rig. But the performance is actually pretty incredible for remote development with vscode such that I don't really notice things are running on different hardware.</p><p>We recently had some new members join the team and I decided to spin up some dedicated EC2 instances for them to use for this exact purpose. They aren't being used yet, but as our stack becomes more sophisticated I think workloads will transition there. It's done with a custom terraform module that also provisions other assets needed for each dev (regardless of local or remote dev) like an S3 bucket, some dynamo tables, IAM roles, etc. Being able to onboard a new dev with a handful of lines added to a mapping is pretty awesome.</p><p>tl;dr I would absolutely consider remote dev spaces.

I have a very lightweight laptop that I use</p><p>- Some of our developers like having multiple separate codespaces at a time as a way to separate out different projects. I just use branches, but some folks like the codespace workflow.</p><p>- I can run vulnerability scans over our dev environment which is nice</p><p>- When I onboard devs, I can get them to the point of running our full application suite in a 15 minute meeting</p><p>- I don't have to deal with m1 vs not-m1 issues that were popping up all the time before we made the switch</p><p>- Having a linux base is nice, as that's what we use in production. We deal with some annoying dependencies and not having to install them on Mac anymore is nice</p><p>- It's seamless changing between my laptop and desktop that I work from. All the code is instantly on the other when I switch, even if I haven't pushed up to git</p><p>- Chrome + Notion + Slack + our task tracker app + etc. take up a lot of memory now adays. Even with 32gb machines, folks often would run out of memory trying to run our app. On a codespace, all of the memory is dedicated to just the app.</p><p>- With prebuilds, when a developer opens a codespace, we already have all of our python, node, go, etc. dependencies preinstalled (also things like awscli, terraform, pre-commit, VsCode extensions, docker). They just run `aws sso login` and then `start --serve` and things work.</p><p>- I live in an RV, and sometimes don't have great internet, but my Codespace is on a remote machine that does always have fast internet. Even being an internet-based service, this works great for me.</p><p>The biggest cons:</p><p>- Some of our devs were really passionate that they preferred other IDEs than VsCode. Some other IDEs do now have support, but they aren't as supported as VsCode yet</p><p>- Codespaces have downtime occasionally (as did Cider at Google). Most folks just use a local copy/devcontainer of the app or do other things when this happens, but some folks choose to always use devcontainers/local copies because this annoys them so much. At Google, we just posted memes when this happened and went home.</p><p>- Codespaces become inactive after a controllable amount of time has passed. Some folks don't like the 40 seconds to reactivate a codespace after being inactive for more than 30 minutes, so they either write scripts to keep their codespaces alive or just don't use codespaces at all.</p><p>Overall:</p><p>- most of our newer employees exclusively use codespaces.</p><p>- A few of our older employees who developed locally for years have chosen to continue developing locally, and will just hop into a codespace to run a quick terraform command or something if their local version gives errors.</p><p>- The number of questions we deal with regarding issues on a single users' machine have gone down dramatically, and tbh most of the questions come from folks who use the local still</p><p>- We do pay a pretty penny for this, but it's a small fraction of our overall cloud spend or costs per employee

We use DevPod to work in cloud dev environments in our AWS cloud. I hate it. DevPod brings its own SSH implementation that injects itself into your server and munges CRLF, making ssh sessions to your workspace fraught with difficulty except for basic command line applications. The only terminal that seems to work is the one built in to Visual Studio Code. Maybe Microsoft Windows Terminal also works, I dunno.<p>If you have editor attachments and want to work this way, suck it up and learn your VS Code. That's what all the tooling supports first class. Second class is JetBrains. Vim and Emacs aren't even considered. I'd say just run them from inside the container, but then you run into things like custom SSH that munges CRLF. When you look at who actually authored the devcontainer standard, it makes sense.

But they need to be paired up with a habit of curation. Without a regular checkup of the things you save, your digital vault will keep growing and growing becoming yet again, overwhelming.</p><p>So after learning to be selective, you need to learn to let go.</p><p>You should regularly check your library of contents to, again, make sure that you’re only keeping what’s serving you.</p><p>Your brain will still be subject to FOMO (Fear of missing out), so you’ll need to counter act regularly, and archive what’s not needed.</p><p>We could fall into the easy argument that social media is a virus to our society and how everything that’s wrong with the world stems from it and how it has made us slaves to external validation and dopamine junkies.</p><p>However, social media can be, and is, used for good.</p><p>You’re just doing it wrong.</p><p>Instead of allowing the algorithm to recommend indiscriminately. Customize it.</p><p><span>Indicating what you are interested in through liking and sharing is important. But the single most effective thing you can do to ensure the value of your feeds, is to start </span><strong>blocking</strong><span> the content you don’t align with.</span></p><p>Don’t just scroll past it. Block it.</p><p>It’s an extra effort for sure, but the result will be well worth it.</p><p>Now, if you’re convinced of the power of the second brain, there are basically infinite options to build your system.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Well, I finally have a story to tell. I finally launched the new version of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://sizzy.co/">Sizzy</a>. It went from a simple web app to a full-fledged browser for designers and developers. I would say that it's been a very exciting month, but actually, it's been a bumpy ride for 2.5 years. I made a lot of mistakes and I learned a lot of lessons, so I wanted to share the entire story with you.  </p>&nbsp;<h2>Solve your own problem, everything else will&nbsp;follow</h2><p>As everything that I have ever worked on, I was trying to solve my own problem. I was working as a freelancer at the time and previewing a website on multiple devices was a <em>major</em> pain in the ass for me. The client wanted the app to work perfectly on every device, in every orientation. So after every change in my app, I had to switch 20 device variations in Chrome and it was driving me crazy. I'm obsessed with automating things. I'd spend hours to automate a task that takes 3 seconds just so I don't have to repeat the steps ever again. Meanwhile, my sister was swapping the batteries between two remotes 10 times per day for almost a year without buying a second pair of batteries and she was absolutely fine. I guess everyone is different.</p>&nbsp;<p>You can actually read the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://medium.com/@kitze/introducing-sizzy-a-tool-for-developing-responsive-websites-crazy-fast-39a8c0061992">original article</a> that I published when I launched the app.</p>&nbsp;<p>Back to the story. After only a day of work, I already saved myself a lot of time while working for clients in the future. I published the app and I open-sourced it on GitHub so everyone can use it and contribute. People <em>loved</em> it. The project received <em>5k</em> stars. The analytics were going crazy. I couldn't believe what was going on.</p>&nbsp;<div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><p><img alt="1_4VX9xRv1-9tCc2ETdZOVhQ.jpg" src="https://media.graphcms.com/8EB6ktlTjaRaGvyT9NYQ"></p></div>&nbsp;<h2>Hopefully, people will donate,&nbsp;right?</h2><p>I started an Open Collective for it but it made 93$ in 2.5 years. After I tweeted about this, a couple of people said: "well maybe people aren't using it". I knew that they were just trying to bring me down, but the analytics were saying something else. 7 to 10 thousand people were using the app every month. The donation link was visible everywhere, so it wasn't possible to miss it.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Here's the catch: when you give away something completely for free, people aren't that motivated to pay for it. It's just how humans think, there's nothing new here. When was the last time you chose a value above 1$ on a "pay what you want" slider for an app? Exactly. (ok, one person who's reading the article, you're special and you're a saint for choosing 2.5$ that one time when you were drunk)</p>&nbsp;<h2>I made a huge&nbsp;mistake</h2><p>It didn't take long for me to realize that launching Sizzy as a web app was a big mistake. There were tons of limitations that prevented me from realizing the app's full potential. I had too many ideas but it wasn't possible to realize all of them in a web app. I wanted to make a real browser. So I dived into Electron. Shortly after getting the first 0.0.0.0.0.1 (not really semver) Electron version working, I published an article so other people don't have to go through what I went to make React and Electron work together. I was making progress.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I obviously wanted to make a paid version of the app because the donations weren't exactly working out for me. But I had no idea what approach to take.</p>&nbsp;<ul role="list" depth="0"><li index="0"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Closing an open-source project just to make it paid seemed like a dick move.</li><li index="1"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Having an open-source version and a paid version seemed very complicated to pull off.</li></ul><p>I had a call with a friend to ask him about his journey with his startup and he was very helpful, but when a goal seems too far away and we can't envision a clear path to reach it, we always reach for the same old drawer:</p>&nbsp;<div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><p><img alt="1_1SGZoVh-5VoC8qFbK2H7vQ.png" src="https://media.graphcms.com/Adyc7lzvQb6OPGs3ZNg3"></p></div>&nbsp;<p>I was born in Macedonia, and I was living in the Netherlands at the time, and both of those countries didn't have access to Stripe. I contacted Stripe and they told me that the Netherlands will have access soon (and it actually launched a few months later), but I was already clinging so hard to the excuse that I don't have a way to charge for this app. </p>&nbsp;<p>I mean, every cool developer is using Stripe, right? They have a cool flashy website and a dashboard that everyone loves. I WANT TO SEE MY $$$ IN A PRETTY AND COLORFUL DASHBOARD WITH ROUNDED CORNERS AND NEAT SHADOWS GODDAMMIT. Screw the fact that there are literally 108351 other payment providers that I can use. No. Payments are hard. This is impossible. Also, I have to figure out a way to auto-update this app? How do I even do that? Where am I going to store all the installers? What if it costs a lot of money? How am I going to handle all of that mess? What about licenses, registrations, emails, newsletters, etc. etc. etc… You know what, I better forget about this "problem" and completely ignore it for 2 years.  </p>&nbsp;<h2>Shifting focus</h2><p>Shortly after the initial launch I stopped freelancing, I launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://reactacademy.io/">React Academy</a> and I was too busy doing workshops, so I didn't have the need to use Sizzy at all. I completely neglected the app and stopped caring about issues etc. The usage wall still high though, and the usage was even going up. The app was useful to people, even in its most basic form. I got a couple of offers from companies which wanted to buy it from me, but I didn't want to sell it. I knew that one day I'll be in the right mindset and go back to it.</p>&nbsp;<h2>If it doesn't work for me, I don't want to sell&nbsp;it</h2><p>Last summer I tried using the app again and my first reaction was "omfg why do people even use this thing, it can be so much better". But people didn't see it that way. When you tune your brain to this problem-solving mindset you start seeing problems in everything. When I was using the app, I didn't like it because I had this other potential version of the app in my head. So I decided that I want to work on it again. I decided to launch it when it's gonna look like something that I would use every day. That was the goal.</p>&nbsp;<h2>A second&nbsp;chance</h2><p>I was so busy doing workshops and conferences that I barely had the time to concentrate and work on any other project. I was traveling every week and I grabbed this one from the excuses drawer:</p>&nbsp;<p>"Unless I'm in one place for a very long time I just can't push myself to focus and do proper work" - Kitze</p><p>But I didn't want to let that stop me, so I hired <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://praneet.dev/">Praneet</a> to work on the app a couple of hours per day. He helped me bring Sizzy back in shape from a technical standpoint. We updated a lot of old dependencies, cleaned up some code, switched a couple of libraries, etc.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The problem was, I had no idea how to move the project forward. There were so many things left to do that I didn't know where to start. The payment integration wasn't even started and there was no landing page. I started working on the landing page while he was working on fixing bugs and adding new features. Most of the new features didn't end in the current version because I wasn't thinking everything through. We were going one step forward and two steps back. I wouldn't say that it was completely lost time, but I wish I was better at prioritizing and estimating things. Unfortunately, I wasn't. I didn't set any time limits and weekly goals. We were just coding.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The other problem is I cannot focus on a goal for too long. I started working on the landing page, but ended up working on a React library for making landing pages 🤦 (maybe I'll release it one sunny day)</p>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to solve that problem too, but I ended up with two half-ass solutions. There were so many things left to do, the launch seemed too far away, and I just burned out and lost interest again. Praneet decided that he doesn't want to join me full time and we parted ways.</p>&nbsp;<h2>The final&nbsp;chance</h2><p>I went back to my trips, conferences, and workshops. I started filming vlogs. I had a lot of fun, and I was using travel as an excuse that I don't have time to work on my apps.</p>&nbsp;<p>Somewhere at the beginning of 2019, we started discussing with Praneet for his full-time employment again. After a lot of back and forth, we agreed on a contract for 1 year, and we went back to working on the app. Paying someone every month out of my own pocket before being profitable was a big motivational boost for me to get my shit together. I honestly think that if I tried to finish everything alone, the app wouldn't see the light of day.</p>&nbsp;<p>The conference and workshop season was almost done for me, so I finally had a lot of time at home and I finally went back to my zone. Honestly, travel and all the hippie nomad shit might look fun to you, but trust me there's nothing better than working from the same old place and being focused for a long time. When you see people post pictures of working by the pool just think that they cannot see shit from all the glare, and there is a group of kids playing Marco Polo that's driving them bananas. It's all part of that fake Instagram life.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Anyway, I decided to finally sit down and ship this thing.</p>&nbsp;<p>The landing page could've been done in a day if I used any of the drag and drop tools for building landing pages, but noooo, that wasn't good enough for the perfectionist in me. I had to do everything from scratch. Everything had to be optimized, animated, and thought out down to the last detail. I'm a believer in #YOLO #JUSTSHIPIT development but the right landing page can basically sell the app for you. I proved that with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://twizzle.app/">Twizzle</a> and I wrote about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiehackers.com%2Fforum%2Fjust-ship-it-is-not-always-the-right-mindset-b71eda7696">Just ship it is not always the right mindset</a>. With zero marketing people were sharing and buying the app just because of the unique landing page filled with easter eggs.</p>&nbsp;<p>The landing page for Sizzy was done, and it was time to move on.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Oh boy, the payment&nbsp;part</h2><p>Even though Stripe was available in Poland, where I'm currently based, I still chose Paddle as a payment provider only because it automatically handles VAT for EU customers. I could've totally used Paddle back in the Netherlands but my hand was kinda stuck in the excuses drawer.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Because the app was in Electron, I couldn't use Paddle's SDK for licensing an app. "Add few lines of code" turned to "few weeks of figuring everything out manually". I had to write literally everything around the payment logic from scratch. From the backend to a separate app for managing licenses and subscriptions, and all the Electron code for activating, deactivating, and validating licenses. When you look only at the functionality of an app, you might think "hah I can write this myself in a few weeks", but actually packing it in something that can be distributed to users involves a lot of work. Don't get me started on the updates and release server.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I learned a lot during the process but I don't want anyone else to do this manually. I already have some plans about releasing the entire infrastructure as a service, so people can easily sell their Electron apps with Paddle. It will take me only 3 years to release it.  </p>&nbsp;<h2>Deleting the GitHub repository</h2><p>Honestly, it felt kind of shitty to delete the repository and unpin the project from my profile. I hated the feeling but I had to shrug it off. I had to convince myself that I'm not doing anything wrong. The app was serving a lot of people for 2.5 years, and I rarely got any contributions. It was time to get real and think about what matters.</p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, here we go… I'm gonna mention the M word and lose a ton of readers at this point.</p>&nbsp;<p><strong>Money</strong>.  </p>&nbsp;<p><strong>Money matters.</strong></p>&nbsp;<p>Most developers, hell, most people are in the mindset that money is something evil and that it doesn't matter. It's a taboo subject. Go ahead and complain to your friends that you're not making enough or cannot pay your bills this month. They will love the conversation and everyone will tell their own story. Now go ahead and tell your friends that you made a lot of money this month. You could cut the tension in the air with a knife. People don't want to hear that shit. Money doesn't matter. Go away with that conversation. I'm making enough. I can barely save anything, but I don't want to think about that right now. At least I'm learning. One day things will magically change, I know that. That guy is making money because his grandpa is rich. That girl is making money because she's lucky. Let's not discuss that and go back to complaining, please.    </p>&nbsp;<p>There are so many amazing developers creating amazing tools and they're not thinking about making them profitable, even for a second. A friend once called me "greedy" because I left a company for a better salary. What the actual fuck. That's a very high school mindset to have, and I'm doing my best to spread this message to every developer out there…</p>&nbsp;<p>Open source, writing blog posts, and playing with tweaking lint settings and editor themes all day are completely fine until your landlord knocks on your door or you're at the checkout at the grocery store. You're doing a crazy 2-hour commute every day telling yourself "well at least I'm learning a lot about SVG". Fuck that. We don't know how long things will stay this way. No one can guarantee that we'll have our jobs and we'll be in the most profitable and spoiled industry in the next 10 years.  </p>&nbsp;<div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><p><img alt="1_GfLq_6uV7t09oQx6998s1w.jpg" src="https://media.graphcms.com/NUE86TVRQ0i4NUvsvMK7"></p></div>&nbsp;<p>A factory lector - a person who was reading the newspaper to factory workers</p><p>The factory lector thought his job was secure until one day the factory owner walked in and replaced him with a radio. But the factory lector didn't have Medium and Hacker News to tell him every single day that the radio is coming to take his job. However, developers are constantly reading that AI and ML are taking a huge momentum and everything is becoming more and more automated. We completely ignore that fact and want to believe that we'll keep our highly paid job of moving rectangles with CSS forever. (People who know how to fix printers are an exception, you'll keep your job forever)  </p>&nbsp;<p>I learned a long time ago not to obsess with stars and likes. I still love open source and I'm still <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://github.com/kitze">open-sourcing</a> a lot of things, but not everything has to be open source. Please don't get defensive and don't get me wrong. If it wasn't for open source we wouldn't be able to ship anything, ever. There are a lot of amazing people in the community, there are people who do open source for living, there are highly funded open source projects like Babel, Webpack, etc.</p>&nbsp;<p>However, <strong>most</strong> developers make <strong>zero</strong> money off open source. <strong>Zero</strong>.</p>&nbsp;<p>I have a lot of friends (and by friends I mean people who replied to my tweet twice) who built an amazing app or a service, they didn't make it paid for a bunch of reasons, and now they're buried in a sea of issues, basically solving other people's problems for free. No matter how cruel this sounds, it's the sad reality. I really hope that with GitHub Sponsors things will change, but it won't be anywhere near launching a paid SaaS product, because donations are <strong>optional</strong>.  </p>&nbsp;<p>My philosophy is that if I'm investing a lot of time and money in making a tool that's gonna save users and companies across the world tons of time, I might as well charge for it.</p>&nbsp;<p>I'm expanding on this point more details in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ6aC6G0ufg">this talk</a>, so if you're interested you can watch it.</p>&nbsp;<p>Jesus, what was this article even about… Oh yeah, Sizzy.  </p>&nbsp;<p>It was time to launch. I did all the calculations and I was hoping that at least a small percentage of my existing users will convert to paid ones.  </p>&nbsp;<p>It was time.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The 0.0.1 version of the app was ready for download.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Everything was tested properly.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I made a professional video demonstrating all the features of the app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The Twitter post was ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The Product Hunt post was ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>It was time to press the button, but it was so hard.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was so afraid that all of my existing users are gonna grab pitchforks and wait in front of my home because the tool is not free anymore.  </p>&nbsp;<p>But oh boy… I was totally not prepared for what happened next.</p>&nbsp;<h2>The big launch</h2><p><strong>Holy fucking monkey balls flying through space! I totally didn't expect that response!</strong></p>&nbsp;<p>Sizzy got 2352 upvotes on Product Hunt. It was the product of the day, the product of the week, and third product of the month. It got more votes than Libra by Facebook and Raspberry Pi 4, isn't that bananas?! (or raspberries, whatever)</p>&nbsp;<p>I decided to use a giveaway on Twitter to motivate people to retweet, and it worked! After the giveaway was done I couldn't find a proper tool for picking winners so I made <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://luckyretweet.co/">Lucky Retweet</a>. Try doing a giveaway for one of your products and you might be surprised by how well it works. Instead of only 3, I gave away 30-lifetime licenses. Although your few buddies will groan and won't RT, and all the winners will be super happy and grateful. It's overall a very positive experience.</p>&nbsp;<p>The initial feedback was amazing. When I started getting my first subscribers I just couldn't believe it. It's been 1.5 months since the launch and I still get the same feeling when I get a new subscriber.  </p>&nbsp;<h2>Haters are always&nbsp;louder</h2><p>I believe that paying a few dollars per month for something that's going to save you and your team hundreds of hours per month is a no-brainer. In retrospect, I should've priced it way higher. It was selling like crazy. If you look at the list of teams who are using Sizzy on the landing page you will find Samsung, Bentley, Comcast, Toyota, Sketch, Hallmark, Basecamp, Algolia, etc.</p>&nbsp;<p>What in the world is going on?  </p>&nbsp;<p>People who can recognize that a tool will actually save them, and even make them money, just buy it immediately and move on with their life.  </p>&nbsp;<p>However, people who are obviously experts at pricing SaaS products are way, way louder. If you only look at the comments from the outside, without knowing the actual stats, you might get a totally wrong impression that the product isn't doing well.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The most common complaints were:</p>&nbsp;<ul role="list" depth="0"><li index="0"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>I want to pay only once!!!111!11!</li><li index="1"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>This shouldn't be a subscription</li><li index="2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>HEY, THIS SHOULD BE FREE!!111!1</li><li index="3"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>I'm gonna make my own version and distribute it for free because screw these greedy companies that are charging users for something like this (actual comment, W T F )</li><li index="4"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Well, isn't this the same as Google Chrome?</li><li index="5"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Well, isn't this the same as that one Chrome extension that came out in 2007?

I CAN EVEN BUY MY OWN COW, RAISE IT, MILK IT EVERY DAY, AND DRINK MILK FOR FREE!11!".  </p>&nbsp;<p>In both scenarios, you would probably be seen as a crazy person and escorted out by security. But sadly, on the internet, people forget that they're talking to real people. It's simple, if you don't agree about the pricing of a product, don't buy it and move on. Then go and spend the same amount of money on a large latte, and spend 25 hours per week manually doing something that a dedicated tool could've done for you. That will show 'em!</p>&nbsp;<h2>Focus on the customers</h2><p>Thankfully, I learned to ignore negative comments and I didn't waste too much time on pointless internet discussions.</p>&nbsp;<p>Instead of wasting my energy on convincing people to buy the app, I decided to focus on customers who actually bought it, and make sure that they will get the best value out of it. Ever since launching the app we've been working non-stop on improving it and we have released 5 new versions with a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://sizzy.co/changelog">lot of new features</a>. I opened a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://sizzy.co/roadmap">public Trello Board </a> where people can see the roadmap and vote on features they would like to see in the app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The emails were piling up and there were way too many of them for me to handle alone. I tried a couple of tools but nothing was working out. I realized that I cannot do everything by myself. My girlfriend, who was already doing QA for the project, offered to work extra hours and help with the email and all the other administrative tasks. After a week I decided to hire her part-time and properly compensate for her time. This might sound super weird to some, and honestly, it's a bit hard to separate the work from our personal life, but somehow we make it work. She is super hyped about the project and went all-in on making all sorts of merch.  </p>&nbsp;<div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><p><img alt="1_dh2uev75_ymFqOlh4kmepA.png" src="https://media.graphcms.com/KifIp6TPTNCoTeq9dZBZ"></p></div>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to make sure that every customer issue and a complaint is addressed as soon as possible, and she was crucial in the process. After fixing an issue that a customer reported, we personally send them an email to let them know that in the new update their issue is fixed. Everyone loves this level of customer support. We're aware that it's not gonna work at a bigger scale, but we'll do our best to keep it that way.  </p>&nbsp;<h2>Next steps</h2><p>Currently, Sizzy has around 1600 users, which is crazy because the only marketing I've done so far is sponsoring one newsletter, and that was last week. Most of the marketing is just a word of mouth from people who enjoy the product. I want to improve the stability of the app even more before I start properly investing in marketing. It's still far away from my final goal. I have so many ideas about shaping Sizzy to be a tool that every developer and designer will rely on during their daily work. I want to reach a million users. It may sound crazy, but I know I'll get there. The only thing standing between me and that goal is just&nbsp;… me. But I won't let myself lose track again. Sizzy is my primary focus now, and everything else comes secondary. It's really hard to sleep properly when you know you have a lot of customers who depend on you. It's a weird feeling, but I love it!</p>&nbsp;<p>I have no idea what's gonna happen next. I got reached out directly by 5 big investment companies. I'm still not sure whether I should take the VC route because I have a feeling that I'll have a boss again, and I was always struggling to work when someone else was in control. I'll try to push as much as I can without getting an investment because owning 100% of a startup and growing it without depending on anyone is just an amazing feeling.</p>&nbsp;<p>Startup?! Did I say startup? I hate the word, seriously. It completely lost meaning because people create a hello world project and immediately change their Twitter bio to "CEO &amp; Founder of X". The title in my bio doesn't mean shit. I'm making an app, who cares, it doesn't matter what you call it. Things are not going to magically change if you change your bio. You're just lying to yourself. Be happy and stop giving a fuck about proving your 3 friends from high school who you are.  </p>&nbsp;<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>&nbsp;<ul role="list" start="1" depth="0"><li index="0"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Solve your own problem</li><li index="1"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Show your solution to other people as soon as possible</li><li index="2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Package it and distribute it as soon as possible (note to self)</li><li index="3"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Don't be scared, ashamed, or discouraged to make it paid</li><li index="4"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Don't let anyone tell you how much you should charge for your work</li></ul><p>I am so worried that other makers are focusing only on the negative comments about paid products, and get discouraged from making their next product paid, instead of free.</p>&nbsp;<p><strong>Please</strong> don't fall for this!  </p>&nbsp;<p>Please value your work and believe that despite the fact that haters are loud, you're still gonna get a lot of customers who would gladly pay for what you made.</p>&nbsp;<p>As a famous legend once said:  </p>&nbsp;<p>'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.whisper.aero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whisper Aero</a> emerged from stealth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/whisper-aero-emerges-from-stealth-to-quiet-drones-and-air-taxis/">a little over two years ago</a> with a straightforward (if ambitious) plan: to radically reduce noise emissions from next-gen aircraft with a never-been-done-before electric thruster.</p>
<p>But according to Whisper COO Ian Villa, from the very beginning, the company was thinking more expansively. The startup was founded by Villa and CEO Mark Moore, both former executives at Uber’s aerial ridesharing project Elevate. Early on, the two founders had a hunch that the electric propulsor could be scaled down for products outside the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Like, say, lawn care.</p>
<p>“If we showed you our seed round deck, we had a leaf blower in it,” Villa said in a recent interview. “We’ve always known leaf blowers would be on the path. The real question was when.”</p>
<p>The answer to that question is “now.” Today, Whisper has unveiled “Whisper Drive,” a scaled-down electric ducted fan that can be integrated into leaf blowers, commercial drones or other consumer products. The company says that a Whisper Drive-enabled leaf blower can be up to 40x quieter at 50 feet than its competitors, effectively turning a neighborhood nuisance into a barely perceptible hush.</p>
<p>The result is a leaf blower that emits just 45 decibels of noise at 50 feet and full throttle. In comparison, gas leaf blowers emit between 70-90 decibels of sound at the same condition, while the quietest electric leaf blowers on the market emit around 57-59 decibels.</p>


<p>Whisper engineers started playing around with the concept for a quiet leaf blower after the company had already developed and flown an early-generation 10-pound thruster for a demonstrator drone. Using some 3D-printed parts and spare batteries, they modified the propulsor into a leaf blower MVP.</p>
<p>“We were blown away,” Villa said, likely not intending to make such a good pun. “It was just insane how magically quiet it was. We looked at the numbers and we said, ‘Okay, we know how much thrust this produces.’ […] And it dawned on us, not only was it quiet, but it has to be moving more air than an equivalent handheld leaf blower.”</p>
<p>Whisper set up the very same testing rigs that outdoor power equipment vendors use, so they’ve been able to do direct comparisons between a Whisper Drive-enabled blower and blowers available for purchase. Whisper engineers have also been able to subject the blower to aviation-grade testing, which has allowed them to measure thrust and noise to a highly precise degree, Villa said.</p>
<p>While the company was able to prove tremendous noise reduction with just a prototype, it wasn’t consumer-friendly in terms of costs, so Whisper had to think seriously about how to scale manufacturing up and drive costs down.</p>
<p>“The leaf blower was a way to tackle that in a product-aligned way, where we can perform these experiments, come up with something that we knew the public wanted, but then also solve [the question of] how are we going to make these thrusters cheap enough for commercial drones. To us it was a win-win.”</p>
<p>The biggest way the company’s been able to bring costs down is via an injection molding technique using low-cost materials. The most expensive part of the leaf blower is the battery, and Villa said that Whisper Drive’s improved efficiency will generate longer run times and decreased battery weight.</p>


<p>Leaf blowers may seem relatively low tech — blow air, move leaves — but this is exactly why they’re such a prime product to target, Whisper says. More and more communities have enacted usage restrictions on leaf blowers due to the noise, which is bad news for lawncare workers, especially those that live in hot areas and may not be able to start work during the coolest parts of the day. Depending on use, workers may also be required under federal law to wear hearing protection. Whisper Drive-enabled leaf blowers would make noise restrictions irrelevant and hearing protection unnecessary.</p>
<p>To be clear, Whisper is not building a leaf blower (just the propulsor), but the company is already in talks with a few potential partners to bring the ultra-quiet blower to the market. Villa said the company’s goal is to lock in a partnership toward the end of this year or beginning of next year, so that the blower can be available for purchase by 2025 or sooner.</p>
<p>The new product is part of Whisper’s broader strategy to bring in early revenue and diversify its portfolio — going after high-thrust defense and commercial aviation on one end, to lower-thrust products like leaf blowers or commercial drones on the other.</p>
<p>“We have a significant portion of the team working on high thrust, we also have a significant portion of the team are working on low thrust,” Villa said. “Really, they’re synergistic.”</p>
<p>A quieter, more efficient and affordable electric leaf blower may even be the final nudge in turning the lawncare industry — which has historically relied on gas-powered machinery — greener. While the percentage of the electric lawn equipment market has been rapidly growing, especially amongst individual consumers, it’s still not the majority.</p>
<p>“A lot of landscapers have already gotten on the bandwagon,” Villa said. “When you look at the dollars and look at the economics of it, just like how electric aviation has favorable economics to some alternatives, the same thing is true in the landscaping space. The trouble is, you have these favorable economics, but there’s limitations. To break through those limitations in terms of run time, in terms of performance, in terms of noise, you need enabling technology.”</p>
<p>“This Whisper Drive that we’re able to use in a leaf blower application, is that key enabler.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Researchers have discovered the link between the gut microbiota and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>For the first time, researchers have found that Alzheimer’s symptoms can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming its role in the disease.</p>
<p>The research was led by Professor Yvonne Nolan, APC Microbiome Ireland, a world leading SFI funded research centre based at University College Cork (UCC), and the Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, UCC, with Professor Sandrine Thuret at King’s College London and Dr Annamaria Cattaneo IRCCS Fatebenefratelli, Italy.</p>
<p>The study supports the emergence of the gut microbiome as a key target for investigation in Alzheimer’s disease due to its particular susceptibility to lifestyle and environmental influences.</p>
<p>Published in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awad303/7308687?searchresult=1">Brain</a>, the study shows that that the memory impairments in people with Alzheimer’s could be transferred to young animals through transplant of gut microbiota.</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s patients had a higher abundance of inflammation-promoting bacteria in faecal samples, and these changes were directly associated with their cognitive status.</p></div><div><p><strong>Professor Yvonne Nolan</strong> said: “The memory tests we investigated rely on the growth of new nerve cells in the hippocampus region of the brain. We saw that animals with gut bacteria from people with Alzheimer’s produced fewer new nerve cells and had impaired memory.”</p>
<p>“People with Alzheimer’s are typically diagnosed at or after the onset of cognitive symptoms, which may be too late, at least for current therapeutic approaches. Understanding the role of gut microbes during prodromal – or early stage- dementia, before the potential onset of symptoms may open avenues for new therapy development, or even individualised intervention,” said Professor Nolan.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. As our population ages, one in three people born today are likely to develop Alzheimer’s. Funded by Science Foundation Ireland, scientists in UCC are working to develop strategies to promote healthy brain ageing and advance treatments for Alzheimer’s by exploring how the gut microbiota respond to lifestyle influences like diet and exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Professor Sandrine Thuret</strong>, Professor of Neuroscience at King’s College London and one of the study’s senior authors said, “Alzheimer’s is an insidious condition that there is yet no effective treatment for. This study represents an important step forward in our understanding of the disease, confirming that the make-up of our gut microbiota has a causal role in the development of the disease. This collaborative research has laid the groundwork for future research into this area, and my hope is that it will lead to potential advances in therapeutic interventions.”</p>
<p>The research was conducted by Dr Stefanie Grabrucker, a postdoctoral researcher working with Professor Nolan, in partnership with postdoctoral colleagues Dr Edina Silajdzic at King’s College London and Dr Moira Marizzoni, IRCCS Fatebenefratelli, Italy. UCC collaborators were Professor Cora O’Neill, Dr Olivia O’Leary, Dr Sarah Nicolas, Dr Jane English, Mr Sebastian Dohm-Hansen and Dr Aonghus Lavelle.</p>
<p><strong>Professor. John F. Cryan</strong>, UCC Vice President for Research and Innovation, who was also involved in this research said: “I’m delighted to be involved in this exciting study that further enhances our understanding of the significant role played by the gut microbiome in brain related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, and recognises UCC and APC Microbiome Ireland as leading institutions in microbiome and brain health research. This research aligns with our UCC Futures Framework and the strategic plan for the University in the areas of Food, Microbiome and Health and the soon to be launched Future Ageing and Brain Science.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">The same hacker who leaked a trove of user data stolen from the genetic testing company 23andMe two weeks ago has now leaked millions of new user records.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a hacker who goes by Golem published a new dataset of 23andMe user information containing records of four million users on the known cybercrime forum BreachForums. TechCrunch has found that some of the newly leaked stolen data matches known and public 23andMe user and genetic information.</p>
<p>Golem claimed the dataset contains information on people who come from Great Britain, including data from “the wealthiest people living in the U.S. and Western Europe on this list.”</p>
<p>23andMe spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>On October 6, 23andMe <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/">announced that hackers had obtained some user data</a>, claiming that to amass the stolen data the hackers used credential stuffing — a common technique where hackers try combinations of usernames or emails and corresponding passwords that are already public from other data breaches.</p>
<div>
		<h4>Contact Us</h4><p>
		 Do you have more information about the 23andMe incident? We’d love to hear from you. You can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase, and Wire @lorenzofb, or email lorenzo@techcrunch.com. You can also contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.	</p></div>
	
<p>In response to the incident, 23andMe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/23andme-resets-user-passwords-after-genetic-data-posted-online/">prompted users to change their passwords</a> and encouraged switching on multi-factor authentication. On its official page addressing the incident, 23andMe said it has launched an investigation with help from “third-party forensic experts.” 23andMe blamed the incident on its customers for reusing passwords, and an opt-in feature called <a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212170838">DNA Relatives</a>, which allows users to see the data of other opted-in users whose genetic data matches theirs. If a user had this feature turned on, in theory it would allow hackers to scrape data on more than one user by breaking into a single user’s account.</p>
<p>There are still a lot of unanswered questions about this incident. It’s not known if the hackers actually used credential stuffing and not another technique to steal the data, how much user data was stolen, and what the hackers intend to do with it.</p>
<p>The incident appears to have been conducted, or at least launched, several months ago. On August 11, a hacker on another cybercrime forum called Hydra advertised a set of 23andMe user data. That set of user data matched some of the user records leaked two weeks ago, according to a TechCrunch analysis.</p>
<p>On Hydra, the hacker claimed to have 300 terabytes of 23andMe user data, though the hacker did not provide any evidence for this claim.</p>
<p>Regardless of the many unanswered questions, what’s clear is that we still don’t know the full extent of this data leak. And it’s not clear that 23andMe knows yet how much data was taken.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rocicorp.dev/blog/ready-player-two">https://rocicorp.dev/blog/ready-player-two</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37931373">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://rocicorp.dev/blog-content/reflect-beta/sunrise2.jpg" alt="Sunrise over Nā Mokulua in O'ahu Hawaii"></p>
<p>Hello, and happy morning!</p>
<p><a href="https://reflect.net/">Reflect</a> is a new way to build multiplayer web apps like Figma, Notion, or Google Sheets.</p>
<p>Reflect is an evolution of <a href="https://replicache.dev/">Replicache</a>, our existing client-side sync framework. It uses the same game-inspired sync engine as Replicache, but adds a fully managed server, making it possible to start building high-quality multiplayer apps in minutes.</p>
<p>Today, Reflect is publicly available for the first time. Visit <a href="https://reflect.net/">reflect.net</a> to learn more, or <a href="https://hello.reflect.net/">hello.reflect.net</a> to get started.</p>
<h2 id="why-reflect"><a href="#why-reflect"><span></span></a>Why Reflect?</h2>
<p>Collaborative editing invariably involves conflicts.</p>
<p>This is just a matter of physics – information can only travel so fast. If you want instantaneously responsive UI, this means you can't wait for the server – changes have to happen locally, on the client. If the application is collaborative, then two users can be editing the same thing at the same time.</p>
<p>These conflicting edits must be synchronized somehow, so that all users see the same thing, and so that conflicts are resolved in a way that feels natural.</p>
<p>The heart of any multiplayer system is its approach to this problem. Like the engine of a car, the choice of sync engine determines just about everything else – the developer experience, the user experience, the performance that is possible, the types of apps that can be built, and more.</p>
<p>In the web ecosystem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a> are a popular way to sync data. CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) are a type of data structure that always converge to the same value, once all changes have been exchanged between collaborators. <a href="http://yjs.dev/">Yjs</a> and <a href="https://automerge.org/">Automerge</a> are two popular open-source CRDT libraries.</p>
<p>But Reflect is not a CRDT. We call our approach <em>Transactional Conflict Resolution</em>. It's a twist on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_prediction">Server Reconciliation</a> – a technique that has been popular in the video game industry for years.</p>
<p>All the unique benefits and differences of Reflect flow from this one core choice, so it helps to understand it if you want to know what Reflect's about. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="consider-the-counter"><a href="#consider-the-counter"><span></span></a>Consider the Counter</h2>
<p>Imagine you're using the Yjs CRDT library and you need to implement a counter. You decide to store the count in a Yjs map entry:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span> map <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Y<span>.</span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<figcaption><p>✅ Correct code for implementing a counter from the Yjs docs.</p></figcaption>
<p>This is kind of surprising and awkward, not to mention inefficient. Why doesn't the obvious way above work?</p>
<p>Yjs is a <em>sequence</em> CRDT. It models a sequence of items. Sequences are great for working with lists, chunks of text, or maps — all tasks Yjs excels at. But a counter is not any of those things, so Yjs struggles to model it well.</p>
<p>Specifically, the merge algorithm for Yjs Map is last-write wins on a per-key basis. So when two collaborators increment concurrently, one or the other of their changes will be lost. LWW is the wrong merge algorithm for a counter, and with Yjs there's no easy way to provide the correct one.</p>
<p>This is a common problem with CRDTs. Most CRDTs are good for one particular problem, but if that's not the problem you have, they're hard to extend.</p>
<h2 id="transactional-conflict-resolution"><a href="#transactional-conflict-resolution"><span></span></a>Transactional Conflict Resolution</h2>
<p>Now let's look at how we would implement a counter in Reflect:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>increment</span><span>(</span>tx<span>,</span> delta<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>const</span> prev <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>await</span> tx<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'count'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>??</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

</span><span>  <span>await</span> tx<span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>'count'</span><span>,</span> next<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<figcaption>Implementing a counter with Reflect.</figcaption>
<p>It's clear, simple, obvious code. But, importantly, it also works under concurrency. The secret sauce is Transactional Conflict Resolution. Here's how it works:</p>
<p><img src="https://rocicorp.dev/blog-content/reflect-beta/flow-01.svg"></p><p>In Reflect, Changes are implemented using special JavaScript functions
called <em>mutators</em>. The increment function above is an example of
a mutator. A copy of each mutator exists on each client and on the
server.</p>
<p><img src="https://rocicorp.dev/blog-content/reflect-beta/flow-02.svg"></p><p>When a user makes a change, Reflect creates a <em>mutation</em> –
a record of a mutator being called. A mutation contains
<em>only the name of the mutator and its arguments</em> (i.e.,
<code>increment(delta: 1)</code>), not the resulting change.</p>
<p>Reflect immediately applies the mutation locally, by running the mutator
with those arguments. The UI updates and the user sees their
change.</p>
<p><img src="https://rocicorp.dev/blog-content/reflect-beta/flow-03.svg"></p><p>Mutations are constantly being added at each client, without waiting for
the server. Here, client 2 adds an <code>increment(2)</code> mutation
concurrently with client 1's <code>increment(1)</code> mutation.</p>
<p><img src="https://rocicorp.dev/blog-content/reflect-beta/flow-04.svg"></p><p>Mutations are streamed to the server. The server linearizes
the mutations by arrival time, then applies them to create the next
authoritative state.</p>
<p>Notice how when mutation A ran on client 1, the result was
<code>count: 1</code>. But when it ran on the server, the result was
<code>count: 3</code>. The conflict was merged correctly, just by
linearizing execution history. This happens even though the server knows
nothing about what <code>increment</code> does, how it works, or how to
merge it.</p>
<p><img src="https://rocicorp.dev/blog-content/reflect-beta/flow-05.svg"></p><p>In fast-moving applications, mutations are often added while
awaiting confirmation of earlier ones. Here, client 1 increments one
more time while waiting for confirmation of the first increment.</p>
<p><img src="https://rocicorp.dev/blog-content/reflect-beta/flow-06.svg"></p><p>Updates to the latest authoritative state are continuously streamed back
to each client.</p>
<p>When a client learns that one of its pending mutation has been applied
to the authoritative state, it removes that mutation from its local
queue. Any remaining pending mutations are <code>rebased</code> atop the
latest authoritative state by again re-running the mutator code.</p>
<p>This entire cycle happens up to 120 times per second, per client.</p>
<h2 id="the-payoff"><a href="#the-payoff"><span></span></a>The Payoff</h2>
<p>This is a fair amount of work to implement.</p>
<p>You need a fast datastore that can rewind, fork, and create branches. You need fast storage on the server-side to keep up with the incoming mutations. You need a way to keep the mutators in sync. You need to deal with either clients or servers crashing mid-sync, and recovering.</p>
<p>But the payoff is that it ✨generalizes✨. Linearization of arbitrary functions is a pretty good general-purposes sync strategy. Once you have it in place all kinds of things just work.</p>
<p>For example, any kind of arithmetic just works:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>setHighScore</span><span>(</span>tx<span>:</span> WriteTransaction<span>,</span> candidate<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>const</span> prev <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>await</span> tx<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'high-score'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>??</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  <span>const</span> next <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span>prev<span>,</span> candidate<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  <span>await</span> tx<span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>'high-score'</span><span>,</span> next<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>List operations just work:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span>tx<span>:</span> WriteTransaction<span>,</span> item<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

</span><span>  <span>const</span> next <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span>prev<span>,</span> item<span>]</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  <span>await</span> tx<span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>'shopping'</span><span>,</span> next<span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>// Note: you need to pass the item (or a stable id), as the index can change.</span>

</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can even enforce high-level invariants, like ensuring that a child always has a back-pointer to its parent.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>addChild</span><span>(</span>
</span><span>  tx<span>:</span> WriteTransaction<span>,</span>
</span><span>  parentID<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>

</span><span>  <span>const</span> parent <span>=</span> <span>await</span> tx<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>parentID<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  <span>const</span> child <span>=</span> <span>await</span> tx<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>childID<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>parent <span>||</span> <span>!</span>child<span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  <span>// Invariant: child.parentID and parent.childIDs must always be consistent.</span>
</span><span>  <span>const</span> nextParent <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span>parent<span>,</span> childIDs<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span>parent<span>.</span>childIDs<span>,</span> childID<span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  <span>const</span> nextChild <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span>child<span>,</span> parentID <span>}</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  <span>await</span> tx<span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span>parentID<span>,</span> nextParent<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  <span>await</span> tx<span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span>childID<span>,</span> nextChild<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>All of these examples <em>just work</em>, and merge reasonably without any special sync-aware code.</p>

<p>The benefits of Transactional Conflict Resolution extend further because of the way sync works.</p>
<p><strong>In Reflect, the server is the authority.</strong> It doesn't matter what clients think or say the result of a change is – their opinion is not even shared with the server or other clients. All that is sent to the server is the mutation name and arguments. The server recomputes the result of a mutation for itself, and all clients see that result.</p>
<p>This means that the server can do whatever it wants to execute a mutation. It doesn't have to even be the same code as runs on the client. It can consult external services, or even roll dice.</p>
<p>One immediate result of this design is that you get fine-grained authorization for free.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you are implementing a collaborative design program and you want to allow users to share their designs and solicit feedback. Guests should be able to add comments, highlight the drawing, and so on, but not make any changes.</p>
<p>Implementing this would be quite difficult with a CRDT, because there is no place to put the logic that rejects an unauthorized change.</p>
<p>In Reflect, it's trivial:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>updateShape</span><span>(</span>tx<span>:</span> WriteTransaction<span>,</span> shapeUpdate<span>:</span> Update<span>&lt;</span>Shape<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>// Your authentication handler runs server-side and can set any fields on</span>
</span><span>  <span>// tx.user. See: https://hello.reflect.net/authentication.</span>
</span><span>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>tx<span>.</span>environment <span>===</span> <span>'server'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>tx<span>.</span>user<span>.</span>canEdit<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'unauthorized'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  <span>}</span>
</span><span>  <span>// ...</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that the mutator actually executes different code on the server. This is fine in Reflect. The server is the authority, and it can make its decision however it wants.</p>
<h2 id="even-more"><a href="#even-more"><span></span></a>Even More</h2>
<p>There are even more benefits to this approach. For example, schema validation and migrations just sort of fall out of the design for free. Future blog posts will explore these topics in more detail.</p>
<p>For now, I'll end this where I started: the choice of sync strategy is the heart of any multiplayer system. It determines just about everything else. And while there are certainly benefits to other approaches, we find that the game industry has a lot to teach on this topic. Transactional Conflict Resolution "fits our brain" in a way other solutions don't. It's simple, flexible, and powerful.</p>
<p>If you're building a multiplayer application, you should <a href="https://hello.reflect.net/">try out Reflect</a> and see if it fits your brain too.</p>
<p>And hey, if you've made it this far, you're our kind of person. We'd love to hear from you. Come find us at <a href="https://discord.reflect.net/">discord.reflect.net</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/hello_reflect">@hello_reflect</a> and say hi. We'd enjoy hearing about what you're building.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The model is <a href="https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b">available on HuggingFace</a>.
We think Fuyu-8B is exciting because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has a much simpler architecture and training procedure than other multi-modal models, which makes it easier to understand, scale, and deploy.</li>
<li>It’s designed from the ground up for digital agents, so it can support arbitrary image resolutions, answer questions about graphs and diagrams, answer UI-based questions, and do fine-grained localization on screen images.</li>
<li>It’s fast - we can get responses for large images in less than 100 milliseconds.</li>
<li>Despite being optimized for our use-case, it performs well at standard image understanding benchmarks such as visual question-answering and natural-image-captioning.</li>

<h2 id="model-architecture">Model Architecture</h2>
<p>Adept is building a generally intelligent copilot for knowledge workers.
In order to do this, it’s important for us to be able to understand user context and to take actions on behalf of users.
Both of those goals rely heavily on image understanding.
Users expect what’s visible on their screen to be accessible to the copilot, and important data is often presented most naturally as an image – think charts, slides, PDFs, etc.
In order to take actions, we often need to literally click on buttons or scroll through menus.
It would be nice if all these actions were doable via API, but many business-relevant software has no API or an incomplete API, and controlling software via UIs allows us to keep the user in the loop.</p>
<div><figure><figure><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/architecture.png"></p></figure><figcaption><div><p>Diagram of the Fuyu model architecture.
Fuyu is a vanilla decoder-only transformer with no specialized image encoder.
Image patches are linearly projected directly into the first layer of the transformer, bypassing the embedding lookup.
This simplified architecture supports arbitrary image resolutions, and dramatically simplifies both training and inference.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Therefore, we need a model that can understand both images and text.
Although a lot of progress is being made on this front, nothing is available that suits our precise needs.
Existing multimodal models are complicated, both from an architectural perspective and a training perspective.
These complications are a liability when it comes to understanding model behavior, scaling models up, and deploying to users.</p>
<p>On the architecture side, other multimodal models involve a separate image encoder, the output of which tends to be connected to an existing LLM via either cross-attention or through some kind of adapter that feeds directly into the LLM’s embedding-space.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03378.pdf">PALM-e</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18565.pdf">PALI-X</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12966.pdf">QWEN-VL</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03744">LLaVA 1.5</a>, and <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/tackling-multiple-tasks-with-a-single-visual-language-model">Flamingo</a> all look more-or-less like this.
These models also tend to work on a fixed image resolution.
At inference time, all images at greater resolution than this must be downsampled, and all images whose aspect ratio doesn’t match must be padded or distorted.</p>
<p>On the training side, other multimodal models tend to have a large number of separate training stages.
The image encoder will be trained separately from the LLM on its own tasks, often using a contrastive training objective, which is complicated to implement and reason about.
Then, as in e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18565.pdf">PALI-X</a>, the image encoder and the text decoder (frequently with a bespoke connector network) will be trained together on images at a low resolution for some period of time.
At this point, a choice must be made about whether to freeze the weights of each of the components while training.
Finally, some models are trained with an extra high-resolution image phase (without which they won’t perform well on high-res images).</p>
<p>When scaling up models, it’s difficult to reason about how to independently scale each of the above components.
Should marginal parameters be allocated to the encoder or the decoder?
To which of the training steps should we give the next chunk of compute?
We’ve instead designed a model without these complications.</p>
<p>Architecturally, Fuyu is a vanilla decoder-only transformer with the same details as <a href="https://www.adept.ai/blog/persimmon-8b">Persimmon-8B</a> - there is no image encoder.
Image patches are instead linearly projected into the first layer of the transformer, bypassing the embedding lookup.
We simply treat the normal transformer decoder like an image transformer (albeit with no pooling and causal attention).
See the diagram above for more details.</p>
<p>This simplification allows us to support arbitrary image resolutions.
To accomplish this, we just treat the sequence of image tokens like the sequence of text tokens.
We remove image-specific position embeddings and feed in as many image tokens as necessary in raster-scan order.
To tell the model when a line has broken, we simply use a special image-newline character.
The model can use its existing position embeddings to reason about different image sizes, and we can use images of arbitrary size at training time, removing the need for separate high and low-resolution training stages.</p>
<p>Together, these changes have dramatically simplified our training and inference experience.</p>
<h2 id="eval-performance">Eval Performance</h2>
<p>To sanity-check the architectural changes underlying Fuyu-8B, we chose four of the most commonly-used image-understanding datasets: <a href="https://visualqa.org/">VQAv2</a>, <a href="https://okvqa.allenai.org/">OKVQA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption">COCO</a> Captions, and <a href="https://allenai.org/data/diagrams">AI2D</a>.
VQAv2 and OKVQA are natural image question-answering datasets, COCO is a captioning dataset, and AI2D is a multiple-choice dataset involving scientific diagrams.
We compare our models to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03378.pdf">PALM-e</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18565.pdf">PALI-X</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12966.pdf">QWEN-VL</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03744">LLaVA 1.5</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>
<p>The Fuyu models perform well according to these metrics, even though they are heavily focused on natural images.
Fuyu-8B improves over QWEN-VL and PALM-e-12B on 2 out of 3 metrics despite having 2B and 4B fewer parameters, respectively.
Fuyu-Medium performs comparably to PALM-E-562B despite having fewer than a tenth as many parameters!
PALI-X still performs best on these benchmarks, but it’s larger and fine-tuned on a per-task basis.
Note that, since these benchmarks are not our main focus, we didn’t perform any of the typical optimizations (e.g. non-greedy sampling, fine-tuning for a long time on each dataset specifically, etc).</p>

<h2 id="what-are-these-image-understanding-benchmarks">What are these Image-Understanding Benchmarks?</h2>
<p>While interacting with these benchmarks we also noticed serious issues.
We’ve developed an in-house eval suite that corresponds more closely to the capabilities we care about, but we thought it was worth elaborating on some of those issues here, given the ubiquity of these benchmarks.</p>
<p><strong>Question Answering Benchmarks</strong></p>
<p>The question-answering datasets are quite flawed - they use a complicated scoring mechanism, require you to respond in a specific format, and are often annotated incorrectly.</p>
<p>Consider the following two images:</p>
<div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/snare_bear.png"></p><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/snare_bear.png"></p></div></figure></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/fish_and_carrots.png"></p><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/fish_and_carrots.png"></p></div></figure></div><div><p>OKVQA</p><div><p>Question:</p><p>“What instrument is the toy bear playing?”</p></div><div><p>OKVQA Score:</p><p>0 <span>(all reference answers are simply “drum”)</span></p></div></div><div><p>VQAv2</p><div><p>Question:</p><p>“What type of foods are in the image?”</p></div><div><p>Fuyu’s answer:</p><p>“fish, carrots”</p></div><div><p>VQAv2 Score:</p><p>0 <span>(reference answers were “hot dogs”, “sausages”, and “healthy”)</span></p></div></div></div>
<p>For the image on the left from the OKVQA dataset, when asked the question “What instrument is the toy bear playing?”, the model responds “snare”—which is clearly true!
However, it gets a score of 0, because all of the reference answers are simply “drum”.
Similarly, for the VQAv2 image on the right, when asked “What type of foods are in the image?”, the model corectly responds “fish, carrots”, but it also gets a score of 0 because the reference solution list doesn’t contain those words.</p>
<p><strong>Captioning Benchmarks</strong></p>
<p>It’s also common to evaluate image models using the COCO Captions benchmark.
The score used for this benchmark (CIDEr) is based on n-gram similarity to a group of reference captions, which are often poor.
We haven’t found performance on this benchmark corresponds particularly well to our internal evaluations.
In fact Fuyu-Medium is slightly worse by this metric than Fuyu-8B!</p>
<p>For the image below, our model gives the caption “A nighttime view of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament.”
This is correct, but it gets a score of 0.4 because it doesn’t match any of the reference captions (a good score is over 100).</p>
<div><figure><figure><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/big_ben.png"></p></figure><figcaption><div><div><p>Fuyu’s caption:</p><p>“A nighttime view of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament.”</p></div><div><p>Reference captions:</p><p>“A fast moving image of cars on a busy street with a tower clock in the background.”</p></div><div><p>“Lit up night traffic is zooming by a clock tower.”</p></div><div><p>“A city building is brightly lit and a lot of vehicles are driving by.”</p></div><div><p>“A large clock tower and traffic moving near.”</p></div><div><p>“there is a large tower with a clock on it.”</p></div><div><p>CIDEr Score:</p><p>0.4 <span>(No reference caption mentions Big Ben or Parliament)</span></p></div></div></figcaption></figure></div>
<h2 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>
<p>The Fuyu models have several cool capabilities that we preview here, including chart, diagram, and document understanding.</p>
<h2 id="chart-understanding">Chart Understanding</h2>
<p>Since our product is geared towards assisting knowledge workers, it’s important for our model to be able to understand charts and diagrams.
Here are some examples.</p>
<p>Fuyu can understand complex visual relationships, such as in the below chart, where it has to trace connections between actors and shows and count them to answer the question.</p>
<div><figure><figure><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/actors.png"></p></figure><figcaption><div><p>Question:</p><p>“Aidan Gillen acted in how many series?”</p></div><div><p>Fuyu’s answer:</p><p>“2”</p></div></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>It can also answer nontrivial, multi-hop questions given traditional charts.</p>
<div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/twitter_graph.png"></p><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/twitter_graph.png"></p></div></figure></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/vacation_days.png"></p><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/vacation_days.png"></p></div></figure></div><div><p>Question:</p><p>“Find missing data of the sequence 24, _ ,32, 33, 42?”</p></div><div><p>Question:</p><p>“What was the fair amount of paid vacation days in the UK?”</p></div></div>
<h2 id="document-understanding">Document Understanding</h2>
<p>Fuyu can also understand documents — both complex infographics and old PDFs:</p>
<div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/jobs.png"></p><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/jobs.png"></p></div></figure></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/pack_spinner.png"></p><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/pack_spinner.png"></p></div></figure></div><div><div><p>Question:</p><p>“Which is the metro in California that has a good job Outlook?”</p></div><div><p>Fuyu’s answer:</p><p>“Los Angeles”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Question:</p><p>“What was the pack spinner capacity?”</p></div><div><p>Fuyu’s answer:</p><p>“118 packs.”</p></div></div></div>
<h2 id="diagram-understanding">Diagram Understanding</h2>
<p>Finally, the model can understand complex relational queries about scientific diagrams:</p>
<div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/leaf_shapes.png"></p><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/leaf_shapes.png"></p></div></figure></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/red_tree_vole.png"></p><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/red_tree_vole.png"></p></div></figure></div><div><div><p>Question:</p><p>“What letter does a keel-shaped cross-section look like?”</p></div><div><p>Fuyu’s answer:</p><p>“The letter V”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Question:</p><p>“If in the food web shown in the diagram, Douglas fir tree needles are absent, which organism would starve?”</p></div><div><p>Fuyu’s answer:</p><p>“Red tree vole”</p></div></div></div>
<h2 id="new-capabilities-sneak-peek">New Capabilities Sneak-Peek</h2>
<p>Our internal models (based on Fuyu) have extra capabilities related to our product. In particular,</p>
<ol>
<li>They can reliably perform OCR on high-resolution images</li>
<li>They can do fine-grained localization of text and UI elements within those images</li>
<li>They can answer questions about images of UIs</li>
</ol>
<p>Since these capabilities are built off of the Fuyu model class (and underly our upcoming product release), we thought it would be interesting to preview some of them.</p>
<h2 id="ocr-capabilities">OCR Capabilities</h2>
<p>We’ve trained our internal models to do the following two tasks given an image of a UI:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given a bounding box, tell us what text lies inside that bounding box (<code>bbox_to_text</code>)</li>
<li>Given some text, return to us the bounding box that contains that text (<code>text_to_bbox</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider the following 1920x1080 image from one of our validation sets:</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/ocr_example.png"></p></figure>
<p>The blue boxes represent bounding box coordinates that have been passed to the model for the <code>bbox_to_text</code> task.
For this example, the model correctly predicted the text contents of every blue bounding box.</p>
<p>The red boxes represent predicted bounding boxes and green boxes represent target bounding boxes for the <code>text_to_bbox</code> task.
The model is good enough at bounding box prediction that the red and green boxes overlap almost completely.</p>
<h2 id="localization-and-qa-capabilities">Localization and QA Capabilities</h2>
<p>The model can also locate things on the screen based on informal text commands, as well as answer detailed factual questions about the contents of UIs:</p>
<div><figure><figure><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/gmail_qa.png"></p></figure><figcaption><div><p>Question:</p><p>“is the 2nd email starred? [‘yes’, ‘no’]”</p></div><div><p>Fuyu’s answer:</p><p>“no”</p></div></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Or consider the below example, where the model can interact with Google Maps to correctly answer questions<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-domnote" id="user-content-fnref-domnote" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>.</p>
<div><figure><figure><p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/fuyu-8b/maps_qa.png"></p></figure><figcaption><div><p>Question:</p><p>“is La Taqueria north of the 24th St Mission Bart station?”</p></div><div><p>Fuyu’s answer:</p><p>“no”</p></div></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>—</p>
<p>Both the model weights and some example code are <a href="https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b">on HuggingFace</a>.
We look forward to seeing what you build with it, and please reach out if you have any questions.
Stay tuned for more on our product alpha, which will incorporate these and other changes and is coming soon!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon’s 10,000 Rivian-made all-electric van are delivering packages throughout the United States, the e-commerce company revealed Tuesday evening during its Delivering the Future event.</p>
<p>Amazon, which owns a stake in Rivian, reached a deal with the automaker in 2019 to have at least 100,000 electric delivery vans on the road by 2030. The order is part of Amazon’s climate pledge to become carbon neutral by 2040.</p>
<p>Amazon began rolling out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/21/amazon-starts-delivering-packages-with-rivian-built-evs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electric delivery vans</a> in summer 2022. The majority of the electric delivery vans are in the U.S., split across 1,800 or so cities. Amazon started bringing the electric delivery vans <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/03/rivian-delivers-first-electric-vans-to-amazon-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Europe</a> this summer and recently announced plans to deploy more than 300 vans in Germany.</p>
<p>The custom electric delivery van is one of three vehicles that Rivian is developing or producing. Its other two vehicles, the R1T pickup and R1S SUV, are consumer EVs. Rivian said earlier this month it expects to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/02/rivian-q3-deliveries-beat-expectations-jump-23-from-previous-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> produce 52,000 vehicles</a> — a group that includes the vans — by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The vehicles, which are assembled at Rivian’s factory in Normal, Illinois, share some of the same design features found in today’s gas-powered versions. The new EV vans have a few more rounded edges, giving them an overall sleeker appearance. The real difference is in the electric architecture and the custom features that have been integrated into the vans, including highway driving and traffic assist features, exterior cameras that can provide a 360-degree view for the driver via a digital display, and surround taillights for better braking visibility.</p>
<p>As part of Amazon’s climate pledge, the company has also launched a $2 billion climate fund to invest in startups that fit into its net-zero vision. Rivian as well as Redwood Materials, CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama and Turntide Technologies are few of the companies that Amazon has invested in through the climate fund.</p>

<p>This article explains the new features in Python 3.12, compared to 3.11.
Python 3.12 was released on October 2, 2023.
For full details, see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#changelog"><span>changelog</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<section id="summary-release-highlights">
<h2>Summary – Release highlights<a href="#summary-release-highlights" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python 3.12 is the latest stable release of the Python programming language,
with a mix of changes to the language and the standard library.
The library changes focus on cleaning up deprecated APIs, usability, and correctness.
Of note, the <code><span>distutils</span></code> package has been removed from the standard library.
Filesystem support in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os" title="os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces."><code><span>os</span></code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#module-pathlib" title="pathlib: Object-oriented filesystem paths"><code><span>pathlib</span></code></a> has seen a number of improvements,
and several modules have better performance.</p>
<p>The language changes focus on usability,
as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-f-string"><span>f-strings</span></a> have had many limitations removed
and ‘Did you mean …’ suggestions continue to improve.
The new <a href="#whatsnew312-pep695"><span>type parameter syntax</span></a>
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#type"><code><span>type</span></code></a> statement improve ergonomics for using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generic-type"><span>generic types</span></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-type-alias"><span>type aliases</span></a> with static type checkers.</p>
<p>This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification of all new features,
but instead gives a convenient overview.
For full details, you should refer to the documentation,
such as the  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index"><span>Library Reference</span></a>
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index"><span>Language Reference</span></a>.
If you want to understand the complete implementation and design rationale for a change,
refer to the PEP for a particular new feature;
but note that PEPs usually are not kept up-to-date
once a feature has been fully implemented.</p>

<span id="whatsnew312-pep695"></span><h3>PEP 695: Type Parameter Syntax<a href="#pep-695-type-parameter-syntax" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Generic classes and functions under <span id="index-3"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/"><strong>PEP 484</strong></a> were declared using a verbose syntax
that left the scope of type parameters unclear and required explicit declarations of
variance.</p>
<p><span id="index-4"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/"><strong>PEP 695</strong></a> introduces a new, more compact and explicit way to create
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-classes"><span>generic classes</span></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-functions"><span>functions</span></a>:</p>

        <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In addition, the PEP introduces a new way to declare <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#type-aliases"><span>type aliases</span></a>
using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#type"><code><span>type</span></code></a> statement, which creates an instance of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeAliasType" title="typing.TypeAliasType"><code><span>TypeAliasType</span></code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Point</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>[</span><span>float</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Type aliases can also be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#generic-type-aliases"><span>generic</span></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Point</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The new syntax allows declaring <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVarTuple" title="typing.TypeVarTuple"><code><span>TypeVarTuple</span></code></a>
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.ParamSpec" title="typing.ParamSpec"><code><span>ParamSpec</span></code></a> parameters, as well as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVar" title="typing.TypeVar"><code><span>TypeVar</span></code></a>
parameters with bounds or constraints:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>IntFunc</span><span>[</span><span>**</span><span>P</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[</span><span>P</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]</span>  <span># ParamSpec</span>
<span>type</span> <span>LabeledTuple</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>Ts</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>Ts</span><span>]</span>  <span># TypeVarTuple</span>
<span>type</span> <span>HashableSequence</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Hashable</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Sequence</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>]</span>  <span># TypeVar with bound</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The value of type aliases and the bound and constraints of type variables
created through this syntax are evaluated only on demand (see
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#lazy-evaluation"><span>lazy evaluation</span></a>). This means type aliases are able to
refer to other types defined later in the file.</p>
<p>Type parameters declared through a type parameter list are visible within the
scope of the declaration and any nested scopes, but not in the outer scope. For
example, they can be used in the type annotations for the methods of a generic
class or in the class body. However, they cannot be used in the module scope after
the class is defined. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params"><span>Type parameter lists</span></a> for a detailed description of the
runtime semantics of type parameters.</p>
<p>In order to support these scoping semantics, a new kind of scope is introduced,
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#annotation-scopes"><span>annotation scope</span></a>. Annotation scopes behave for the
most part like function scopes, but interact differently with enclosing class scopes.
In Python 3.13, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-annotation"><span>annotations</span></a> will also be evaluated in
annotation scopes.</p>

<section id="pep-701-syntactic-formalization-of-f-strings">
<span id="whatsnew312-pep701"></span><h3>PEP 701: Syntactic formalization of f-strings<a href="#pep-701-syntactic-formalization-of-f-strings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-6"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/"><strong>PEP 701</strong></a> lifts some restrictions on the usage of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-f-string"><span>f-strings</span></a>.
Expression components inside f-strings can now be any valid Python expression,
including strings reusing the same quote as the containing f-string,
multi-line expressions, comments, backslashes, and unicode escape sequences.
Let’s cover these in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Quote reuse: in Python 3.11, reusing the same quotes as the enclosing f-string
raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError" title="SyntaxError"><code><span>SyntaxError</span></code></a>, forcing the user to either use other available
quotes (like using double quotes or triple quotes if the f-string uses single
quotes). In Python 3.12, you can now do things like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>songs</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'Take me back to Eden'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Alkaline'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ascensionism'</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>f</span><span>"This is the playlist: </span><span>{</span><span>", "</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>songs</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>'This is the playlist: Take me back to Eden, Alkaline, Ascensionism'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that before this change there was no explicit limit in how f-strings can
be nested, but the fact that string quotes cannot be reused inside the
expression component of f-strings made it impossible to nest f-strings
arbitrarily. In fact, this is the most nested f-string that could be written:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>f</span><span>"""</span><span>{</span><span>f</span><span>'''</span><span>{</span><span>f</span><span>'</span><span>{</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>}</span><span>'</span><span>}</span><span>'''</span><span>}</span><span>"""</span>
<span>'2'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As now f-strings can contain any valid Python expression inside expression
components, it is now possible to nest f-strings arbitrarily:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>'2'</span>
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-line expressions and comments: In Python 3.11, f-string expressions
must be defined in a single line, even if the expression within the f-string
could normally span multiple lines
(like literal lists being defined over multiple lines),
making them harder to read. In Python 3.12 you can now define f-strings
spanning multiple lines, and add inline comments:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f"This is the playlist: {", ".join([
...     'Take me back to Eden',  # My, my, those eyes like fire
...     'Alkaline',              # Not acid nor alkaline
...     'Ascensionism'           # Take to the broken skies at last
... ])}"
'This is the playlist: Take me back to Eden, Alkaline, Ascensionism'
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Backslashes and unicode characters: before Python 3.12 f-string expressions
couldn’t contain any <code><span>\</span></code> character. This also affected unicode <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#escape-sequences"><span>escape
sequences</span></a> (such as <code><span>\N{snowman}</span></code>) as these contain
the <code><span>\N</span></code> part that previously could not be part of expression components of
f-strings. Now, you can define expressions like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"This is the playlist: </span><span>{</span><span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>songs</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>This is the playlist: Take me back to Eden</span>
<span>Alkaline</span>
<span>Ascensionism</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"This is the playlist: </span><span>{</span><span>"</span><span>\N{BLACK HEART SUIT}</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>songs</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>This is the playlist: Take me back to Eden♥Alkaline♥Ascensionism</span>
</pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See <span id="index-7"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/"><strong>PEP 701</strong></a> for more details.</p>
<p>As a positive side-effect of how this feature has been implemented (by parsing f-strings
with <span id="index-8"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0617/"><strong>the PEG parser</strong></a>), now error messages for f-strings are more precise
and include the exact location of the error. For example, in Python 3.11, the following
f-string raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError" title="SyntaxError"><code><span>SyntaxError</span></code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>my_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>z</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>+</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span>1</span>
<span>    </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>z</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>     </span><span>^^^</span>
<span>SyntaxError</span>: <span>f-string: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?</span>
</pre></div>
<p>but the error message doesn’t include the exact location of the error within the line and
also has the expression artificially surrounded by parentheses. In Python 3.12, as f-strings
are parsed with the PEG parser, error messages can be more precise and show the entire line:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>my_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>z</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>+</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span>1</span>
<span>    </span><span>my_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>z</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>+</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>                   </span><span>^^^</span>
<span>SyntaxError</span>: <span>invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?</span>

<span id="whatsnew312-pep709"></span><h3>PEP 709: Comprehension inlining<a href="#pep-709-comprehension-inlining" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Dictionary, list, and set comprehensions are now inlined, rather than creating a
new single-use function object for each execution of the comprehension. This
speeds up execution of a comprehension by up to two times.
See <span id="index-13"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0709/"><strong>PEP 709</strong></a> for further details.</p>
<p>Comprehension iteration variables remain isolated and don’t overwrite a
variable of the same name in the outer scope, nor are they visible after the
comprehension. Inlining does result in a few visible behavior changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no longer a separate frame for the comprehension in tracebacks,
and tracing/profiling no longer shows the comprehension as a function call.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/symtable.html#module-symtable" title="symtable: Interface to the compiler's internal symbol tables."><code><span>symtable</span></code></a> module will no longer produce child symbol tables for each
comprehension; instead, the comprehension’s locals will be included in the
parent function’s symbol table.</p></li>
<li><p>Calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#locals" title="locals"><code><span>locals()</span></code></a> inside a comprehension now includes variables
from outside the comprehension, and no longer includes the synthetic <code><span>.0</span></code>
variable for the comprehension “argument”.</p></li>
<li><p>A comprehension iterating directly over <code><span>locals()</span></code> (e.g. <code><span>[k</span> <span>for</span> <span>k</span> <span>in</span>
<span>locals()]</span></code>) may see “RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration”
when run under tracing (e.g. code coverage measurement). This is the same
behavior already seen in e.g. <code><span>for</span> <span>k</span> <span>in</span> <span>locals():</span></code>. To avoid the error, first
create a list of keys to iterate over: <code><span>keys</span> <span>=</span> <span>list(locals());</span> <span>[k</span> <span>for</span> <span>k</span> <span>in</span>
<span>keys]</span></code>.</p></li>

null bytes. (Contributed by Pablo Galindo in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96670">gh-96670</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>A backslash-character pair that is not a valid escape sequence now generates

(<code><span>"\d"</span></code> is an invalid escape sequence, use raw strings for regular

In a future Python version, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError" title="SyntaxError"><code><span>SyntaxError</span></code></a> will eventually be raised,
instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxWarning" title="SyntaxWarning"><code><span>SyntaxWarning</span></code></a>.
(Contributed by Victor Stinner in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98401">gh-98401</a>.)</p></li>

<h3>Pending Removal in Future Versions<a href="#pending-removal-in-future-versions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following APIs were deprecated in earlier Python versions and will be removed,
although there is currently no date scheduled for their removal.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html#module-array" title="array: Space efficient arrays of uniformly typed numeric values."><code><span>array</span></code></a>’s <code><span>'u'</span></code> format code (<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/57281">gh-57281</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Currently Python accepts numeric literals immediately followed by keywords,
for example <code><span>0in</span> <span>x</span></code>, <code><span>1or</span> <span>x</span></code>, <code><span>0if</span> <span>1else</span> <span>2</span></code>.  It allows confusing
and ambiguous expressions like <code><span>[0x1for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>y]</span></code> (which can be
interpreted as <code><span>[0x1</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>y]</span></code> or <code><span>[0x1f</span> <span>or</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>y]</span></code>).
A syntax warning is raised if the numeric literal is
immediately followed by one of keywords <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#and"><code><span>and</span></code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#else"><code><span>else</span></code></a>,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for"><code><span>for</span></code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if"><code><span>if</span></code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in"><code><span>in</span></code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is"><code><span>is</span></code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#or"><code><span>or</span></code></a>.
In a future release it will be changed to a syntax error. (<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87999">gh-87999</a>)</p></li>

lock contention. This means that a cached property getter function could now run
more than once for a single instance, if two threads race. For most simple
cached properties (e.g. those that are idempotent and simply calculate a value
based on other attributes of the instance) this will be fine.  If
synchronization is needed, implement locking within the cached property getter

tokens described in <span id="index-38"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/"><strong>PEP 701</strong></a> are now produced instead: <code><span>FSTRING_START</span></code>,
<code><span>FSTRING_MIDDLE</span></code> and <code><span>FSTRING_END</span></code> are now emitted for f-string “string”
parts in addition to the appropriate tokens for the tokenization in the
expression components. For example for the f-string <code><span>f"start</span> <span>{1+1}</span> <span>end"</span></code>
the old version of the tokenizer emitted:</p>

<p>Additionally, there may be some minor behavioral changes as a consequence of the
changes required to support <span id="index-39"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/"><strong>PEP 701</strong></a>. Some of these changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code><span>type</span></code> attribute of the tokens emitted when tokenizing some invalid Python
characters such as <code><span>!</span></code> has changed from <code><span>ERRORTOKEN</span></code> to <code><span>OP</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Incomplete single-line strings now also raise <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tokenize.html#tokenize.TokenError" title="tokenize.TokenError"><code><span>tokenize.TokenError</span></code></a> as incomplete
multiline strings do.</p></li>
<li><p>Some incomplete or invalid Python code now raises <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tokenize.html#tokenize.TokenError" title="tokenize.TokenError"><code><span>tokenize.TokenError</span></code></a> instead of
returning arbitrary <code><span>ERRORTOKEN</span></code> tokens when tokenizing it.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixing tabs and spaces as indentation in the same file is not supported anymore and will
raise a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TabError" title="TabError"><code><span>TabError</span></code></a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Python no longer uses <code><span>setup.py</span></code> to build shared C extension modules.
Build parameters like headers and libraries are detected in <code><span>configure</span></code>
script. Extensions are built by <code><span>Makefile</span></code>. Most extensions use
<code><span>pkg-config</span></code> and fall back to manual detection.

</li>
<li><p><span id="index-42"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0697/"><strong>PEP 697</strong></a>: Add an API for extending types whose instance memory layout is
opaque:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>API for creating objects that can be called using
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/call.html#vectorcall"><span>the vectorcall protocol</span></a> was added to the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable"><span>Limited API</span></a>:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL" title="Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL"><code><span>Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL</span></code></a> flag is now removed from a class
when the class’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__call__" title="object.__call__"><code><span>__call__()</span></code></a> method is reassigned.
This makes vectorcall safe to use with mutable types (i.e. heap types
without the immutable flag, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE" title="Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE"><code><span>Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE</span></code></a>).
Mutable types that do not override <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_call" title="PyTypeObject.tp_call"><code><span>tp_call</span></code></a> now

<code><span>__dict__</span></code> and weakrefs with less bookkeeping,
using less memory and with faster access.</p>
</li>
<li><p>API for performing calls using

<h3>Porting to Python 3.12<a href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Legacy Unicode APIs based on <code><span>Py_UNICODE*</span></code> representation has been removed.
Please migrate to APIs based on UTF-8 or <code><span>wchar_t*</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Argument parsing functions like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html#c.PyArg_ParseTuple" title="PyArg_ParseTuple"><code><span>PyArg_ParseTuple()</span></code></a> doesn’t support
<code><span>Py_UNICODE*</span></code> based format (e.g. <code><span>u</span></code>, <code><span>Z</span></code>) anymore. Please migrate
to other formats for Unicode like <code><span>s</span></code>, <code><span>z</span></code>, <code><span>es</span></code>, and <code><span>U</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>tp_weaklist</span></code> for all static builtin types is always <code><span>NULL</span></code>.
This is an internal-only field on <code><span>PyTypeObject</span></code>
but we’re pointing out the change in case someone happens to be
accessing the field directly anyway.  To avoid breakage, consider
using the existing public C-API instead, or, if necessary, the
(internal-only) <code><span>_PyObject_GET_WEAKREFS_LISTPTR()</span></code> macro.</p></li>
<li><p>This internal-only <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses" title="PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses"><code><span>PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses</span></code></a> may now not be
a valid object pointer.  Its type was changed to <span><span>void</span><span>*</span></span> to
reflect this.  We mention this in case someone happens to be accessing the
internal-only field directly.</p>
<p>To get a list of subclasses, call the Python method
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#class.__subclasses__" title="class.__subclasses__"><code><span>__subclasses__()</span></code></a> (using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/call.html#c.PyObject_CallMethod" title="PyObject_CallMethod"><code><span>PyObject_CallMethod()</span></code></a>,
for example).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add support of more formatting options (left aligning, octals, uppercase
hexadecimals, <code><span>intmax_t</span></code>, <code><span>ptrdiff_t</span></code>, <code><span>wchar_t</span></code> C
strings, variable width and precision) in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicode_FromFormat" title="PyUnicode_FromFormat"><code><span>PyUnicode_FromFormat()</span></code></a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicode_FromFormatV" title="PyUnicode_FromFormatV"><code><span>PyUnicode_FromFormatV()</span></code></a>.
(Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98836">gh-98836</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>An unrecognized format character in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicode_FromFormat" title="PyUnicode_FromFormat"><code><span>PyUnicode_FromFormat()</span></code></a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicode_FromFormatV" title="PyUnicode_FromFormatV"><code><span>PyUnicode_FromFormatV()</span></code></a> now sets a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemError" title="SystemError"><code><span>SystemError</span></code></a>.
In previous versions it caused all the rest of the format string to be
copied as-is to the result string, and any extra arguments discarded.

<li><p>Extension classes wanting to add a <code><span>__dict__</span></code> or weak reference slot
should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_DICT" title="Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_DICT"><code><span>Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_DICT</span></code></a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_WEAKREF" title="Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_WEAKREF"><code><span>Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_WEAKREF</span></code></a> instead of <code><span>tp_dictoffset</span></code> and
<code><span>tp_weaklistoffset</span></code>, respectively.
The use of <code><span>tp_dictoffset</span></code> and <code><span>tp_weaklistoffset</span></code> is still
supported, but does not fully support multiple inheritance
(<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95589">gh-95589</a>), and performance may be worse.
Classes declaring <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_DICT" title="Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_DICT"><code><span>Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_DICT</span></code></a> should call
<code><span>_PyObject_VisitManagedDict()</span></code> and <code><span>_PyObject_ClearManagedDict()</span></code>
to traverse and clear their instance’s dictionaries.
To clear weakrefs, call <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/weakref.html#c.PyObject_ClearWeakRefs" title="PyObject_ClearWeakRefs"><code><span>PyObject_ClearWeakRefs()</span></code></a>, as before.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicode_FSDecoder" title="PyUnicode_FSDecoder"><code><span>PyUnicode_FSDecoder()</span></code></a> function no longer accepts bytes-like
paths, like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray" title="bytearray"><code><span>bytearray</span></code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview" title="memoryview"><code><span>memoryview</span></code></a> types: only the exact
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes" title="bytes"><code><span>bytes</span></code></a> type is accepted for bytes strings.

<li><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_CLEAR" title="Py_CLEAR"><code><span>Py_CLEAR</span></code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_SETREF" title="Py_SETREF"><code><span>Py_SETREF</span></code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_XSETREF" title="Py_XSETREF"><code><span>Py_XSETREF</span></code></a>
macros now only evaluate their arguments once. If an argument has side
effects, these side effects are no longer duplicated.
(Contributed by Victor Stinner in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98724">gh-98724</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>The interpreter’s error indicator is now always normalized. This means
that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/exceptions.html#c.PyErr_SetObject" title="PyErr_SetObject"><code><span>PyErr_SetObject()</span></code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/exceptions.html#c.PyErr_SetString" title="PyErr_SetString"><code><span>PyErr_SetString()</span></code></a> and the other
functions that set the error indicator now normalize the exception
before storing it. (Contributed by Mark Shannon in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101578">gh-101578</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>_Py_RefTotal</span></code> is no longer authoritative and only kept around
for ABI compatibility.  Note that it is an internal global and only
available on debug builds.  If you happen to be using it then you’ll
need to start using <code><span>_Py_GetGlobalRefTotal()</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The following functions now select an appropriate metaclass for the newly
created type:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_FromSpec" title="PyType_FromSpec"><code><span>PyType_FromSpec()</span></code></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_FromSpecWithBases" title="PyType_FromSpecWithBases"><code><span>PyType_FromSpecWithBases()</span></code></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_FromModuleAndSpec" title="PyType_FromModuleAndSpec"><code><span>PyType_FromModuleAndSpec()</span></code></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Creating classes whose metaclass overrides <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_new" title="PyTypeObject.tp_new"><code><span>tp_new</span></code></a>
is deprecated, and in Python 3.14+ it will be disallowed.
Note that these functions ignore <code><span>tp_new</span></code> of the metaclass, possibly
allowing incomplete initialization.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_FromMetaclass" title="PyType_FromMetaclass"><code><span>PyType_FromMetaclass()</span></code></a> (added in Python 3.12)
already disallows creating classes whose metaclass overrides <code><span>tp_new</span></code>
(<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__" title="object.__new__"><code><span>__new__()</span></code></a> in Python).</p>
<p>Since <code><span>tp_new</span></code> overrides almost everything <code><span>PyType_From*</span></code> functions do,
the two are incompatible with each other.
The existing behavior – ignoring the metaclass for several steps
of type creation – is unsafe in general, since (meta)classes assume that
<code><span>tp_new</span></code> was called.
There is no simple general workaround. One of the following may work for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you control the metaclass, avoid using <code><span>tp_new</span></code> in it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If initialization can be skipped, it can be done in
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_init" title="PyTypeObject.tp_init"><code><span>tp_init</span></code></a> instead.</p></li>
<li><p>If the metaclass doesn’t need to be instantiated from Python,
set its <code><span>tp_new</span></code> to <code><span>NULL</span></code> using
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.Py_TPFLAGS_DISALLOW_INSTANTIATION" title="Py_TPFLAGS_DISALLOW_INSTANTIATION"><code><span>Py_TPFLAGS_DISALLOW_INSTANTIATION</span></code></a> flag.
This makes it acceptable for <code><span>PyType_From*</span></code> functions.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid <code><span>PyType_From*</span></code> functions: if you don’t need C-specific features
(slots or setting the instance size), create types by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/call.html#call"><span>calling</span></a>
the metaclass.</p></li>
<li><p>If you <em>know</em> the <code><span>tp_new</span></code> can be skipped safely, filter the deprecation
warning out using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warnings.catch_warnings" title="warnings.catch_warnings"><code><span>warnings.catch_warnings()</span></code></a> from Python.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/veryhigh.html#c.PyOS_InputHook" title="PyOS_InputHook"><code><span>PyOS_InputHook</span></code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/veryhigh.html#c.PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer" title="PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer"><code><span>PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer</span></code></a> are no
longer called in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#sub-interpreter-support"><span>subinterpreters</span></a>. This is
because clients generally rely on process-wide global state (since these
callbacks have no way of recovering extension module state).</p>
<p>This also avoids situations where extensions may find themselves running in a
subinterpreter that they don’t support (or haven’t yet been loaded in). See
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104668">gh-104668</a> for more info.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLongObject" title="PyLongObject"><code><span>PyLongObject</span></code></a> has had its internals changed for better performance.
Although the internals of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLongObject" title="PyLongObject"><code><span>PyLongObject</span></code></a> are private, they are used
by some extension modules.
The internal fields should no longer be accessed directly, instead the API
functions beginning <code><span>PyLong_...</span></code> should be used instead.
Two new <em>unstable</em> API functions are provided for efficient access to the
value of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLongObject" title="PyLongObject"><code><span>PyLongObject</span></code></a>s which fit into a single machine word:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyUnstable_Long_IsCompact" title="PyUnstable_Long_IsCompact"><code><span>PyUnstable_Long_IsCompact()</span></code></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyUnstable_Long_CompactValue" title="PyUnstable_Long_CompactValue"><code><span>PyUnstable_Long_CompactValue()</span></code></a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Custom allocators, set via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html#c.PyMem_SetAllocator" title="PyMem_SetAllocator"><code><span>PyMem_SetAllocator()</span></code></a>, are now
required to be thread-safe, regardless of memory domain.  Allocators
that don’t have their own state, including “hooks”, are not affected.
If your custom allocator is not already thread-safe and you need
guidance then please create a new GitHub issue
and CC <code><span>@ericsnowcurrently</span></code>.</p></li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/the-fake-browser-update-scam-gets-a-makeover/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/the-fake-browser-update-scam-gets-a-makeover/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37930634">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>One of the oldest malware tricks in the book — hacked websites claiming visitors need to update their Web browser before they can view any content — has roared back to life in the past few months. New research shows the attackers behind one such scheme have developed an ingenious way of keeping their malware from being taken down by security experts or law enforcement: By hosting the malicious files on a decentralized, anonymous cryptocurrency blockchain.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fakechromeupdate.png" alt="an image of a warning that the Chrome browser needs to be updated, showing several devices (phone, monitor, etc.) open to Google and an enticing blue button to click in the middle." width="749" height="478" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fakechromeupdate.png 785w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fakechromeupdate-768x490.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fakechromeupdate-782x499.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p>
<p>In August 2023, security researcher <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@rmceoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Randy McEoin</a> blogged about a scam he dubbed <a href="https://rmceoin.github.io/malware-analysis/clearfake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClearFake</a>, which uses hacked WordPress sites to serve visitors with a page that claims you need to update your browser before you can view the content.</p>
<p>The fake browser alerts are specific to the browser you’re using, so if you’re surfing the Web with Chrome, for example, you’ll get a Chrome update prompt. Those who are fooled into clicking the update button will have a malicious file dropped on their system that tries to install an information stealing trojan.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, researchers at the Tel Aviv-based security firm <strong>Guardio</strong> said they tracked an updated version of the ClearFake scam that included an important evolution. Previously, the group had stored its malicious update files on Cloudflare, Guardio said.</p>
<p>But when Cloudflare blocked those accounts the attackers began storing their malicious files as cryptocurrency transactions in the <strong>Binance Smart Chain</strong> (BSC), a technology designed to run decentralized apps and “smart contracts,” or coded agreements that execute actions automatically when certain conditions are met.</p>
<p><strong>Nati Tal</strong>, head of security at <strong>Guardio Labs</strong>, the research unit at Guardio, said the malicious scripts stitched into hacked WordPress sites will create a new smart contract on the BSC Blockchain, starting with a unique, attacker-controlled blockchain address and a set of instructions that defines the contract’s functions and structure. When that contract is queried by a compromised website, it will return an obfuscated and malicious payload.</p>
<p>“These contracts offer innovative ways to build applications and processes,” Tal <a href="https://labs.guard.io/etherhiding-hiding-web2-malicious-code-in-web3-smart-contracts-65ea78efad16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> along with his Guardio colleague <strong>Oleg Zaytsev</strong>. “Due to the publicly accessible and unchangeable nature of the blockchain, code can be hosted ‘on-chain’ without the ability for a takedown.”</p>
<p>Tal said hosting malicious files on the Binance Smart Chain is ideal for attackers because retrieving the malicious contract is a cost-free operation that was originally designed for the purpose of debugging contract execution issues without any real-world impact.</p>
<p>“So you get a free, untracked, and robust way to get your data (the malicious payload) without leaving traces,” Tal said.<span id="more-65327"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_65371"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-65371" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fakebrowser-guardio.png" alt="" width="748" height="814"></p><p id="caption-attachment-65371">Attacker-controlled BSC addresses — from funding, contract creation, and ongoing code updates. Image: Guardio</p></div>
<p>In response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity, the <strong>BNB Smart Chain</strong> (BSC) said its team is aware of the malware abusing its blockchain, and is actively addressing the issue. The company said all addresses associated with the spread of the malware have been blacklisted, and that its technicians had developed a model to detect future smart contracts that use similar methods to host malicious scripts.</p>
<p>“This model is designed to proactively identify and mitigate potential threats before they can cause harm,” BNB Smart Chain wrote. “The team is committed to ongoing monitoring of addresses that are involved in spreading malware scripts on the BSC. To enhance their efforts, the tech team is working on linking identified addresses that spread malicious scripts to centralized KYC [Know Your Customer] information, when possible.”</p>
<p>Guardio says the crooks behind the BSC malware scheme are using the same malicious code as the attackers that McEoin wrote about in August, and are likely the same group. But a report published today by email security firm <strong>Proofpoint</strong> says the company is currently tracking at least four distinct threat actor groups that use fake browser updates to distribute malware.</p>
<p>Proofpoint notes that the core group behind the fake browser update scheme has been using this technique to spread malware for the past five years, primarily because the approach still works well.</p>
<p>“Fake browser update lures are effective because threat actors are using an end-user’s security training against them,” Proofpoint’s <strong>Dusty Miller</strong> <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/are-you-sure-your-browser-date-current-landscape-fake-browser-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. “In security awareness training, users are told to only accept updates or click on links from known and trusted sites, or individuals, and to verify sites are legitimate. The fake browser updates abuse this training because they compromise trusted sites and use JavaScript requests to quietly make checks in the background and overwrite the existing website with a browser update lure. To an end user, it still appears to be the same website they were intending to visit and is now asking them to update their browser.”</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, this site published <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/05/krebss-3-basic-rules-for-online-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Krebs’s Three Rules for Online Safety</a>, of which Rule #1 was, “<em>If you didn’t go looking for it, don’t install it.</em>” It’s nice to know that this technology-agnostic approach to online safety remains just as relevant today.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! Alex &amp; Jess here, cofounders at Pier (<a href="https://www.pier-finance.com/">https://www.pier-finance.com</a>). Pier is an API for launching credit products. We enable any company to offer credit by handling origination, underwriting, compliance and servicing with just a few lines of code.</p><p>There’s no ‘try it out’ link, primarily because (as most fintech devs know) there are compliance and regulatory thresholds that make it hard for us to give out sandbox keys freely. However, we’ve put together this video to show you the basics of how Pier works: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/04883eb17f394b46a67cce919cb77356" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.loom.com/share/04883eb17f394b46a67cce919cb77356</a>.</p><p>Alex &amp; I worked together at our last company, a credit tech startup, where we saw how businesses struggle to launch credit products quickly &amp; compliantly, due to fragmented solutions and high compliance hurdles. We’ve talked to many companies looking to launch their own product, and are taking our learnings from before to build a modular, flexible credit stack.</p><p>Credit is highly complex and requires a dedicated team -—and few people specialize in this. Unlike social apps where you can launch with a 70% product and iterate over time, credit is heavily regulated and needs to be done 100% right from the beginning. When you factor this in with federal and state regulations across 50 states, the tech stack and compliance hurdles become too time-consuming and expensive for companies to build in-house, especially for fast-moving teams trying to build innovative products. We’re talking 9-12 months of buildout and millions of dollars. This is what most companies struggle with and it’s why we’re valuable to them.</p><p>Our credit infrastructure gives developers the freedom of not having to worry about the details of managing a credit program. Using Pier, they can offer credit to their users without ever directing them outside their app. Our API powers it all under the hood (see API docs: <a href="https://pier-dev.readme.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pier-dev.readme.io</a>)</p><p>For example, a business (say "ACME") has a user who comes to their platform &amp; applies for a loan. That user stays on ACME’s platform and is never redirected to a 3rd party. ACME owns the entire UX from presenting loan offer, to signing loan docs, to disbursing funds, sending statements and collecting payments. What ACME doesn’t have to deal with is any of the back end. Each part of this flow is powered by Pier API.</p><p>We support the full credit lifecycle from loan origination to loan servicing. Want to generate a loan doc for a specific credit offer &amp; user? We've an endpoint that creates a pdf to present to the user, and ensures it doesn’t violate any laws for the state the user is in. Want to retrieve loan balance, generate loan statement or process loan payment? We've API endpoints for that too.</p><p>There're existing products that solve parts of the credit stack, such as KYC &amp; underwriting, but nothing that solves the credit stack end-to-end. Credit is different from payments and banking-—those are 1x activities, while loan terms are for 12 months or more. We see “credit” as a living-and-breathing creature that evolves throughout each loan’s life cycle due to a variety of behaviors, hence requires an end-to-end solution to properly address.</p><p>Since launching a few months ago, we’ve onboarded several customers and have live loan traffic on our platform. Our existing customers use Pier to provide a wide variety of credit products to their users, including BNPL for wedding, credit builder, BNPL for clean energy, salary advance loans, portfolio line of credit, etc.</p><p>Pricing - Monthly min Saas fee ($7-20k/mth), and a usage fee of 0.2-1.0% of loan volume for origination and servicing. This largely depends on the credit program and loan volume.</p><p>We’re building devtools to enable the next-gen of credit products, with our goal to make credit more accessible to everyone! We’re super eager to get your feedback — What’s your experience building in fintech/credit? What can we do to make this better? Anything else that comes to mind? Thank you!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

At the start of the study, 20% of participants reported some level of smell or taste loss. After the third day of treatment, the proportion of participants reporting such symptoms in the ensitrelvir groups started dropping more sharply than did the proportion in the placebo group.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In large tech companies these days, it is becoming common for front-end developers to talk about “micro frontends”. MFEs are analogous to microservices in backend systems. But just like we’ve all seen bad microservice architectures that simply worsened a distributed monolith, a bad micro-frontend architecture just spreads tightly-coupled code across many moving parts.</p>
<p>My argument is not that MFEs never pay off their complexity. I think that for a sufficiently large team, with well factored domains, having separate pipelines within a monorepo arrangements is a reasonable design for keeping teams moving independently.</p>
<p>But my scepticism is that few teams are in this position, and the ones that are, should work on factoring their domains first, before adopting a more complex architecture. The many moving parts of MFEs make it much harder to release, move and test code in a coherent effort.</p>
<p>Instead, start with a modular monolith and do the hard work of refactoring your domains before the easy work of creating new pipelines.</p>
<h2 id="A-primer-on-micro-frontends"><a href="#A-primer-on-micro-frontends" title="A primer on micro-frontends"></a>A primer on micro-frontends</h2><p><em>Micro-frontends</em> (MFEs) are not a stupid idea. We all intuitively know that software systems are easier to evolve if they can be split into isolated parts. There’s no intrinsic reason that front-end JavaScript apps don’t benefit from the same modularisation once they reach a certain size.</p>
<p>Microservices are similar. The idea of microservices on the backend was originally sold as a way to make systems more scalable under load, but the real motive was that it’s easier to scale teams if each one gets its own walled context to work in, free of interference.</p>
<p>MFEs have history. Back in 2016 I worked on an MFE-like architecture at The Guardian, where our goal was to completely isolate the ad-tech, news and feature code, which meant that you could read the news without waiting for, say, the <em>crosswords</em> code to download, or the adware bloat. These architectures weren’t called anything because they were just solutions to specific technical problems.</p>
<p>Eventually enough companies found themselves doing this that they coined a name for it, micro-frontends, meant to evoke the intuitive benefits of microservices. The usual pattern is that instead of one JavaScript app in one repo with one pipeline, you split out N apps into N repos with N pipelines. Occasionally the apps are held in a monorepo arrangement, but that’s not universal.</p>
<h2 id="Problems-with-MFEs"><a href="#Problems-with-MFEs" title="Problems with MFEs"></a>Problems with MFEs</h2><p>Microfrontends are very popular on the conference circuit, so I am probably about to make future job interviews awkward by criticisng them. But I’m seeing enough teams adopt MFEs at the wrong time to feel concerned about the hype. My objections boil down to three core complaints</p>
<ol>
<li>A monolith distributed over separate parts is a world of pain</li>
<li>You need to refactor before you can split, but splitting first looks easier</li>
<li>MFEs can be a form of rewrite fever</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Don’t-distribute-your-monolith"><a href="#Don’t-distribute-your-monolith" title="Don’t distribute your monolith!"></a>Don’t distribute your monolith!</h3><p>Those of us who’ve worked on backend microservice transitions have probably witnessed an anti-pattern when instead of getting cleanly separated, independent microservices, we find ourselves with a complex hairball of dependencies now split over servers. This is dubbed a “distributed monolith” and it’s painful because the same interdependence still exists, but now it’s mediated over things like HTTP calls or events.</p>
<p>Most large frontend apps that would be candidates for MFEs have this level of interdependence. This leads to MFE architectures proposing some kind of context sharing or mechanism for passing around state. That could be JavaScript bundles exposing global functions or using <code>postMessage</code> as an event bus. The more state that gets shared, the more dependencies that exist, the further away you are from actual isolation.</p>
<p>Why is this worse than having interdependencies within a monolith? Because within a monolith, you can refactor very easily. You can remove the dependency from <code>A -&gt; B</code> by changing A and B in a single commit. You can understand the dependencies by looking around a single repository. You can have TypeScript verify that nothing is using A’s method any more. You probably have a single test pipeline to verify the change.</p>
<p>Microfrontends have overheads if you aren’t smart about this. You can end up having to deploy code in multiple places in careful orchestration. You can end up with shared code that has to be released with an awkward versioning mechanism. You have to invent a way to integration test everything. Your engineers have to sniff around multiple repositories to understand how the whole thing fits together. That’s not a scalable developer experience.</p>
<p>My view on MFEs, when they exist, is that any dependencies should be carefully vetted and factored down to the absolute minimum. At <em>The Guardian</em> our “MFEs” didn’t share <em>any</em> state at all. But factoring down dependencies hard when your code is a tightly-coupled mess, which leads to the next point.</p>
<h3 id="Decouple-before-you-split"><a href="#Decouple-before-you-split" title="Decouple before you split"></a>Decouple before you split</h3><p>So let’s say our frontend app is a hairball that’s full of interdependencies. How do we break that link? I think engineers - and managers! - are so excited about the prospect of escaping the monolith, they forget about the intermediary stage of actually chopping up the hairball.</p>
<p>Refactoring any code is hard, uncomfortable, and thankless, but just like brushing your teeth or going to gym you can only avoid it so long before the consequences get to you. If you try splitting an app without decoupling its parts, one of two things happen</p>
<ol>
<li>You get a distributed monolith (see above)</li>
<li>You manage to turn the isolated parts into MFEs (the pages with no dependencies), but the big complex pages never actually get migrated</li>
</ol>
<p>What does good decoupling look like?</p>
<ol>
<li>Each part of the code belongs to a distinct <em>domain</em>, a particular area of the business, or it belongs to a shared “support” domain</li>
<li>Each domain is, conversely, implemented in a distinct part of the code - it’s not smeared over several parts</li>
<li>The parts of the code interact over a small, well-factored interface. Ideally type-safe.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might be tempted to skip decoupling and say you’ll do it as you migrate the code. This is a bad idea. You end up in a half-migrated state where part of the code is moved but the rest can’t be decoupled. You want to minimise the scope of each incremental change you make, not try to combine refactoring and replatforming into a single mission.</p>
<h3 id="MFEs-can-be-a-form-of-rewrite-fever"><a href="#MFEs-can-be-a-form-of-rewrite-fever" title="MFEs can be a form of rewrite fever"></a>MFEs can be a form of rewrite fever</h3><p>Sometimes engineers (and manager) get so sick of working in a bad codebase that they fantasise about throwing the lot away. In microfrontend projects, teams sometimes feel they can use MFEs to effectively rewrite the codebase from scratch, avoiding all the complexity of the original project.</p>
<p>Rewrites are really dangerous. They’re tempting because writing code is much easier than reading it. Developers imagine that with modern tools and consolidated knowledge, they can do a much better job than the original engineers. There is a bit of main character syndome here (the last project was a disaster because _I_ didn’t write it). But the rewrite turns out to be more complicated than expected, because the old code was full of secrets and edge cases that weren’t obviously apparent.</p>
<p>My experience of rewrites is that they <em>start</em> great. Early on velocity seems high as you’re focused on scaffolding the new code and adding tools to the codebase. It’s when you start implementing the <em>features</em> that things get sticky. Rewrites are sold as everything to everyone and end up becoming a way bigger project than you first imagined.</p>
<p>Usually in MFEs the motiviation is a monolith codebase that’s bad enough, to make rewrites a strong temptation. But if you’ve reached that point, your pages and UI is too complex to just be rewritten in a few weeks. The <code>Product</code> page that accumulates five years of code is going to take a lot of work to understand and unpick alone. Moving it into a Next.js app isn’t going to shortcut that. An incremental rewrite via MFEs is better than a total rewrite in a new monolith, but not by a lot.</p>
<h2 id="Modularisation-before-MFEs"><a href="#Modularisation-before-MFEs" title="Modularisation before MFEs"></a>Modularisation before MFEs</h2><p>What is to be done, then, about frontend repositories that reach such a critical mass they can’t be worked on effectively? My advice is to start with <strong>modularisation</strong>.</p>
<p>Keep a single repo and build, for the moment, but start organising your code into packages with very strict architectural boundaries. Have these packages only interact via well-defined, minimal interfaces, ideally just a small user context object with basics like ID and tokens. Packages can share idempotent state like API caches but they don’t share context like Redux stores or React context.</p>
<p>As you split the code up, <em>then</em> you can implement things like Yarn workspaces that are designed for managing a monorepo. This lets you do things like split up the unit tests and only execute suites for the parts that have changed. This starts bringing in MFE-like benefits without all the overhead.</p>
<p>Over time you can move <em>incrementally</em> to a microfrontend-like architecture that sits inside a monorepo, with separate pipelines and fully differential builds.</p>
<p>Why a monorepo? In my experience it’s a good tradeoff between oversight and independence. You can still typecheck a monorepo app as a single unit, whilst building and deploying modules independently. Code can be shared without complex versioning and packaging; you can implement separate deployment pipelines with a little effort, but it’s much easier to move code across packages as you need to.</p>
<p>Oversight matters. By the time you reach this level of complexity, you <em>need</em> a team who are acting to oversee the overall architecture and provide common tooling. If you let every team diverge you’ll get chaos.</p>
<p>Refactoring _is_ hard. In one frontend I’ve worked on, with over 400,000 lines of source code (and I mean <em>not</em> including dependencies), I ended up writing a program just to understand the codebase itself. It used the AST (abstract syntax tree) of each file to discover when components were reading or writing Redux data, parsed that into a graph, and then let you execute queries against the graph to understand that ties between different pages. The graph data alone was hundreds of kilobytes.</p>
<p>But by doing this, now we could visualise the problem. Before, the argument was that we could just rewrite everything via MFEs and engineers would just kind of figure things out as they went. When we could visualise the graph of data dependencies, we could see how difficult this would be without a dedicated effort to decouple the domains in the code.</p>
<h3 id="Appreciating-the-tradeoffs"><a href="#Appreciating-the-tradeoffs" title="Appreciating the tradeoffs"></a>Appreciating the tradeoffs</h3><p>Despite all the criticism above, I think in time this app <em>could</em> become something like a microfrontend project, although with more control and oversight than the polyrepo MFEs I see other organisations adopting. But it will only do so once the domain isolation and design-level refactoring is largely complete. <em>Then</em> the parts of the codebase will be sufficiently isolated for us to work on them independently.</p>
<p>You could call this microfrontends by stealth; I call it agile architecture.</p>
<p>Don’t take on big hero projects to implement The Grand New Architecture you’ve read about. Identify your problems, move towards them iteratively, and don’t try to skip the hard work of figuring out how to split the code into <em>genuinely</em> separated units, or all you’ll get is your horrible frontend monolith turned into a distributed monolith MFE.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple’s new iPhone 15 marks a disruptive departure from previous models. The 11-year reign of the Lightning cable is over, and the USB-C era has begun — leaving us wondering what sets one charger apart from another.&nbsp;</p><p>Does Apple’s Thunderbolt 4 cable really warrant its $129 price tag? Or does a $5 cable get the job done just as well? We’ve used our <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/products/neptune-industrial-x-ray-ct-scanner">Neptune industrial X-ray CT scanner</a> to uncover the hidden engineering differences between them.</p><h3>Apple Thunderbolt 4 (USB‑C) Pro cable</h3><p>The <a href="https://app.lumafield.com/project/fedc9b09-b696-4a7f-8270-95762abd1d1d">Apple Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) Pro Cable</a> is a versatile connector catering to a broad spectrum of data transfer and charging needs. It supports Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, and USB 4 data transfer with speeds reaching up to a remarkable 40 Gb/s. It also features DisplayPort video output (HBR3) and can charge devices by delivering up to 100 W, exceeding most data and power requirements with ease. Let’s see what makes all this possible.</p><p>The connector has a hard plastic enclosure; beneath it is a metal shield that’s fully bonded to the shell of the connector — all made of stainless steel. Where the cord leaves the connector, we find a single-piece strain relief crimped in from eight different directions that shields the entire bottom of the assembly.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/652f11e8308ee0d3944eeb96_1%20strain%20relief.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Stainless steel enclosure and strain relief on the Thunderbolt connector head</figcaption></figure><p>The Thunderbolt connector maxes out on almost every point; it has 24 pins, all mounted independently on a nine-layer PCBA. Filtering out the lower-density PCB substrate in our <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/products/voyager-ai-powered-cloud-analysis-software">Voyager</a> visualization, we discover a forest of blind and buried vias. Blind vias connect an outer layer to inner layers but don't go all the way through the board, while buried vias connect only inner layers and aren't visible from the outside.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/652f12253610f38db0f9e5e5_pcba%20combined.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Blind and buried vias inside the Thunderbolt cable's 9-layer PCBA</figcaption></figure><p>Another curiosity hidden in the circuit board is this wiggle on one of the traces. It contains a tiny detour to make sure it’s the same length as its paired trace, which is especially important when dealing with extra-high-speed data transmission.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/652f12e5467f53c1691b5ce6_3%20wiggle.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Wiggle detour on a PCBA trace</figcaption></figure><p>The Thunderbolt cable contains three distinct types of wires corresponding to its separate charging and data transfer capabilities. The coaxially shielded conductors in the cable are high-speed data lines. Most of the unshielded wires transmit power, but two of them are data wires that support legacy USB 2.0 functionality. The wires and their shields are landed separately on the PCBA.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/652f1f942eaa244b6c7ec615_image%20(4).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Shielded and unshielded wires inside the Thunderbolt cord</figcaption></figure><h5><a href="https://app.lumafield.com/project/fedc9b09-b696-4a7f-8270-95762abd1d1d"><strong>Explore the scan.</strong></a></h5><p>Overall, the Thunderbolt cable is a stunning piece of precision engineering. Let’s see how competitors at lower price-points stack up.</p><h3>Amazon Basics USB-C cable</h3><p>Less than 1/10th the price of the Apple cable, the <a href="https://app.lumafield.com/project/a0fd9731-994a-403f-9710-a03aa2f31cc1">Amazon Basics</a> USB-C to USB-C 2.0 Fast Charger Cable offers charging up to 60 W and data transfer speeds up to 480 Mbps.</p><p>Like the Thunderbolt connector, the Amazon Basics connector has a metal jacket beneath its plastic enclosure that provides shielding and is integrated with its strain relief. This strain relief is much simpler than we saw on the Thunderbolt connector, though; it has two arms that crimp together and anchor the shielding on the cable.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/652f130a5f7361aeee4541d4_5%20strain%20relief.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Two-armed strain relief and shielding anchor on the Amazon Basics connector head</figcaption></figure><p>In the connector tip, we find only 12 pins — half as many as in the Thunderbolt, and four pairs of those are jumped across rather than individually connected to the PCBA. This may be a simpler and more cost-effective design to ensure basic functionality for charging and lower-speed data transfer. We also find that the plug’s shell is fully grounded; it’s soldered to the end pins of the connector.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/652f132185906dcdcf45bef8_6%20pins.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>12 pins, with four pairs jumped across the Amazon Basics PCBA</figcaption></figure><h5><a href="https://app.lumafield.com/project/a0fd9731-994a-403f-9710-a03aa2f31cc1"><strong>Explore the scan.</strong></a></h5><h3>NiceTQ USB-C cable</h3><p>The $5.59 <a href="https://app.lumafield.com/project/f6ec539a-2775-44d1-a9e3-54a118093b69">NiceTQ</a> USB-C cable claims to transfer data at up to 10 Gbps, lower than the Thunderbolt cable’s 40 Gbps but higher than the 480 Mbps claimed by the Amazon Basics cable. How does it compare inside?</p><p>This is a much more primitive cable than the first two we’ve seen. It has no metal shielding beneath its soft plastic enclosure, and the plug’s shell floats in overmolded plastic without any connection to the cable’s ground wire. The cable’s strain relief is just a rubber extension of the plug’s plastic enclosure–no metal reinforcement, unlike the previous two connectors.</p><p>Inside the connector tip are eight pins, but only four of them connect to the cable. The other four float in the connector’s plastic overmolding, unlike the Amazon Basics connector, where mirrored pins are jumped across to each other. This may present reliability issues; if one of the active pins gets worn or bent and doesn’t reliably connect to the port, it wouldn’t have a redundant pin on the opposite side to fall back on.</p><p>This is the only cable we scanned that contains no PCBA; the pins just connect directly to the wires.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/652f1357308ee0d39450d898_7%20pins.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Wires connecting directly to the pins without a PCBA&nbsp;in the NiceTQ cable</figcaption></figure><p>The NiceTQ cable consists of four straightforward stranded conductors, each embedded individually in two layers of insulation — the outer layer slightly less dense than the inner.</p><p>This manufacturer claims the cable transmits data at up to 10 Gbps–a speed that corresponds to USB 3.1 Gen 2–but it only has enough pins and wires to support USB 2.0 at up to 480 Mbps.

<li><strong>Users cannot withdraw USD without first converting it to stablecoins or another digital asset.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Binance US notified users of the update via email and provided detailed instructions.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Binance US has implemented fundamental changes to its financial activities in the USA. The exchange is no longer allowing users to make direct withdrawals in US dollars as of this week.</p>



<p>As stated in their revised terms of service, they will no longer let users withdraw USD without first converting it to <a href="https://thenewscrypto.com/usdt-stablecoin-issuer-tether-names-paolo-ardoino-as-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stablecoins</a> or another digital asset. Importantly, unlike conventional financial guarantees, US currency deposits are no longer covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (<a href="https://thenewscrypto.com/fdic-issues-warning-to-crypto-exchange-okcoin-over-insured-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FDIC</a>).</p>



<h3 id="h-regulatory-concerns">Regulatory Concerns</h3>



<p>The decision comes after months of increased scrutiny from US authorities, which has presented the corporation with significant operating obstacles. Binance US has been the target of several lawsuits over its financial dealings, prompting a review of its offerings. As a result, dollar deposits were frozen this summer, a prelude to the present withdrawal restriction.</p>



<p>Customers will have to adjust how they get at their funds because of the alterations. There will be no option for cashing out in US currency. To withdraw dollars, users must first convert their funds to another digital asset or stablecoin. Binance US notified users of the update via email and provided detailed instructions for the new procedure.</p>



<p>The company’s problems, however, extend beyond only regulatory ones. After the <a href="http://sec.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SEC</a> took strong action, banking partners were hesitant to maintain ties. This fallout, initiated by a June SEC complaint, highlights the difficult climate in which crypto exchanges like Binance US operate.</p>



<p>Binance’s problems aren’t exclusive to the United States. The firm is no longer accepting new UK customers. This decision came quickly after its UK promotional partner, Rebuilding Society, was hit with new regulations from the Financial Conduct Authority (<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FCA</a>).&nbsp;</p>

</figure><p>It began the way many discoveries do — a tickling of curiosity in the back of someone’s mind. That someone was astronomer and communicator Carl Sagan. The thing doing the tickling was the trajectory of NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, which had launched in October 1989 and was the first to orbit Jupiter. The result was a paper in <i>Nature </i>30 years ago this week that changed how scientists thought about looking for life on other planets.</p><p>The opportunity stemmed from a tragic mishap. Almost four years before Galileo’s launch, in January 1986, the space shuttle Challenger had exploded shortly after lift-off, taking seven lives with it. NASA cancelled its plans to dispatch Galileo on a speedy path to Jupiter using a liquid-fuelled rocket aboard another space shuttle. Instead, the probe was released more gently from an orbiting shuttle, with mission engineers slingshotting it around Venus and Earth so it could gain the gravitational boosts that would catapult it all the way to Jupiter.</p><p>On 8 December 1990, Galileo was due to skim past Earth, just 960 kilometres above the surface. The tickling became an itch that Sagan had to scratch. He talked NASA into pointing the spacecraft’s instruments at our planet. The resulting paper was titled ‘A search for life on Earth from the Galileo spacecraft’<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><h2><b>The outside view</b></h2><p>We are in a unique position of knowing that life exists on Earth. To use our own home to test whether we could discern that remotely was an extraordinary suggestion at the time, when so little was known about the environments in which life might thrive. “It’s almost like a science-fiction story wrapped up in a paper,” says David Grinspoon, senior scientist for astrobiology strategy at NASA’s headquarters in Washington DC. “Let’s imagine that we’re seeing Earth for the first time.”</p><p>It came at a time, too, when the search for life elsewhere in the Solar System was at a low ebb. US and Soviet robotic missions in the 1960s and 1970s had revealed that Venus — once thought to be a haven for exotic organisms — was hellishly hot beneath its dense clouds of carbon dioxide. Mars, crisscrossed by the ‘irrigation canals’ of astronomers’ imagination<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>, was a seemingly barren wasteland. In 1990, no one yet knew about the buried oceans that lay on Jupiter’s moon Europa — a discovery that Galileo would go on to make<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup> — or on Saturn’s moon Enceladus, both of which are now seen as potential cradles of extraterrestrial life.</p><p>Crucially, Sagan and his collaborators took a deliberately agnostic approach to the detection of life, says astrobiologist Lisa Kaltenegger, who heads the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “Of course he wants to find life, every scientist does,” she says. “But he says, let’s take that wish and be even more cautious — because we want to find it.” The existence of life was to be, in the words of the paper, the “hypothesis of last resort” for explaining what Galileo observed.</p><p>But even through this veil of scepticism, the spacecraft delivered. High-resolution images of Australia and Antarctica obtained as Galileo flew overhead did not yield signs of civilization. Still, Galileo measured oxygen and methane in Earth’s atmosphere, the latter in ratios that suggested a disequilibrium brought about by living organisms. It spotted a steep cliff in the infrared spectrum of sunlight reflecting off the planet, a distinctive ‘red edge’ that indicates the presence of vegetation. And it picked up radio transmissions coming from the surface that were moderated as if engineered. “A strong case can be made that the signals are generated by an intelligent form of life on Earth,” Sagan’s team wrote, rather cheekily.</p><h2><b>A powerful control</b></h2><p>Karl Ziemelis, now chief physical sciences editor at <i>Nature</i>, handled the paper as a rookie editor. He says it remains one of his favourites — and one of the hardest to get in. Editorial approval for the paper was far from unanimous, because it was not obviously describing something new. But, according to Ziemelis, that was mostly beside the point. “It was an incredibly powerful control experiment for something that wasn’t really on many people’s radar at the time,” he says.</p><p>“While the answer was known, it profoundly changed our way of thinking about the answer,” says Kaltenegger. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01692-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01692-7" data-track-category="body text link">Only by stepping back and regarding Earth as a planet like any other</a> — perhaps harbouring life, perhaps not — can researchers begin to get a true perspective on our place in the Universe and the likelihood of life elsewhere, she says.</p><figure>

</figure><p>It takes on a new importance given developments since the Galileo flyby. In 1990, no planets orbiting stars other than the Sun were known. It was another two years before astronomers conclusively reported the first ‘exoplanet’ orbiting a rotating dead star known as a pulsar<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>, and three years more before they found<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup> the first around a Sun-like star, 51 Pegasi. Today, scientists know of more than 5,500 exoplanets, few of which look like anything in the Solar System. They range from ‘super-Earths’ with bizarre geologies and ‘mini-Neptunes’ with gassy atmospheres to ‘hot Jupiters’, huge planets whirling close to their blazing stars.</p><p>When Sagan and his colleagues pointed Galileo at Earth, they invented a scientific framework for looking for signs of life on these other worlds — one that has permeated every search for such biosignatures since. Kaltenegger still gives Sagan’s paper to her students to show them how it is done. Life is the last, not first, inference to draw when seeing something unusual on another planet, she tells them. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p><h2><b>The right mix for life</b></h2><p>This lesson could not be more important today, as scientists stand on the verge of potentially revolutionary, and perhaps monumentally confusing, discoveries by the powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The telescope is just beginning its remote exploration of the atmospheres of dozens of exoplanets, hunting for the same sort of chemical disequilibrium that Galileo spotted in Earth’s atmosphere. It is already turning up early hints of biosignatures that might lead scientists and the public astray.</p><p>For instance, JWST has sniffed out methane in the atmosphere of at least one planet. That gas is a powerful signature of life on Earth, but it can also come from volcanoes, no life required. Oxygen captures scientists’ attention because much of it is generated by life on Earth, but it can also be formed by light splitting apart molecules of water or carbon dioxide. Finding the right combination of methane and oxygen could indicate the presence of life on another planet — but that world needs to be located in a temperate zone, not too hot nor too cold. Getting the right mix of life-sustaining ingredients in a life-friendly environment is challenging, Kaltenegger says.</p><p>The same is true for other intriguing mixes of atmospheric gases. Just last month, astronomers sifting through JWST data reported finding methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a large exoplanet called K2-18 b. They suggested that the planet might have water oceans covering its surface, and hinted at tantalizing detections of dimethyl sulfide, a compound that, on Earth, comes from phytoplankton and other living organisms<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>.</p><p>Headlines ran wild, with news stories reporting possible signs of life on K2-18 b. Never mind that the presence of dimethyl sulfide was reported with low confidence and needed further validation. Nor that no water had actually been detected on the planet. And, even if water were present, it might be in an ocean so deep as to choke off all geological activity that could maintain a temperate atmosphere.</p><h2><b>Building evidence</b></h2><p>Challenges such as these led Jim Green, a former chief scientist at NASA, to propose a framework in 2021 for how to report evidence for life beyond Earth<sup>7</sup>. A progressive scale, from one to seven, for example, could help to convey the level of evidence for life in a particular discovery, he argues. Maybe you’ve got a signal that could result from biological activity — that would just be a one on the scale. You’d need to work through many more steps, such as ruling out contamination and acquiring independent evidence of the strength of that signal before you could get to level 7 and demonstrate a true discovery of life beyond Earth.</p><p>It could take a long time. A telescope might sniff out an intriguing molecule, and scientists would argue about it. Another telescope might be built to work out the context of the observation. Each brick of evidence must be placed on top of another, each layer of mortar mixed through the arguments, scepticism and agnosticism of many, many scientists. And that’s assuming that life on another world resembles that on Earth — an assumption underlying the conclusions drawn from Galileo’s observations. “The uncertainty may last years or decades,” Grinspoon says. Sagan, who died in 1996, would have loved it.</p><p>The same year that Galileo observed Earth, Sagan convinced NASA to point another spacecraft in a direction the agency had not been planning. As Voyager 1 raced past Neptune on its way out of the Solar System, it turned its cameras back towards Earth and photographed a tiny speck, gleaming in a sunbeam. This was the <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/536/voyager-1s-pale-blue-dot" data-track="click" data-label="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/536/voyager-1s-pale-blue-dot" data-track-category="body text link">iconic Pale Blue Dot image</a> that inspired Sagan to ruminate in his 1994 book <i>Pale Blue Dot</i>: “That’s here. That’s home. That’s us.”</p><p>That fragile gleaming pixel reshaped how humanity visualizes its place in the Cosmos. So, too, did using Galileo to look for life on Earth, says Kaltenegger: “This is how we can use our pale blue dot to provide a template for the search for life on other planets.”</p>

This compromises the system's security, allowing unauthorized actions to be performed.</p><p>Some time ago we <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/chatgpt-code-interpreter-computer-vision/"><u>showed you</u></a> how to use prompt injection to jailbreak OpenAI’s Code Interpreter, allowing you to install unauthorized Python packages and run Computer Vision models in a seemingly closed environment. In this blog, we will show you what Vision Prompt Injection is, how it can be used to steal your data, and how to defend against it.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2023/10/1_G9UMTt5duZTP8pfAReSEYg.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="554" height="720"><figcaption><i><em>Running Ultralytics YOLOv8 in the Code Interpreter environment</em></i></figcaption></figure><h2 id="gpt-4-and-vision-prompt-injection">GPT-4 and Vision Prompt Injection</h2><p>On September 25, 2023, OpenAI announced the launch of a new feature that expands how people interact with its latest and most advanced model, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/gpt-4-vision/"><u>GPT-4V(ision)</u></a>: the ability to ask questions about images.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2023/10/2023-09-26-17.56.29.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="826" height="1280" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/2023-09-26-17.56.29.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2023/10/2023-09-26-17.56.29.jpg 826w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em>Visual Question Answering example</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Among other things, GPT-4 is now able to read the text found in uploaded images.

This is because it requires teaching the model how to distinguish between good and bad instructions. Unfortunately, almost all methods that increase the security of LLM, at the same time lead to reduced usability of the model.</p><p>Vision Prompt Injection is a brand new problem. The situation is made even more difficult by the fact that GPT-4 Vision is not open-source and we don't quite know how text and vision input affect each other. I tried techniques based on adding additional instructions in the text part and ordering the LLM to ignore potential instructions contained in the image. It seems to improve the model's behavior, at least to some extent.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-16-at-19.36.34.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="693" height="363" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-16-at-19.36.34.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-16-at-19.36.34.png 693w"><figcaption><i><em>Defending against visual prompt injection with prompt engineering</em></i></figcaption></figure><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>The only thing we can do at the moment is to make sure we are aware of this problem and take it into account every time we design LLM-based products.

Unless you’re a computer programmer or engineer, you probably haven’t even heard of it. </span></p><p><span>In this interview, we talk to Filipe Cruz, who uses the handle </span><em>ps</em><span> (@psenough on Twitter, etc. – as </span><em>ps </em><span>is too short of a username).

And what is a demo? </strong></p><p><span>Filipe Cruz: The demoscene is a sub-culture of digital art, a community of people who focus on showcasing what their machine can do with audiovisual presentations, the so called </span><em>demos</em><span>. It has its roots in the game piracy&nbsp;scene that boomed in the late 80s with the proliferation of the early personal computers (Apple II, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari, Amiga, etc.), where people, mostly teenagers, would trade floppy disks with&nbsp;software and games and sometimes add small intros that would play in the beginning, communicating who had been responsible for breaking the copy protection or fixed/enhanced the game in some way, or how to get in&nbsp;touch for more trading.</span></p><div id="youtube2-pmw87w7i6rQ" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;pmw87w7i6rQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pmw87w7i6rQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><em>Rupture by ASD / Andromeda Software Development (2009)</em></p><div><p><span>These folks would gather regularly at physical events to trade disks and&nbsp;learn from each other how to use the machine to draw pixelart, produce&nbsp;music, code your own graphical routines, etc. When game trading became&nbsp;more dangerous, the groups became more focused on the artistic side of&nbsp;things and by extension, those LAN copy parties became known as&nbsp;demoparties, holding competitions for best new demos, music, and graphics.</span></p><p><span>The advent of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" rel="">Bulletin Board Systems</a><span> and then later the internet&nbsp;made the culture more international and there is still to this day an&nbsp;active community of people around the world who regularly release new&nbsp;demoscene productions and organize demoscene events.</span></p><p><span>It's very focused on Central and Northern Europe, with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_(demoparty)" rel="">Revision</a><span> during Easter&nbsp;in Germany being the biggest pure demoscene event. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_(demoparty)" rel="">Assembly Summer</a><span> in Finland during the summer being one of the events with the longest&nbsp;running tradition, despite also catering to other computer culture&nbsp;related scenes. </span></p></div><p><span>But it's worth mentioning the demoscene is also active&nbsp;outside Europe, in places like the United States, Argentina, Australia,&nbsp;Japan, etc. Some countries with a bit more tradition than others. For&nbsp;example here in Portugal, where I'm from, we only have a single&nbsp;demoscene event per year, the </span><a href="https://inercia.pt/" rel="">Inércia Demoparty</a><span> that I help organize&nbsp;with some friends. It's quite small compared to other parties, but we&nbsp;are always looking for new blood to come learn about the culture and&nbsp; participate in the community.</span></p><div id="youtube2-_QZd967F65g" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_QZd967F65g&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_QZd967F65g?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><em>Incyber by Satori (SK) &amp; Aural Planet (PL) (2000)</em></p><p><strong>OTA: Any favorites or recommendations for cool demos?</strong></p><p><span>FC: Oh yes, I have a lot of favorites for a lot of different reasons.

You&nbsp;can see them </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxyPjW-DeNVFfzPUIXUJrxIYRURsdRel" rel="">on my YouTube channel.</a></p><p><strong>OTA: Why do demosceners create demos? Is it purely for artistic reasons, or more about pushing the limitations of computer hardware?</strong></p><div><p><span>FC: A little bit of both. In the late 80s and early 90s the technical aspect&nbsp;was definitely a driving force behind the culture. It was easier to&nbsp;compare things when everyone had the same machine, so it was down to the&nbsp;programming skills and artistic talent to get the most out of the&nbsp;platform. When the IBM PC clones became highly adopted by the masses,&nbsp;some of the active demoscene lost a bit of its charm in that regard,&nbsp;but people kept making demos and gathering at demoparties.</span></p><p><span>Back in the 90s, it was still relatively possible for small groups of&nbsp;people to develop technology for a demo that was superior to what you&nbsp;would see in most games released in the market, which was a strong&nbsp;contribution to the popularity of the demoscene in the computer culture&nbsp;of the 90s. Nowdays it's much harder to compete as a hobby with the&nbsp;professional research and artists from AAA studios and commercial&nbsp;engines. Even though a lot of those companies carry demosceners in their&nbsp;ranks.</span></p></div><div id="youtube2-62u_-VE1pQk" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;62u_-VE1pQk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/62u_-VE1pQk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><em>kosmoplovci &amp; minimalartifact - the lost religion of light (2007)</em></p><div><p><span>There are still plenty of demos being regularly released though, both&nbsp;for vintage machines and more recent platforms. </span><a href="https://meteoriks.org/" rel="">The Meteoriks awards</a><span>&nbsp;tries to highlight some of the best releases of the year and their&nbsp;website is a good place to start if you're looking for recent demos. The&nbsp;more impressive demos tend to have a mix of interesting technology with&nbsp;a focus on style / direction / message / artistic expression.</span></p><p><span>Also worth mentioning is that during the last couple of decades, the&nbsp;demoscene seems to have become more known in the mainstream computer media outlets for its achievements in procedural programming and size-limited productions. Releases where your entire program executable&nbsp;must fit within a certain ridiculously small size. The more popular&nbsp;categories being 4 kilobytes and 64 kilobytes, but there is also a very active tiny size intro community in even smaller categories like 128&nbsp;bytes, 256 bytes, 512 bytes, etc. </span><a href="https://lovebyte.party/" rel="">The Lovebyte Demoparty</a><span> online event&nbsp;that started during the pandemic being one of the major factors for that&nbsp;particular boom of popularity.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://nanogems.demozoo.org/" rel="">Nano Gems</a><span> is a&nbsp;website / online gallery that highlights demoscene tiny size coding productions.</span></p><p><span>For me personally, demomaking is mostly about artistic expression, I try&nbsp;to use the technology I have available instead of focusing on developing&nbsp;new tech. But for a lot of other demosceners, exploring new technology to&nbsp;make something impressive is still the main driving force. And then&nbsp;there is a large aspect of demomaking that is also just about having&nbsp;fun doing something creative with your friends, sharing it, and&nbsp;talking about it with other friends in the demoscene.</span></p></div><p><strong>OTA: Demos are usually created by teams, but are there individual artists too?</strong></p><div><p><span>FC: There are individual artists too, they are more rare because you&nbsp;typically need a broader range of skillsets to fulfill your vision when&nbsp;you're doing things alone but they do exist in the demoscene.</span></p><p><span>Doing things in teams is a bit more common. In a team you can typically focus on what you are more naturally inclined to do and then ask your&nbsp;friends to help you out for the other aspects of making the demo that&nbsp;they are more comfortable with. Sometimes you have to relinquish your&nbsp;vision or spend a lot of time and energy debating things that were&nbsp;already locked in your head though, but at the same time you can also&nbsp;end up with something interesting beyond your expectations. So there are pros and cons to both ways of doing things.</span></p></div><p><strong>OTA: Demoscene seems very much driven by the “scene” (hence the name) of events, called demoparties. How does that work? Do teams typically work on a demo together and only share it at events? And is it a competition, with winners, or just a place to show work? Do creators have portfolios of their work, or is it mostly an event-based art&nbsp;form?</strong></p><div><p><span>FC: Yes, most social aspect happens at the demoparties. There are typically competitions for many different categories where you submit your latest work. The competition format is a bit of a cultural thing. A lot of the&nbsp;participants don't really care about the position their entry gets and&nbsp;they just enter it to the competition to have it shared on the big&nbsp;screen / livestream for others to see.</span></p><p><span>After the event the party organizers typically upload all the releases&nbsp;and results online, usually to </span><a href="http://scene.org/" rel="">scene.org.</a><span> There are people&nbsp;actively trying to preserve all of this demoscene metadata and keep it&nbsp;publicly available, with </span><a href="http://demozoo.org/" rel="">demozoo.org</a><span> as the most generalist complete&nbsp;demoscene website, where you can find all the releases, results and history. For example, </span><a href="https://demozoo.org/sceners/313/" rel="">here&nbsp;is my scener page,</a><span> listing all the events I’ve helped organize, all the&nbsp;productions I’ve ever released, the demogroups that I am or was a part of in the past, etc.</span></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg" width="800" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:481556,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Assembly 2004 – a combination of a demoparty and a LAN party</em></p><p><span>There are other demoscene websites doing similar work like </span><a href="http://pouet.net/" rel="">pouet.net</a><span>, </span><a href="http://csdb.dk/" rel="">csdb.dk</a><span>, or </span><a href="http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/" rel="">janeway.exotica.org.uk</a><span>. Some of them focus on specific&nbsp;platforms or just certain aspects of the demoscene. Demozoo tries to&nbsp;cover it all but is still an ongoing process, the database is not complete.</span></p><p><strong>OTA: What do demo creators use to make demos? Are these graphics entirely made with code, or do people use programs like After Effects or Blender too?</strong></p><div><p><span>FC: Depends on the person and the project. Some people develop their own&nbsp;tools and frameworks to work with or to help their group members&nbsp;collaborate making a production. Particularly if you're targetting size&nbsp;limited categories like 4kb or 64kb you need specialized tools which&nbsp;don't exist commercially. But there is a bit of a culture of sharing&nbsp;your tool and framework for others to reuse / learn from after you have&nbsp;released your production. For example, </span><a href="https://in4k.github.io/" rel="">in4k</a><span> gathers resources for creating&nbsp;productions of 4kb.</span></p><p><span>Others do all the code by hand, for example, there are executable&nbsp;graphics categories where you have to generate a single static image&nbsp;under 4kb within 30 seconds of precalculation time. This allows you to use&nbsp;rendering techniques that you wouldn't be able to do at 30 frames per&nbsp;second and can get quite impressive.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://executable.graphics/" rel="">Executable.graphics</a><span> is a&nbsp;website / online gallery that showcases these kind of productions.</span></p><p><span>To create graphic assets or music, I would say it's culturally accepted&nbsp;in the demoscene to use commercial tools if you want. It's all about the&nbsp;end result. Same for doing video releases. Using commercial engines for&nbsp;realtime demos is still a bit frowned upon by the demoscene purists&nbsp;though, because it removes or blurs the line a lot of what actual coding&nbsp;is involved in the process making it hard/unfair to judge, but overall&nbsp;demos using commercial engines are still allowed to participate in the&nbsp;competitions, as long as it is properly credited so people can try to&nbsp;vote accordingly.</span></p></div><p><strong>OTA: In general, are there any real “rules” to demoscene, other than making a cool demo?</strong></p><div><p><span>FC: Each demoparty has its own set of competitions. And for each of these&nbsp;competitions there are usually rules lined down, to ensure the&nbsp;competition is fair for everyone participating. Those are the main&nbsp;constraints when releasing something on the demoscene. That being said,&nbsp;most demoparties typically have a wild competition category where&nbsp;anything goes: video, weird platforms, live performances, whatever you&nbsp;can think of.</span></p><p><span>And you can also release your demo outside of any competition or party.&nbsp;It will get less visibility though, which is why most active demosceners&nbsp;prefer to release at demoparties where they or their friends are attending.</span></p><p><span>There are some conventions and tropes from the four decades of culture&nbsp;that reoccur a lot, like for example most demos have credits and&nbsp;greetings scenes. But there is no committee that gets to decide what is&nbsp;or is not a real demo and it's culturally accepted that anyone is free&nbsp;to release whatever they enjoyed doing. If it becomes praised by the&nbsp;community or not that's another story. Also party organizers sometimes&nbsp;disqualify from the competition screening some things that are in bad&nbsp;taste, but you can still release them outside of a demoparty.</span></p></div><div><p><strong>OTA: Demoscene has recently been labeled as intangible culture by UNESCO in some countries. What effect do you think this will have, good&nbsp;or bad?</strong></p><p><span>FC: I been closely following that effort and am part of the discussion group of demosceners who have been actively pushing for that to happen across&nbsp;the globe. We call it </span><a href="https://demoscene-the-art-of-coding.net/" rel="">"The Art of Coding"</a><span> initiative.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We are also trying to push for it in Portugal as one of the activities&nbsp;of our </span><a href="https://inercia.pt/" rel="">Associação Inércia,</a><span> the nonprofit entity we have in place here&nbsp;in Portugal focused on promoting demoscene culture.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I think it's good. It can open some doors when you are trying to get&nbsp;some support from local municipality to help you organize future&nbsp;demoscene events.

I also dabbled in audio production, am known as an experimental&nbsp; / noise artist of sorts in the demoscene for focusing on glitch audio aesthetics in many of my releases. But I also&nbsp;try other aesthetics now and again, depending on the project idea.</p><div><p><span>The demoscene was never that big in Portugal, so most of my early&nbsp;contact with it was by reading about it through </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_magazine" rel="">diskmag articles.</a><span> Diskmags are the equivalent of an independent news zine of sorts, but&nbsp;in an executable file format and fitting inside a single floppy&nbsp;disk, hence the name, a mag inside a disk. I became a bit obsessed with&nbsp;the medium, was even an amateur editor and co-editor of different number&nbsp; of demoscene publications throughout the years. So it was common for me&nbsp; to keep track of the active demoscene, what groups are active, the new&nbsp; parties coming up, the best latest releases that just came out. Getting&nbsp; to know all the different groups and platforms of activity and how they&nbsp; correlated with each other, did a whole bunch of interviews with all&nbsp; types of demosceners, etc.</span></p><p><span>Long story short, once the Internet became more prevalent the diskmag&nbsp;format kind of faded away, becoming replaced with online portals for&nbsp;news and forum discussions, blogs with specialized articles, event&nbsp;reports and interviews, etc. But it's kind of a bit all over the place&nbsp;and hard to follow if you don't know what you're looking for, so now&nbsp;with my YouTube channel, I try to do a continuation of what the diskmags&nbsp;used to bring to the table in that regard, consolidating the information&nbsp;into a single place that becomes a bit easier to keep up with the&nbsp;demoscene – with my monthly reports for example, or creating in depth&nbsp;discussion videos about specific demoscene topics, guides for new people&nbsp;getting into things, etc.</span></p><p><span>My channel is still a bit of a mess, in the sense that it's not strictly&nbsp;focused on just this one single demoscene promotion goal. It also caters&nbsp;to other things in my range of interest that might warrant the&nbsp;occasional video, such as games, technical help videos, book reviews,&nbsp;random things really. Which is a big no-no on all the "how to make your&nbsp;channel grow" tutorials out there, but it's been working for me so far, so&nbsp;I don't care.</span></p></div><div id="youtube2-3FFPCuDqi_g" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3FFPCuDqi_g&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3FFPCuDqi_g?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><em>BACK TO THE PET – shiru8bit (2022)</em></p><p><strong><span>OTA: If someone wants to get involved with demoscene, where should they start? Your guidebook and related video on “</span><a href="https://github.com/psenough/teach_yourself_demoscene_in_14_days" rel="">Teach Yourself Demoscene in 14 Days</a><span>” is a good place to start for sure. Any other recommendations? And where can they find demoscene events to attend?</span></strong></p><p>FC: Definitely “Teach Yourself Demoscene in 14 Days”, it was prepared especially with that goal in mind and peer reviewed by other demosceners. There are other resources out there of course, but it largely depends on&nbsp;your area of interest:</p><ul><li><p><span>If you are more into learning the livecoding&nbsp;shaders culture in the demoscene you can go to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://livecode.demozoo.org/" rel="">Demozoo’s Livecode</a></p></li><li><p><span>If you are interested in coding small&nbsp;things you can go to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://sizecoding.org/" rel="">Size Coding</a></p></li><li><p><span>If you are more interested in&nbsp;textart there is&nbsp;</span><a href="https://16colo.rs/" rel="">16 colors</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://podbay.fm/p/zine-the-radio-show" rel="">The Zine podcast</a><span> radioshow is also a&nbsp;good way to get to know more about the demoscene.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>As for finding demoscene events to attend, </span><a href="https://www.demoparty.net/" rel="">Demoparty.net</a><span> is&nbsp;the main resource, but the front page of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://demozoo.org/" rel="">Demozoo</a><span> also lists upcoming events. I would also recommend to join some&nbsp;demoscene Discord servers and getting to know the active community&nbsp;depending on what you're most interested in. </span></p><p>Through that interaction&nbsp;it'll become clear what upcoming events people are looking forward to or&nbsp;preparing their releases for, and then just try to participate. If you&nbsp;can't attend physically, most events also welcome remote participation&nbsp;and usually have a livestream of the event available.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The extraordinary Hadrian X bricklaying robot rocks up to a building site looking like a regular truck, then extends a 32-m (105-ft) boom arm and starts precisely laying up to 300 large masonry blocks an hour. It's pretty remarkable to watch.</p><p>We've had our eye on this Australian bot since it was an <a href="https://newatlas.com/hadrian-brick-laying-robot-fastbrick/38239/" data-cms-ai="0">excavator-mounted prototype back in 2015</a>. Even then, it was capable of laying the brick framework for a full-sized home in about two days – some 20 times faster than human bricklayers, according to Fastbrick Robotics, now known as FBR and the creator of the robot.</p><p>Now, in 2023, it's starting to roll out commercially. FBR has built its first "next gen" Hadrian-X system, and last month it set a new speed record on its first outdoor test build, demonstrating a sustained rate over 300 USA-format masonry blocks per hour on a testing and calibration run.</p><p>Extrapolate that rate to the largest blocks it can handle – 45-kg (99-lb) monsters measuring 600 x 400 x 300 mm (23.6 x 15.7 x 11.8 in) and you're looking at a machine capable of putting down some 70 sq m (753 sq ft) of vertical wall every hour – that's about a quarter of a tennis court. Oh, and FBR actually expects it to get a lot faster; its rated top speed is 500 blocks per hour. </p><div data-align-center="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sweden on Tuesday said that a Baltic Sea telecom cable running to Estonia was partially damaged around the same time as a <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/finland-pipeline-leak-likely-caused-by-external-activity/a-67058017">Finnish-Estonian pipeline</a> and cable earlier this month.</p>

<p>Sweden's Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said it was unclear&nbsp;what caused the damage to the undersea cable that connects Sweden and Estonia.</p>

<p>"It is not a total cable break. There is a partial damage on this cable," Bohlin said.&nbsp;"We cannot assess what caused the damage. But what we can say is that this damage has happened at a similar time and in physical proximity ... to the damage that was previously reported to a gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland, and a telecommunications cable between Estonia and Finland."</p>

<p>The damage to the cable was sustained outside the territorial waters and Sweden's exclusive economic zone.</p>

<p>Bohlin said that the cable has&nbsp;continued to function since then.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/estonia/t-39241513">Estonia's</a>&nbsp;economy ministry said the damage to the Swedish-owned cable was in Estonian territory, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the island of Hiiumaa, the Baltic News Service reported.</p>

<p>Service was restored within a few days, the agency added.</p>

<p>On October 8, Finland said that its coast guard had discovered "clear damage" on the Balticconnector natural gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia, which was shut down due to a leak.</p>

<p>On Tuesday,&nbsp;Sweden's Defense Minister Pal Jonson said that his country's police, military and coast guard were in touch with Estonian counterparts on the matter.</p>

<p>He said there also was increased vigilance in the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>"We see the issue of security for our critical infrastructure as a high priority, and take the current situation seriously," Jonson told reporters.</p>

<p>Europe and NATO are becoming more concerned over the susceptibility of critical infrastructure around and under the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>Last week, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson spoke of a "spaghetti of cables, wires" on the Baltic seabed which "is absolutely fundamental for data traffic."</p>

<p>"We live in a time where civilian infrastructure is also very threatened in this security environment," Kristersson said.&nbsp;"It is also a very clear lesson from Ukraine, i.e., attacking infrastructure that is for energy supply, food supply, water supply."</p>

<p dir="auto">🔥 autogen has graduated from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML">FLAML</a> into a new project.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-what-is-autogen" dir="auto"><a href="#what-is-autogen">What is AutoGen</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">AutoGen is a framework that enables the development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website/static/img/autogen_agentchat.png"><img src="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/raw/main/website/static/img/autogen_agentchat.png" alt="AutoGen Overview"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>AutoGen enables building next-gen LLM applications based on <strong>multi-agent conversations</strong> with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation, and optimization of a complex LLM workflow. It maximizes the performance of LLM models and overcomes their weaknesses.</li>
<li>It supports <strong>diverse conversation patterns</strong> for complex workflows. With customizable and conversable agents, developers can use AutoGen to build a wide range of conversation patterns concerning conversation autonomy,
the number of agents, and agent conversation topology.</li>
<li>It provides a collection of working systems with different complexities. These systems span a <strong>wide range of applications</strong> from various domains and complexities. This demonstrates how AutoGen can easily support diverse conversation patterns.</li>
<li>AutoGen provides a drop-in replacement of <code>openai.Completion</code> or <code>openai.ChatCompletion</code> as an <strong>enhanced inference API</strong>. It allows easy performance tuning, utilities like API unification and caching, and advanced usage patterns, such as error handling, multi-config inference, context programming, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">AutoGen is powered by collaborative <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Research" rel="nofollow">research studies</a> from Microsoft, Penn State University, and the University of Washington.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-multi-agent-conversation-framework" dir="auto"><a href="#multi-agent-conversation-framework">Multi-Agent Conversation Framework</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Autogen enables the next-gen LLM applications with a generic multi-agent conversation framework. It offers customizable and conversable agents that integrate LLMs, tools, and humans.
By automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Features of this use case include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Multi-agent conversations</strong>: AutoGen agents can communicate with each other to solve tasks. This allows for more complex and sophisticated applications than would be possible with a single LLM.</li>
<li><strong>Customization</strong>: AutoGen agents can be customized to meet the specific needs of an application. This includes the ability to choose the LLMs to use, the types of human input to allow, and the tools to employ.</li>
<li><strong>Human participation</strong>: AutoGen seamlessly allows human participation. This means that humans can provide input and feedback to the agents as needed.</li>
</ul>
