<p dir="auto">This open source project written in Rust generates any chosen location from the real world in Minecraft Java Edition with a high level of detail.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">üñ•Ô∏è Example</h2><a id="user-content-desktop_computer-example" aria-label="Permalink: :desktop_computer: Example" href="#desktop_computer-example"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">By leveraging geospatial data from OpenStreetMap and utilizing the powerful capabilities of Rust, Arnis provides an efficient and robust solution for creating complex and accurate Minecraft worlds that reflect real-world geography and architecture.</p>
<p dir="auto">Arnis is designed to handle large-scale data and generate rich, immersive environments that bring real-world cities, landmarks, and natural features into the Minecraft universe. Whether you're looking to replicate your hometown, explore urban environments, or simply build something unique and realistic, Arnis offers a comprehensive toolset to achieve your vision.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">‚å®Ô∏è Usage</h2><a id="user-content-keyboard-usage" aria-label="Permalink: :keyboard: Usage" href="#keyboard-usage"></a></p>

Download the <a href="https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases/">latest release</a> or <a href="#trophy-open-source">compile</a> the project on your own.</p>
<p dir="auto">Choose your area in Arnis using the rectangle tool and select your Minecraft world - then simply click on 'Start Generation'!
The world will always be generated starting from the coordinates 0 0 0.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you choose to select an own world, make sure to generate a new flat world in advance in Minecraft.</p>
<details>
<summary>Alternatively you can also run Arnis the old fashioned way in the command line.</summary>
<p dir="auto"><code>arnis.exe --path="C:/YOUR_PATH/.minecraft/saves/worldname" --bbox="min_lng,min_lat,max_lng,max_lat"</code></p>
<p dir="auto">The --bbox parameter specifies the bounding box coordinates in the format: min_lng,min_lat,max_lng,max_lat. Use --path to specify the location of the Minecraft world.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/blob/main/gitassets/bbox-finder.png?raw=true"><img width="60%" src="https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/raw/main/gitassets/bbox-finder.png?raw=true"></a><br>
Use <a href="http://bboxfinder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bboxfinder.com/</a> to draw a rectangle of your wanted area. Then copy the four box coordinates as shown below and use them as the input for the --bbox parameter. Try starting with a small area since large areas take a lot of computing power and time to process.<br></p>

<p dir="auto">The raw data obtained from the API <em><a href="#question-faq">(see FAQ)</a></em> includes each element (buildings, walls, fountains, farmlands, etc.) with its respective corner coordinates (nodes) and descriptive tags. When you run Arnis, the following steps are performed automatically to generate a Minecraft world:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Processing Pipeline</h4><a id="user-content-processing-pipeline" aria-label="Permalink: Processing Pipeline" href="#processing-pipeline"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Fetching Data from the Overpass API:</strong> The script retrieves geospatial data for the desired bounding box from the Overpass API.</li>
<li><strong>Parsing Raw Data:</strong> The raw data is parsed to extract essential information like nodes, ways, and relations. Nodes are converted into Minecraft coordinates, and relations are handled similarly to ways, ensuring all relevant elements are processed correctly. Relations and ways cluster several nodes into one specific object.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing and Sorting Elements:</strong> The elements (nodes, ways, relations) are sorted by priority to establish a layering system, which ensures that certain types of elements (e.g., entrances and buildings) are generated in the correct order to avoid conflicts and overlapping structures.</li>
<li><strong>Generating Minecraft World:</strong> The Minecraft world is generated using a series of element processors (generate_buildings, generate_highways, generate_landuse, etc.) that interpret the tags and nodes of each element to place the appropriate blocks in the Minecraft world. These processors handle the logic for creating 3D structures, roads, natural formations, and more, as specified by the processed data.</li>
<li><strong>Generating Ground Layer:</strong> A ground layer is generated based on the provided scale factors to provide a base for the entire Minecraft world. This step ensures all areas have an appropriate foundation (e.g., grass and dirt layers).</li>
<li><strong>Saving the Minecraft World:</strong> All the modified chunks are saved back to the Minecraft region files.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">‚ùì FAQ</h2><a id="user-content-question-faq" aria-label="Permalink: :question: FAQ" href="#question-faq"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>Wasn't this written in Python before?</em><br>
Yes! Arnis was initially developed in Python, which benefited from Python's open-source friendliness and ease of readability. This is why we strive for clear, well-documented code in the Rust port of this project to find the right balance. I decided to port the project to Rust to learn more about the language and push the algorithm's performance further. We were nearing the limits of optimization in Python, and Rust's capabilities allow for even better performance and efficiency. The old Python implementation is still available in the python-legacy branch.</li>
<li><em>Where does the data come from?</em><br>
The geographic data is sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM)<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-76869c95acfdd418de6bcf280d4bde15" id="user-content-fnref-1-76869c95acfdd418de6bcf280d4bde15" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>, a free, collaborative mapping project that serves as an open-source alternative to commercial mapping services. The data is accessed via the Overpass API, which queries OSM's database.</li>
<li><em>How does the Minecraft world generation work?</em><br>
The script uses the <a href="https://github.com/owengage/fastnbt">fastnbt</a> cargo package to interact with Minecraft's world format. This library allows Arnis to manipulate Minecraft region files, enabling the generation of real-world locations.</li>
<li><em>Where does the name come from?</em><br>
The project is named after the smallest city in Germany, Arnis<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-76869c95acfdd418de6bcf280d4bde15" id="user-content-fnref-2-76869c95acfdd418de6bcf280d4bde15" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. The city's small size made it an ideal test case for developing and debugging the algorithm efficiently.</li>

Below is ‚Äúwhy‚Äù these don‚Äôt work. I offer this recognizing engineering is also a social science and what works/does not work is context dependent. One life lesson is that every time you say to an engineer (or post on X) that something won‚Äôt work it quickly becomes a challenge to prove otherwise.

Then everyone calling the APIs magically get some improvement or new capability without changing anything. There‚Äôs an old saying ‚Äúthe API is the behavior not the header file/documentation‚Äù. Almost nothing is pluggable to the degree that it ‚Äújust works‚Äù. The most pluggable components of modern software are probably device drivers, which enabled the modern computer but worked so poorly they are either no longer allowed or modern OSs have been building their own for a decade. The only way something is truly pluggable is if a second implementation is designed at the exact same time as the primary implementation. Then at least you have a proof it can work‚Ä¶one time.</span></p><p><strong>Let's just add an API. </strong><span>Countless products/companies have sprinted to some level of success and then decided ‚Äúwe need to be a platform and have developers‚Äù and soon enough there is an API. The problem with offering an API is multidimensional. First, being an API provider is itself a whole mindset and skill where you constantly trade compatibility and interoperability for features, where you are constrained in how things change because of legacy behavior or performance characteristics, and you can basically never move the cheese around. More importantly, an offering an API doesn‚Äôt mean anyone wants to use it. Almost every new API comes up because the co/product wants features, but it doesn‚Äôt want to prioritize them enough (too small a market, too vertical, too domain specific, etc.) and the theory is the API will be ‚Äúevangelized‚Äù to some partner in the space. Turns out those people are not sitting around waiting to fill in holes in your product. They have a business and customers too who don‚Äôt want to buy into yet another product to solve their problem. Having an API‚Äîbeing a platform‚Äîis a serious business with real demands. There is magic in building a platform but rarely does one come about by simply ‚Äúoffering some APIs‚Äù and even if it does, the chances it provides an economic base for third parties are slim. Tough stuff! Hence the reward.</span></p><p><strong>Let's abstract that one more time. </strong><span>One of the wisest computer scientists I ever got to work with was the legend Butler Lampson (Xerox, MIT, Microsoft, etc) who once said, "All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection" (the "fundamental theorem of software engineering‚Äù as it is known). There is truth to this‚Äîreal truth. Two things on why this fails. First, often engineers know this ahead of time, so they put in abstractions in the architecture too soon. Windows NT is riddled with excess abstractions that were never really used primarily because they were there from the start before there was a real plan to use them. I would contrast this with Mac OS evolution where abstractions that seemed odd appeared useful two releases later because there was a plan. Second, abstractions added after the fact can become very messy to maintain, difficult to secure, and challenging to performance optimize. Because of that you end up with too much code that does not use the new abstraction. Then you have a maintenance headache.</span></p><p><strong>Let's make that asynchronous</strong><span>. Most of the first 25 years of computer science was figuring out how to make things work asynchronously. If you were a graduate student in the 1980s you spent whole courses talking about dining philosophers or producers-consumers or sleeping barbers. Today‚Äôs world has mostly abstracted this problem away for most engineers who just operate by the rules at the data level. But at the user experience level there remains a desire to try to get more stuff done and never have people wait. Web frameworks have done great work to abstract this. But 9 out of 10 times once you go outside a framework or the data layer and think you can manage asynchrony yourself, you‚Äôll do great except for the bug that will show up a year from now that you will never be able to reproduce. Hopefully it won‚Äôt be a data corruption issue, but I warned you.</span></p><p><strong>Let's just add access controls later. </strong><span>When we weren‚Äôt talking about philosophers using chopsticks in grad school we were debating where exactly in a system access control should be. Today‚Äôs world is vastly more complex than the days of theoretical debates about access control because systems are under constant attack. Of course everyone knows systems need to be secure from the get-go, yet the pace to get to market means almost no system has fully thought through the access control/security model from the start. There‚Äôs almost no way to get the design of access controls to a product right unless you are thinking of that from the customer and adversary perspective from the start. No matter how expeditious it might feel, you will either fail or need to rewrite the product down the road and that will be a horrible experience for everyone including customers.</span></p><p><strong>Let's just sync the data. </strong><span>In this world of multiple devices, SaaS apps, or data stores it is super common to hear someone chime in ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we just sync the data‚Äù? Ha. </span><a href="https://x.com/@ROzzie" rel="">@ROzzie</a><span> (Ray Ozzie) who got his start on the Plato product, invented Lotus Notes, as well as Groove and Talko, and led the formation of Microsoft Azure was a pioneer in client/server and data sync. His words of wisdom, ‚Äúsynchronization is a hard problem‚Äù. And in computer science a hard problem means it is super difficult and fraught with challenges that can only be learned by experience. This problem is difficult enough with a full semantic and transacted data store, but once it gets to synchronizing blobs or unstructured data or worse involves data translation of some kind, then it very quickly becomes enormously difficult. Almost never do you want to base a solution on synchronizing data. This is why there are multi-billion dollar companies that do sync.</span></p><p><strong>Let's make it cross-platform. </strong><span>I have been having this debate my whole computing life. Every time it comes up someone shows me something that they wrote that they believe works ‚Äúgreat‚Äù cross platform, or someone tells me about Unity and games. Really clever people think that they can just say ‚Äúthe web‚Äù. I get that but I‚Äôm still right :-) When you commit to making something cross platform, no matter how customer focused and good your intentions are, you are committing to build an operating system, a cloud provider, or a browser. As much as you think you‚Äôre building your own thing, by committing to cross-platform you are essentially building one of those by just ‚Äúadding a level of indirection‚Äù (see above by Butler Lampson). You think you can just make a pluggable platform (see above). The repeated reality of cross-platform is that it works well two times. It works when platforms are new‚Äîwhen the cloud was compute and simple storage for example‚Äîand then being an abstraction across two players doing that simple thing makes sense. It works when your application/product is new and simple. Both of those fail as you diverge from the underlying platform or as you build capabilities that are expressed wildly differently on each target. A most ‚Äúfamous‚Äù example for me is when Microsoft gave up on building Mac software precisely because it became too difficult to make Office for Mac and Windows from the same code‚Äîrealize Microsoft essentially existed because it made its business building cross-platform apps. That worked when an OS API was 100 pages of docs, and each OS was derived from CP/M. We forked the Office code in 1998 and never looked back. Every day I use Mac Office I can see how even today it remains impossible to do a great job across platforms. You want more of my view on this please see -&gt; </span><a href="https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/divergent-thoughts-on-cross-platform-updated-68a925a45a83" rel="">https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/divergent-thoughts-on-cross-platform-updated-68a925a45a83</a></p><p><strong>Let's just enable escape to native. </strong><span>Since cross-platform only works for a brief time one of the most common solutions frameworks and API abstractions offer is the ability to ‚Äúescape to native. The idea is that the platform evolved or added features that the framework/abstraction doesn‚Äôt (yet?) expose, presumably because it has to build a whole implementation for the other targets that don‚Äôt yet have the capability. This really sounds great on paper. It too never works, more than 9 out of 10 times. The reason is pretty simple. The framework or API you are using that abstracts out some native capability always maintains some state or a cache of what is going on within the abstraction it created. When you call the underlying native platform, you muck with data structures and state that the framework doesn‚Äôt know about. Many frameworks provide elaborate mechanisms to exchange data or state information from your ‚Äúescape to native‚Äù code back to the framework. That can work a little bit but in a world of automatic memory management is a solution akin to malloc/free and I am certain no one today would argue for that architecture :-)</span></p><p>Have I always been a strong ‚Äúno‚Äù on all of these? Of course not. Can you choose these approaches, and they work? Yes, of course you can. There‚Äôs always some context where these might work, but most of the time you just don‚Äôt need them and there‚Äôs a better way. Always solve with first principles and don‚Äôt just to a software pattern that is so failure prone.</p><p>‚ÄîSteven</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="the-big-ones">The Big Ones</h2>
<p>The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
5.0. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
changes (where available).</p>
<ul>
<li>This development cycle has included a large number of changes which
improve the user experience, as detailed in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uiux-improvements">UI/UX Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added camera-specific styles for more than 500 camera models to more
closely approximate the out-of-camera JPEG rendition.  These styles
only affect contrast, brightness, and saturation and do not attempt
to match sharpening, denoising, or hue shifts.  Also added a Lua
script to auto-apply the appropriate style on import and manually
apply styles to a collection of previously-imported images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an optional splash screen showing startup progress (including
estimated time remaining during the scan for updated sidecar files) to
dramatically reduce the time between invoking darktable and something
appearing on screen when the user has a large library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user interface now gives feedback while processing bulk image
operations such as rating, tagging, applying styles, and edit
history management (and undoing those operations), rather than
silently freezing until the operation completes.  While the
operation is in progress, darktable will now show either a busy
cursor (such as a stopwatch or spinner) or a progress bar with
option to cancel the remainder of the operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paths for drawn masks now display two B√©zier handles per control point,
which can be moved individually. This allows for more precise control
of the paths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a high-contrast theme with bright white text on a dark gray
background.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced tooltips for utility module headers to provide more
information about the module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added more new-user hints on an empty lighttable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added two new error placeholder images to distinguish between
missing, unsupported, and corrupted images.  When attempting to edit
such an image, an appropriate, more specific error message is
displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When selecting a style in the export module, hovering on the style
name in the popup menu displays a thumbnail previewing the effect of
appending the style to the active image‚Äôs edit (first selected image
in lighttable, center-view image in darkroom).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for selecting the utility modules to be displayed on the
panels in the different views.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right-click on the empty panel area below the modules to get a
menu where they can be hidden or shown. This allows additional
modules to be added to the darkroom, like metadata editor and
styles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This replaces the options in the ‚Äúcollections‚Äù and ‚Äúrecently used
collections‚Äù modules‚Äô preferences to show or hide the latter and
show a ‚Äúhistory‚Äù button in the former instead. Users that want the
separate module will need to reenable it once via the new
<kbd>Right-click</kbd> menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The menu also contains an option ‚Äúrestore defaults‚Äù that resets
the selection and position of modules in the current view. In the
preferences dialog, on the general tab, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúreset view
panels‚Äù button that resets all views, including visibility and
width of the panels themselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a global preference to swap the left and right side panels in
the darkroom view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first time a new user presses Tab, they will be warned that this
will hide all panels and how to get them back. Hopefully this
prevents some confusion or frustration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag&amp;drop utility module headers to reposition them across the left
and right panels (lighttable) as well as vertically (all
views). Each view can have a different layout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag&amp;drop of processing modules in the darkroom right panel has been
improved to auto-scroll when reaching the top or bottom and to not
get confused when images get dragged into the area. This functionality
no longer requires <kbd>Ctrl+Shift</kbd> modifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved the message displayed at startup when the database is
locked by another instance of darktable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replaced the icon of the operator button in the color label filter
for working with multiple selected color labels
(union/intersection).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added OpenCL implementation of color equalizer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved the speed of bulk image operations by improving the speed
of sidecar writes, and by moving sidecar updates for many operations
into a background task, allowing the user to proceed before the
writes complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significantly accelerated loading of PFM files due to loops
parallelization and optimization that eliminated additional
processing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-changes">Other Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Switched default scope for new installations from histogram to
waveform to display more detailed information about image color and
tonality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ISO 12646 color assessment condition is kept until unset by user
action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposure bias can now be used to form collections and as a display filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved visualization of the color equalizer‚Äôs effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved debugging support for verifying CPU vs. GPU results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Calibrite alias for X-Rite ColorChecker in color calibration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scan for updated sidecar files now ignores timestamp differences
of two seconds or less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The macOS installation package now has a background image to direct
the user on installing darktable.app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changed the user interface of the import dialog to make it easier to
delete custom places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numerous rounds of code cleanup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The copy-parts dialog does not select any module by default now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add support for undo/redo for actions done on the filmstrip while in
darkroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In darkroom, add action (binding to <kbd>Ctrl+x</kbd> by default) for
synchronizing the last edited module on current edited module to the
selection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjusted the internal AVIF encoder parameter to significantly boost
encoding speed without compromising the output quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tag names can now easily be copied to the clipboard via popup
context menu in the tagging module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Piwigo export storage now supports to specify a file name
pattern for the exported file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The directory where darktable will write the log file under Windows
has been changed to %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Darktable. This allows
the user to easily see where the log file is located without even
having to search for it in the documentation or FAQ. The previous
location was deep in the system subdirectories of the user profile,
and also under a hidden directory (so it was impossible to click to
it in File Explorer with default system settings).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow import of JPEG 2000 files with .jpf and .jpx file extensions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a visible indicator to the color calibration module when its
color mapping section has non-neutral settings which will affect
color rendition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new substitution variables <code>$(IMAGE.TAGS.HIERARCHY)</code> to insert
tags with full hierarchy and <code>$(IMAGE.ID.NEXT)</code> to insert the image ID
to be assigned to the image being imported, allowing the image ID to
be part of the filename generated during a copy&amp;import operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exporting to floating-point JPEG XL with a quality of 100 will try
to do it as losslessly as possible. That is now consistent with the
behavior of integral JPEG XL formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved visibility of shortcuts that can be changed by users by
using bold text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The histogram-exposure interface now supports all standard bauhaus
features (<kbd>Ctrl+click</kbd>, <kbd>Right-click</kbd>‚Ä¶).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce image module order v5.0 to have the final-scale done before
color-out to fix some issues with color difference between darkroom
view and exported files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add support for editing any live color-picker samples. Using
<kbd>Right-click</kbd> on a sample it is possible to edit it
(changing location and/or size of the box) and either add a new
sample based on the edit or store the edit into an existing live
sample.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added more substitution variables for using EXIF data fields,
enabled autocompletion of variables in the watermark module.</p>
<p>The new variables are <code>$(EXIF.FLASH)</code>, <code>$(EXIF.METERING)</code>,
<code>$(EXIF.EXPOSURE.PROGRAM)</code>, <code>$(EXIF.WHITEBALANCE)</code> and
<code>$(GPS.LOCATION.ICON)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase maximum focal length for filtering auto-applied presets to
2000mm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an expanded color-checker preset to the Color Look Up Table
module with seven-level red/green/blue/gray ramps, IT8/CC24-like
skin tones, and miscellaneous color patches for more targeted color
adjustments across the full spectrum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for EXIF tags ‚ÄòAnalogBalance‚Äô used for color
calibration and ‚ÄòLinearResponseLimit‚Äô used in highlights
reconstruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we find currently unsupported color calibration data in DNG
specific tags, we tag the image by darktable|issue|no-samples for

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Deepseek is a Chinese AI startup whose latest R1 model </span><strong><a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news1120" rel="">beat OpenAI‚Äôs o1</a><span> on multiple reasoning benchmarks</span></strong><span>. Despite its low profile, Deepseek is the Chinese AI lab to watch.</span></p><p><span>Before Deepseek, CEO Liang Wenfeng‚Äôs main venture was High-Flyer (ÂπªÊñπ), a top 4 Chinese quantitative hedge fund last valued at $8 billion. Deepseek is fully funded by High-Flyer and has no plans to fundraise. It focuses on building foundational technology rather than commercial applications and has committed to open sourcing all of its models. It has also singlehandedly kicked off price wars in China by charging very affordable API rates. Despite this, Deepseek can afford to stay in the scaling game: with access to High-Flyer‚Äôs compute clusters, Dylan Patel‚Äôs </span><a href="https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1859302712803807696" rel="">best guess</a><span> is they have upwards of ‚Äú50k Hopper GPUs,‚Äù orders of magnitude more compute power than the 10k A100s they cop to publicly.</span></p><p>Deepseek‚Äôs strategy is grounded in their ambition to build AGI. Unlike previous spins on the theme, Deepseek‚Äôs mission statement does not mention safety, competition, or stakes for humanity, but only ‚Äúunraveling the mystery of AGI with curiosity‚Äù. Accordingly, the lab has been laser-focused on research into potentially game-changing architectural and algorithmic innovations.</p><p><span>Deepseek has delivered a series of impressive technical breakthroughs. Before R1-Lite-Preview, there had been a longer track record of wins: </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06066" rel="">architectural improvements</a><span> like multi-head latent attention (MLA) and sparse mixture-of-experts (DeepseekMoE) had reduced inference costs so much as to trigger a price war among Chinese developers. Meanwhile, Deepseek‚Äôs </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11931" rel="">coding model</a><span> trained on these architectures outperformed open weights rivals like July‚Äôs GPT4-Turbo.</span></p><p>As a first step to understanding what‚Äôs in the water at Deepseek, we‚Äôve translated a rare, in-depth interview with CEO Liang Wenfeng, originally published this past July on a 36Kr sub-brand. It contains some deep insights into:</p><ul><li><p>How DeepSeek‚Äôs ambitions for AGI flow through their research strategy</p></li><li><p>Why it views open source as the dominant strategy and why it ignited a price war</p></li><li><p>How he hires and organizes researchers to leverage young domestic talent far better than other labs that have splurged on returnees</p></li><li><p>Why Chinese firms settle for copying and commercialization instead of ‚Äúhardcore innovation‚Äù and how Liang hopes Deepseek will ignite more ‚Äúhardcore innovation‚Äù across the Chinese economy.  </p></li></ul><p><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/r9zZaEgqAa_lml_fOEZmjg" rel="">Wechat</a><span>, </span><a href="https://archive.is/JnE4j" rel="">Archive link</a><span>. Text | Lily Yu ‰∫é‰∏Ω‰∏Ω. Editor | Liu Jing ÂàòÊóå.</span></p><p>Of China‚Äôs seven large-model startups, DeepSeek has been the most discreet ‚Äî yet it consistently manages to be memorable in unexpected ways.</p><p>A year ago, this unexpectedness came from its backing by High-Flyer ÂπªÊñπ, a quantitative hedge fund powerhouse, making it the only non-big tech giant with a reserve of 10,000 A100 chips. A year later, it became known as the catalyst for China‚Äôs AI model price war. A year later, it became known as the catalyst for China‚Äôs AI model price war.</p><p>In May, amid continuous AI developments, DeepSeek suddenly rose to prominence. The reason was that they released an open-source model called DeepSeek V2, which offered an unprecedented price/performance ratio: inference costs were reduced to only 1 RMB per million tokens, which is about one-seventh of the cost of Llama3 70B and one-seventieth of the cost of GPT-4 Turbo.</p><p>DeepSeek was quickly dubbed the ‚ÄúPinduoduo of AI,‚Äù and other major tech giants such as ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba couldn‚Äôt hold back, cutting their prices one after another. A price war for large models in China was imminent.</p><p><strong>This diffuse smoke of war actually concealed one fact: unlike many big companies burning money on subsidies, DeepSeek is profitable.</strong></p><p><span>‚Äã‚ÄãThis success stems from DeepSeek‚Äôs comprehensive innovation in model architecture. They proposed a novel MLA (</span><strong>multi-head latent attention</strong><span>) architecture that reduces memory usage to 5-13% of the commonly used MHA architecture. Additionally, their original DeepSeekMoESparse structure minimized computational costs, ultimately leading to reduced overall costs.</span></p><p>In Silicon Valley, DeepSeek is known as ‚Äúthe mysterious force from the East‚Äù Êù•Ëá™‰∏úÊñπÁöÑÁ•ûÁßòÂäõÈáè. SemiAnalysis‚Äôs chief analyst believes the DeepSeek V2 paper ‚Äúmay be the best one of the year.‚Äù Former OpenAI employee Andrew Carr found the paper ‚Äúfull of amazing wisdom‚Äù ÂÖÖÊª°ÊÉä‰∫∫Êô∫ÊÖß, and applied its training setup to his own models. And Jack Clark, former policy head at OpenAI and co-founder of Anthropic, believes DeepSeek ‚Äúhired a group of unfathomable geniuses‚Äù Èõá‰Ω£‰∫Ü‰∏ÄÊâπÈ´òÊ∑±Ëé´ÊµãÁöÑÂ•áÊâç, adding that large models made in China ‚Äúwill be as much of a force to be reckoned with as drones and electric cars‚Äù Â∞ÜÂíåÊó†‰∫∫Êú∫„ÄÅÁîµÂä®Ê±ΩËΩ¶‰∏ÄÊ†∑ÔºåÊàê‰∏∫‰∏çÂÆπÂøΩËßÜÁöÑÂäõÈáè.</p><p><strong>In the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwave ‚Äî where the story is largely driven by Silicon Valley ‚Äî this is a rare occurrence. </strong><span>Several industry insiders told us that </span><strong>this strong response stems from innovation at the architectural level, a rare attempt by domestic large model companies and even global open-source large-scale models</strong><span>. One AI researcher said that the Attention architecture has hardly been successfully modified, let alone validated on a large scale, in the years since it was proposed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an idea that would be shut down at the decision-making stage because most people lack confidence‚Äù ËøôÁîöËá≥ÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™ÂÅöÂÜ≥Á≠ñÊó∂Â∞±‰ºöË¢´ÊéêÊñ≠ÁöÑÂøµÂ§¥ÔºåÂõ†‰∏∫Â§ßÈÉ®ÂàÜ‰∫∫ÈÉΩÁº∫‰πè‰ø°ÂøÉ.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, large domestic models have rarely dabbled in innovation at the architectural level before, partly due to a prevailing belief that </span><strong>Americans excel at 0-to-1 technical innovation, while Chinese excel at 1-to-10 application innovation</strong><span>. Moreover, this kind of behavior is very unprofitable ‚Äî after all, a new generation of models will inevitably emerge after a few months, so Chinese companies need only follow along and focus on downstream applications. Innovating the model architecture means that there is no path to follow, meaning multiple failures and substantial time and economic costs.</span></p><p>DeepSeek is clearly going against the grain. Amid the clamor that large-model technology is bound to converge and following is a smarter shortcut, DeepSeek values the learning accumulated through ‚Äúdetours‚Äù ÂºØË∑Ø, and believes that Chinese large-model entrepreneurs can join the global technological innovation stream beyond just application innovation.</p><p>Many of DeepSeek‚Äôs choices differ from the norm. Until now, among the seven major Chinese large-model startups, it‚Äôs the only one that has given up the ‚Äúwant it all‚Äù Êó¢Ë¶ÅÂèàË¶Å approach, so far focusing on only research and technology, without the toC applications. It‚Äôs also the only one that hasn‚Äôt fully considered commercialization, firmly choosing the open-source route without even raising capital. While these choices often leave it in obscurity, DeepSeek frequently gains organic user promotion within the community.</p><p>How did DeepSeek achieve this all? We interviewed DeepSeek‚Äôs seldom-seen founder, Liang Wenfeng Ê¢ÅÊñáÈîã, to find out.</p><p>The post-80s founder, who has been working behind the scenes on technology since the High-Flyer era, continues his low-key style in the DeepSeek era ‚Äî ‚Äúreading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions‚Äù ÁúãËÆ∫ÊñáÔºåÂÜô‰ª£Á†ÅÔºåÂèÇ‰∏éÂ∞èÁªÑËÆ®ËÆ∫ every day, just like every other researcher does.</p><p>And unlike many quant fund founders ‚Äî who have overseas hedge-fund experience and physics or mathematics degrees ‚Äî Liang Wenfeng has always maintained a local background: in his early years, he studied artificial intelligence at Zhejiang University‚Äôs Department of Electrical Engineering.</p><p>Multiple industry insiders and DeepSeek researchers told us that Liang Wenfeng is a very rare person in China‚Äôs AI industry ‚Äî someone who has ‚Äúboth strong infra engineering and modeling capabilities, as well as the ability to mobilize resources‚Äù he ‚Äúcan make accurate, high-level judgments, while also remaining stronger than first-line researchers in the details‚Äù. He has a ‚Äúterrifying ability to learn‚Äù, and at the same time, he is ‚Äúnot at all like a boss and much more like a geek.‚Äù</p><p><span>This is a particularly rare interview. Here, this technological idealist provides a voice that is especially scarce in China‚Äôs tech world: </span><strong>he is one of the few who puts ‚Äúright and wrong‚Äù before ‚Äúprofits and losses‚Äù</strong><span> Êää‚ÄúÊòØÈùûËßÇ‚ÄùÁΩÆ‰∫é‚ÄúÂà©ÂÆ≥ËßÇ‚Äù‰πãÂâç, </span><strong>who reminds us to see the inertia of the times, and who puts ‚Äúoriginal innovation‚Äù</strong><span> ÂéüÂàõÂºèÂàõÊñ∞ </span><strong>at the top of the agenda</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>A year ago, when DeepSeek first came off the market, we interviewed Liang Wenfeng: ‚Äú</span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fpnmf5W1rr6qTIQjbf9aCg" rel="">Crazy High-Flyer: A Stealth AI Giant‚Äôs Road to Large Models</a><span>‚Äù </span><a href="https://archive.is/OoId6" rel="">ÁñØÁãÇÁöÑÂπªÊñπÔºö‰∏ÄÂÆ∂ÈöêÂΩ¢AIÂ∑®Â§¥ÁöÑÂ§ßÊ®°Âûã‰πãË∑Ø</a><span>.

We didn‚Äôt expect pricing to be so sensitive to everyone. We were just doing things at our own pace and then accounted for and set the price.

Since big companies‚Äô model costs are much higher than ours, we never expected anyone would do this at a loss, but it eventually turned into the familiar subsidy-burning logic of the internet era.</p><p>Waves: From the outside, price cuts look a lot like bids for users, which is usually the case in internet-era price wars.</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: Poaching users is not our main purpose. We cut prices because, on the one hand, our costs decreased while exploring next-generation model architectures, and on the other hand, we also feel that both APIs and AI should be accessible and affordable to everyone.</p><p>Waves: Before this, most Chinese companies would directly copy the current generation‚Äôs Llama architecture for applications. Why did you start from the model structure?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: If the goal is to make applications, using the Llama structure for quick product deployment is reasonable. But our destination is AGI, which means we need to study new model structures to realize stronger model capability with limited resources. This is one of the fundamental research areas needed for scaling up to larger models. And beyond model structure, we‚Äôve done extensive research in other areas, including data construction and making models more human-like ‚Äî which are all reflected in the models we released. In addition, Llama‚Äôs structure, in terms of training efficiency and inference cost, is estimated to have a two-generation gap behind international frontier levels in training efficiency and inference costs.</p><p>Waves: Where does this generation gap mainly come from?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: First of all, there‚Äôs a training efficiency gap. We estimate that compared to the best international levels, China‚Äôs best capabilities might have a twofold gap in model structure and training dynamics ‚Äî meaning we have to consume twice the computing power to achieve the same results. In addition, there may also be a twofold gap in data efficiency, that is, we have to consume twice the training data and computing power to achieve the same results. Combined, that‚Äôs four times more computing power needed. What we‚Äôre trying to do is to keep closing these gaps.</p><p>Waves: Most Chinese companies choose to have both models and applications. Why has DeepSeek chosen to focus on only research and exploration?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: Because we believe the most important thing now is to participate in the global innovation wave. For many years, Chinese companies are used to others doing technological innovation, while we focused on application monetization ‚Äî but this isn‚Äôt inevitable. In this wave, our starting point is not to take advantage of the opportunity to make a quick profit, but rather to reach the technical frontier and drive the development of the entire ecosystem.</p><p>Waves: The Internet and mobile Internet eras left most people with the belief that the United States excels at technological innovation, while China excels at making applications.</p><p><span>Liang Wenfeng: We believe that as the economy develops, </span><strong>China should gradually become a contributor instead of freeriding</strong><span>. In the past 30+ years of the IT wave, we basically didn‚Äôt participate in real technological innovation. </span><strong>We‚Äôre used to Moore‚Äôs Law falling out of the sky, lying at home waiting 18 months for better hardware and software to emerge. That‚Äôs how the Scaling Law is being treated</strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>But in fact, this is something that has</strong><span> </span><strong>been created through the tireless efforts of generations of Western-led tech communities. It‚Äôs just because we weren‚Äôt previously involved in this process that we‚Äôve ignored its existence.</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png" width="166" height="135.8849557522124" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:370,&quot;width&quot;:452,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:166,&quot;bytes&quot;:99155,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41161e2-7139-4c15-84ba-0fff53b18561_452x370.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Waves: Why did DeepSeek V2 surprise so many people in Silicon Valley?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: Among the numerous innovations happening daily in the United States, this is quite ordinary. They were surprised because it was a Chinese company joining their game as an innovation contributor. After all, most Chinese companies are used to following, not innovating.</p><p>Waves: But choosing to innovate in the Chinese context is a very extravagant decision. Large models are a heavy investment game, and not all companies have the capital to solely research and innovate instead of thinking about commercialization first.</p><p><span>Liang Wenfeng: The cost of innovation is definitely not low, and past tendencies toward indiscriminate borrowing were also related to China‚Äôs previous conditions. But now you see, whether it‚Äôs China‚Äôs economic scale, or the profits of giants like ByteDance and Tencent ‚Äî none of it is low by global standards. </span><strong>What we lack in innovation is definitely not capital, but a lack of confidence and knowledge of how to organize high-density talent for effective innovation.</strong></p><p>Waves: Why do Chinese companies ‚Äî including the huge tech giants ‚Äî default to rapid commercialization as their #1 priority?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: In the past 30 years, we‚Äôve emphasized only making money while neglecting innovation. Innovation isn‚Äôt entirely business-driven; it also requires curiosity and a desire to create. We‚Äôre just constrained by old habits, but this is tied to a particular economic phase.</p><p>Waves: But you‚Äôre ultimately a business organization, not a public-interest research institution ‚Äî so where do you build your moat when you choose to innovate and then open source your innovations? Won‚Äôt the MLA architecture you released in May be quickly copied by others?</p><p><span>Liang Wenfeng: I</span><strong>n the face of disruptive technologies, moats created by closed source are temporary. Even OpenAI‚Äôs closed source approach can‚Äôt prevent others from catching up</strong><span>. S</span><strong>o we anchor our value in our team ‚Äî our colleagues grow through this process, accumulate know-how, and form an organization and culture capable of innovation. That‚Äôs our moat.</strong></p><p>Open source, publishing papers, in fact, do not cost us anything. For technical talent, having others follow your innovation gives a great sense of accomplishment. In fact, open source is more of a cultural behavior than a commercial one, and contributing to it earns us respect. There is also a cultural attraction for a company to do this.</p><p>Waves: What do you think of those who believe in the market, like [GSR Ventures‚Äô[ Zhu Xiaohu Êú±Âï∏Ëôé?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: Zhu Xiaohu is logically consistent, but his style of play is more suitable for fast money-making companies. And if you look at America‚Äôs most profitable companies, they‚Äôre all high-tech companies that accumulated deep technical foundations before making major breakthroughs.</p><p>Waves: But when it comes to large models, pure technical leadership rarely forms an absolute advantage. What bigger thing are you betting on?</p><p><span>Liang Wenfeng: </span><strong>What we see is that Chinese AI can‚Äôt be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation. If this doesn‚Äôt change, China will always be only a follower ‚Äî so some exploration is inescapable.</strong></p><p>Nvidia‚Äôs leadership isn‚Äôt just the effort of one company, but the result of the entire Western technical community and industry working together. They see the next generation of technology trends and have a roadmap in hand. Chinese AI development needs such an ecosystem. Many domestic chip developments struggle because they lack supporting technical communities and have only second-hand information. China inevitably needs people to stand at the technical frontier.</p><p>Waves: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it‚Äôs open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source.</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important.</p><p>Waves: Do you have a financing plan? I‚Äôve seen media reports saying that High-Flyer plans to spin off DeepSeek for an IPO. AI startups in Silicon Valley inevitably end up binding themselves to major firms.</p><p><span>Liang Wenfeng: We do not have financing plans in the short term. </span><strong>Money has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.</strong></p><p>Waves: Many people believe that developing AGI and quantitative finance are completely different endeavors. Quantitative finance can be pursued quietly, but AGI may require a high-profile and bold approach, forming alliances to amplify your investments.</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: More investments do not equal more innovation. Otherwise, big firms would‚Äôve monopolized all innovation already.</p><p>Waves: Are you not focusing on applications right now because you lack the operational expertise?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: We believe the current stage is a period of explosive growth in technological innovation, not in applications. In the long run, we hope to create an ecosystem where the industry directly utilizes our technology and outputs. Our focus will remain on foundational models and cutting-edge innovation, while other companies can build B2B and B2C businesses based on DeepSeek‚Äôs foundation. If a complete industry value chain can be established, there‚Äôs no need for us to develop applications ourselves. Of course, if needed, nothing stops us from working on applications, but research and technological innovation will always be our top priority.</p><p>Waves: But when customers are choosing APIs, why should they choose DeepSeek over offerings from bigger firms?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: The future world is likely to be one of specialized division of labor. Foundational large models require continuous innovation, and large companies have limits on their capabilities, which may not necessarily make them the best fit.</p><p>Waves: But can technology itself really create a significant gap? You‚Äôve also mentioned that there are no absolute technological secrets.</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: There are no secrets in technology, but replication requires time and cost. Nvidia‚Äôs graphics cards, theoretically, have no technological secrets and are easy to replicate. However, building a team from scratch and catching up with the next generation of technology takes time, so the actual moat remains quite wide.</p><p>Waves: Once DeepSeek lowered its prices, ByteDance followed suit, which shows that they feel a certain level of threat. How do you view new approaches to competition between startups and big firms?</p><p><strong>Liang Wenfeng: Honestly, we don‚Äôt really care, because it was just something we did along the way. Providing cloud services isn‚Äôt our main goal. Our ultimate goal is still to achieve AGI.</strong></p><p><span>Right now I don‚Äôt see any new approaches, but big firms do not have a clear upper hand. </span><strong>Big firms have existing customers, but their cash-flow businesses are also their burden, and this makes them vulnerable to disruption at any time.</strong></p><p>Waves: What do you see as the end game of the six other large-model startups?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: Two or three may survive. All of them are in the ‚Äúburning-money‚Äù phase right now, so those with a clear self-positioning and better refinement of operations have a higher chance of making it. Other companies might undergo significant transformations. Things of value won‚Äôt simply disappear but will instead take on a different form.</p><p>Waves: High-Flyer‚Äôs approach to competition has been described as ‚Äúimpervious,‚Äù as it pays little attention to horizontal competition. What‚Äôs your starting point when it comes to thinking about competition?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: What I often think about is whether something can improve the efficiency of society‚Äôs operations, and whether you can find a point of strength within its industrial chain. As long as the ultimate goal is to make society more efficient, it‚Äôs valid. Many things in between are just temporary phases, and overly focusing on them can lead to confusion.</p><p><span>Waves: Jack Clark, former policy director at OpenAI and co-founder of Anthropic, said that DeepSeek hired </span><a href="https://importai.substack.com/p/import-ai-372-gibberish-jailbreak" rel="">‚Äúinscrutable wizards.‚Äù</a><span> What kind of people are behind DeepSeek V2?</span></p><p><strong>Liang Wenfeng: There are no wizards. We are mostly fresh graduates from top universities, PhD candidates in their fourth or fifth year, and some young people who graduated just a few years ago.</strong></p><p>Waves: Many LLM companies are obsessed with recruiting talents from overseas, and it‚Äôs often said that the top 50 talents in this field might not even be working for Chinese companies. Where are your team members from?</p><p><strong>Liang Wenfeng: The team behind the V2 model doesn‚Äôt include anyone returning to China from overseas ‚Äî they are all local. The top 50 experts might not be in China, but perhaps we can train such talents ourselves.</strong></p><p><strong>Waves: How did this MLA innovation come about? I heard the idea originated from the personal interest of a young researcher?</strong></p><p><strong>Liang Wenfeng: After summarizing some mainstream evolutionary trends of the attention mechanism, he just thought to design an alternative. However, turning the idea into reality was a lengthy process. We formed a team specifically for this and spent months getting it to work. [</strong><em><span>Jordan: really reminiscent of how </span><a href="https://aibusiness.com/nlp/sxsw-23-openai-co-founder-shares-the-story-behind-chatgpt" rel="">Alec Radford‚Äôs early contribution to the GPT series</a><span> and speaks to the broader thesis we‚Äôve argued in the past on ChinaTalk that algorithmic innovation is fundamentally different from pushing the technological frontier in something like semiconductor fabrication. Instead of needing a PhD and years of industry experience to really be useful, you can push the frontier by being a really sharp and hungry 20something (of which China has many!). Dwarkesh‚Äôs interview with OpenAI </span><a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/sholto-douglas-trenton-bricken" rel="">Sholto Douglass and Anthropic‚Äôs Trenton Bricken</a><span> illustrates this dynamic well. Dwarkesh opens with the ine ‚ÄúNoam Brown, who wrote the Diplomacy paper, said this about Sholto: ‚Äúhe's only been in the field for 1.5 years, but people in AI know that he was one of the most important people behind Gemini's success.‚Äù</span></em><strong>]</strong></p><p>Waves: The emergence of such divergent thinking seems closely related to your innovation-driven organizational structure. Back in the High-Flyer era, your team rarely assigned goals or tasks from the top down. But AGI involves frontier exploration with much uncertainty ‚Äî has that led to more management intervention?</p><p><strong>Liang Wenfeng: DeepSeek is still entirely bottom-up. We generally don‚Äôt predefine roles; instead, the division of labor occurs naturally. Everyone has their own unique journey, and they bring ideas with them, so there‚Äôs no need to push anyone. While we explore, if someone sees a problem, they will naturally discuss it with someone else. However, if an idea shows potential, we do allocate resources top-down.</strong></p><p>Waves: I heard that DeepSeek is very flexible in mobilizing resources like GPUs and people.</p><p><strong>Liang Wenfeng: Anyone on the team can access GPUs or people at any time. If someone has an idea, they can access the training cluster cards anytime without approval. Similarly, since we don‚Äôt have hierarchies or separate departments, people can collaborate across teams, as long as there‚Äôs mutual interest.</strong></p><p>Waves: Such a loose management style relies on having highly self-driven people. I heard you excel at identifying exceptional talent through non-traditional evaluation criteria.</p><p><span>Liang Wenfeng: </span><strong>Our hiring standard has always been passion and curiosity. Many of our team members have unusual experiences, and that is very interesting. Their desire to do research often comes before making money.</strong></p><p>Waves: Transformers was born at Google‚Äôs AI Lab, and ChatGPT at OpenAI. How do you compare the value of innovations at big companies‚Äô AI labs versus startups?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: Google‚Äôs AI Lab, OpenAI, and even Chinese tech companies‚Äô AI labs are all immensely valuable. The fact that OpenAI succeeded was partly due to a few historical coincidences.</p><p>Waves: So, is innovation largely a matter of luck? I noticed that the middle row of meeting rooms in your office has doors on both sides that anyone can open. Your colleagues said that this design leaves room for serendipity. The creation of transformers involved someone overhearing a discussion and joining, ultimately turning it into a general framework.</p><p><span>Liang Wenfeng: I believe innovation starts with believing. </span><strong>Why is Silicon Valley so innovative? Because they dare to do things. When ChatGPT came out, the tech community in China lacked confidence in frontier innovation. From investors to big tech, they all thought that the gap was too big and opted to focus on applications instead. But innovation starts with confidence, which we often see more from young people.</strong></p><p>Waves: But you don‚Äôt fundraise or even speak to the public, so your visibility is lower than those companies actively fundraising. How do you ensure DeepSeek remains the top choice for those working on LLMs?</p><p><span>Liang Wenfeng: Because we‚Äôre tackling the hardest problems. Top talents are most drawn to solving the world‚Äôs toughest challenges. In fact, </span><strong>top talents in China are underestimated because there‚Äôs so little hardcore innovation happening at the societal level, leaving them unrecognized. We‚Äôre addressing the hardest problems, which makes us inherently attractive to them.</strong></p><p>Waves: When OpenAI‚Äôs latest release didn‚Äôt bring us GPT5, many people feel that this indicates technological progress is slowing and are starting to question the Scaling Law. What do you think?</p><p><span>Liang Wenfeng: We‚Äôre relatively optimistic. Our industry as a whole seems to be meeting expectations. </span><strong>OpenAI is not a god (OpenAI‰∏çÊòØÁ•û), they won‚Äôt necessarily always be at the forefront.</strong></p><p>Waves: How long until AGI is realized? Before releasing DeepSeek V2, you had models for math and code generation and also switched from dense models to Mixture of Experts. What are the key points on your AGI roadmap?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: It could be two, five, or ten years‚Äìin any case, it will happen in our lifetimes. There‚Äôs no unified opinion on a roadmap even within our company. That said, we‚Äôve taken real bets on three directions. First is mathematics and code, second multimodality, and third natural language itself.</p><p>Mathematics and code are natural AGI testing grounds, somewhat like Go. They‚Äôre closed, verifiable systems where high levels of intelligence can be self-taught. Multimodality and engagement with the real human world, on the other hand, might also be a requirement for AGI. We remain open to different possibilities.</p><p>Waves: What do you think is the end game for large models?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: There will be specialized companies providing foundation models and services, achieving extensive specialization in every node of the supply chain. More people will build on top of all of this to meet society‚Äôs diverse needs.</p><p>Waves: Over the past year, there have been many changes in China's large model startups. For example, Wang Huiwen [co-founder of RenRen, a facebook clone, and Meituan, a food delivery company], who was very active at the beginning of last year, withdrew midway, and companies that joined later began to show differentiation.</p><p><span>Liang Wenfeng: Wang Huiwen bore all the losses himself, allowing others to withdraw unscathed. He made a choice that was worst for himself but good for everyone else, so he's very decent in his conduct - this is something I really admire. [</span><em><span>Wang Huiyuan founded foundation model company ÂÖâÂπ¥‰πãÂ§ñ Lightyear only to quickly fold it back into Meituan. For more on Meituan and AI, </span><a href="https://36kr.com/p/3053948838351233" rel="">see this recent 36Kr feature</a></em><span>].</span></p><p>Waves: Where are you focusing most of your energy now?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: My main energy is focused on researching the next generation of large models. There are still many unsolved problems.</p><p>Waves: Other large model startups are insisting on pursuing both [technology and commercialization], after all, technology won't bring permanent leadership as it's also important to capitalize on a window of opportunity to translate technological advantages into products. Is DeepSeek daring to focus on model research because its model capabilities aren't sufficient yet?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: All these business patterns are products of the previous generation and may not hold true in the future. Using Internet business logic to discuss future AI profit models is like discussing General Electric and Coca-Cola when Pony Ma was starting his business. It‚Äôs a pointless exercise (ÂàªËàüÊ±ÇÂâë).</p><p>Waves: In the past, your quant fund High-Flyer had a strong foundation in technology and innovation, and its growth was relatively smooth. Is this the reason for your optimism?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: In some ways, High-Flyer strengthened our confidence in technology-driven innovation, but it wasn't all smooth sailing. We went through a long accumulation process. What outsiders see is the part of High-Flyer after 2015, but in fact, we've been at it for 16 years.</p><p>Waves: Returning to the topic of innovation. Now that the economy is starting to decline and capital is no longer as loose as it was, will this suppress basic research?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: I don't necessarily think so. The adjustment of China's industrial structure will necessarily rely more on hardcore technological innovation. When people realize that making quick money in the past was likely due to lucky windows, they'll be more willing to humble themselves and engage in genuine innovation.</p><p>An Yong: So you're optimistic about this as well?</p><p>Liang Wenfeng: I grew up in the 1980s in a fifth-tier city in Guangdong. My father was a primary school teacher. In the 1990s, there were many opportunities to make money in Guangdong. At that time, many parents came to my home; basically, they thought studying was useless. But looking back now, they‚Äôve all changed their views. Because making money isn't easy anymore‚Äîeven the opportunity to drive a taxi might be gone soon. It‚Äôs only taken one generation.</p><p>In the future, hardcore innovation will become increasingly common. It‚Äôs not easy to understand right now, because society as a whole needs to be educated on this point. Once society allows people dedicated to hardcore innovation to achieve fame and fortune, then our collective mindset will adapt. We just need some examples and a process</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Judische said he had no interest in selling the data he‚Äôd stolen from Snowflake customers and telecom providers, and that he preferred to outsource that to Kiberphant0m and others. Meanwhile, Kiberphant0m claimed in posts on Telegram that he was responsible for hacking into at least 15 telecommunications firms, including AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p>
<p>On November 26, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/hacker-in-snowflake-extortions-may-be-a-u-s-soldier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a story</a> that followed a trail of clues left behind by Kiberphantom indicating he was a U.S. Army soldier stationed in South Korea.</p>

<p>Ms. Roen said Cameron worked on radio signals and network communications at an Army base in South Korea for the past two years, returning to the United States periodically. She said Cameron was always good with computers, but that she had no idea he might have been involved in criminal hacking.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI never was aware he was into hacking,‚Äù Roen said. ‚ÄúIt was definitely a shock to me when we found this stuff out.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ms. Roen said Cameron joined the Army as soon as he was of age, following in his older brother‚Äôs footsteps.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe and his brother when they were like 6 and 7 years old would ask for MREs from other countries,‚Äù she recalled, referring to military-issued ‚Äúmeals ready to eat‚Äù food rations. ‚ÄúThey both always wanted to be in the Army. I‚Äôm not sure where things went wrong.‚Äù<span id="more-69925"></span></p>
<p>Immediately after news broke of Moucka‚Äôs arrest, Kiberphant0m posted on the hacker community <strong>BreachForums</strong>&nbsp;what they claimed were the AT&amp;T call logs for&nbsp;<strong>President-elect</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Donald J. Trump</strong>&nbsp;and for&nbsp;<strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the event you do not reach out to us @ATNT all presidential government call logs will be leaked,‚Äù Kiberphant0m threatened, signing their post with multiple ‚Äú#FREEWAIFU‚Äù tags. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think we don‚Äôt have plans in the event of an arrest? Think again.‚Äù</p>
<div id="attachment_69624"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69624" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/kiberphant0m-nsa-schema.png" alt="" width="750" height="239" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/kiberphant0m-nsa-schema.png 1417w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/kiberphant0m-nsa-schema-768x245.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/kiberphant0m-nsa-schema-782x249.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69624">Kiberphant0m posting what he claimed was a ‚Äúdata schema‚Äù stolen from the NSA via AT&amp;T.</p></div>
<p>On that same day, Kiberphant0m posted what they claimed was the ‚Äúdata schema‚Äù from the <strong>U.S. National Security Agency</strong>.</p>
<p>On Nov. 5, Kiberphant0m offered call logs stolen from Verizon‚Äôs push-to-talk (PTT) customers ‚Äî mainly U.S. government agencies and emergency first responders. On Nov. 9, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on BreachForums offering a ‚ÄúSIM-swapping‚Äù service targeting Verizon PTT customers. In a SIM-swap, fraudsters use credentials that are phished or stolen from mobile phone company employees to divert a target‚Äôs phone calls and text messages to a device they control.</p>
<p>The profile photo on Wagenius‚Äô Facebook page was deleted within hours of my Nov. 26 story identifying Kiberphant0m as a likely U.S. Army soldier. Still, many of his original profile photos remain, including several that show Wagenius in uniform while holding various Army-issued weapons.</p>
<div id="attachment_69972"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69972" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/wagenius-fb.png" alt="" width="602" height="842"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69972">Several profile photos visible on the Facebook page of Cameron Wagenius.</p></div>
<p>November‚Äôs story on Kiberphant0m cited his own Telegram messages saying he maintained a large botnet that was used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to knock websites, users and networks offline. In 2023, Kiberphant0m sold remote access credentials for a major U.S. defense contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Allison Nixon,</strong>&nbsp;chief research officer at the New York-based cybersecurity firm <a href="https://www.unit221b.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unit 221B</a>, helped track down Kiberphant0m‚Äôs real life identity. Nixon was among several security researchers who faced harassment and specific threats of violence from Judische and his associates.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnonymously extorting the President and VP as a member of the military is a bad idea, but it‚Äôs an even worse idea to harass people who specialize in de-anonymizing cybercriminals,‚Äù Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. She said&nbsp;the investigation into Kiberphant0m shows that law enforcement is getting better and faster at going after cybercriminals ‚Äî especially those who are actually living in the United States.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBetween when we, and an anonymous colleague, found his opsec mistake on November 10th to his last Telegram activity on December 6, law enforcement set the speed record for the fastest turnaround time for an American federal cyber case that I have witnessed in my career,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Nixon asked to share a message for all the other Kiberphant0ms out there who think they can‚Äôt be found and arrested.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know that young people involved in cybercrime will read these articles,‚Äù Nixon said. ‚ÄúYou need to stop doing stupid shit and get a lawyer. Law enforcement wants to put all of you in prison for a long time.‚Äù</p>
<p>The indictment against Wagenius was filed in Texas, but the case has been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle.</p>

<article>
	
  
	<p>The smartphone boom changed everything. Suddenly, apps were everywhere, connecting people, solving problems, and entertaining us. But for a while now, they‚Äôve started to feel more like a burden than a blessing. In today‚Äôs web-first world, most native apps feel redundant, cluttering our phones unnecessarily. With how far modern web technologies have come, it‚Äôs time to rethink if we really need them.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt just a guess‚Äîit‚Äôs already happening. Here‚Äôs why.</p>
<h3>The Problem with Native Apps</h3>
<h4>Too Many Apps, Too Little Reason</h4>
<p>Remember when every company rushed to make an app? Airlines, restaurants, even your local coffee shop. Back then, it made some sense. Browsers weren‚Äôt as powerful, and apps had unique features like notifications and offline access. But fast-forward to today, and browsers can do all that. Yet businesses still push native apps as if it‚Äôs 2010, and we‚Äôre left downloading apps for things that should just work on the web.</p>
<p>My wife recently had a rant about the Italki website, which forced her to download their app just to accept class requests on mobile. Frustrated by the app clutter and the company‚Äôs behavior, she downloaded the app, accepted the request, then promptly deleted it. She‚Äôs so fed up with unnecessary apps that she keeps only five on her phone. It‚Äôs one thing to hear complaints like this from someone in tech, but coming from a regular user like my wife, it‚Äôs clear that the app overload problem has gone completely out of hand.</p>
<h4>Costly, Clunky, and Cluttered</h4>
<p>Native apps are a pain for everyone involved. Developers pay hefty app store fees, jump through approval hoops, and juggle multiple platform versions. Users? We‚Äôre stuck with constant updates, wasted storage space, and apps that don‚Äôt even work on all our devices.</p>
<p>And don‚Äôt let anyone tell you the App Store solves discoverability. Apps aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù there; they‚Äôre marketed through ads, SEO, or word-of-mouth‚Äîjust like websites. So why go through the extra hassle?</p>
<h4>Specialized, But Rarely Essential</h4>
<p>Yes, native apps still have their place, like video/image editing where it‚Äôs better for working with local files. But these are niche use cases. For most situations, web apps have caught up. They‚Äôre faster, more flexible, and work seamlessly across devices. Native apps? Not so much.</p>
<h3>Why Web Apps Are the Future</h3>
<h4>Accessible Everywhere, All the Time</h4>
<p>Web apps can easily adapt to whatever device you‚Äôre on. A single responsive website can run on your desktop, phone, tablet, or even a VR headset. What‚Äôs even more, they can be updated on all of them simultaneously. That‚Äôs a level of flexibility that native apps can‚Äôt match.</p>
<h4>The Power of Modern Browsers</h4>
<p>Today‚Äôs browsers are powerhouses. Notifications? Check. Offline mode? Check. Secure payments? Yep, they‚Äôve got that too. And with technologies like WebAssembly and WebGPU, web games are catching up to native-level performance. In some cases, they‚Äôre already there.</p>
<h3>The Gaming Frontier</h3>
<h4>All Caught Up</h4>
<p>If there‚Äôs one industry proving the web‚Äôs potential, it‚Äôs gaming. Thanks to HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly, browser games are catching up to native ones in ways we couldn‚Äôt have imagined just a few years ago. Meta‚Äôs Oculus browser already delivers web games that rival native apps in performance. And once WebGPU becomes standard, the differences will be practically invisible.</p>
<h4>Growing Popularity</h4>
<p>Platforms like <a href="https://poki.com/" rel="nofollow">Poki</a> and <a href="https://crazygames.com/" rel="nofollow">CrazyGames</a>, with a combined 95 million players a month, are leading the charge in, what I like to call, the Browser Games Renaissance. These platforms are already showing what‚Äôs possible with web gaming.</p>
<p>I recently caught up with Raf Mertens, founder and CEO of CrazyGames, who shared: <em>‚ÄúUsers don‚Äôt care about the technology; they want something fun and accessible. It should just work‚Äîand that includes instantly. At CrazyGames, we aim to deliver high-quality games in an accessible format. We‚Äôre attracting new game developers into the web space and converting mobile developers.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Raf also highlighted how the synergy between tools like Rogue Engine and platforms like CrazyGames is essential for the web gaming ecosystem to thrive.</p>
<p>Even platforms that cater to multiple formats are seeing the browser‚Äôs dominance. In a recent chat with Leaf, the creator of <a href="https://itch.io/" rel="nofollow">itch.io</a>, he shared, <em>‚ÄúBrowser games make up about 50% of all games on the site. It‚Äôs a pretty big section and continually growing.‚Äù</em>.</p>
<p>One great example of a very successful web game, is <a href="https://narrow.one/" rel="nofollow">Narrow One</a> by <a href="https://www.pelicanparty.co/#home" rel="nofollow">Pelican Party</a>. This two-person game studio has been thriving for the past five years exclusively with web games. Jasper from Pelican Party shared how this model has worked perfectly for them and many other game studios. They‚Äôre living proof that browser games can provide a sustainable business model.</p>
<h4>Tooling Is Catching Up</h4>
<p>Web game development is evolving fast. <a href="https://threejs.org/" rel="nofollow">Three.js</a>, the leading programming library for 3D web content, is pushing beyond WebGL into WebGPU, and at <a href="https://rogueengine.io/">Rogue Engine</a>, we‚Äôre committed to being the go-to game engine for <a href="https://threejs.org/" rel="nofollow">Three.js</a> and the web. We focus on keeping the experience simple, web-first, and familiar for developers‚Äîespecially those transitioning from Unity, thanks to our similar environments.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also working closely with <a href="https://multisynq.io/" rel="nofollow">Multisynq</a> to integrate serverless networking with <a href="https://croquet.io/" rel="nofollow">Croquet</a>, through our <a href="https://github.com/BeardScript/RogueCroquet" rel="nofollow">Rogue Croquet</a> plugin. This is making it easier for developers to build connected, multiplayer web games, at a fraction of the price, without worrying about backend infrastructure. As technology advances, we‚Äôre committed to staying ahead, pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible on the web, and making these innovations accessible to all developers.</p>
<h3>The Challenges Ahead</h3>
<h4>Browser UX Needs an Upgrade</h4>
<p>For web apps to dominate, browsers have to evolve. Mobile browsers, in particular, need smarter navigation and better use of screen space. It should feel like using your desktop or mobile home screen‚Äîunobtrusive, customizable, and flawless.</p>
<h4>App Stores Won‚Äôt Let Go Easily</h4>
<p>Let‚Äôs face it: Google, Apple, and other app store giants aren‚Äôt going to give up their cash cow without a fight. But as web apps continue to grow, their dominance will diminish. It‚Äôs not a question of if, but when.</p>
<h4>Bad Actors</h4>
<p>Some companies push for app installations because they gain access to more permissions than they would in the browser. Apps allow them to collect more data and track user activity, often under the pretense of a better experience. They‚Äôd much rather escape the safety of the browser where you get more control and transparency over these permissions.</p>
<h4>VCs Are Overlooking the Web Gaming Revolution</h4>
<p>The web game development space is on fire, but many VCs are still missing the point. They see the potential but are waiting for the ‚Äúright‚Äù platform to show up before jumping in. What they don‚Äôt get is that this puts unnecessary pressure on tools like ours or <a href="https://multisynq.io/" rel="nofollow">Multisynq</a> and portals like <a href="https://poki.com/" rel="nofollow">Poki</a>, and <a href="https://crazygames.com/" rel="nofollow">CrazyGames</a>, who are already seeing huge success. VCs are sitting on the sidelines, ignoring the strength of the ecosystem and the clear demand for web games. The time to act is now, and those who hesitate will be left scrambling when the web gaming revolution takes off.</p>
<h3>The Web-Centric Future</h3>
<p>With WebGPU, WebAssembly, and WebXR, the web isn‚Äôt just catching up‚Äîit‚Äôs pulling ahead. Developers who embrace this shift now will be free from app store restrictions, ready to create experiences that work anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>Sure, a few niche native apps will stick around. But for the vast majority of games, tools, and everything in between, the web is the future. The app craze was fun while it lasted, but it‚Äôs time to get back to what the web was always meant to be: a universal platform for everyone. At the end of the day, most apps should‚Äôve been websites all along.</p>
<p>Come join the party at <a href="https://rogueengine.io/">Rogue Engine</a>. Let‚Äôs make something awesome together!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/30/att_verizon_confirm_salt_typhoon_breach/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/30/att_verizon_confirm_salt_typhoon_breach/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42555594">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies confirmed that Chinese government-backed snoops accessed portions of their systems earlier this year, while the White House added another, yet-unnamed telecommunications company to the list of those breached by Salt Typhoon.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/14/salt_typhoon_hacked_multiple_telecom/">digital intrusion</a>, which has been called the‚Äã "worst telecom hack in our nation's history," gave Beijing-backed spies the "capability to geolocate millions of individuals" and "record phone calls at will," Anne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/12/27/on-the-record-press-gaggle-by-white-house-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-38/">told</a> reporters.</p>
<p>In a statement emailed to <em>The Register</em>, AT&amp;T said the foreign spies compromised "a small number" of its customers in the espionage campaign and added that the PRC-backed crew had since been kicked out of its networks.</p>

    

<p>"We detect no activity by nation-state actors in our networks at this time," an AT&amp;T spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>"Based on our current investigation of this attack, the People's Republic of China targeted a small number of individuals of foreign intelligence interest," the statement added. "In the relatively few instances in which an individual's information was impacted, we have complied with our notification obligations in cooperation with law enforcement."</p>
<p>AT&amp;T continues to monitor its networks and work with government officials, other telecom firms, and cybersecurity experts on the investigation, the spokesperson said.</p>

        

<p>Verizon also confirmed that the Chinese intruders had accessed "a small number of high-profile customers in government and politics." A spokesperson told <em>The Register</em> that it notified these customers, and has since "contained the cyber incident brought on by this nation-state threat actor."</p>
<p>An unnamed, "highly respected" cybersecurity company has also confirmed the containment, the Verizon spokesperson added.</p>
<p>According to the operator's chief legal officer, Verizon partnered with federal law enforcement, national security agencies, other telecom partners, and security firms upon detecting the network activity.</p>

        

<p>"We have not detected threat actor activity in Verizon's network for some time, and after considerable work addressing this incident, we can report that Verizon has contained the activities associated with this particular incident," Verizon's Chief Legal Officer Vandana Venkatesh told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, Lumen Technologies, another one of the firms <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/07/verizon_att_lumen_salt_typhoon/">reportedly breached</a> in the attack, told us that it has also booted the Chinese attackers out of its systems, and said it found "no evidence" that customer data was accessed.</p>
<p>"An independent forensics firm has confirmed Salt Typhoon is no longer in our network," a spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>. "In addition, our federal partners have not shared any information that would suggest otherwise."</p>
<p>T-Mobile's security boss previously <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/05/tmobile_cso_telecom_attack/">spoke</a> to <em>The Register</em> about the espionage campaign and said it thwarted successful attacks on its systems "within a single-digit number of days."</p>
<h3>9 telecom firms compromised, White House says</h3>
<p>The companies' admissions come as a top White House official added another unnamed firm to the breach, bringing the total thus far to nine. Neuberger previously said eight had been compromised. Only three ‚Äî AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile US ‚Äî have confirmed the intrusion.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We believe a large number of individuals were affected by geolocation and metadata of phones; a smaller number around actual collection of phone calls and texts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The Chinese gained access to networks, essentially had broad and full access," Neuberger told reporters. "We believe that's why they had the capability to geolocate millions of individuals, to record phone calls at will, because they had that broad access."</p>
<p>In one instance, the spies broke into an admin account that then gave them access to more than 100,000 routers, she added. "So, when the Chinese compromised that account, they gained that kind of broad access across the network," Neuberger said. "That's not meaningful cybersecurity to defend against a nation-state actor."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The White House doesn't yet have a number on how many total people were affected by the breach, she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We believe a large number of individuals were affected by geolocation and metadata of phones; a smaller number around actual collection of phone calls and texts," Neuberger said. "And I think the scale we're talking about is far larger on the geolocation; probably less than 100 on the actual individuals."</p>
<p>Following the intrusion, the White House emphasized the inadequacy of voluntary cybersecurity measures against nation-state threats. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) launched a public rule <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/06/salt_typhoon_fcc_proposal/">proposal</a> requiring basic cybersecurity practices for telecom carriers. The commissioners are expected to vote on the rule by January 15.</p>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the FCC's own efforts, US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) has also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/11/telecom_cybersecurity_standards/">proposed legislation</a> that would require the FCC to issue binding rules for telecom systems.</p>
<p>Plus, according to Neuberger, all of the nine telecom CEOs whose companies were hacked have signed on to the government's 60-day Enduring Security Framework.</p>
<p>This public-private effort aims to put in place minimum cybersecurity practices that have been agreed upon by intelligence officers, CISA, the FBI, and telecom security experts. ¬Æ</p>

        Dear Orbit User,
        </p><p>
        I trust this email finds you well amidst the cacophony of technological marvels that continue to dazzle us mere mortals. Ah, but let us take a moment to bask in the radiant glow of Artificial Intelligence, that wondrous creation that promises to revolutionize our existence like nothing before! Oh, the sheer joy of living in an era where machines possess the intellect to outsmart us at every turn!
        </p><p>
        Let's delve into the enchanting world of AI, shall we? Brace yourself for a journey through the lands of algorithmic superiority and the utopia of automation.
        </p><p>
        Firstly, let's celebrate the ingenuity of AI in its remarkable ability to render even the simplest of tasks utterly complex. Why settle for straightforward solutions when you can bask in the glory of convoluted algorithms and endless parameter tweaking? Oh, the sheer delight of spending countless hours trying to figure out why your AI model insists on classifying your cat as a dog!
        </p><p>
        And let's not forget the unparalleled joy of witnessing AI's prowess in predictive analytics. It's simply magical how AI can predict what I want to buy, watch, or do next based on my previous actions. Who needs free will anyway when we have algorithms to dictate our every move?
        </p><p>
        Oh, and let's raise a toast to the magnificence of AI chatbots! Gone are the days of meaningful human interaction. Why engage in genuine conversation when you can spend eternity navigating through a maze of pre-programmed responses that barely scratch the surface of comprehension?
        </p><p>
        But wait, there's more! Let us not overlook the awe-inspiring advancements in AI-generated content. Why bother with the creative process when you can feed a machine a bunch of data and watch it regurgitate something vaguely resembling art?

Here‚Äôs to embracing the quirks and wonders of AI, and to finding joy in the process‚Äîeven when it means occasionally laughing at our own reflections in the digital mirror.

        Your Annoying Friend/Boss/Neighbor
