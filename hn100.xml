<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Sometimes the money’s good, sometimes not so good. Either way, Shaun Beckles loves the human aspect of working as a for-hire vehicle driver — getting to know fares even just a little in passing, gaining a glimpse into so many different lives over the course of a single shift.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">“I’ve always liked driving for the mere fact that you get to meet some interesting people who can connect with your passion, you’d be surprised,” says Beckles, now operations manager at The Drivers Cooperative. The driver-owned ride-hailing platform, which </span><a href="https://nextcity.org/podcast/this-ride-hailing-app-alternative-is-owned-by-the-drivers">launched</a> in 2021, is hitting some major milestones this year: It has a new app, it’s the official transportation partner for Juneteenth NY, and – per new revenue data provided exclusively to Next City – it’s nearly breaking even financially. The co-op expects to see its first profits this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Beckles moved to New York from Guyana as a teen in the ‘80s, and quickly took to driving as a way to help make ends meet. He’d sit in his Dodge Shadow outside the popular Ess-a-Bagel shop in Manhattan’s posh Gramercy Park neighborhood, waiting for a call on the radio from dispatch. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Though Beckles eventually moved into the telecommunications industry, he later took up driving part-time for a ride-hailing platform as an opportunity to do something he loved while earning some income to help cover the ever-rising cost of living.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">“You couldn’t pass a billboard without the enticing $5,000 a month or make this crazy amount of money and in such little time,” Beckles says. “So I got caught by that –and then quickly realized it was also an exploiting situation.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">It wasn’t just the failed promise of $5,000 a month. There was also the impersonal nature of working for a company that seemed more concerned with its investors than its drivers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Now, as one of the top executives at The Drivers Cooperative, Beckles relishes the opportunity to run a ride-hailing company where he interfaces with drivers regularly. Some sit on the co-op’s board of directors. Many others participate regularly in meetings as part of running the fast-growing startup: meetings about the company’s recently overhauled app, </span><a href="https://drivers.coop/download">“Co-Op Ride,”</a> meetings about setting the co-op’s minimum hourly wage, or meetings to discuss setting up a $1 surcharge on each trip to help other co-op members purchase electric vehicles. And sometimes it’s just conversations between peers, colleagues and friends.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">“There is no other company where drivers can connect with an operations leader or finance leader and have a one-on-one conversation about either struggles on the road or their expectations for the week,” Beckles says. “That for me is a big differentiator for why members are here, regardless of the growing pains, because they’re not going to be able to have someone listen and adapt to what they’re trying to accomplish for themselves.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">In 2022, its first full year of operation, The Driver’s Cooperative earned $5.9 million in revenue from 162,294 successful trips — and $5.2 million of that went directly to driver wages. That 2022 revenue is 12 times what the co-op took in for 2021, though it didn’t launch until the end of May 2021. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Even with its minimum hourly wage of $30 an hour, the co-op is nearly breaking even, recording a net loss of just $318,000 in 2022. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">With the growth it’s already seeing in 2023, The Drivers Cooperative expects to earn its first annual profit — some of which will be distributed back out as dividends to drivers. Currently there are 9,000 drivers who are or will soon be members of the co-op — an estimated 15% percent of the total ride-hailing platform driver workforce in New York City. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">The co-op’s leadership team now consists entirely of former drivers, all of whom are people of color, including Beckles, driver engagement manager David Alexis and finance manager Cynette Wilson.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Born and raised in Chicago, Wilson started out in ride-hailing in New York as a driver with one of the co-op’s behemoth rivals back in 2018. She recently had the opportunity to walk her fellow driver-owners through all the good financial news in their annual membership meeting, which she followed up with an internal fireside chat about the co-op’s finances. She plans to make the fireside chats a quarterly event for member-owners of the Drivers Cooperative.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">“I went through the [profit and loss statement] with the membership, took any questions they had about any particular line items and painted the picture of what profitability looks like, what it’s going to take for us to get there and how close we are,” Wilson says. </span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Taking on the competition</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">The Drivers Cooperative got to where it is by mapping out a phased growth path for its business model. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">The co-op realized early on that it couldn’t initially compete on the same terms with Uber or Lyft because it didn’t have access to the same pool of deep-pocketed venture capital investors. It didn’t have what those kinds of investors eventually want — the chance to go public and get listed on a stock exchange, allowing early investors to cash out their shares for five times, ten times or some other crazy multiple of their startup investment. Those are the investors that can fund a massive marketing blitz to riders (and drivers) and an army of software engineers working out bugs in the app almost in real time. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">The Drivers Cooperative does have outside investors: It raised $1.6 million from more than 1,100 individuals through the crowdfund investment platform WeFunder </span><a href="https://wefunder.com/driverscoop">last year</a>. But those investors are limited to earning back 2.5 times what they invested, as opposed to typical venture capital investors seeking five, 10 or 100 times what they invest in a company. Limiting returns to early stage investors gives the co-op the financial flexibility to do things like set its $30 an hour minimum wage or create an internal fund to help drivers purchase electric vehicles. Not only that, venture capital investors typically take a strong role on the board of a company, so the probability that an investor-oriented company proactively does those things for drivers is much lower.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">The market entry bar is also higher now that the ride-hailing giants are so established. Riders expect a certain level of functionality – and the shortest possible wait times for a ride. That means any business in this space somehow needs to have a critical mass of drivers signed up behind the scenes before gaining any real traction from ride-hailing. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">So The Drivers Cooperative instead focused first on prescheduled trips: primarily government-funded paratransit, non-emergency medical transportation, and staff transportation for larger businesses. The Drivers Cooperative estimates the overall market for prescheduled trips to be about 30,000 total trips per day across New York City, representing $300 million in revenue.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Focusing on prescheduled trips allowed the co-op to establish its $30-an-hour minimum wage. It works by asking drivers to sign up for a four-, six- or eight-hour shift for the next day. As long as The Drivers Cooperative can calculate at least one day in advance how many drivers it will have for the next day, it can calculate how many prescheduled trip appointments it can schedule based on pick up and drop off locations and estimated drive times. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Scheduling trips is a tricky calculation, and it all comes down to routing — you want drivers to spend as much of their shift as they can actually driving clients around, but you have to leave enough time in-between trips so the driver isn’t late for their next client. So far, the only way to do this successfully has been by using a team of human dispatchers, though the co-op is working on an automated solution using artificial intelligence. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Thanks to the predictability of the overall market for prescheduled trips, The Drivers Cooperative was able to set its $30-an-hour minimum wage. Most of the time, the revenues from each driver’s prescheduled trips on a shift net the driver at least that amount, sometimes more. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">There are some rare occasions when a driver’s prescheduled trips don’t net enough to cover the minimum. When that happens, the co-op has an automated mechanism to pay however much is necessary to ensure the promised minimum hourly wage for the driver. In 2022, the co-op made about $70,000 in extra payouts to make up for prescheduled shifts that didn’t bring in enough revenue to cover the $30-an-hour minimum wage.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">“We have a driver-centric focus because we were drivers,” Wilson says. “So even now with the design of how we improve our pay flows, or with the new app, all these little tweaks and minute differences, that makes such a big difference in the experience of the driver.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">The Drivers Cooperative is now banking on that $30-an-hour minimum wage as one of the pillars of its driver recruiting efforts, key to getting its ride-hailing wait times down to the point where it can compete with the incumbent ride-hailing apps. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">There are an estimated 600,000 ride-hailing trips per day in New York City, representing $4.4 billion in revenue. As part of its early marketing shift to the broader ride-hailing market, the co-op was just announced as the </span><a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/confirmed-schedule-of-events-sponsors-for-the-14th-annual-juneteenth-22054808">official transportation partner for Juneteeth NY’s</a> upcoming weekend of festivities — offering 5% discounts on rides to events and also free trips for Juneteenth NY festival staff.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">Other recruiting pillars include the Drivers Cooperative’s various programs for drivers, like the fund to help purchase electric vehicles, which includes low-interest or zero-interest vehicle loans through partnerships with the Lower East Side People’s Federal Credit Union and the Hebrew Free Loan Society. Members of the Drivers Cooperative can also refinance any existing high-interest predatory vehicle loans with a lower-interest loan from one of the lending partners. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">And of course, there’s also the opportunity to join a cooperative and participate in it as a member-owner, meeting face-to-face with top executives on a regular basis to help shape the company. As part of the board of directors and other committees, drivers got to be part of interviewing and choosing Wilson to manage the co-op’s finances. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">She still likes to take a driving shift every now and then – just this month, she took on a Wednesday shift.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-cbbe18b9-7fff-3c2a-99d8-f10a83c1bf3f">“Being cooperative, everyone does have a voice and their voice is important,” Wilson says. “Especially in finance, to actually open the door and invite people in and create a space where they’re comfortable to come visit at least once a quarter is important. These are those things where we keep a finger on the pulse…keep the humanity in the face of all the technology.”</span></p>

              <p><span>I</span>t’s summer in San Diego, California, where I live. When I walk down the street, I can smell the delirious musk of jasmine clinging to the air<strong>.</strong>  My nose picks up the languid smokiness of briquets burning on barbecues, taking me back to decades of yard parties. But given the heat wave descending on the city, the garbage is also throwing off a sickly stench, hinting at decay. These odors are all good signs.&nbsp;</p><p>We have long known that smell has potent connections to memory and emotion, as the endurance of Proust’s proverbial madeleine moment attests. In fact, the limbic system, including the amygdala and the hippocampus, is responsible for processing not just memory and emotion, but also smell. While Western culture has generally <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8946147/#:~:text=The%20American%20Medical%20Association%20Guides,sense%20of%20smell%20much%20value." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relegated</a> the sense of smell to the lowest rank since the time of Plato, some hunter-gatherer groups such as the Semaq Beri of the Malay peninsula have more words for smells than for color hues. Now, researchers are learning that the sense of smell is critical as a marker of brain disease and health.</p><p>Over the past decade, loss of smell—known as hyposmia—has emerged as an early indicator of several neurodegenerative disorders, according to a recent <em>International Journal of Molecular Science</em> <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/3/2117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review</a> of 20 papers. The high prevalence and early onset of smell loss, along with the development of sensitive olfactory tests, has raised interest in it as a diagnostic tool for Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, in particular. But loss of smell also afflicts people with <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8673514/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huntington’s disease</a>, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.msard-journal.com/article/S2211-0348(18)30084-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple sclerosis</a>, and <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9393534/#:~:text=A%20meta%2Danalysis%20study%20found,et%20al.%2C%202017)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mild cognitive impairment</a>. Catching these diseases early by testing for powers of smell could give patients a head start on neuroprotective and disease-modifying therapies.</p><blockquote>
<p>The power of the nose peaks in middle age, around age 40.</p>
</blockquote><p>The connection between odor detection and brain health makes sense. Our sense of smell begins in the nose and then proceeds directly to the olfactory bulb at the base of the brain. It’s the first sensory structure we have that provides direct contact with sensory stimuli and environmental pathogens in the air. Experimental evidence suggests olfactory bulb neurons play a key role not just in the loss of smell but also in the early stages of brain disease.&nbsp;</p><p>Some researchers at the University of Padova in Italy are looking at how the sudden smell loss characteristic of COVID-19 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9444897/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">connects</a> with Parkinson’s disease. Viral infections, like COVID-19, and regional inflammatory processes may trigger defective proteins to aggregate, a feature of Parkinson’s, and lead neurons to subsequently degenerate, the researchers hypothesize. Certain psychiatric diseases are also associated with smell dysfunction: Schizophrenia patients have shallower nasal cavities and smaller olfactory bulbs than healthy individuals, as well as other nasal abnormalities that Alzheimer’s patients also experience.</p><p>Not everyone with smell loss will develop brain disease. The acuity of our sense of smell declines as we age but follows a different trajectory from that of some other cognitive and perceptual abilities. While short-term memory peaks at age 25, for example, the power of the nose peaks in middle age, around age 40, and then gradually begins to slip. Age-related loss of smell is greater in men than women, and women have a higher total number of olfactory bulb cells than men—at least 50 percent more, on average, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> suggests.</p><p>Aside from its connection to neurodegeneration, smell is also a powerful marker of overall health and mortality risk. In one longitudinal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3916729/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> of 1,162 healthy older people (without dementia) the mortality rate over a four-year period was 45 percent for those with the lowest baseline olfactory test scores, compared to 18 percent for those with the highest scores, even after controlling for age and other factors.</p>
          <p>It is surprisingly difficult to know when we have lost our sense of smell: About 70 percent of people living with a loss of smell don’t realize it until they’re tested. (If you’re curious, you can take a simple scratch and sniff <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mysmelltest.org/sfmc?et_cid=2447792&amp;et_rid=237629145&amp;et_lid=https%3A%2F%2Fmysmelltest.org%2Fsfmc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smell test</a> to find out how well your nose performs, and depending on the results, you could receive an invite to join a research study sponsored by the Michael J. Fox Foundation.)&nbsp; There may be more truth than we realized to the saying, “Follow your nose.”&nbsp; <img decoding="async" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p><em>Lead image: Lightspring / Shutterstock</em></p>

<p>I turned 40 last month and spent three weeks reading <em>Don Quixote,</em>&nbsp;so the mid-life crisis has been on my brain.</p>
<p>“Never waste your midlife crisis.”</p>
<p>That’s advice I heard while&nbsp;listening to <a href="https://www.adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts/wmcgmfe7zj7chps-89fa4-2e48e-rwzy8-824b8-4mdjd-2hcs8-chrb2-7y8jj-5pcse-2wtsh-cz8zd-e3cdy-g68s7-3dezn-7k5mw-y739l-p75rr-jr8a7-7akgj-l4zms-mbmhm-486s5-jg45z-n3dba-3g2sh-3bme9-m284e">a podcast interview</a>&nbsp;with <a href="https://johnhiggs.com/">John Higgs</a>, author of <a href="https://geni.us/5eE3"><em>William Blake vs. The World.</em></a> (One of my <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2022/12/28/my-reading-year-2022/">favorite reads of 2022</a>.)</p>
<p>Higgs was saying that the artists he admires are people like David Lynch, “People who you wouldn’t think there’s an obvious place for them in the world, but they just do their stuff regardless, and a place sort of builds around them.”</p>
<p>He continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s a concept in ecology of ‘niche creation.’ And the idea is: it’s not the case that a species will sort of come along and go, ‘oh, I could do well here, there’s lots of food,’ and things like that. A species comes along and just does his thing, and by acting in the world, he sort of creates the very environment he needs to survive.</p>
<p>It was when I made the decision to attempt to become a full-time writer — knowing full well the absurdity of it given all the business models of writing — there was a sort of act of faith that if I just <em>did it</em>, people who read my books would start to appear. And slowly over time, I’d build people who would go, ‘Oh, that guy’s interesting, I’ll read his next book.’ Just enough to support me.</p>
<p>You sort of create the niche that need. It’s not like the world was going, ‘Oh, there’s a real need for books by John Higgs, where are they?’ But if you do them, the world sort of reacts around them.</p></blockquote>
<p>“It’s always on an edge of never working out properly,” he admits, but it’s working so far, and it all started when he turned 40 and made the decision to go for it:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>You should never waste your midlife crisis. You can do great things with a midlife crisis</strong>. If you just waste it on like a car, it’s just a lack of imagination. Mine was the decision to write books and attempt to make a living there.</p>
<p>The options seemed to be: If I went for it, I’d be penniless, and if I didn’t go for it, I’d be bitter. I’d be bitter going forward. Penniless certainly beats bitter. So I made the decision. And that was ten years ago! And I’m still going.</p></blockquote>
<p>Loved this. <em>Never waste your midlife crisis.</em></p>
<p>(I’m currently listening to his book <a href="https://geni.us/nPTk"><em>Love and Let Die: James Bond, The Beatles, and the British Psyche</em></a> while playing Zelda. He points out that James Bond was basically Ian Fleming’s mid-life crisis.)</p>

        </h2>
        

<p>
This post is about why we need a coroutine package for Go, and what it would look like.
But first, what are coroutines?

</p><p>
Every programmer today is familiar with function calls (subroutines):
F calls G, which stops F and runs G.
G does its work, potentially calling and waiting for other functions, and eventually returns.
When G returns, G is gone and F continues running.
In this pattern, only one function is running at a time,
while its callers wait, all the way up the call stack.

</p><p>
In contrast to subroutines, coroutines run concurrently on different stacks,
but it's still true that only one is running at a time,
while its caller waits.
F starts G, but G does not run immediately.
Instead, F must explicitly <i>resume</i> G, which then starts running.
At any point, G may turn around and <i>yield</i> back to F.
That pauses G and continues F from its resume operation.
Eventually F calls resume again, which pauses F and continues G from its yield.
On and on they go, back and forth, until G returns, which cleans up G and
continues F from its most recent resume, with some signal to F that G is done
and that F should no longer try to resume G.
In this pattern, only one coroutine is running at a time,
while its caller waits on a different stack.
They take turns in a well-defined, coordinated manner.

</p><p>
This is a bit abstract. Let's look at real programs.
<a href="#lua"></a></p><h2 id="lua"><a href="#lua">Coroutines in Lua</a></h2>


<p>
To use a <a href="https://research.swtch.com/pcdata#gopher">venerable example</a>, consider comparing two binary trees
to see if they have the same value sequence, even if their structures are different.
For example, here is code in <a href="https://lua.org/">Lua 5</a> to generate some binary trees:
</p><pre>function T(l, v, r)
    return {left = l, value = v, right = r}
end

e = nil
t1 = T(T(T(e, 1, e), 2, T(e, 3, e)), 4, T(e, 5, e))
t2 = T(e, 1, T(e, 2, T(e, 3, T(e, 4, T(e, 5, e)))))
t3 = T(e, 1, T(e, 2, T(e, 3, T(e, 4, T(e, 6, e)))))
</pre>


<p>
The trees <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> both contain the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; <code>t3</code> contains 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.

</p><p>
We can write a coroutine to walk over a tree and yield each value:
</p><pre>function visit(t)
    if t ~= nil then  -- note: ~= is "not equal"
        visit(t.left)
        coroutine.yield(t.value)
        visit(t.right)
    end
end
</pre>


<p>
Then to compare two trees, we can create two visit coroutines and
alternate between them to read and compare successive values:
</p><pre>function cmp(t1, t2)
    co1 = coroutine.create(visit)
    co2 = coroutine.create(visit)
    while true
    do
        ok1, v1 = coroutine.resume(co1, t1)
        ok2, v2 = coroutine.resume(co2, t2)
        if ok1 ~= ok2 or v1 ~= v2 then
            return false
        end
        if not ok1 and not ok2 then
            return true
        end
    end
end
</pre>


<p>
The <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> arguments to <code>coroutine.resume</code> are only used on the first iteration,
as the argument to <code>visit</code>.
Subsequent resumes return that value from <code>coroutine.yield</code>, but the code ignores the value.

</p><p>
A more idiomatic Lua version would use <code>coroutine.wrap</code>, which returns a function
that hides the coroutine object:
</p><pre><span>function cmp(t1, t2)</span>
    next1 = coroutine.wrap(function() visit(t1) end)
    next2 = coroutine.wrap(function() visit(t2) end)
<span>    while true</span>
<span>    do</span>
        v1 = next1()
        v2 = next2()
        if v1 ~= v2 then
<span>            return false</span>
<span>        end</span>
        if v1 == nil and v2 == nil then
<span>            return true</span>
<span>        end</span>
<span>    end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre>


<p>
When the coroutine has finished, the <code>next</code> function returns <code>nil</code> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/rsc/5908886288b741b847a83c0c6597c690">full code</a>).
<a href="#python"></a></p><h2 id="python"><a href="#python">Generators in Python (Iterators in CLU)</a></h2>


<p>
Python provides generators that look a lot like Lua's coroutines,
but they are not coroutines, so it's worth pointing out the differences.
The main difference is that the “obvious” programs don't work.
For example, here's a direct translation of our Lua tree and visitor to Python:
</p><pre>def T(l, v, r):
    return {'left': l, 'value': v, 'right': r}

def visit(t):
    if t is not None:
        visit(t['left'])
        yield t['value']
        visit(t['right'])
</pre>


<p>
But this obvious translation doesn't work:
</p><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; e = None
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = T(T(T(e, 1, e), 2, T(e, 3, e)), 4, T(e, 5, e))
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in visit(t1):
...     print(x)
...
4
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>


<p>
We lost 1, 2, 3, and 5. What happened?

</p><p>
In Python, that <code>def visit</code> does not define an ordinary function.
Because the body contains a <code>yield</code> statement, the result is a generator instead:
</p><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(visit(t1))
&lt;class 'generator'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>


<p>
The call <code>visit(t['left'])</code> doesn't run the code in <code>visit</code> at all.
It only creates and returns a new generator, which is then discarded.
To avoid discarding those results, you have to loop over the generator and re-yield them:
</p><pre><span></span>
<span>def visit(t):</span>
<span>    if t is not None:</span>
        for x in visit(t['left']):
            yield x
<span>        yield t['value']</span>
        for x in visit(t['right'])
            yield x
</pre>


<p>
Python 3.3 introduced <code>yield</code> <code>from</code>, allowing:
</p><pre><span>def visit(t):</span>
<span>    if t is not None:</span>
        yield from visit(t['left']):
<span>        yield t['value']</span>
        yield from visit(t['right'])
</pre>


<p>
The generator object contains the state of the single call to <code>visit</code>,
meaning local variable values and which line is executing.
That state is pushed onto the call stack each time the generator is resumed
and then popped back into the generator object at each <code>yield</code>,
which can only occur in the top-most call frame.
In this way, the generator uses the same stack as the original program,
avoiding the need for a full coroutine implementation
but introducing these confusing limitations instead.

</p><p>
Python's generators appear to be almost exactly copied from CLU,
which pioneered this abstraction (and so many other things),
although CLU calls them iterators, not generators.
A CLU tree iterator looks like:
</p><pre>visit = iter (t: cvt) yields (int):
    tagcase t
        tag empty: ;
        tag non_empty(t: node):
            for x: int
                in tree$visit(t.left) do
                    yield(x);
                    end;
            yield(t.value);
            for x: int
                in tree$visit(t.right) do
                    yield(x);
                    end;
        end;
    end visit;
</pre>


<p>
The syntax is different, especially the <code>tagcase</code> that is examining
a tagged union representation of a tree, but the basic structure,
including the nested <code>for</code> loops, is exactly the same as our first
working Python version.
Also, because CLU was statically typed, <code>visit</code> is clearly marked as an iterator (<code>iter</code>)
not a function (<code>proc</code> in CLU).
Thanks to that type information,
misuse of <code>visit</code> as an ordinary function call,
like in our buggy Python example,
is something that the compiler could (and I assume did) diagnose.

</p><p>
About CLU's implementation, the original implementers wrote,
“Iterators are a form of coroutine; however, their use is sufficiently constrained
that they are implemented using just the program stack.
Using an iterator is therefore only slightly more expensive than using a
procedure.”
This sounds exactly like the explanation I gave above for the Python generators.

At first glance, coroutines, threads, and generators look alike.
All three provide <a href="https://research.swtch.com/pcdata">concurrency</a> in one form or another,
but they differ in important ways.
</p><ul>
<li>


<p>
Coroutines provide concurrency without parallelism:
when one coroutine is running, the one that resumed it
or yielded to it is not.

</p><p>
Because coroutines run one at a time and only switch at specific
points in the program, the coroutines can share data among themselves
without races.
The explicit switches (<code>coroutine.resume</code> in the first Lua example
or calling a <code>next</code> function in the second Lua example)
serve as synchronization points, creating <a href="https://research.swtch.com/gomm#gos_memory_model_today">happens-before edges</a>.

</p><p>
Because scheduling is explicit (without any preemption)
and done entirely without the operating system,
a coroutine switch takes at most around ten nanoseconds, usually even less.
Startup and teardown is also much cheaper than threads.
</p></li><li>


<p>
Threads provide more power than coroutines, but with more cost.
The additional power is parallelism, and the cost is
the overhead of scheduling, including more expensive context switches
and the need to add preemption in some form.
Typically the operating system provides threads,
and a thread switch takes a few microseconds.

</p><p>
For this taxonomy, Go's goroutines are cheap threads:
a goroutine switch is closer to a few hundred nanoseconds,
because the Go runtime takes on some of the scheduling work,
but goroutines still provide the full parallelism and preemption
of threads.
(Java's new lightweight threads are basically the same as goroutines.)
</p></li><li>


<p>
Generators provide less power than coroutines, because only
the top-most frame in the coroutine is allowed to yield.
That frame is moved back and forth between an object and the call stack
to suspend and resume it.</p></li></ul>


<p>
Coroutines are a useful building block for writing programs that want
concurrency for program structuring
but not for parallelism.
For one detailed example of that, see my previous post,
“<a href="https://research.swtch.com/pcdata">Storing Data in Control Flow</a>”.
For other examples, see Ana Lúcia De Moura and Roberto Ierusalimschy's 2009 paper
“<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1462166.1462167">Revisiting Coroutines</a>”.
For the original example, see Melvin Conway's 1963 paper
“<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/366663.366704">Design of a Separable Transition-Diagram Compiler</a>”.
<a href="#why"></a></p><h2 id="why"><a href="#why">Why Coroutines in Go?</a></h2>


<p>
Coroutines are a concurrency pattern not directly
served by existing Go concurrency libraries.
Goroutines are often close enough,
but as we saw,
they are not the same, and sometimes that difference matters.

</p><p>
For example,
Rob Pike's 2011 talk “<a href="https://go.dev/talks/2011/lex.slide">Lexical Scanning in Go</a>”
presents the original lexer and parser for the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/text/template">text/template package</a>.
They ran in separate goroutines connected by a channel,
imperfectly simulating a pair of coroutines: the
lexer and parser ran in parallel, with the lexer looking ahead to
the next token while the parser processed the most recent one.
Generators would not have been good enough—the lexer yields values from many different functions—but
full goroutines proved to be a bit too much.
The parallelism provided by the goroutines caused races
and eventually led to abandoning the design
in favor of the lexer storing state in an object,
which was a more faithful simulation of a coroutine.
Proper coroutines would have avoided the races
and been more efficient than goroutines.

</p><p>
An anticipated future use case for coroutines in Go
is iteration over generic collections.
We have discussed adding support to Go for
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/56413">ranging over functions</a>,
which would encourage authors of collections and other abstractions
to provide CLU-like iterator functions.
Iterators can be implemented today using function values, without any language changes.
For example, a slightly simplified tree iterator in Go could be:
</p><pre>func (t *Tree[V]) All(yield func(v V)) {
    if t != nil {
        t.left.All(yield)
        yield(t.value)
        t.right.All(yield)
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
That iterator can be invoked today as:
</p><pre>t.All(func(v V) {
    fmt.Println(v)
})
</pre>


<p>
and perhaps a variant could be invoked in a future version of Go as:
</p><pre>for v := range t.All {
    fmt.Println(v)
}
</pre>


<p>
Sometimes, however, we want to iterate over a collection
in a way that doesn't fit a single <code>for</code> loop.
The binary tree comparison is an example of this:
the two iterations need to be interlaced somehow.
As we've already seen, coroutines would provide an answer,
letting us turn a function like <code>(*Tree).All</code> (a “push” iterator)
into a function that returns a stream of values, one per call
(a “pull” iterator).
<a href="#how"></a></p><h2 id="how"><a href="#how">How to Implement Coroutines in Go</a></h2>


<p>
If we are to add coroutines to Go, we should aim to do it without language changes.
That means the definition of coroutines should be possible to implement
and understand in terms of ordinary Go code.
Later, I will argue for an optimized implementation provided directly by the runtime,
but that implementation should be indistinguishable from the pure Go definition.

</p><p>
Let's start with a very simple version that ignores the yield operation entirely.
It just runs a function in another goroutine:
</p><pre>package coro

func New[In, Out any](f func(In) Out) (resume func(In) Out) {
    cin := make(chan In)
    cout := make(chan Out)
    resume = func(in In) Out {
        cin &lt;- in
        return &lt;-cout
    }
    go func() { cout &lt;- f(&lt;-cin) }()
    return resume
}
</pre>


<p>
<code>New</code> takes a function <code>f</code> which must have one argument and one result.
<code>New</code> allocates channels, defines <code>resume</code>,
creates a goroutine to run <code>f</code>,
and returns the <code>resume</code> funtion.
The new goroutine blocks on <code>&lt;-cin</code>,
so there is no opportunity for parallelism.
The <code>resume</code> function unblocks the
new goroutine by sending an <code>in</code> value and then
blocks receiving an <code>out</code> value.
This send-receive pair makes a coroutine switch.
We can use <code>coro.New</code> like this (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/gLhqAutT9Q4">full code</a>):
</p><pre>func main() {
    resume := coro.New(strings.ToUpper)
    fmt.Println(resume("hello world"))
}
</pre>


<p>
So far, <code>coro.New</code> is just a clunky way to call a function.
We need to add <code>yield</code>, which we can pass as an argument to <code>f</code>:
</p><pre>func New[In, Out any](f func(in In, yield func(Out) In) Out) (resume func(In) Out) {
<span></span>
<span>    cin := make(chan In)</span>
<span>    cout := make(chan Out)</span>
<span>    resume = func(in In) Out {</span>
<span>        cin &lt;- in</span>
<span>        return &lt;-cout</span>
<span>    }</span>
    yield := func(out Out) In {
        cout &lt;- out
        return &lt;-cin
    }
    go func() { cout &lt;- f(&lt;-cin, yield) }()
<span>    return resume</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>


<p>
Note that there is still no parallelism here: <code>yield</code> is another send-receive pair.
These goroutines are constrained by the communication pattern
to act indistinguishably from coroutines.
<a href="#parser"></a></p><h2 id="parser"><a href="#parser">Example: String Parser</a></h2>


<p>
Before we build up to iterator conversion, let's look at a few simpler examples.
In “<a href="https://research.swtch.com/pcdata">Storing Data in Control Flow</a>,” we considered the problem of
taking a function
</p><pre>func parseQuoted(read func() byte) bool
</pre>


<p>
and running it in a separate control flow so that bytes can be provided one
at a time to a <code>Write</code> method. Instead of the ad hoc channel-based implementation
in that post, we can use:
</p><pre>type parser struct {
    resume func(byte) Status
}

func (p *parser) Init() {
    coparse := func(_ byte, yield func(Status) byte) Status {
        read := func() byte { return yield(NeedMoreInput) }
        if !parseQuoted(read) {
            return BadInput
        }
        return Success
    }
    p.resume = coro.New(coparse)
    p.resume(0)
}

func (p *parser) Write(c byte) Status {
    return p.resume(c)
}
</pre>


<p>
The <code>Init</code> funtion does all the work, and not much.
It defines a function <code>coparse</code> that has the signature needed by <code>coro.New</code>,
which means adding a throwaway input of type <code>byte</code>.
That function defines a <code>read</code> that yields <code>NeedMoreInput</code>
and then returns the byte provided by the caller.
It then runs <code>parseQuoted(read)</code>, converting the boolean result
to the usual status code.
Having created a coroutine for <code>coparse</code> using <code>coro.New</code>,
<code>Init</code> calls <code>p.resume(0)</code> to allow <code>coparse</code> to advance
to the first read in <code>parseQuoted</code>.
Finally the <code>Write</code> method is a trivial wrapper around <code>p.resume</code> (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/MNGVPk11exV">full code</a>).

</p><p>
This setup abstracts away the pair of channels that we
maintained by hand in the previous post, allowing us to work
at a higher level as we write the program.
<a href="#sieve"></a></p><h2 id="sieve"><a href="#sieve">Example: Prime Sieve</a></h2>


<p>
As a slightly larger example, consider <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/sieve/sieve.pdf">Doug McIlroy's concurrent prime sieve</a>.
It consists of a pipeline of coroutines, one for each prime <code>p</code>, each running:
</p><pre>loop:
    n = get a number from left neighbor
    if (p does not divide n)
        pass n to right neighbor
</pre>


<p>
A counting coroutine on the leftmost side of the pipeline feeds the numbers 2, 3, 4, ... into the left end of the pipeline.
A printing coroutines on the rightmost side can read primes out, print them, and create new filtering coroutines.
The first filter in the pipeline removes multiples of 2, the next removes multiples of 3, the next removes multiples of 5, and so on.

</p><p>
The <code>coro.New</code> primitive we've created lets us take a straightforward loop that yields values
and convert it into a function that can be called to obtain each value one at a time.
Here is the counter:
</p><pre>func counter() func(bool) int {
    return coro.New(func(more bool, yield func(int) bool) int {
        for i := 2; more; i++ {
            more = yield(i)
        }
        return 0
    })
}
</pre>


<p>
The counter logic is the function literal passed to <code>New</code>.
It takes a yield function of type <code>func(int)</code> <code>bool</code>.
The code yields a value by passing it to <code>yield</code> and then receives back a boolean
saying whether to continue generating more numbers.
When told to stop, either because <code>more</code> was false on entry
or because a <code>yield</code> call returned false,
the loop ends.
It returns a final, ignored value, to satisfy the function
type required by <code>New</code>.

</p><p>
<code>New</code> turns this into loop a function that is the inverse of <code>yield</code>: a <code>func(bool)</code> <code>int</code>
that can be called with true to obtain the next value or with false to shut down
the generator.
The filtering coroutine is only slightly more complex:
</p><pre>func filter(p int, next func(bool) int) (filtered func(bool) int) {
    return coro.New(func(more bool, yield func(int) bool) int {
        for more {
            n := next(true)
            if n%p != 0 {
                more = yield(n)
            }
        }
        return next(false)
    })
}
</pre>


<p>
It takes a prime <code>p</code> and a <code>next</code> func connected to the coroutine on the left
and then returns the filtered output stream to connect to the coroutine on the right.

</p><p>
Finally we have the printing coroutine:
</p><pre>func main() {
    next := counter()
    for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
        p := next(true)
        fmt.Println(p)
        next = filter(p, next)
    }
    next(false)
}
</pre>


<p>
Starting with the counter, <code>main</code> maintains in <code>next</code> the output
of the pipeline constructed so far.
Then it loops: read a prime <code>p</code>, print <code>p</code>, and then add a new
filter on the right end of the pipeline to remove multiples of <code>p</code> (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/3OHQ_FHe_Na">full code</a>).

</p><p>
Notice that the calling relationship between coroutines can change over time:
any coroutine C can call another coroutine D's <code>next</code> function and become the
coroutine that D yields to.
The counter's first <code>yield</code> goes to <code>main</code>, while its subsequent <code>yield</code>s
go to the 2-filter.
Similarly each <code>p</code>-filter <code>yield</code>s its first output (the next prime) to <code>main</code>
while its subsequent <code>yield</code>s go to the filter for that next prime.
<a href="#goroutines"></a></p><h2 id="goroutines"><a href="#goroutines">Coroutines and Goroutines</a></h2>


<p>
In a certain sense, it is a misnomer to call these control flows coroutines.
They are full goroutines, and they can do everything an ordinary
goroutine can, including block waiting for mutexes, channels,
system calls, and so on.
What <code>coro.New</code> does is create goroutines
with access to coroutine switch operations
inside the <code>yield</code> and <code>resume</code> functions (which the sieve calls <code>next</code>).
The ability to use those operations can even be passed to
different goroutines, which is happening with <code>main</code> handing off
each of its <code>next</code> streams to each successive <code>filter</code> goroutine.
Unlike the <code>go</code> statement, <code>coro.New</code> adds new concurrency to the program
<i>without</i> new parallelism.
The goroutine that <code>coro.New(f)</code> creates can only run
when some other goroutine explicitly loans it the
ability to run using <code>resume</code>; that loan is repaid by <code>yield</code>
or by <code>f</code> returning.
If you have just one main goroutine
and run 10 <code>go</code> statements, then all 11 goroutines can be running at once.
In contrast, if you have one main goroutine
and run 10 <code>coro.New</code> calls, there are now 11 control flows
but the parallelism of the program is what it was before: only one runs at a time.
Exactly which goroutines are paused in coroutine operations
can vary as the program runs, but the parallelism never increases.

</p><p>
In short, <code>go</code> creates a new concurrent, <i>parallel</i> control flow,
while <code>coro.New</code> creates a new concurrent, <i>non-parallel</i> control flow.
It is convenient to continue to talk about the non-parallel control flows
as coroutines, but remember that exactly which goroutines are
“non-parallel” can change over the execution of a program,
exactly the same way that which goroutines are receiving or sending from channels
can change over the execution of a program.
<a href="#resume"></a></p><h2 id="resume"><a href="#resume">Robust Resumes</a></h2>


<p>
There are a few improvements we can make to <code>coro.New</code> so that it works better in real programs.
The first is to allow <code>resume</code> to be called after the function is done: right now it deadlocks.
Let's add a bool result indicating whether <code>resume</code>'s result came from a yield.
The <code>coro.New</code> implementation we have so far is:
</p><pre>func New[In, Out any](f func(in In, yield func(Out) In) Out) (resume func(In) Out) {
    cin := make(chan In)
    cout := make(chan Out)
    resume = func(in In) Out {
        cin &lt;- in
        return &lt;-cout
    }
    yield := func(out Out) In {
        cout &lt;- out
        return &lt;-cin
    }
    go func() {
        cout &lt;- f(&lt;-cin, yield)
    }()
    return resume
}
</pre>


<p>
To add this extra result, we need to track whether <code>f</code> is running
and return that result from <code>resume</code>:
</p><pre>func New[In, Out any](f func(in In, yield func(Out) In) Out) (resume func(In) (Out, bool)) {
<span>    cin := make(chan In)</span>
<span>    cout := make(chan Out)</span>
    running := true
    resume = func(in In) (out Out, ok bool) {
        if !running {
            return
        }
<span>        cin &lt;- in</span>
        out = &lt;-cout
        return out, running
<span>    }</span>
<span>    yield := func(out Out) In {</span>
<span>        cout &lt;- out</span>
<span>        return &lt;-cin</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>    go func() {</span>
        out := f(&lt;-cin, yield)
        running = false
        cout &lt;- out
<span>    }()</span>
<span>    return resume</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>


<p>
Note that since <code>resume</code> can only run when the calling goroutine is blocked,
and vice versa, sharing the <code>running</code> variable is not a race.
The two are synchronizing by taking turns executing.
If <code>resume</code> is called after the coroutine has exited, <code>resume</code> returns a zero value and false.

</p><p>
Now we can tell when a goroutine is done (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/Y2tcF-MHeYS">full code</a>):
</p><pre>func main() {
    resume := coro.New(func(_ int, yield func(string) int) string {
        yield("hello")
        yield("world")
        return "done"
    })
    for i := 0; i &lt; 4; i++ {
        s, ok := resume(0)
        fmt.Printf("%q %v\n", s, ok)
    }
}


$ go run cohello.go
"hello" true
"world" true
"done" false
"" false
$
</pre>
<a href="#iterator"><h2 id="iterator">Example: Iterator Conversion</h2></a>


<p>
The prime sieve example showed direct use of <code>coro.New</code>,
but the <code>more bool</code> argument was a bit awkward and does not
match the iterator functions we saw before.
Let's look at converting any push iterator into a pull iterator
using <code>coro.New</code>.
We will need a way to terminate the coroutine running
the push iterator if we want to stop early, so we will add a boolean
result from <code>yield</code> indicating whether to continue,
just like in the prime sieve:
</p><pre>push func(yield func(V) bool)
</pre>


<p>
The goal of the new function <code>coro.Pull</code> is to turn that push function
into a pull iterator. The iterator will return the next value
and a boolean indicating whether the iteration is over,
just like a channel receive or map lookup:
</p><pre>pull func() (V, bool)
</pre>


<p>
If we want to stop the push iteration early, we need some
way to signal that, so <code>Pull</code> will return not just the pull
function but also a stop function:
</p><pre>stop func()
</pre>


<p>
Putting those together, the full signature of <code>Pull</code> is:
</p><pre>func Pull[V any](push func(yield func(V) bool)) (pull func() (V, bool), stop func()) {
    ...
}
</pre>


<p>
The first thing <code>Pull</code> needs to do is start a coroutine to run the push iterator,
and to do that it needs a wrapper function with the right type,
namely one that takes a <code>more bool</code> to match the bool result from <code>yield</code>,
and that returns a final <code>V</code>.
The <code>pull</code> function can call <code>resume(true)</code>, while the <code>stop</code> function can call <code>resume(false)</code>:
</p><pre>func Pull[V any](push func(yield func(V) bool)) (pull func() (V, bool), stop func()) {
    copush := func(more bool, yield func(V) bool) V {
        if more {
            push(yield)
        }
        var zero V
        return zero
    }
    resume := coro.New(copush)
    pull = func() (V, bool) {
        return resume(true)
    }
    stop = func() {
        resume(false)
    }
    return pull, stop
}
</pre>


<p>
That's the complete implementation.
With the power of <code>coro.New</code>, it took very little code and effort to build a nice iterator converter.

</p><p>
To use <code>coro.Pull</code>, we need to redefine the tree's <code>All</code> method
to expect and use the new <code>bool</code> result from <code>yield</code>:
</p><pre>func (t *Tree[V]) All(yield func(v V) bool) {
    t.all(yield)
}

func (t *Tree[V]) all(yield func(v V) bool) bool {
    return t == nil ||
        t.Left.all(yield) &amp;&amp; yield(t.Value) &amp;&amp; t.Right.all(yield)
}
</pre>


<p>
Now we have everything we need to write a tree comparison function in Go (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/hniFxnbXTgH">full code</a>):
</p><pre>func cmp[V comparable](t1, t2 *Tree[V]) bool {
    next1, stop1 := coro.Pull(t1.All)
    next2, stop2 := coro.Pull(t2.All)
    defer stop1()
    defer stop2()
    for {
        v1, ok1 := next1()
        v2, ok2 := next2()
        if v1 != v2 || ok1 != ok2 {
            return false
        }
        if !ok1 &amp;&amp; !ok2 {
            return true
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<h2 id="panic"><a href="#panic">Propagating Panics</a></h2>


<p>
Another improvement is to pass panics from a coroutine back to its caller,
meaning the coroutine that most recently called <code>resume</code> to run it
(and is therefore sitting blocked in <code>resume</code> waiting for it).
Some mechanism to inform one goroutine when another panics is a very common request,
but in general that can be difficult, because we don't know which
goroutine to inform and whether it is ready to hear that message.
In the case of coroutines, we have the caller blocked waiting for news,
so it makes sense to deliver news of the panic.

</p><p>
To do that, we can add a <code>defer</code> to catch a panic in the new coroutine
and trigger it again in the <code>resume</code> that is waiting.
</p><pre>type msg[T any] struct {
    panic any
    val   T
}
<span></span>
<span>func New[In, Out any](f func(in In, yield func(Out) In) Out) (resume func(In) (Out, bool)) {</span>
<span>    cin := make(chan In)</span>
    cout := make(chan msg[Out])
<span>    running := true</span>
<span>    resume = func(in In) (out Out, ok bool) {</span>
<span>        if !running {</span>
<span>            return</span>
<span>        }</span>
<span>        cin &lt;- in</span>
        m := &lt;-cout
        if m.panic != nil {
            panic(m.panic)
        }
        return m.val, running
<span>    }</span>
<span>    yield := func(out Out) In {</span>
        cout &lt;- msg[Out]{val: out}
<span>        return &lt;-cin</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>    go func() {</span>
        defer func() {
            if running {
                running = false
                cout &lt;- msg[Out]{panic: recover()}
            }
        }()
<span>        out := f(&lt;-cin, yield)</span>
<span>        running = false</span>
        cout &lt;- msg[Out]{val: out}
<span>    }()</span>
<span>    return resume</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>


<p>
Let's test it out (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/Sihm8KVlTIB">full code</a>):
</p><pre>func main() {
    defer func() {
        if e := recover(); e != nil {

        }
    }()
    next, _ := coro.Pull(func(yield func(string) bool) {
        yield("hello")
        panic("world")
    })
    for {
        fmt.Println(next())
    }
}

<p>
The new coroutine yields <code>hello</code> and then panics <code>world</code>.
That panic is propagated back to the main goroutine,
which prints the value and repanics.
We can see that the panic appears to originate in the call to <code>resume</code>:
</p><pre>% go run coro.go
hello true
main panic: world
panic: world [recovered]
    panic: world

goroutine 1 [running]:
main.main.func1()
    /tmp/coro.go:9 +0x95
panic({0x108f360?, 0x10c2cf0?})
    /go/src/runtime/panic.go:1003 +0x225
main.coro_New[...].func1()
    /tmp/coro.go.go:55 +0x91
main.Pull[...].func2()
    /tmp/coro.go.go:31 +0x1c
main.main()
    /tmp/coro.go.go:17 +0x52
exit status 2
%
</pre>
<a href="#cancel"><h2 id="cancel">Cancellation</h2></a>


<p>
Panic propagation takes care of telling the caller about an early coroutine exit,
but what about telling a coroutine about an early caller exit?
Analogous to the <code>stop</code> function in the pull iterator,
we need some way to signal to the coroutine that it's no longer needed,
perhaps because the caller is panicking, or perhaps because the caller
is simply returning.

</p><p>
To do that, we can change <code>coro.New</code> to return not just <code>resume</code> but
also a <code>cancel</code> func.
Calling <code>cancel</code> will be like <code>resume</code>, except that <code>yield</code> panics instead of returning a value.
If a coroutine panics in a different way during cancellation,
we want <code>cancel</code> to propagate that panic, just as <code>resume</code> does.
But of course we don't want <code>cancel</code> to propagate its own panic,
so we create a unique panic value we can check for.
We also have to handle a cancellation in before <code>f</code> begins.
</p><pre>var ErrCanceled = errors.New("coroutine canceled")

<p>
We could change <code>Pull</code> to use panics to cancel iterators as well,
but in that context the explicit <code>bool</code> seems clearer,
especially since stopping an iterator is unexceptional.
<a href="#sieve2"></a></p><h2 id="sieve2"><a href="#sieve2">Example: Prime Sieve Revisited</a></h2>


<p>
Let's look at how panic propagation and cancellation make cleanup of the prime sieve “just work”.
First let's update the sieve to use the new API.
The <code>counter</code> and <code>filter</code> functions are already
“one-line” <code>return coro.New(...)</code> calls.
They change signature to include the additional cancel func returned from <code>coro.New</code>:
</p><pre>func counter() (func(bool) (int, bool), func()) {
    return coro.New(...)
}

func filter(p int, next func(bool) (int, bool)) (func(bool) (int, bool), func()) {
    return coro.New(...)
}
</pre>


<p>
Then let's convert the <code>main</code> function to be a <code>primes</code> function that prints <code>n</code> primes (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/XWV8ACRKjDS">full code</a>):
</p><pre>func primes(n int) {
    next, cancel := counter()
    defer cancel()
    for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {
        p, _ := next(true)
        fmt.Println(p)
        next, cancel = filter(p, next)
        defer cancel()
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
When this function runs, after it has gotten <code>n</code> primes, it returns.
Each of the deferred <code>cancel</code> calls cleans up the
coroutines that were created.
And what if one of the coroutines has a bug and panics?
If the coroutine was resumed by a <code>next</code> call in <code>primes</code>,
then the panic comes back to <code>primes</code>, and <code>primes</code>'s deferred
<code>cancel</code> calls clean up all the other coroutines.
If the coroutine was resumed by a <code>next</code> call in a <code>filter</code> coroutine,
then the panic will propagate up to the waiting <code>filter</code> coroutine
and then the next waiting <code>filter</code> coroutine, and so on, until it
gets to the <code>p</code> <code>:=</code> <code>next(true)</code> in <code>primes</code>, which will
again clean up the remaining coroutines.
<a href="#api"></a></p><h2 id="api"><a href="#api">API</a></h2>


<p>
The API we've arrived at is:</p><blockquote>

<p>
New creates a new, paused coroutine ready to run the function f.
The new coroutine is a goroutine that never runs on its own:
it only runs while some other goroutine invokes and waits for it,
by calling resume or cancel.

</p><p>
A goroutine can pause itself and switch to the new coroutine by calling resume(in).
The first call to resume starts f(in, yield).
Resume blocks while f runs, until either f calls yield(out) or returns out.
When f calls yield, yield blocks and resume returns out, true.
When f returns, resume returns out, false.
When resume has returned due to a yield, the next resume(in)
switches back to f, with yield returning in.

</p><p>
Cancel stops the execution of f and shuts down the coroutine.
If resume has not been called,
then f does not run at all.
Otherwise, cancel causes the blocked yield call
to panic with an error satisfying errors.Is(err, ErrCanceled).

</p><p>
If f panics and does not recover the panic,
the panic is stopped in f's coroutine and restarted in the goroutine
waiting for f, by causing the blocked resume or cancel that is waiting
to re-panic with the same panic value.
Cancel does not re-panic when f's panic is one that
cancel itself triggered.

</p><p>
Once f has returned or panicked, the coroutine no longer exists.
Subsequent calls to resume return zero, false.
Subsequent calls to cancel simply return.

</p><p>
The functions resume, cancel, and yield can be passed between
and used by different goroutines, in effect dynamically changing
which goroutine is “the coroutine.”
Although New creates a new goroutine, it also establishes an
invariant that one goroutine is always blocked,
either in resume, cancel, yield, or (right after New)
waiting for the resume that will call f.
This invariant holds until f returns, at which point the
new goroutine is shut down.
The net result is that coro.New creates new concurrency in the program
without any new parallelism.

</p><p>
If multiple goroutines call resume or cancel, those calls are serialized.
Similarly, if multiple goroutines call yield, those calls are serialized.</p></blockquote>
<pre>func New[In, Out any](f func(in In, yield func(Out) In) Out) (resume func(In) (Out, bool), cancel func())
</pre>
<a href="#efficiency"><h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2></a>


<p>
As I said at the start, while it's important to have a definition of coroutines
that can be understood by reference to a pure Go implementation,
I believe we should use an optimized runtime implementation.
On my 2019 MacBook Pro, passing values back and
forth using the channel-based <code>coro.New</code> in this post requires
approximately 190ns per switch, or 380ns per value in <code>coro.Pull</code>.
Remember that <code>coro.Pull</code> would not be the standard way
to use an iterator: the standard way would be to invoke the iterator
directly, which has no coroutine overhead at all.
You only need <code>coro.Pull</code> when you want to process
iterated values incrementally, not using a single for loop.
Even so, we want to make <code>coro.Pull</code> as fast as we can.

</p><p>
First I tried having the compiler mark send-receive pairs
and leave hints for the runtime to fuse them into a single operation.
That would let the channel runtime bypass the scheduler
and jump directly to the other coroutine.
This implementation requires
about 118ns per switch, or 236ns per pulled value (38% faster).
That's better, but it's still not as fast as I would like.
The full generality of channels is adding too much overhead.

</p><p>
Next I added a direct coroutine switch to the runtime,
avoiding channels entirely.
That cuts the coroutine switch to three atomic compare-and-swaps
(one in the coroutine data structure, one for the scheduler status
of the blocking coroutine, and one for the scheduler status of the resuming coroutine),
which I believe is optimal given the safety invariants that must be maintained.
That implementation takes 20ns per switch, or 40ns per pulled value.
This is about 10X faster than the original channel implementation.
Perhaps more importantly, 40ns per pulled value seems small enough
in absolute terms not to be a bottleneck for code that needs <code>coro.Pull</code>.

<p>The Internet Archive also archives physical books. The archive’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/albumofornamenta00thre/mode/2up">2010 scan</a> of a late 19th century catalogue of colourful granite tiles came to my attention recently - thanks to <a href="https://kottke.org/23/04/19th-century-ornamental-granite-tiles">this post on kottke.org</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://blotcdn.com/blog_866ae794fdc14da08ec437c326b3a12e/_image_cache/184fac1f-e8c2-4c05-a03c-3e3d882e28aa.jpg" alt="Album of Ornamental Granite Tiles" width="900" height="711" data-action="zoom"><span>Album of Ornamental Granite Tiles</span></p>
<p>I decided to build a <strong><a href="https://www.deepakg.com/_assets/tiler.html">little web app that’d allow me to play with the tiles in this catalogue</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The original catalogue only shows a little over 1/4th of the design but by digitising these tiles I could complete all 4 quadrants.</p>
<p><img src="http://blotcdn.com/blog_866ae794fdc14da08ec437c326b3a12e/_image_cache/ff0d0a42-a3fb-4907-9861-c0043c4754e0.jpg" width="1000" height="530" data-action="zoom"></p>
<p>I could also choose how many tiles I wanted to use and even decide how big (up to a point) an individual tile should be. For now I’ve settled on 10 rows x 10 columns of 55px tiles including the border.</p>
<p>While some tiles in this catalogue are symmetrical, others are not. Which means combining them after rotating in multiples of <span>90º</span> or mirroring them results in patterns that sometimes surprise you. Depending on the tile, mirroring and rotating are not equivalent and can give different results:</p>
<p><img src="http://blotcdn.com/blog_866ae794fdc14da08ec437c326b3a12e/_image_cache/88f30ba8-ea77-4a38-9877-d67d38542971.jpg" alt="Using the original tile as is, or rotating/mirroring it while tiling, results in different patterns" width="1000" height="527" data-action="zoom"><span>Using the original tile as is, or rotating/mirroring it while tiling, results in different patterns</span></p>
<p>When you select the rotate option, the app does this:</p>
<p><img src="http://blotcdn.com/blog_866ae794fdc14da08ec437c326b3a12e/_image_cache/27eb350b-3319-43cd-ac2b-1a5939fdc0b4.png" alt="Rotation explained" width="308" height="304.5"><span>Rotation explained</span></p>
<p>Depending on the initial rotation of the first tile you can get very different patterns:</p>
<p><img src="http://blotcdn.com/blog_866ae794fdc14da08ec437c326b3a12e/_image_cache/e154b598-d27f-4921-9440-05e961565070.png" alt="When using rotation, the rotation of the starting tile matters" width="399.5" height="280" data-action="zoom"><span>When using rotation, the rotation of the starting tile matters</span></p>
<p>The mirror option just constructs the first rows by flipping the alternate tiles horizontally and makes the second row by flipping the first row vertically. The first two rows are then repeated.</p>
<p><img src="http://blotcdn.com/blog_866ae794fdc14da08ec437c326b3a12e/_image_cache/cf45f698-3ab3-4fc7-8884-f052d656f0db.png" alt="Mirroring explained" width="308" height="304.5"><span>Mirroring explained</span></p>
<p>The borders were another fascinating detail that add an extra visual flair to the designs. While the catalogue illustrates a limited number of border + main tile combinations (19 in all), we of course can combine any border with any tile (a whopping 19x19 = 361 possibilities).</p>
<p>Another thing I realised when tinkering with the borders is that some of the corner tiles used in the borders also look good when used as a main tile, especially when you apply mirroring or rotation to them.</p>
<p><img src="http://blotcdn.com/blog_866ae794fdc14da08ec437c326b3a12e/_image_cache/b54b6ac0-4bf3-4a6a-b219-319fc4bcae0a.jpg" alt="Some of the top left corner border tiles can double up as the main tile" width="1131" height="550" data-action="zoom"><span>Some of the top left corner border tiles can double up as the main tile</span></p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Some of the patterns in the original catalogue use two different tiles for the border, while others use two different tiles for the main tile (i.e.&nbsp;not just rotated variants of the original). My app doesn’t support this yet, but I’ll be adding them shortly.</p>
<p>The first goal would be to allow you to create all 19 patterns in the original catalog faithfully but I might eventually make it flexible so that you could pick any two tiles.</p></li>
<li><p>I will also make the no. of rows and columns user selectable. I might add control over the size of the tile (capped to the max size I could extract from the catalogue (around 110px for things to look good on Retina displays).</p></li>
<li><p>I also want to experiment with supporting khaki/custom tiles for the rest of the background. In the original catalogue, they do make the rest of the colourful pattern<span></span> <span>‘</span>pop’. I might even add support for spacing between the tiles and a custom background colour that shows in the space.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other thoughts</h2>
<p>A lot of these tiles were hand-drawn individually. You can see some of these imperfections when looking closely at titles that are not too geometric. To make this easy to spot, I overlaid two rows of one of the patterns on top of each other, changed the opacity of the topmost one and made a short video:</p>
<video src="https://www.deepakg.com/_assets/video/hand-drawn-imperfections.mp4" width="600" controls="">
</video>
<p>Each tile is somewhat unique!</p>
<p>While I am of course working with just one tile that’s repeated, so some of the charm of the hand-drawn tiles is lost<a href="#footnote-1HV1" id="ref-1HV1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. And then there are imperfections from the pages ageing for over a hundred years. Plus scanning artefacts - even though I started with the highest resolution <a href="https://archive.org/download/albumofornamenta00thre">jp2 downloads that archive.org offer</a>.</p>
<p>A part of me fancies going all in and creating their digitally perfect replicas by tracing them in a vector program. We’ll see.</p>
<p>This project also got me thinking about the realities of the physical world to which these tiles belong. While I can mirror them easily digitally, in the real world it would mean creating 4 versions of a tile. Whereas, rotation is something you can do easily to the same tile. So I think designs that only be replicated by mirroring alone must’ve been much rarer.</p>
<p>I’ve also been paying a lot more attention to tiling patterns in the real world<a href="#footnote-2HV1" id="ref-2HV1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. While traveling through Newark airport recently, I came across tiles that somehow looked wrong. I took a picture and plugged them into this tool - lo and behold - if only they’d rotated these tiles while laying them, it would’ve looked like a much nicer pattern!</p>
<p><img src="http://blotcdn.com/blog_866ae794fdc14da08ec437c326b3a12e/_image_cache/424ff8a8-cc97-4b4d-8649-81a57f321fe3.jpg" alt="Tiles at Newark Airport - what a missed opportunity!" width="1000" height="495" data-action="zoom"><span>Tiles at Newark Airport - what a missed opportunity!</span></p>
<h2 id="a-note-about-ai">A note about <span>AI</span></h2>
<p>Many of the initial drafts of this tool were at least partially generated by ChatGPT 4. They never came close to anything you could simply use, but they were instrumental in showing me what’s possible. More importantly, they greatly lowered the inertia I would have had to overcome to start building something like this in the first place. We live in interesting times.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The Enterprise Linux model works something like this:</p>
<p>It’s decided to snapshot a collection of upstream open source projects at a specific version, including the Linux kernel, to form as the basis of a new cohesive version of an Enterprise Linux distribution. This collection of software will remain locked at its specific version throughout the lifespan of that Enterprise Linux distribution release – which is often 10 years or more.</p>
<p>The engineers, maintainers, and testers behind these distributions then put in the enormous amount of thankless work of bug fixes, tests, QA, documentation, etc. It’s a massive undertaking of tedious painstaking work. At the end of the process, you end up with a relatively stable Linux distribution that works well and they release it to the world.</p>
<p>The next phase of hard work begins for that release. Keeping the large collection of software secured and as bug-free as possible as their upstream counterparts continue to churn and release new versions. The maintainers of your Enterprise Linux distribution must carefully keep track of the ocean of changes.</p>
<p>The process often looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://unix.foo/images/wharrgarbl.jpg" alt="WHARGARBL"></p>
<p>In practice, what this works out to is they freeze packages at a specific version for a long time and only ever backport fixes for the most egregious of bugs or security issues that receive a CVE.</p>
<p>Sounds good, right? Nope. Not for security. There’s a lot wrong with this model.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14565">research shows</a>: “Despite the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) publishes identified vulnerabilities, a vast majority of vulnerabilities and their corresponding security patches remain beyond public exposure”.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the example of one of the largest ongoing open source projects: The Linux kernel. According to the 2020 Linux Kernel History Report, the Linux kernel project receives about 10 changes per hour, or approximately 225 changes per day. The team behind the kernel does not treat security bugs as something special. It’s simply another bug. All bugs are equal in the eyes of the project. They do not designate a particular bugfix as security related in the commit logs. They do not publish advisories. In fact, the vast majority of CVEs found for the Linux kernel are only retroactively identified as security researchers and interested parties pore over the changes and realize that a few of those bugfixes are indeed closing security gaps. Only then do they file for a CVE for the issue.</p>
<p>Quite often, most identified CVEs were fixed months ago in the stable kernel release. That’s not even thinking about the huge pile of unidentified CVEs lurking in the sea of bugfixes. Multiply this problem times the total number of packages that make up an Enterprise Linux distribution and you end up with a huge vulnerability window.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue is that the Enterprise Linux model optimizes for stability at the expense of security. By locking packages to specific versions and only backporting select fixes, these distributions lag significantly behind upstream versions when it comes to security bugfixes, albeit unintentionally.</p>
<p>Defenders will counter that this is a necessary tradeoff – you can’t have both stability and being fully up-to-date on security fixes. I’m not convinced that’s true as there are other Linux distributions that have shown you can have both. Rolling release distributions like OpenSUSE Tumbleweed follow upstream much more closely while still maintaining stability through thorough <a href="https://openqa.opensuse.org/">automated testing</a>. Additionally, distributions like Fedora Linux, while not technically a rolling release, do tend to hew close to upstream versions at a more regular cadence.</p>
<p>Even so, these type of distributions are not a panacea and operational challenges may present themselves with staying close to upstream given your application or team needs.</p>
<p>There does exist a middle ground, but you’re probably not going to like hearing it.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-oracle-linux">The Case for Oracle Linux</h2>
<p>I need you to set aside your automatic (and justified) repulsion to what you just read. Yes, I know that Oracle has earned every bit of their reputation amongst engineers. I’m totally with you on that – I am not affiliated with Oracle in any way.</p>
<p>But stop screaming for a moment and hear me out.</p>
<p>The Oracle Linux project was started in October 2006 as a downstream rebuild of RHEL. They simply took Red Hat’s sources, recompiled it and put their branding on it, and sold their own support contracts for it in an attempt to undercut Red Hat’s business.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, they’ve continued this work and publish all their work on <a href="https://yum.oracle.com/">yum.oracle.com</a> which is freely available. As their very own site and explanation states in the <a href="https://linux.oracle.com/switch/centos/">FAQ</a>:</p>
<p><em>Q. Wait, doesn’t Oracle Linux cost money?</em></p>
<p><em>A. Oracle Linux support costs money. If you just want the software, it’s 100% free. And it’s all in our yum repo at yum.oracle.com. Major releases, errata, the whole shebang. Free source code, free binaries, free updates, freely redistributable, free for production use. Yes, we know that this is Oracle, but it’s actually free. Seriously.</em></p>
<p>Where it got interesting was in September 2010 when Oracle <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/09/20/oracle_own_linux/">announced</a> one optional departure for their RHEL clone: the pompously named Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel.</p>
<p>Oracle was now offering everyone two kernels: The Red Hat Compatible Kernel (RHCK) and their own Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK).</p>
<p>Over time, UEK has evolved into a unique Enterprise Linux kernel offering that more closely tracks the upstream Linux kernel. Rather than cherry picking individual fixes to backport to their kernel the way most Enterprise Linux distributions do, the model they’ve <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/tracking-linux-stable-kernels-with-uek">found works best</a> “has been to lag behind the tip of the LTS tree by less than four weeks”.</p>
<p>They use that small lag time to perform their typical “enterprise” validation and testing process before shipping an updated UEK release.</p>
<p>By sticking much closer to the upstream kernel releases at regular intervals, they are able to keep up with the enormous amount of bugfixes that go into the kernel – whether they were security related or not.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting middle ground option for one of the more critical components of an Enterprise Linux distribution. You can rely on the operational stability of the overall distribution tooling, but still have a relatively updated (and validated) kernel.</p>
<p>Oracle has also publicly continued to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/keep-linux-open-and-free-2023-07-10/">commit</a> to keeping “…the binaries and source code for that distribution publicly and freely available”. At this point their distribution has been around for 17 years, and they’ve never tried to restrict access to their source code in that time.</p>
<p>It feels wrong to speak positively about an Oracle product, but Oracle Linux is actually a good option worthy of our consideration.</p>
<p>Just don’t tell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison">Larry</a> I said that.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The year is 1997, and famed Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki <a href="https://www.j-cast.com/2013/09/02182759.html?p=all">announced plans to retire following the release of <em>Princess Mononoke</em></a>, a film that set new records at the box office for Japanese animation and revolutionized the medium. The year is 2001, and Miyazaki announced plans to retire following the release of <em>Spirited Away,</em> saying he can no longer work on feature-length animated films. The year is 2013, and Miyazaki announced plans to retire following the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/23/5337826/the-wind-rises-the-beauty-and-controversy-of-miyazakis-final-film"><em>The Wind Rises</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hayao-miyazaki-explains-why-hes-retiring-1261922844">saying that</a> “If I said I wanted to [make another feature film], I would sound like an old man saying something foolish.”</p><p>The year is 2023, and Miyazaki is an old man saying something foolish by releasing a new film, titled <em>How Do You Live</em> in Japan and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23795086/studio-ghibli-how-do-you-live-the-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki">renamed <em>The Boy and the Heron</em></a> for the international market.</p><p>The point is, it’s hard to say with any certainty whether this will truly be the moment when Hayao Miyazaki steps away from feature animation for good (he’ll likely never step away from animation entirely, directing a new short for the Ghibli Museum during his last retirement, <a href="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/films/works/#boro_the_caterpillar"><em>Boro the Caterpillar</em></a>). Until a few days ago, it was also hard to say what this mysteriously titled final film would actually be about, following a bold PR strategy of, well, not doing any PR. Only a single poster for the film featuring a heron was released before its theatrical debut, without so much as press or preview screenings, trailers, screenshots, or even a synopsis.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A poster for Studio Ghibli’s How Do You Live." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/376x532/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/384x543/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/415x587/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/480x679/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/540x764/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/640x905/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/750x1061/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/828x1171/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/1080x1528/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/1200x1698/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/1440x2037/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/1920x2716/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/2048x2897/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/2400x3395/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/2400x3395/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>The only piece of promotional art for the film.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Studio Ghibli</cite></p></div></div><p>Riding the train in the early hours of Friday morning to be one of the first to catch this all-new Miyazaki-directed feature film, <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> appeared to exist only as some mythical entity rather than a real film. In the absence of any news and in light of the single image’s striking repetitiveness, Japanese fans even resorted to creating memes of the bird, <a href="https://twitter.com/ce_lemony/status/1679042978478968840?s=46&amp;t=f_Mv93lXcUyV0D1_x5MQGg">riffing on the name</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/bkub_comic/status/1678763787615346689?s=46&amp;t=f_Mv93lXcUyV0D1_x5MQGg">mystery surrounding it</a>. Honestly, a part of me wondered if the whole thing was some trick, a ruse soon to be exposed to the world at last.</p><p>Another part wondered: if this film actually was real, what story would prompt Miyazaki out of his latest retirement? And how would I even discuss a film like this when even saying it exists could technically class as a spoiler?</p><p>I have that answer now. To give the minimal necessary introduction, the film opens during the firebombing of Tokyo in World War II, a hazy memory of the moment that young boy Mahito witnessed the death of his mother as the hospital she was in burned to the ground. The experience is seared in his mind like the erupting flames he witnessed, never truly moving on from the pain of this sudden loss. When Mahito joins his father to move out of Tokyo shortly after the war to live with his new (and already pregnant) partner in a large traditional home full of peculiarities — like a mysterious heron and an old abandoned stone building in the woods nearby — he struggles to accept this new situation.</p><p>These opening moments feel unsettling and heavy, especially in flashbacks, only briefly relieved by the kindly gaggle of old ladies at the home or the famed heron. While it embraces the fantastical as it takes us to a whole new world in pursuit of a far-from-normal heron’s promise that Mahito can see his mother once more (while continuing to search for his new mother who recently went missing), the weight of this opening lingers.&nbsp;</p><p>In these moments, it’s a rich, dense fantasy in the vein we’ve come to expect, both in terms of the detail visible in every scene and its greater thematic purpose. You may come to <em>Spirited Away</em> for its eclectic and intricate spiritual bathhouse, but you stay for the human story and deeper undertones at its core.</p><p>Continuing this comparison, you could even say these musings on the complexity of the human condition are emphasized by the 82-year-old Miyazaki with this final film, creating something that feels more autobiographical and self-reflective than <em>The Wind Rises</em>. For all that film was technically a biopic, it felt as much a reflection of the man behind the production as it was the master aviator at its center. While fantastical and family-friendly elements litter <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>, filling it to the brim with whimsy that lightens its heavy moments and brings endless charm to its stunning animation, the frank nature in which it explores Miyazaki’s self-reflective musings on memory makes it as much a conversation with the man in the mirror as it is the audience.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A photo of Hayao Miyazaki at the Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences’ 2014 Governors Awards." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/376x250/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/384x256/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/415x276/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/480x319/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/540x359/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/640x426/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/750x499/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/828x551/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/1080x719/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/1200x799/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/1440x958/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/1920x1278/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/2048x1363/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/2400x1597/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/2400x1597/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Hayao Miyazaki.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Frazer Harrison / Getty Images</cite></p></div></div><p>The question the film’s Japanese title poses lingers throughout the experience. How <em>do</em> you live? On the shoulders of those who came before you. After decades of defining the animation industry in Japan, Miyazaki has accepted his fate. This is ultimately a story about the hows and whys that define our memory, a recognition that no existence can live without building upon the inventions, experiences, and memories of those who came before us. A recognition that to move forward means to move on and let go of the past while keeping their memories and lessons close for the next person to carry that torch.</p><p><em>The Boy and the Heron</em> feels like a recognition by Miyazaki of his place as a relic in a modern animation industry that’s moved on without him. Studio Ghibli has firmly embedded itself within animation history and particularly Japanese culture, where movies like <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> and <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em> feel like rights of passage for Japanese children even before we discuss the park or museum or the copious merchandising. People who don’t watch anime or look down on animation as some childish toy likely still know and love at least one Ghibli film. Totoro was a character in <em>Toy Story 3</em>!</p><p>Yet it’s also been 10 years since Miyazaki released his last film and nine years since Ghibli’s final feature, <em>When Marnie Was There</em>. For all the media at one point seemed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/09/makoto-shinkai-director-anime-your-name">determined to anoint the so-called “next Miyazaki,”</a> only the spiritual successor made up of former veterans of Ghibli, Studio Ponoc, ever attempted to directly emulate the distinct visual and narrative playbook of the famed studio. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Du8tsjNYEYKQ"><em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em></a> released to moderate success in 2017, but notably, the first trailer for the studio’s new project <em>The Imaginary</em> premiered before this screening with a visual and thematic approach that serves as a distinct departure.</p><p>The anime landscape today is defined by a different director: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/15/23678724/makoto-shinkai-suzume-interview">Makoto Shinkai</a>. Films like <em>Five Centimeters Per Second</em>, <em>Your Name,</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23680219/suzume-review"><em>Suzume</em></a>, with their intense post-processing over highly realistic environments telling stories about love and distance through the imagery of fantasy and science fiction, are nonetheless impressive but are very distinct from the works of Ghibli in their own, more modern style. In recent years, with the success of Shinkai’s works, the comparisons have stopped. You can’t be the next Miyazaki when you’ve already eclipsed the man you’re being compared to.</p><p>When it’s not Shinkai or one of his many imitators, recognizable franchises reign stronger than ever. Anime has always relied on adaptations of other mediums, but the shift from historically lower gross for such films as mere fan service to the blockbusters of today showcases a stark difference. Last year, <a href="https://eiga.com/news/20230130/8/"><em>One Piece Film RED</em> grossed almost 20 billion yen in Japan</a>, making it one of the top 10 highest-grossing films of all time and placing it above <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> and all but two of Miyazaki’s works. <em>The First Slam Dunk</em> has <a href="https://lp.p.pia.jp/article/news/276201/index.html?detail=tru">similarly been breaking records</a> and <a href="http://www.kogyotsushin.com/archives/topics/t8/202301/23153909.php">topped the box office for eight consecutive weeks</a> upon release. And let’s not forget the monster 2020 success of <em>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train</em>, whose 40 billion yen domestic gross demolished <em>Spirited Away</em>’s record of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334004/demon-slayer-the-movie-mugen-train-north-america-release-theaters">highest-grossing film of all time in Japan</a>.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Merchandise for Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki’s latest film, titled in English “How Do You Live?” is displayed for sale at a cinema on the first day of the film’s premiere in Tokyo on July 14, 2023." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/376x251/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/384x256/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/415x277/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/480x320/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/540x360/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/640x427/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/750x500/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/828x552/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/1080x720/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/1200x800/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/1440x960/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/1920x1280/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/2048x1365/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/2400x1600/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/2400x1600/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><cite>Photo by Richard A. Brooks / AFP via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>The point is, we don’t see films like this being made anymore, for better and for worse. There’s no glee or joy in discussing Miyazaki’s fading stardom. Indeed, with <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>, Miyazaki has produced one of his best films to date, a mature metafictional tale in a friendlier facade about memory and moving on from the past while carrying their precious experiences on their shoulders.</p><p>Yet the industry <em>has</em> moved on. This film feels thematically and visually like a lost piece of mid-2000s Ghibli media resurfaced from a vault and thrown onto cinema screens. No less impressive, but a piece of the past carried on the shoulders of those who built it, tossed into the world more to remember what we lost than to build upon what we have today. You could argue there’s irony in making a film about letting go and moving forward when a director can’t follow through with his desire to walk away, but maybe that’s why this movie had to be made.</p><div><p>We don’t see films like this being made anymore, for better and for worse</p></div><p>Honestly, so moved and impressed I was by this movie, I’d love for him to betray its message and come back, just one more time. The creative well underneath Miyazaki remains full, and I’m sure he could create another 10 films and still have new ideas to explore. We’ve barely scratched the surface of his bottomless talent.</p><p>In the movie’s first act, Mahito finds an old copy of <em>How Do You Live?</em>, the children’s book that inspired the film’s Japanese title. The title page is signed by his mother with a message of how much he’s grown. He breaks down in tears. The adventure which follows proves that she was right, and the book stays with him throughout, another memory passed down for him to bear.</p><p>Just as Mahito needs to accept the loss of his mother, leaving that cinema on Friday morning felt like closing the book on an era of animation history we’ll never get back. The items passed on to Mahito by the characters in this fantasy world are ways to remember his adventure and reconnection to his mother, just as we can always rewatch these films. And remember we must, as it’s only by passing these memories down that they can live on long after the people behind them are gone.</p><p>Miyazaki has accepted his time has come and gone, and this is his plea to be remembered by the next generation. With this understanding, everything from the film’s complex yet thematically resonant story to particularly its non-existent promotional campaign made sense. Releasing a film without a single trailer, screenshot, or even synopsis feels like career suicide, a sure chance a film will fail. It’s a strategy that could only succeed at the hands of a studio and director who earned respect like these two. In turn, this campaign is a final plea from Miyazaki to the public who admire him and his work.</p><p>Memories only outlive us by sharing them with others, ensuring they won’t be forgotten with our passing. Similarly, if we want this era of animation to be remembered for generations to come, the onus is on us as an audience to champion its voice and share it with others. Ghibli and Miyazaki already have their place in history. If <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> is to join it, we have to want to pass it on, hold it close, and carry it with us.</p><p>And, after all that, move forward.</p><p><small>How Do You Live <em>is in Japanese theaters now. Distributor GKIDS says that it will be released “theatrically in North America later this year” under the English title</em> The Boy and the Heron.</small></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h3>Flicking lights or swiping wipers could one day add extra security to vehicles</h3>

<p>Skyrocketing vehicle theft rates in some U.S. cities have drawn attention to an inconvenient truth: the increasing amount of technology in our vehicles can make them increasingly vulnerable to hacking or theft.</p>



<p>Now, a solution that leverages perhaps the lowest-tech feature of today’s vehicles—the auxiliary power outlet, known to those of a certain age as the cigarette lighter—has been developed by a University of Michigan-led research team.</p>



<p>With a new $1.2 million dollar grant from the National Science Foundation, the team is set to begin large-scale testing of Battery Sleuth, a vehicle security system that can protect against sophisticated wireless hacking, old-school jimmying and everything in between.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Battery Sleuth bypasses both the wireless communication that key fobs depend on and the standardized onboard communication network that’s used in today’s vehicles. Instead, it authenticates drivers by measuring voltage fluctuations in a vehicle’s electrical system. Drivers interact with it through a keypad device plugged into the auxiliary power outlet.</p>



<p>“The great thing about the power outlet is its simplicity—it’s just a wire connected to the battery, so there’s nothing to hack,” said Kang Shin, the Kevin and Nancy O’Connor Professor of Computer Science at U-M and lead researcher on the project. “And creating voltage fluctuations with components like windshield wipers or door locks is even simpler.”</p>

Image credit: Kang Shin</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battery Sleuth delivers a predetermined series of voltage fluctuations—a sort of “voltage fingerprint”—to the car’s electrical system when the driver enters a numerical code into the keypad device. A receiver then recognizes this fingerprint and enables the vehicle to start. Drivers can also deliver the voltage fluctuation manually using auxiliary functions that draw battery power. They might perform some combination of flicking the windshield wipers, turn signal or headlights on and off, or locking and unlocking the doors.</p>



<p>Installed between a vehicle’s battery and the car’s electrical system, Battery Sleuth’s default mode allows the battery to deliver enough current to power systems like electronics and lights, but not enough to power the vehicle’s starter. Only when it detects the pre-set series of voltage fluctuations in the vehicle’s electrical system does it turn up the juice, allowing the battery’s full power through to the starter.</p>



<p>“The idea of measuring fluctuations in a car’s electrical system seems simple, but designing one device that can do it accurately on thousands of different vehicle models in varying environmental conditions gets quite complicated,” said Liang He, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Colorado, Denver and a researcher on the project. “We’re working to design a system that’s smart enough to measure the parameters of the vehicle it’s installed on and then customize itself to work effectively on that vehicle.”</p>



<p>Battery Sleuth also has defenses to guard against hacking or physical attacks on the device itself, including a siren that sounds if illegitimate activity is detected and a resistor that shuts down the vehicle’s electrical system if an unauthorized power source is connected to the vehicle. The system is designed to work as either an add-on to existing vehicles or a permanently installed component on new vehicles.</p>

Image credit: Kang Shin</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Vehicle theft costs drivers and insurance companies more than $4 billion each year in the United States alone, and that’s partly because today’s vehicles use a hodge-podge of computer systems that were never designed to work together,” Shin said. “Each new layer of technology introduces new security vulnerabilities, and rather than try to patch each one, we’ve developed a system that works completely independently.”</p>



<p>In a field test study on eight vehicles published in July 2022, the researchers showed that a prototype of Battery Sleuth was more than 99.9% effective at detecting and preventing illegitimate activity without interfering with normal vehicle operation. The team plans to use the new grant to fund more extensive testing at U-M’s Mcity test facility. The next stage of the process will also explore expanding the system to enable it to control entry to the car, making it useful for applications like vehicle sharing.</p>



<p>At the end of the three-year project, the team aims to have a commercially viable prototype that can be scaled up to commercial production, first as a theft deterrent device, and potentially later as a complete vehicle entry and control system that could replace traditional keys and fobs.</p>



<p>The research was supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Computer and Network Systems under the Computer Science and Engineering Directorate, grant number 2245223.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Tommy Steed lives in upstate New York. He has bees, a border collie named Pete and a pickup truck with a bumper sticker saying he's a member of the local Fish and Game Club. But before retiring, Tommy worked on the telephone lines.</p><p>Tommy Steed: I started working for New York telephone in 1971. Neighborhoods like Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, and the South Bronx.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Tommy was hired as a cable splicer. In this job, he had to maintain and install telephone cables, sometimes 20 feet up in the air, sometimes underground.</p><p>Tommy Steed: We would wipe the ends with molten solder and run a seam down the middle, make sure there was not one single bubble because that cable is going into a manhole for the next 100 years.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Tommy enjoyed his job, the camaraderie of the crews and being outside all day. But after about 15 years of work, something unexpected happened.</p><p>Tommy Steed: Maybe about 1987, 1988, I went down to our medical department in Manhattan. It was a routine annual examination, and about two weeks later, my boss came out and said, "You have to go back to medical department." I said, "What for?" He said, "They didn't tell me. They just said they need to draw blood."</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: That afternoon, Tommy made his way downtown to the company's medical department.</p><p>Tommy Steed: I went to the front desk and they gave me my file and they told me to walk down this long hallway, make a left at the end, and there'll be an open door with a nurse that'll take my blood. So, walking down the hall, I was curious like, "What the hell did he want my blood for?" I opened up my file and there was a yellow sticky note, "Test for lead only."</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Lead. The results of this test would show that Tommy's lead levels were off the charts. Tommy is one of tens of thousands of workers who've been exposed to lead through their work at AT&amp;T, Verizon, and other telecom companies. The companies say they follow safety guidelines for workers dealing with lead. For the past 18 months, The Wall Street Journal's been investigating the impacts that lead covered cables have on people and on the environment. The team found that telecom companies have known about the health risks posed by these cables for decades. Welcome to The Journal, our show about money, business, and power. I'm Kate Linebaugh. It's Friday, July 14th. Coming up on the show, the potential danger of lead cables and what telecom companies knew about it. Lead covered cables have been connecting the country since the late 1800s. Our colleague, Shalini Ramachandran, is part of The Wall Street Journal team that's been investigating them.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: The telephone companies wanted to keep the water out of the copper wires that were transmitting signals all over America. Lead is a very malleable metal, and it was something that kept water out.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: By 1940, the majority of the country's phones were connected with lead covered cables. The company behind this was the massive Bell system, a predecessor of AT&amp;T, Verizon, and other telecom companies.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: We saw that in a 1957 article published in the Bell Laboratory's Record, the entire system had used around 100 million pounds of lead in just the prior year alone.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: All that lead cable had to be installed and maintained. Work that was done by people like Tommy Steed. At the time, Tommy was working for a company called NYNEX that would eventually become part of Verizon.</p><p>Tommy Steed: Working with the cables brand new wasn't too bad, but when I was a linesman and we removed thousands and thousands of feet of this old lead cable that was decommissioned, that's where the danger came in.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Over time, newer technology replaced the need for lead covered cables.</p><p>Tommy Steed: The removal of these cables that were now porous from being out in the weather for 50 years, hot and cold, snow, rain, sun, that's when they really started deteriorating. It was the removal of these lead cables that I feel was the most dangerous part of our jobs because it created dust that we had to breathe.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: At any point did the company talk to you about how toxic lead is?</p><p>Tommy Steed: No.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Or give you protective gear?</p><p>Tommy Steed: No, they gave me... Excuse me. Let me go back. When I wiped lead sleeves with molten solder, they did give me protective gloves so I didn't get burnt because I couldn't do it if I got burnt.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Shalini talked to a number of former and current employees who also described inadequate protection.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: When talking to a lot of the workers who've worked with the stuff over decades, most of them said they were never provided a mask. They said they were never provided respirators. There were no danger signs. Many said they learned lead work on the job. There was no safety training that they heard of.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: How have the telecom companies responded to your reporting?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: In response to our reporting, the companies and USTelecom, a group that represents the broader telecom industry, they have defended their practices and say that they offer safety training and a lot of protective gear and masks and equipment to help workers handle lead properly. They also said that they follow regulatory safety guidelines for workers dealing with lead and offer training, and also offer blood lead testing for people who wish to get their blood lead levels checked.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Stories from workers like Tommy prompted Shalini and the team to go back to see what Bell Systems knew about lead and risks to employees. They found an old study done by medical staff at Bell.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: A 1977 Bell study showed a snapshot of just how high lead levels were among female lead soldering workers at a unit of AT&amp;T. The workers had blood lead levels in the range of 25 to 45 micrograms per deciliter, which is very high. It was very known to AT&amp;T that there were high blood lead levels among workers.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Around the same time, Bell partnered with Mount Sinai Hospital System on a second study of 90 cable splicers, the job Tommy had. This one also came back showing high lead content in their blood. Shalini says the companies didn't necessarily act on that information.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: From what we understand, there wasn't any sort of widespread reckoning in the Bell system that, "Oh my goodness, workers are exposed. This is a major problem. We have to deal with it." That didn't happen from our understanding and from the documents that we have seen. What we know is that they did publish safety manuals from time to time, but many of the workers we talked to said they never saw any kind of lead training. They kind of said that the safety manuals weren't really widely read and weren't really well known. It's not clear to us that they took major action after getting that knowledge from that study in the late seventies.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Did you try to find out why not?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: It wasn't considered a big deal from the former executives we talked to. It didn't seem like people thought twice about it. It was just an old part of the network. We've moved on to fiber, we've moved on to other stuff, cell phones. It's just some old stuff out there, it's not a big deal.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Right. To find out more about how companies thought about lead, we called up Brad Allenby, a former AT&amp;T executive.</p><p>Brad Allenby: We had lead in a lot of uses.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: 20 years ago, brad was a vice president of environment health and safety for AT&amp;T. Our colleagues have done a major investigation and found all kinds of lead sheathed cables across the country. When you were working for AT&amp;T, were you aware of these cables?</p><p>Brad Allenby: Sure. Because it was part of the infrastructure. But it's important to note that that lead was a ubiquitous material in telecom.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: We've spoken with telecom workers who said they regularly came into contact with lead cables. Was that something you were aware of happening at AT&amp;T?</p><p>Brad Allenby: Not particularly aware of, but I wouldn't be surprised, you'd expect it. They were working with the infrastructure, so sure. But the question is that lead in a form that is liable to cause damage? Once you use a soldering iron and you begin to melt it, then you begin to get gaseous lead and that can be inhaled and that's more of an exposure problem. So the question would be, in a case like that, are they properly protected when and if that lead is mobilized?</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Right, and we spoke with cable splicers and they did say they soldered lead and then their blood was tested, they had high lead levels. At your time at AT&amp;T, was this on your mind in terms of putting in place safety protocols and monitoring lead exposure for workers?</p><p>Brad Allenby: Yeah, I can't speak to what the practices were at that time because that's 20 years ago. I can say generally that if there were exposure issues and we knew about it, we would've addressed it because among other things, that would've been an OSHA requirement and it would've been the right thing to do for our employees. If there's something like that that's causing potential problems, then of course you address it.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: OSHA oversees worker safety for the federal government. In a statement to The Journal, AT&amp;T said, "The legacy cables that remain in our network are maintained in compliance with applicable environmental, health, and safety rules." I asked Shalini if she spoke with any workers who are currently maintaining lead covered cables.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: I talked to a cable splicer out in LA who talked about how when there're heavy rains, there's a lot of these lead sheathed cables that fail and they have to go into the manhole, cut them open with a lead chipping knife. He described even as of recently, a few months ago, opening up a big lead sheathed cable under ground and then repairing the copper wires inside.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: But importantly, and what you're saying is this isn't all just in the past. Workers today are still interacting with lead cables and having potential lead exposure?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: That's correct. When actually I set out to understand this issue, I thought it was probably mostly a decades ago exposure. But in reality, with all of these lead sheathed cables still around, workers are still exposed to it.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Coming up, the potential health consequences of lead exposure. Around two years before Tommy Steed got his blood tested for lead, he was really ill.</p><p>Tommy Steed: I was in the prime of my life. I couldn't understand it, but the most significant marker was I would leave the garage in the morning, go for my morning breakfast, and as soon as I ate my bacon and eggs, I would vomit it all up so I knew something was significantly wrong. I went to this physician, this medical doctor in Riverdale, and I went back a few times because she performed so many different tests. But the one test we missed, which is a specific test, was for lead poisoning. We missed out, both of us missed out.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Eventually, Tommy ended up in his company medical office, walking down that long hallway about to get his blood tested for lead.</p><p>Tommy Steed: I went into the room and the nurse started drawing my blood. I asked her, I said, "Look, am I going to get the results of this test?" She said, "Oh, yeah." I said, "When?" She said, "Oh, about two weeks." I said, "Good, 'cause I'm going to call you." Two weeks went by, three weeks went by, nothing. I called her and she still would not tell me my results, but she said, "I'll give you a number to call, but it's a long distance number." I said, "Lady, I'll call Singapore. I work for the phone company, it's not going to cost me anything."
It was a 518 area code, which is Albany, New York. I called the phone number, the lady picked up the phone. I identified myself, "Thomas Steed calling. I was given this number to call." She said, "Oh yeah, Mr. Steed, I have your file right on my desk in front of me. Do you know where you're calling?" I said, "No, I don't." She says, "We are the New York State Department of Health and your employer was mandated to report your lead levels to us, and I have your file right here in front of me." That's how I found out I had lead poisoning, the New York State Department of Health. Now, by this time, I wasn't sick anymore because I was away from working with lead cable and I was doing new plastic polyethylene, brand new cable. I wasn't ill anymore and I still had lead poisoning, but I didn't know.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Shalini saw Tommy's blood test and it showed he had 43 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, well above the average for the US population at the time of 2.8 micrograms. Verizon, which took over the company Tommy worked for said, "It has a robust health and safety program and that workers can get lead testing at any time at no cost." The company said, "Its work practices on lead cables are based on available science, legal requirements and guidance from medical and work safety organizations." I asked Shalini if Tommy Steed should have been told by his employer that he'd been exposed to lead when he was tested in 1988. She said yes.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: Tommy Steed was working in the 1980s, which was after the first lead standard from OSHA was published. His blood lead test ended up over 40 micrograms per deciliter, which under OSHA standards, even at that time, he should have been informed. And for him, that never happened and that was as of the late eighties.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: What kind of problems can lead exposure cause?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: Lead exposure can cause kidney, heart, and reproductive problems in adults, and it's classified as a probable carcinogen. The risks that people worry most about with lead is that it is a neurotoxin, so that means that it attacks the central nervous system and Parkinson's disease has been linked recently to lead exposure.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Shalini spoke with other former and current telecom employees who'd worked with lead and had health issues.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: I talked to a number of women who worked in AT&amp;T central offices doing lead soldering work, connecting lead sheathed cables from the outside with the internal central office machinery. They actually showed gloves with the fingertips cut off because they had to do sort of small, intricate work to melt the solder with a soldering iron. So, they describe breathing in those fumes. They're not being sort of fans or exhaust around and feeling headaches often every day coming home from work and gastrointestinal issues, nausea, constipation, infertility issues, miscarriages. One woman had developed kidney cancer and had to have a kidney removed.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: AT&amp;T dismissed what it called anecdotal, non-evidence based linkages to individuals health symptoms. The company said symptoms, "Could be associated with a vast number of potential causes." When you think back on it, what's been the hardest thing?</p><p>Tommy Steed: That I was a loyal employee and my company was not loyal to me and not loyal to hundreds, maybe thousands of fellow craftsmen like myself.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: What do you say to them now?</p><p>Tommy Steed: Well, it's a different corporation now, but what I would say to them is, "Hey, safety is number one. Your employees lives are number one." After that, we'll work our darnedest to make the company, nevermind a Fortune 500, a Fortune 1 or 2. We'll dedicate ourselves to that but you have to accept some responsibility. You have to accept some decency. We're not cattle. We're human beings just like you.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: So Shalini, this is the end of a really long reporting project?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: Yes. It's the longest investigation I've ever worked on.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: After those, what, 18 months of reporting with a team that's traveled all over the country, what would you say you found out?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: The highest level finding that the old American telephone and telegraph, which is known as a Bell System, laid thousands of lead sheathed cables across the country, and many of them were abandoned in place and still remain out aerially, above schools, above houses and underground, underneath waterways that are used for drinking water. We've gone out and seen them, and moreover, done our testing with experts and we found that some of them are leaching lead into the environment.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Who's responsible? I mean, it's old industrial waste in the environment.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: Basically, it's complicated. The question of whose responsible is complicated. On one hand, environmental law and precedent has held successor companies responsible for things that their predecessor companies did. That is well established in environmental law. However, if in the time these were laid, if it was okay and considered safe at the time, then cleanup could be a collective responsibility between the companies and the government. One of the things that this reporting opened my eyes to was that there is this old industrial detritus that we still continue to live around and they're here and they're potentially causing risks to our community. It just kind of opened our eyes to how much could be out there, we've only scratched the surface. And just the bigger picture that oftentimes things that we consider toxic now, might have been left in the environment years ago and not dealt with, and they're still out there.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: That's all for today, Friday, July 14th.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://kenschutte.com/gzip-knn-paper/">https://kenschutte.com/gzip-knn-paper/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36758433">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Bad numbers in the "gzip beats BERT" paper?</h3><p><i>2023-07-17</i></p><p>The recent paper,<i>“Low-Resource” Text Classification: A Parameter-Free Classification Method with Compressors</i> by Jiang et al. [<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.426/">link</a>] recently received a lot of attention on twitter.</p><p>I recently checked out their <a href="https://github.com/bazingagin/npc_gzip">source code</a> to try to recreate their results and to try out  some related ideas.</p><p>
What I found (although I could be mistaken!)
is that there appears
to be a
bug (or at least an unexpected choice) in their kNN code
that makes all the accuracy numbers
for their method higher than
expected.
<b>[tldr: it is reporting a top-2 accuracy rather than a kNN(k=2) accuracy]</b>.</p><p>Table 5 from the paper was often included in tweets and shows the <code>gzip</code> method beating all these other neural-network-based methods:</p><p><a href="https://kenschutte.com/gzip-knn-paper/table5.png"><img src="https://kenschutte.com/gzip-knn-paper/table5.png"></a></p><p>
I'll explain the details below, but my
calculations for these experiments
are (first 4 datasets,
only the "Full" column):
        </p><table id="tab1"><thead><tr><th></th><th>KinyarwandaNews</th><th>KirundiNews</th><th>DengueFilipino</th><th>SwahiliNews</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>in paper</th><td>0.891</td><td>0.905</td><td>0.998</td><td>0.927</td></tr><tr><th>corrected (knn2d)</th><td>0.835</td><td>0.858</td><td>0.999</td><td>0.850</td></tr></tbody></table><p>(Fifth dataset SogouNews is large -- I haven't run it yet)</p><p>
These numbers would significantly change the take-away from
these experiments. For example,
for <code>KirundiNews</code>, the <code>gzip</code> method went from best-perfoming to worst-performing.</p><h4>kNN</h4><p>Their method uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">kNN classifier</a> using k=2 (Appendix C says all experiments used k=2).</p><p>
k=2 is a bit of an odd choice for kNN classification.
For every test case, you search the training set
for the two "closest" examples. Looking at
the labels of these two, there are only two possibilities,
            </p><ul><li><i>The labels are equal.</i>
 So, this is clearly your hypothesized label.
Note that you would get the same answer for k=1.
</li><li><i>The labels are different.</i>
 We have a 1-1 tie that most be broken. There
are many ways to do a tie breaker, but one
reasonable one is take the label of the closer point.
In this case, you get the same answer for k=1.                    
</li></ul><p>

So, going from k=1 to k=2 doesn't add much information to your classifier. But, it can be different depending on the tie-breaking strategy.  
            </p><p>
It is in the case of ties that the source code
here is doing something unexpected, shown below.
            </p><h4>Code</h4><p>The issue is in <code>calc_acc</code> method in <code>experiments.py</code> [<a href="https://github.com/bazingagin/npc_gzip/blob/main/experiments.py#L88">here</a>].</p><p>Here is the relevant snippet, with my added comments, and branches dealing with <code>rand==True</code> removed for clarity:</p><div><pre><span></span><span># here, sorted_pred_lab[][] has the </span>
<span># labels and counts corresponding</span>
<span># to the top-k samples,</span>
<span>#  [[label,count],[label,count],...]</span>
<span># grouped-by label and sorted by count.</span>

<span>most_label</span> <span>=</span> <span>sorted_pred_lab</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
<span>most_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>sorted_pred_lab</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>

<span>if_right</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>for</span> <span>pair</span> <span>in</span> <span>sorted_pred_lab</span><span>:</span>
    <span># we loop until we drop below 'most_count', ie</span>
    <span># this for-loop iterates over those classes</span>
    <span># tied for highest count</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>pair</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>most_count</span><span>:</span>
        <span>break</span>

    <span># this says if ANY of those</span>
    <span># in the tied-set are equal to</span>
    <span># the test label,</span>
    <span># it is marked correct (if_right=1)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>pair</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>label</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]:</span>
        <span>if_right</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
        <span>most_label</span> <span>=</span> <span>pair</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>

<span># accumulate results:        </span>
<span>pred</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>most_label</span><span>)</span>
<span>correct</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>if_right</span><span>)</span>
        
</pre></div><p>So, if any of the tie-break labels is equal to the test label, it is marked as correct. For k=2, a tie simply means there was one vote for each of two different classes amongst the 2 closest training points. Therefore, the reported accuracies could be considered <b>top-2</b>, meaning that it's marked correct if either of the top  two choices is correct (you may have encountered top-k in ImageNet, where top-5 accuracy is often cited).</p><p>This method takes arbitrary <code>k</code> but note that it doesn't compute <code>top-k</code> for any <code>k</code>. Only in the special case of <code>k=2</code> do we have that when there is a tie, all the <code>k</code> examples are tied with the max value (1).</p><p>The <code>calc_acc</code> method has a <code>rand</code> flag that seems to be correct:  if <code>rand==True</code> it will correctly break the tie using <code>random.choice</code>. But it seems that this wasn't used for the paper results.</p><h4>Re-calc</h4><p>
I wrote a simple implementation with two
different tie-breaking strategies [<a href="https://gist.github.com/kts/46709a70c4efd167eff7ccfa62f30dd8">gist</a>]:</p><ul><li>[r] random selection</li><li>[d] decrement k until you are left with a case without ties.</li></ul><pre>Results

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="fjlPX0">Most Americans, especially those living outside of major cities, need to drive to get around, and so the need to put one’s car somewhere<em> </em>when we’re not using it — ideally somewhere safe, free, and convenient — is a quiet force that often dominates how we get around. But how parking works (or doesn’t work) is something we rarely stop to consider.</p>
<p id="P8E6aZ">Henry Grabar, a <a href="https://slate.com/author/henry-grabar">staff writer at Slate</a>, has done a lot of thinking about the issue. In his new book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/paved-paradise-how-parking-explains-the-world-henry-grabar/18727296?gclid=Cj0KCQjw3a2iBhCFARIsAD4jQB2l7xteDcNE8TNeMrWKJX3v-O9ve8ptpT35hMcnccBLCK9GKj8KJksaAgqNEALw_wcB"><em>Paved Paradise: How Parking Explains the World</em></a>, Grabar demonstrates in a fascinating way how parking shapes our lives in the United States, determining the kinds of homes we live in, the communities we build, and how we interact with our built environments. He shows how zoning requirements requiring off-street parking for new construction strangle new development and help fuel the affordable housing crisis. Finally, he offers a series of solutions to make our cities more affordable and livable — and to keep parking from driving us all mad.</p>
<p id="UqKfX6">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p id="BzM1cZ"><strong>Why does parking make us so crazy?</strong></p>
<p id="fTIgDS">That is the million-dollar question. I think there are a few reasons that parking makes people really upset, but perhaps the most obvious is that in almost every place in this country, it is obligatory to have a car, and there is almost nothing that you can do without a car. So to the extent that you are able to hold down a job or go to a restaurant or pick your kids up from school, you have to drive, and parking becomes the link between driving and whatever else you want to do with your life. And so naturally, there’s a great deal of importance placed on having a good parking space.</p>
<p id="rIvAg4">That’s the first thing. And then the second one is that we have just catastrophically mismanaged the way we provide parking in this country, in a way that actually doesn’t make things better for people who are driving and parking. Parking is not shared, and it’s not properly priced. We have acquiesced to the idea that parking on city streets has to be a total free-for-all. </p>
<p id="aWbozQ"><strong>As you point out in the book, you’re not just talking about this symbolically. People have actually died over arguments about parking spots.</strong></p>
<p id="9AmoAT">Oh yeah, all the time. When I started working on this book, I set up a Google alert for “parking space murder.” So that’s been how I’ve been keeping track of this. I’m really excited to turn that Google alert off now that the reporting is done. <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/01/three-stabbings-in-nyc-kill-one-injure-two-as-2023-begins-nypd/">The first person to be killed in New York City this year was actually killed over a parking space</a>. I estimate that it happens several dozen times a year in US cities.</p>
<p id="3ZVYLp"><strong>How did you get interested in parking?</strong></p>
<p id="oRhyf9">In my work as a reporter, I was <a href="https://slate.com/author/henry-grabar">writing about cities</a>, and it seemed like every topic that I would come across had this hidden component to it that was determinative in the result of whatever was being discussed, and that issue was parking. When I went to <a href="https://slate.com/business/2018/08/houston-one-year-after-hurricane-harvey-is-at-a-crossroads.html">Houston to report on Hurricane Harvey</a>, I talked to a guy whose house had flooded for the first time, and he was saying that his house never used to flood and he was blaming it on an enormous parking lot that had been constructed and the displacement of water falling on that parking lot, and how that was contributing to the stormwater issue in his neighborhood. And this is a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/why-cities-flood/538251/">widespread issue in Houston</a> — the city’s brand of sprawling, auto-centric development does involve <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/article/downtown-houston-parking-one-quarter-area-17888647.php">paving over a ton of land</a>. That’s just an example.</p>
<p id="KSqpqt">Parking is really expensive, and the <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/04/henry-grabar-paved-paradise/">obligation to provide parking</a> can break projects that would otherwise succeed. Mass transit, the ability to create bus rapid transit lanes, or even to create bike lanes is dependent on being willing to reallocate the street parking supply. </p>
<p id="emRBn1">When you think about its spatial impact, well, cars spend 95 percent of their time parked. Parking literally takes up more room than the roads, and it costs more than the automobiles. But many of us don’t think much about parking at all, or if we do, it’s an afterthought.</p>
<p id="0rRMtX"><strong>Is the problem that we have too little parking or too much?</strong></p>
<p id="b5WCPb">I will give you an annoying answer: It depends. On a national level, certainly, there’s far more parking than we need. There are at least <a href="https://www.vox.com/a/new-economy-future/cars-cities-technologies">four parking spaces for every car</a>, meaning that the parking stock is no more than 25 percent full at any given time. And some of those cars are moving at any given time, so parking may be a good deal emptier than that. </p>
<p id="LcE6I7">Of course, there are places where people get frustrated because there isn’t enough parking. So if what you’re interested in is having a free place to park, you could look at this situation and say, well, there isn’t enough parking. In fact, that’s sort of what we did as a country: We decided, at some point in the middle of the 20th century, that there wasn’t enough parking, that this was at the root of our traffic problem, and we had to create more parking. But you can only do so at great expense, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/parking-drives-housing-prices/618910/">at a tremendous cost to the urban fabric</a>. There may be places where there isn’t enough parking, but the solution is rarely to create more parking, but rather to more intelligently manage the parking that we have and try and find ways to control demand for parking by, for example, sharing it, pricing it, and telling people where it is. </p>
<p id="cnfrVH"><strong>What does that look like?</strong></p>
<p id="10gHCX">When somebody decides they want to open a new restaurant or open a new building, instead of saying it needs X number of spaces, we could say, let’s look at the parking stock and find accommodations that are already there. Office parking could be used at night for residential parking. That dentist’s office parking lot could become the parking lot for a restaurant. </p>
<p id="Pw5djj">The other part is pricing. If you institute a parking fee, you’ll find out exactly how many people are willing to pay to park there. If you keep raising prices until you always have spots available, you’ll find out exactly how high it needs to be to create a few open spots on every block. Because it might seem like it only takes you a couple of minutes to find a spot for free, but the net effect is thousands of miles of driving every day across the United States. There’s an unbelievable amount of driving being done just looking for parking spaces. You can look up a restaurant and look at exactly how to get there, but finding good parking is dependent on local knowledge. If you want to park downtown, you should be able to know it’s going to cost this much, and you can do it here — that should be made clear at every highway exit to downtown. But it’s not.</p>
<p id="Pkz4tv"><strong>Is the implication that parking is going to have to get more annoying in places where everyone wants to park, like busy urban commercial areas?</strong></p>
<p id="sAUQpM">I don’t think it should be more annoying. We’ve become so accustomed to the idea that you have to hunt for parking that it’s hard for people to wrap their heads around the idea that it will be easier. Yes, you’re going to have to pay for it, but no, you don’t have to stress anymore because you’ll know there’ll be a parking spot where you want it. That’s a new concept, but in the places where it’s been instituted, people seem to have found it agreeable. There is a way, even without eliminating any parking, that a little bit of management can make a smoother parking experience for everyone. Time is money, and circling around the block and not knowing when you can find a spot, or leaving 20 minutes early to find a spot to park, that’s a cost as well. </p>
<p id="5JMzNb"><strong>How does parking affect our housing supply?</strong></p>
<p id="oxnbNg">There are two principal ways that parking affects the housing supply. The first is that many jurisdictions in this country have parking requirements for new housing. That places a geometric and financial constraint on the types of things that can be built. And then what gets built contains a lot of parking, and the cost of that parking is folded into the cost of the units, whether they’re being sold or rented. And this is a pretty significant cost. In California and Arizona, it adds tens of thousands of dollars onto the cost of every new low-income housing unit. It’s folded into the rent or the asking price, whether you drive a car or not.</p>
<p id="YBYeE4">Parking functions as a third rail in neighborhood politics. The public parking supply is such a fixation that people oppose new projects, especially projects that don’t have “enough” parking, on the grounds that they’ll threaten that public parking supply, whereas if I were to say, “I don’t want poor people living in the neighborhood,” that would be considered unacceptable. I cite this survey in the book of baby boomers, and <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/modest-densification-zhar-30934/">more than half of baby boomers</a> say that free parking is more important than affordable housing in their neighborhood.  </p>
<p id="TkVFuo"><strong>How did we mess this up so bad?  </strong></p>
<p id="taRlfX">I think that parking requirements were done with the best of intentions. At its roots, it was really thought that it would solve the traffic problems in congested neighborhoods that were caused, <a href="https://time.com/6217873/parking-lots-climate-change-california/">[mid-century urban planners] thought</a>, by not having enough parking. This was the situation in American cities in the 1940s and ’50s: It was just unbelievable traffic jams, which city planners concluded were caused by the fact that there wasn’t enough parking. So lots and lots of parking was provided. The thing that they probably couldn’t have anticipated was just how thoroughly it would remake the urban environment, and how expensive it would be, and the extent to which it would begin to constrain the types of housing we could build. </p>
<p id="QObHF9">What more recent research proves is that the more parking you provide, the more people will drive, and parking is perhaps the greatest determinant of whether people decide to make a trip in a car or by some other means. So providing more parking does not actually make it easier to park. If parking actually encourages people to drive, then more parking is actually going to create more traffic, not soak up the traffic of people looking for parking.  </p>
<p id="FjV7CC"><strong>Some places have gotten rid of parking minimums, or requirements that new construction have a certain number of parking spots, in the last few years. I’m curious if you can talk a little bit about what the results have been in those communities.</strong></p>
<p id="46Dil7">There’s been a ton of movement on this in the last five years. It’s kind of amazing, dozens of cities deciding that they no longer want to require people to build a <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/11/22/announcing-a-new-and-improved-map-of-cities-that-have-removed-parking-minimums">certain amount of parking</a> corresponding to land use. One of the best examples is in Seattle, where in 2012 they decided to <a href="https://council.seattle.gov/2012/05/10/removing-minimum-parking-requirements-where-unneeded/">stop requiring parking for new apartment buildings around transit</a>. This was right at a period when residential construction in Seattle was booming. And they approved 60,000 units between 2012 and 2017. Most of them still have parking — I mean, developers know people who move into their buildings want space to park their cars — but they <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837718312870?via%3Dihub">built 40 percent less parking</a> than would have been required under the old regime. And that meant they built 18,000 fewer parking spaces, and the amount of money saved from that, which we can assume went into cheaper apartments and lower rent, was $540 million: half a billion dollars saved just by not building quite so many parking spaces. </p>
<p id="1bLqYP"><strong>What else can we do? </strong></p>
<p id="2s6mVZ">If you could imagine a paradigm in which parking was a little less important, and we needed a little less of it, you can do so much with the land that we have currently reserved for parking lots. The more spectacular opportunity is with curb parking in cities, where we’ve got some of the most valuable real estate on earth, and that is really crucial in shaping people’s perception and understanding and enjoyment of the places they live in. You saw this during Covid, with the [outdoor] <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/07/streateries-outdoor-dining-architecture.html">restaurant pop-ups</a>; to even have 12 people outside sitting and having coffee on the street is just tremendous. That’s only the tip of the iceberg, right? </p>
<p id="C5p1o0">You could imagine a world in which streets were pedestrianized and where we planted trees and gardens and in what is currently space reserved for parking, and closed streets, outside schools, so kids can have places to play. I think all those things are within reach. Those aren’t even particularly expensive or ambitious ideas. They just depend on 25 car owners saying, all right, we’ll give up our rights to this little strip of land. The changes to parking on surrounding streets would probably be pretty marginal, if you consider 25 cars in neighborhood parking stock that’s probably in the thousands. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="ember3855837">    <h2>Strategies beat stoicism</h2>
<p>People who talk about self-discipline often make it sound like a matter of <em>clenching</em> really hard. Or of bullying yourself through negative self-talk.</p>
<p>But effective self-discipline is about working smarter, not just harder. We've known this since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.historytoday.com/archive/foundations/ulysses-and-sirens">Odysseus tied himself</a> to the mast, and we've studied it extensively in the lab.</p>
<p>From Robert Sapolsky's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Behave-Robert-M-Sapolsky-audiobook/dp/B06XVYHXDV">Behave</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1960s Stanford psychologist Walter Mischel developed the “marshmallow test” to study gratification postponement. A child is presented with a marshmallow. The experimenter says, “I’m going out of the room for a while. You can eat the marshmallow after I leave. But if you wait and don’t eat it until I get back, I’ll give you another marshmallow,” and leaves. And the child, observed through a two-way mirror, begins the lonely challenge of holding out for fifteen minutes until the researcher returns.</p>
<p>Studying hundreds of three- to six-year-olds, Mischel saw enormous variability — a few ate the marshmallow before the experimenter left the room. About a third lasted the fifteen minutes. The rest were scattered in between, averaging a delay of eleven minutes. Kids’ strategies for resisting the marshmallow’s siren call differed, as can be seen on contemporary versions of the test on YouTube. Some kids cover their eyes, hide the marshmallow, sing to distract themselves. Others grimace, sit on their hands. Others sniff the marshmallow, pinch off an infinitely tiny piece to eat, hold it reverentially, kiss it, pet it.</p>
<p>As expected, older kids hold out longer, using more effective strategies. Younger kids describe strategies like “I kept thinking about how good that second marshmallow would taste.” The problem, of course, is that this strategy is about two synapses away from thinking about the marshmallow in front of you. In contrast, older kids use strategies of distraction — thinking about toys, pets, their birthday. This progresses to reappraisal strategies (“This isn’t about marshmallows. This is about the kind of person I am”). To Mischel, maturation of willpower is more about distraction and reappraisal strategies than about stoicism.</p>

<h2>What do <em>I</em> know?</h2>
<p>Self-discipline is my jam. I've spent a <em>lot</em> of time honing my ability to do what I say I'm going to do. Maybe not 10,000 hours, but certainly 10,000 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/plan-do-learn-my-somewhat-hardcore-work-routine-1fb500959f">learning cycles</a>. And the PoWeR technique, which I'll explain below, is one of the most valuable frameworks I've developed with all those iterations.</p>
<p>First, a quick reality check: No single technique will turn anyone into a disciplined person. For that, you'll have to put in your own 10,000 iterations.</p>
<p>But here's an idea of what the technique <em>will</em> do.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/0807014273">once wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, think of the PoWeR technique as a strategic crowbar for prying that space wide open with minimal effort.</p>
<h2>PWR: the main ingredients</h2>
<p>Let's start with the "PWR" in "PoWeR." These letters are capitalized because they're the core steps of the technique. They stand for <strong>P</strong>ause, <strong>W</strong>hat-now decision, and <strong>R</strong>eset.</p>
<p>In short: You hold your breath and don't allow yourself to breathe again until you begin taking an action that aligns with your goals.</p>
<p>I'll break down the steps.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Pause</h3>
<p>Let's say you're in a situation where you want to exercise self-discipline. Maybe you keep snoozing your alarm instead of getting up. Maybe you're doomscrolling a social feed instead of working on that important project. Maybe you've just reached for the marshmallow instead of waiting for the nice man in the lab coat to bring you mallow #2.</p>
<p>The first step is to pause and take what I call a "ransom breath":</p>
<ol>
<li>Whatever it is you're currently doing, stop doing it.</li>
<li>Take a deep breath and hold it in.</li>
<li>Commit to yourself that you won't release the breath until you start taking a specific, goal-directed action (explained in the next step).</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have a hostage situation on your hands.</p>
<p>P.S.: Obviously don't hold your breath to the point of passing out. If you naturally run out of air, just start a new breath hold.</p>
<h3>Step 2: What-now decision</h3>
<p>"What-now" is short for "What should I do now?"</p>
<p>In the scenarios I mentioned above, you already have a <em>general</em> idea of what you should do. But to make a "what-now decision," you need to concretize that idea into a <em>specific action step.</em> The action step should be simple enough that you can get it done before running out of breath. But "simple" doesn't mean "trivial."</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You keep snoozing your alarm. <strong>What-now decision:</strong> "I'll stand to my feet with no part of my body touching the bed anymore."</li>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You're stuck in a doomscrolling loop. <strong>What-now decision:</strong> "I'll close this browser tab (or mobile app)."</li>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You reach for the mallow. <strong>What-now decision:</strong> "I'll sit on my hands and start counting onesies twosies threesies foursies."</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Reset</h3>
<p>Exactly what you think:</p>
<ol>
<li>You "unpause" to take action on your what-now decision.</li>
<li>Once you've satisfied the conditions that you laid out in step 2, you release the ransom breath and go about your day.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's that.</p>
<h2>Why this works</h2>
<p>To use a financial analogy: because the return on your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/dont-just-manage-time-manage-tea-time-energy-attention-a3e6c97377">investment of energy</a> is massive. PWR amounts to an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention">implementation intention</a> with a side of suffocation. Together, they generate a lot of chemical motivation at the cheap, cheap cost of taking a breath.</p>
<p>I won't explain implementation intentions in this essay. Feel free to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention">hit up Wikipedia</a> if you're curious. But I do want to nerd out for a moment about suffocation. Because it's wild.</p>
<h3>The woman without fear</h3>
<p>Back in the 60s, a woman was born with a disease that completely destroyed her amygdala. That's the region of the brain that's responsible for fear. In the scientific literature she's known as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M._(patient)">Patient S.M.</a>, but the media likes to refer to her as "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b15GbtsdQAU">the woman without fear</a>."</p>
<p>Venomous snakes? Domestic violence? Haunted houses? Risky financial bets? She won't flinch at any of it. No amygdala, no fear.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Wrong. When researchers had S.M. inhale a single breath of carbon dioxide, which creates a suffocating sensation, her response surprised everyone. Here's author James Nestor's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Breath-New-Science-Lost-Art/dp/0735213615">description</a> of the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right away, her droopy eyes grew wider. Her shoulder muscles tensed, her breathing became labored. She grabbed at the desk. “Help me!” she yelled through the mouthpiece. S.M. lifted an arm and waved it as if she were drowning. “I can’t!” she screamed. “I can’t breathe!”</p>
<p>A researcher yanked the mask off, but it didn’t help. S.M. jerked wildly and gasped. A minute or so later, she dropped her arms and returned to breathing slowly and calmly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks in part to S.M., we now know that there's a second and deeper way to trigger the fear circuit — and that this "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/12/141201090430.htm">suffocation alarm</a>" may have even evolved before the amygdala.</p>
<p>This matters for self-discipline because the amygdala is often the biggest obstacle to exercising willpower. It can easily overwhelm the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontoparietal_network">executive center</a> of the brain where we do a lot of rational decision-making.</p>
<p>But the executive center can fight back. By consciously controlling the breath, it can leverage a powerful alarm system to override the amygdala and divert resources away from it. At least for a few seconds.</p>
<p>But sometimes a few seconds aren't enough. Which brings me to the final two letters of the PoWeR technique.</p>

<h2>O and E: the bonus ingredients</h2>
<p>Sometimes, PWR be damned, you'll still struggle to pry open that space between stimulus and response. You'll want to stop scrolling or gaming or Netflixing, and you'll think to yourself, "Just take a deep breath." But even that tiny action will prove too tall of an order.</p>
<p>Or an even more common scenario: you'll pry the space open successfully, only for it to slam shut again the moment you stop paying attention. Like when your fingers unconsciously reopen that addictive browser tab you closed three minutes ago.</p>
<p>In these situations, you can add the "O" and the "E" to "PoWeR": <strong>O</strong>verride and <strong>E</strong>nvironment.</p>
<p>In short, an "override" involves working your way up from a small ransom breath to a larger one during the pause step. And "environment" means adding constraints to your physical environment that make it easier to avoid unwanted behavioral patterns.</p>
<h3>Override</h3>
<p>This is basically a variant of a pause:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop doing whatever you're doing.</li>
<li>Do a <em>no windup</em> breath hold by simply closing the windpipe in your throat (instead of taking a deep breath, as you would in the PWR version).</li>
<li>Commit to yourself that you won't breathe again until you take a normal ransom breath (explained earlier in the section called "Step 1: Pause").</li>
<li>Take a normal ransom breath, and then continue naturally to the "what-now decision" step.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>If your environment isn't conducive to intentional action, make <em>environment change</em> the target of your what-now decision. Do this by setting up an environment constraint. Here's how Alicia Juarrero <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Context-Changes-Everything-Constraints-Coherence/dp/0262545667">defines</a> "constraints":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conditions that raise or lower barriers to energy flow without directly transferring kinetic energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't just close the browser tab. Use a site blocker like <a target="_blank" href="https://freedom.to/">Freedom</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/delayed-gratification/ifhndomfnbmggdgodaicfebeggdphlcn">Delayed Gratification</a> to block yourself from accessing the offending website for the next 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Don't just get out of bed. Play an upbeat soundtrack on your mobile phone that puts you in a mood to get going.</li>
<li>Don't just ignore the marshmallow. Hide it from view by moving it to the chair on the opposite side of the table.</li>
</ul>
<p>…Or just eat the damn thing. You're only four years old, after all.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  The dominant text generation models compose the output by sequentially
selecting words from a fixed vocabulary. In this paper, we formulate text
generation as progressively copying text segments (e.g., words or phrases) from
an existing text collection. We compute the contextualized representations of
meaningful text segments and index them using efficient vector search toolkits.
The task of text generation is then decomposed into a series of copy-and-paste
operations: at each time step, we seek suitable text spans from the text
collection rather than selecting from a standalone vocabulary. Experiments on
the standard language modeling benchmark (WikiText-103) show that our approach
achieves better generation quality according to both automatic and human
evaluations. Besides, its inference efficiency is comparable to token-level
autoregressive models thanks to the reduction of decoding steps. We also show
that our approach allows for effective domain adaptation by simply switching to
domain-specific text collection without extra training. Finally, we observe
that our approach attains additional performance gains by simply scaling up to
larger text collections, again without further training.\footnote{Our source

<p>All too often someone, somewhere, on some forum … will lament the lack of encapsulation and isolation in the <em>C programming language</em>. This happens with such regularity that I now feel compelled to address the myth once and forever. This means I can post links to this page for any future assertion of that nature without having to retype the explanation in everytime <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">someone is wrong on the internet</a></p>
<p>Just to be clear, <em>C</em> is an old language lacking many, many, <em>many</em> modern features. One of the features it <em>does not lack</em> is encapsulation and isolation.</p>
<h2 id="myth-c-has-no-equivalent-to-private">Myth: C has no equivalent to “private”</h2>
<p>Lets look at a class definition that has <code>private</code> members; after all, that’s where the isolation comes from, right? If all the fields were public, then it’d be just like <em>C</em> but with inheritance.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>class</span> <span>StringBuilder</span> {</span>
<span id="cb2-2">   <span>private</span> <span>String</span> payload;</span>
<span id="cb2-3">   <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Append</span>(<span>String</span> snippet) {</span>
<span id="cb2-4">      payload = payload + snippet;</span>
<span id="cb2-5">   }</span>
<span id="cb2-6">};</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Any attempt by a caller to access the field <code>payload</code> results in a compilation error. Pretty nifty. You can see why this can be useful.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="https://turnoff.us/image/en/private-cloud.png" width="300" alt="PrivateWrong!"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Private Wrong, a Major Pain!</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <em>C</em> programming language doesn’t have classes<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, but it does have <code>structs</code>, which look like this:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>struct</span> StringBuilder {</span>
<span id="cb3-2">   <span>char</span> *payload;</span>
<span id="cb3-3">};</span>
<span id="cb3-4"></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><span>void</span> Append(<span>struct</span> StringBuilder *obj, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *snippet);</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are no access modifiers; all fields in a struct are public. This is why there is always someone complaining that <em>C</em> doesn’t provide encapsulation or isolation: everything is visible in a struct, to everyone, all the time, even the callers of the function <code>Append()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="reality-bytes">Reality bytes</h2>
<p>The complaint isn’t necessarily true. While you <em>can indeed</em> dump everything into a single source file and call it a day, the more common option is to split things into different files and modules.</p>
<p>When code is in different source files, they <em>are</em> are encapsulated into a <em>module</em>. Each <em>“module”</em> in <em>C</em> consists of an interface file which callers can use to call functions which exist in the implementation file.</p>
<p>The interface file, called the <strong>header file</strong> (with a file extension of <code>.h</code>) is a <strong>contract</strong> that tells the user of the module what functions and types are needed to use the implementation, frequently simply called the <strong>source file</strong>. After compilation, you might have a compiled <strong>implementation</strong>, and thus may not even have access to the source code of <code>Append()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="and-ta-da">And … Ta Da!</h2>
<p>The calling programs <strong>have</strong> to use the <em>header file</em> in order to make legal (under <em>C</em>) calls to <code>Append()</code>; the implementation might only be available in compiled form, after all, and not source code form.</p>
<p>So, in the header you do:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> StringBuilder StringBuilder;</span>
<span id="cb4-2"></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>void</span> Append(StringBuilder *obj, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *snippet);</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the implementation you do:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>struct</span> StringBuilder {</span>
<span id="cb5-2">   <span>char</span> *payload;</span>
<span id="cb5-3">};</span>
<span id="cb5-4"></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><span>void</span> Append(StringBuilder *obj, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *snippet)</span>
<span id="cb5-6">{</span>
<span id="cb5-7">   ...</span>
<span id="cb5-8">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And … that’s <em>it!</em></p>
<p>Now any code using a struct of type <code>StringBuilder</code> can use it all they want to build up a string, but they can never see the fields within it.</p>
<p>Hell, they cannot even <code>malloc()</code> their own <code>StringBuilder</code> instance, because even the size of the <code>StringBuilder</code> is hidden. They have to use creation and deletion functions provided in the implementation as specified in the interface.</p>
<h2 id="but-theres-more">But, there’s more …</h2>
<p>So now you have a way to create an instance of an object with all its fields hidden from any caller. You have also forced all callers to stop messing about with the fields in your object - all access to the object is guarded by the functions in the implementation (as specified in the header).</p>
<p>You don’t have inheritance, but you <em>do</em> have one very important characteristic: you can create objects from this class, and use them, from within Python.</p>
<p>Or PHP.</p>
<p>Ruby, even.</p>
<p>It’ll work with most Lisp implementations.</p>
<p>You can call it from Java.</p>
<p>In fact, I don’t believe there is a single programming language in common use which <em>cannot</em> use this object. In many cases the programmer from the other language won’t even have to do much work to use this class.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>]</p>
<p>My <code>Makefiles</code> already have rules to <strong>automatically</strong> generate the interface so that the <em>C</em> code I write in this manner is callable from within Android applications.</p>
<h2 id="you-got-it-ill-stop-now">You got it, I’ll stop now</h2>
<p>And that’s how you get encapsulation and isolation with strong guarantees in <em>C</em>. Don’t believe everything you read on the internet.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

				<p id="speakable-summary">What does one expect from a website builder in 2023? That’s the question many startups — and incumbents — are trying to answer as the landscape changes, driven by trends in generative AI. Do no-code drag-and-drop interfaces still make sense in an era of prompts and media-generating models? And what’s the right level of abstraction that won’t alienate more advanced users?</p>
<p>Wix, a longtime fixture of the web building space, is betting that today’s customers don’t particularly care to spend time customizing every aspect of their site’s appearance.</p>
<p>The company’s new AI Site Generator tool, announced today, will let Wix users describe their intent and generate a website complete with a homepage, inner pages and text and images — as well as business-specific sections for events, bookings and more. Avishai Abrahami, Wix’s co-founder and CEO, says that the goal was to provide customers with “real value” as they build their sites and grow their businesses.</p>
<p>“The AI Site Generator leverages our domain expertise and near-decade of experience with AI to tune the models to generate high-quality content, tailor-made design and layouts,” Abrahami said. “We’ve conducted many tests and have had many in-depth conversations with users to be confident that we are delivering real value. That’s why we chose to do it now.”</p>

<p>AI Site Generator might be Wix’s most ambitious AI experiment to date, but it’s not the company’s first. Wix’s recently launched text creator taps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> to give users the ability to generate personalized content for particular sections of a website. Meanwhile, its AI template text creator generates all the text for a given site. There’s also the AI domain generator for brainstorming web domain names, which sits alongside Wix’s suite of AI image editing, fine-tuning and creation tools.</p>
<p>The way Abrahami tells it, Wix isn’t jumping on AI because it’s the Silicon Valley darling of the moment. He sees the tech as a genuine way to streamline and simplify the process of building back-end business functionality, infrastructure, payments capabilities and more for customers’ websites.</p>
<div id="attachment_2569603"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2569603" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ezgif-1-ceeefa582b.gif" alt="Wix AI site generator" width="600" height="338"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2569603"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wix</p></div>
<p>To Abrahami’s point, small businesses in particular struggle to launch and maintain sites, potentially causing them to miss income opportunities. A 2022 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/27-of-small-businesses-still-dont-have-a-website-in-2022-301542302.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> by Top Design Firms, a directory for finding creative agencies, found that nearly 27% of small businesses still don’t have a website and that low traffic, followed by adding “advanced” functionalities and cost, are the top challenges they face with their website.</p>
<p>AI Site Generator takes several prompts — any descriptions of sites — and uses a combination of in-house and third-party AI systems to create the envisioned site. In a chatbot-like interface, the tool asks a series of questions about the nature of the site and business, attempting to translate this into a custom web template.</p>
<p>ChatGPT generates the text for the website while Wix’s AI creates the site design and images.</p>
<p>Other platforms, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/07/speedybrand-generative-ai-marketing/">SpeedyBrand</a>, which TechCrunch recently profiled, already accomplish something this. But Wix claims that AI Site Generator is unique in that it can build in e-commerce, scheduling, food ordering and event ticketing components automatically, depending on a customer’s specs and requirements.</p>
<div id="attachment_2569600"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2569600" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ezgif-1-b0517e68cb.gif" alt="Wix AI site generator" width="600" height="338"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2569600"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wix</p></div>
<p>“With AI Site Generator, users will be able to create a complete website, where the design fits the content, as opposed to a template where the content fits the design,” Abrahami said. “This generates a unique website that maximizes the experience relevant to the content.”</p>
<p>Customers aren’t constrained to AI Site Generator’s designs, a not-so-subtle acknowledgement that AI isn’t at the point where it can replace human designers — assuming it ever gets there. The full suite of Wix’s editing tools — both manual and AI-driven — is available to AI Site Generator users, letting them make tweaks and changes as they see fit.</p>
<p>New capabilities focused on editing will arrive alongside AI Site Generator, too, like an AI page and section creator that’ll enable customers to add a new page or section to a site simply by describing their needs. The forthcoming object eraser will let users extract objects from images and manipulate them, while the new AI assistant tool will suggest site improvements (e.g. adding a product or changing a design) and create personalized strategies based on analytics and site trends.</p>
<div id="attachment_2569593"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2569593" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ezgif-1-3df1f254b3.gif" alt="Wix assistant" width="600" height="338"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2569593"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wix</p></div>
<p>“The current AI revolution is just beginning to unleash AI’s true potential,” Abrahami said. “We believe AI can reduce complexity and create value for our users, and we will continue to be trailblazers.”</p>
<p>But there’s reason to be wary of the tech.</p>
<p>As The Verge’s James Vincent wrote in a recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/26/23773914/ai-large-language-models-data-scraping-generation-remaking-web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piece</a>, generative AI models are changing the economy of the web — making it cheaper and easier to generate lower-quality content. Newsguard, a company that provides tools for vetting news sources, has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2023/06/29/the-predictable-rise-of-generative-ai-spam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exposed</a>&nbsp;hundreds of ad-supported sites with generic-sounding names featuring misinformation created with generative AI.</p>
<p>Cheap AI content also risks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/19063562/ai-text-generation-spam-marketing-seo-fractl-grover-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clogging up</a> search engines — a future small businesses almost certainly don’t want. Models such as ChatGPT excel at crafting search engine-friendly marketing copy. But this spam can often bury legitimate sites, particularly sites created by those without the means or know-how to optimize their content with the right keywords and schema.</p>
<p>Even generative AI used with the best intentions can go awry. Thanks to a phenomenon known as “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/19/stability-ai-releases-chatgpt-like-language-models/">hallucination</a>,” AI models sometimes confidently make up facts or spew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/researchers-discover-a-way-to-make-chatgpt-consistently-toxic/">toxic, wildly offensive</a> remarks. And <span>generative AI has been shown to <a href="https://www.unite.ai/ai-based-generative-writing-models-frequently-copy-and-paste-source-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plagiarize</a> copyrighted work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So what steps is Wix taking to combat all this? Abrahami didn’t say specifically. But he stressed that Wix uses a “bevy” of tools to&nbsp;manage spam and abuse.</p>
<p>“Our AI solutions are tried and tested on large-scale quality data and we leverage the knowledge gained from usage and building workflows across hundreds of millions of websites,” Abrahami said. “We have many models, including AI, that prevent and detect model abuse because we believe in creating a safe digital space where the fundamental rights of users are protected. ChatGPT has an inherent model to prevent inappropriate content generation; we plan to use OpenAI’s moderation.”</p>
<p>Time will tell how successful that strategy ends up being.</p>

<p>From the abstract:<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>"we analyze a large dataset of citations from Wikipedia and model the role of open access in Wikipedia's citation patterns. We find that open-access articles are extensively and increasingly more cited in Wikipedia. What is more, they show a 15% higher likelihood of being cited in Wikipedia when compared to closed-access articles, after controlling for confounding factors. This open-access citation effect is particularly strong for articles with low citation counts, including recently published ones. Our results show that open access plays a key role in the dissemination of scientific knowledge, including by providing Wikipedia editors timely access to novel results."

<h4></h4>
<p>This article is a first draft of an analysis of the relationship between the availability of a scientific journal as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access" title="Open access">open access</a> and the fact that it is cited in the English Wikipedia (note: although it speaks of "Wikipedia", the article looks only at the English pages). It is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed, so its results should be read with caution, especially since I am not sure about the robustness of the model and the results derived from it (see below). It is of course a very important issue, as access to scientific sources is key to the diffusion of scientific knowledge, but also, as the authors mention, because Wikipedia is seen as central to the diffusion of scientific facts (and is sometimes used by scientists to push their ideas).

<p>The results presented in the article (and its abstract) highlight two important issues for Wikipedia that will likely be addressed in a more complete version of the paper:
</p>
<ul><li>The question of the reliability of the sources used by Wikipedians</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>→ The regressions seem to indicate that the reputation of the journal is not important to be cited in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>→ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_journals" title="Predatory journals">Predatory journals</a> are known to be more often open access than classical journals, which means that this result potentially indicates that the phenomenon of open access reduces the seriousness of Wikipedia sources.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>The authors say on p. 4 that they provided "each journal with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCImago_Journal_Rank" title="SCImago Journal Rank">SJR score</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index" title="H-index">H-index</a>, and other relevant information."
Why did they not use this as a control variable?
(this echoes a debate on the role of Wikipedia: is it to disseminate verified knowledge, or to serve as a platform for the dissemination of new theories? The authors seem to lean towards the second view: p. 2: "With the rapid development of the Internet, traditional peer review and journal publication can no longer meet the need for the development of new ideas".)
</p>
<ul><li>The solidity of the paper's conclusions</li></ul>
<dl><dd>The authors said: "STEM fields, especially biology and medicine, comprise the most prominent scientific topics in Wikipedia [17]." "General science, technology, and biomedical research have relatively higher OA rates."
<dl><dd>→ So, it is obvious that, on average, there are more citations of Open Access articles in Wikipedia (than in the entire available research corpus), and explain that open access articles are cited more.</dd>
<dd>→ Why not control for academic discipline in the models?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>More problematic (and acknowledged by the authors, so probably in the process of being addressed), the authors said, on p.7, that they built their model with the assumption that the age of a research article and the number of citations it has both influence the probability of an article being cited in Wikipedia.
Of course, for this causal effect to hold, the age and the number of citations must be taken into account at the moment the article is cited in Wikipedia. For example, if some of the citations are made after the citation in Wikipedia, one could argue that the causal effect could be in the other direction.
Also, many articles are open access after an embargo period, and are therefore considered open access in the analysis, whereas they may have been cited in Wikipedia when they were under embargo.
The authors did not check for this, as acknowledged in the last sentence of the article. Would their result hold if they do their model taking the first citation in the English Wikipedia, for example, and the age of the article, its open access status, etc. at that moment?

<blockquote><p> 
This study investigates the development of historical revisionism on Wikipedia. The edit history of Wikipedia pages allows us to trace the dynamics of individuals and coordinated groups surrounding controversial topics. This project focuses on Japan, where there has been a recent increase in right-wing discourse and dissemination of different interpretations of historical events.</p></blockquote>
<p>This brief study, one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_abstract" title="Extended abstract">extended abstracts</a> accepted at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2023/">Wiki Workshop (10th edition)</a>, follows up on reports that some historical pages on the Japanese Wikipedia, particularly those related to World War II and war crimes, have been edited in ways that reflect radical right-wing ideas (see previous <i>Signpost</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2021-03-28/In_the_media" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2021-03-28/In the media">coverage</a>). It sets out to answer three questions: 
</p>
<ol><li>What types of historical topics are most susceptible to historical revisionism?</li>
<li>What are the common factors for the historical topics that are subject to revisionism?</li>
<li>Are there groups of editors who are seeking to disseminate revisionist narratives?</li></ol>
<p>The study focuses on the level of controversy of historical articles, based on the notion that the introduction of revisionism is likely to lead to edit wars. The authors found that the most controversial historical articles in the Japanese Wikipedia were indeed focused on areas that are of particular interest to revisionists. From the findings:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Articles related to WWII exhibited significantly greater controversy than general historical articles. Among the top 20 most controversial articles, eleven were largely related to Japanese war crimes and right-wing ideology. Over time, the number of contributing editors and the level of controversy increased. Furthermore, editors involved in edit wars were more likely to contribute to a higher number of controversial articles, particularly those related to right-wing ideology. These findings suggest the possible presence of groups of editors seeking to disseminate revisionist narratives.</p></blockquote> 
<p>The paper establishes that articles covering these topic areas in the Japanese Wikipedia are contested and subject to edit wars. However, it does not measure to what extent article content has been compromised. Edit wars could be a sign of mainstream editors pushing back against revisionists, while conversely an absence of edit wars could indicate that a project has been captured (cf. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Wikipedia" title="Croatian Wikipedia">Croatian Wikipedia</a>). While this little paper is a useful start, further research on the Japanese Wikipedia seems warranted.

<p>This preprint<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> (by three graduate students at Stanford University's computer science department and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_S._Lam" title="Monica S. Lam">Monica S. Lam</a> as fourth author) discusses the construction of a Wikipedia-based chatbot:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We design WikiChat [...] to ground LLMs using Wikipedia to achieve the following objectives. While LLMs tend to hallucinate, our chatbot should be factual. While introducing facts to the conversation, we need to maintain the qualities of LLMs in being relevant, conversational, and engaging."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper sets out from the observation that
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"LLMs cannot speak accurately about events that occurred after their training, which are often topics of great interest to users, and [...] are highly prone to hallucination when talking about less popular (tail) topics. [...] Through many iterations of experimentation, we have crafted a pipeline based on information retrieval that (1) uses LLMs to suggest interesting and relevant facts that are individually verified against Wikipedia, (2) retrieves additional up-to-date information, and (3) composes coherent and engaging time-aware responses. [...] We focus on evaluating important but previously neglected issues such as conversing about recent and tail topics. We find that WikiChat outperforms all baselines in terms of the factual accuracy of its claims, by up to 12.1%, 28.3% and 32.7% on head, recent and tail topics, while matching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3.5" title="GPT-3.5">GPT-3.5</a> in terms of providing natural, relevant, non-repetitive and informational responses."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers argue that "most chatbots are evaluated only on static crowdsourced benchmarks like Wizard of Wikipedia (Dinan et al., 2019) and Wizard of Internet (Komeili et al., 2022). Even when human evaluation is used, evaluation is conducted only on familiar discussion topics. This leads to an overestimation of the capabilities of chatbots." They call such topics "head topics" ("Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona" title="FC Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>"). In  contrast, the lesser known "tail topics [are] likely to be present in the pre-training data of LLMs at low frequency. Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Percy_Hilditch" title="Thomas Percy Hilditch">Thomas Percy Hilditch</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen_Suomi" title="Hell's Kitchen Suomi">Hell's Kitchen Suomi</a>". As a third category, they consider "recent topics" ("topics that happened in 2023, and therefore are absent from the pre-training corpus of LLMs, even though some background information about them could be present. Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spare_(memoir)" title="Spare (memoir)"><i>Spare</i> (memoir)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Open" title="2023 Australian Open">2023 Australian Open</a>"). The latter are obtained from a list of most edited Wikipedia articles in early 2023. 
</p><p>Regarding the "core verification problem [...] whether a claim is backed up by the retrieved paragraphs [the researchers] found that there is a significant gap between LLMs (even GPT-4) and human performance [...]. Therefore, we conduct human evaluation via crowdsourcing, to classify each claim as supported, refuted, or [not having] enough information." (This observation may be of interest regarding efforts to use LLMs as a tools for Wikipedians to check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:TSI" title="Wikipedia:TSI">integrity of citations on Wikipedia</a>. See also <a href="#&quot;WiCE:_Real-World_Entailment_for_Claims_in_Wikipedia&quot;">the "WiCE" paper below</a>.) 
</p><p>In contrast, the evalution for "conversationality" is conducted "with simulated users using LLMs. LLMs are good at simulating users: they have the general familiarity with world knowledge and know how users behave socially. They are free to occasionally hallucinate, make mistakes, and repeat or even contradict themselves, as human users sometimes do."
</p><p>In the paper's evaluation, WikiChat impressively outperforms the two comparison baselines in all three topic areas (even the well-known "head" topics). It may be worth noting though that the comparison did not include widely used chatbots such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT" title="ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_AI" title="Bing AI">Bing AI</a>. Instead, the authors chose to compare their chatbot with Atlas (describing it as based on a retrieval-augmented language model that is "state-of-the-art [...] on the KILT benchmark") and GPT-3.5 (while ChatGPT is or has been based on GPT-3.5 too, it involved extensive additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning)" title="Fine-tuning (deep learning)">finetuning</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback" title="Reinforcement learning from human feedback">by humans</a>).

<blockquote><p> 
"Large Language Models (LLMs) may hallucinate and generate fake information, despite pre-training on factual data. Inspired by the journalistic device of 'according to sources', we propose according-to prompting: directing LLMs to ground responses against previously observed text. To quantify this grounding, we propose a novel evaluation metric (QUIP-Score) that measures the extent to which model-produced answers are directly found in underlying text corpora. We illustrate with experiments on Wikipedia that these prompts improve grounding under our metrics, with the additional benefit of often improving end-task performance."</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors tested various variations of such "grounding prompts" (e.g. "As an expert editor for Wikipedia, I am confident in the following answer." or "I found some results for that on Wikipedia. Here’s a direct quote:"). The best performing prompt was "Respond to this question using only information that can be attributed to Wikipedia".

Our annotations are over sub-sentence units of the hypothesis, decomposed automatically by GPT-3, each of which is labeled with a subset of evidence sentences from the source document. We show that real claims in our dataset involve challenging verification problems, and we benchmark existing approaches on this dataset. In addition, we show that reducing the complexity of claims by decomposing them by GPT-3 can improve entailment models' performance on various domains."

<p>"we introduce the novel task of automatically generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Short_description" title="Wikipedia:Short description">short descriptions for Wikipedia articles and</a> propose Descartes, a multilingual model for tackling it. Descartes integrates three sources of information to generate an article description in a target language: the text of the article in all its language versions, the already-existing descriptions (if any) of the article in other languages, and semantic type information obtained from a knowledge graph. We evaluate a Descartes model trained for handling 25 languages simultaneously, showing that it beats baselines (including a strong translation-based baseline) and performs on par with monolingual models tailored for specific languages. A human evaluation on three languages further shows that the quality of Descartes’s descriptions is largely indistinguishable from that of human-written descriptions; e.g., 91.3% of our English descriptions (vs. 92.1% of human-written descriptions) pass the bar for inclusion in Wikipedia, suggesting that Descartes is ready for production, with the potential to support human editors in filling a major gap in today’s Wikipedia across languages."

<p>From the introduction:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With the rapid development of Wikipedia and Wikidata in recent years, the editor community has been overloaded with contributing new information adapting to user requirements, and patrolling the massive content daily. Hence, the application of NLP and deep learning is key to solving these problems effectively. In this paper, we propose a summarization approach trained on WikiDes that generates missing descriptions in thousands of Wikidata items, which reduces human efforts and boosts content development faster. The summarizer is responsible for creating descriptions while humans toward a role in patrolling the text quality instead of
starting everything from the beginning. Our work can be scalable to multilingualism, which takes a more positive impact on user experiences in searching for articles by short descriptions in many Wikimedia projects."

We evaluated the properties of this ranking using human assessments of text quality, including readability, narrativity and language use. We demonstrate that GPT-2 perplexity scores correlate moderately to strongly with narrativity, but only weakly with reading comprehension scores. Importantly, the model reflects even small improvements to text as would be seen in Wikipedia edits. We conclude by highlighting that Wikipedia's featured articles counter-intuitively contain text with the highest perplexity scores."

It’s a mental warm-up, a way of occupying my brain when I don’t want to mindlessly scroll.</span></p><p><span>Along the way, I came across a fantastic book called </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Super-GM-Michael-Adams/dp/1784831670" rel="">Think Like A Super-GM</a><span>, by Michael Adams and Philip Hurtado. The authors take 100 or so chess puzzles, of varying difficulty, and then ask chess players of different skill levels (amateur to grandmaster) to solve them, </span><em>while recording their thinking process out loud</em><span>. </span></p></div><div><p><span>It turns out comparing the thought process of less skilled vs. more skilled players gives you many useful insights! (I’d love to see this concept used for books in other disciplines.)</span></p><p><span>The lesson I found the most striking is this: </span><strong>there’s a direct correlation between how skilled you are as a chess player, and how much time you spend falsifying your ideas</strong><span>. The authors find that grandmasters spend longer falsifying their idea for a move than they do coming up with the move in the first place, whereas amateur players tend to identify a solution and then play it shortly after without trying their hardest to falsify it first. (Often amateurs, find reasons </span><em>for</em><span> playing the move -- ‘hope chess’.)</span></p><p><span>Call this the ‘falsification ratio’: the ratio of time you spend trying to falsify your idea to the time you took coming up with it in the first place. For grandmasters, this is 4:1 — they’ll spend 1 minute finding the right move, and another 4 minutes trying to falsify it, whereas for amateurs this is something like 0.5:1 — 1 minute finding the move, 30 seconds making a cursory effort to falsify it. </span></p><p><span>This is a really interesting finding!</span></p><p><span>Let me explain with an example. (Obviously, you’ll need to understand the rules of chess, and chess notation, to follow all this; skip to section 2 if not.) Here is White to move:</span></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png" width="912" height="906" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:906,&quot;width&quot;:912,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb48adf8-ef5f-483d-9533-7173b07ba22e_912x906.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><div><p><span>Try and solve it yourself first. (Here’s a </span><a href="https://lichess.org/analysis/4Q3/5pkp/2Bp1bp1/4p3/1P2P2P/5qP1/5P2/6K1_w_-_-_0_1?color=white" rel="">Lichess board</a><span> link. Note: the puzzle is rated advanced, and a 2000 ELO person got it wrong in the book).</span></p><p><span>Here is the difference between an amateur and a good player:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The amateur: “Huh, f7 seems weak, what if I attack it again? Bd5 does that. Ok, so Bd5 and next move I play Qf7+. That’s </span><em>got</em><span> to be winning”. At this point the amateur will conclude they’ve solved the puzzle. (Note that they didn’t consider the opponent’s move at all.)</span></p><p><span>The good player: “Ok, I notice f7’s weak. Let me analyse Bd5. What’s the strongest reply — can I prove this wrong somehow? What would I play if I were Black? Oh wow, there’s Bxh4! Now if gxh4 then Black has a perpetual check (repeat Qg4 - Qd1 forever), and it’s a draw.” </span></p><p><span>Note that the good player hits on a potential right answer but immediately dives into </span><em>trying their hardest to prove it wrong, as though they were the opponent</em><span>, and they find that Bd5 leads to a draw (not a win). This leads them to the correct answer, which in this case is Qd7 -- this covers the g4 square, so that now if black plays Bxh4 white can safely recapture the bishop without worrying about perpetual check.</span></p><p><span>This skill of finding the best move for your opponent turns out to be very hard in practice. [1]</span></p><p><strong>2.</strong></p><p><span>It’s hard in real life, too: vanishingly few people are meta-rational enough to try </span><em>really hard to falsify their own ideas</em><span>. Your brain really wants to find reasons to support what you believe. It’s an unfamiliar and strange mental motion to invert that, and find the strongest arguments </span><em>against</em><span> your own beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But this isn’t a catch-all trick. There are important disanalogies to this in life, too. Many scenarios in life have the following properties:</span></p><p><span>(1) You have to “try it and see”; there aren’t definitive, computable answers</span><br><span>(2) Your degree of belief partially determines how successful you are</span></p><p><span>For example, should you launch that risky project - say, a startup? </span></p><p><span>If you spend 1 hour coming up with the idea and 4 hours coming up with reasons not to pursue it… chances are you’ll probably find some compelling-seeming reason why you shouldn’t bother. </span></p><p><span>The most effective people seem to be good at accepting the dissonance and going forward with things anyway (after thinking rigorously about them!), knowing that you can always find reasons why a thing won’t work. I think startups are an example of #2: your success is partially determined by how much conviction you have.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The “you have to try it and see” property is also counter-intuitive; it implies that your initial idea often doesn’t matter </span><em>except as a starting point</em><span>. This concept is often taken to mean “ideas don’t matter”, which is not what I’m saying here. It’s more like: the idea determines what maze you’re exploring, which is important — if you start out trying to find a cure for diabetes you’re unlikely to end up working on a payroll SaaS company, for example — but it’s going to </span><em>change</em><span> as you go along and learn more about reality.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is another area where I find that the personality of founders diverges from some smart engineers or scientists I’ve known: the scientist/engineers are good at analyzing the idea and finding reasons it </span><em>won’t</em><span> work (witness the negative Hacker News comments in virtually every successful startup launch, e.g. </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863" rel="">Dropbox</a><span>), because that’s how they’re trained to think. This skeptical mindset is adaptive in the engineering and science context — you have to find all the weak points in a system or theory, or else you’re not doing your job right. </span></p><p><span>It’s not as simple as “founders are optimists, scientists are skeptics”, though. I once asked a few founder friends what they’d have told themselves about startups, and the most common one was that </span><em>you know when something isn’t working way before you’re actually able to admit it to yourself</em><span>, and it’s best to save yourself time by admitting that it’s not working sooner, cutting your losses, and iterating quicker. You want the cycle time</span><em> </em><span>to be as fast as possible: the more cycles, the higher your chances of success overall. [2]</span></p><p><strong>3.</strong><span> </span></p><p><em>Conviction that there is an answer.</em><span> There’s a cruelty to problem-solving: if you are solving exercises that are collected in a book, it’s implicit that each of those problems has a solution. Puzzle books are a forgiving problem-solving environment in that way. It means that you can bang your head against the problem for hours, because you know that there is a findable answer, and that you will find it if you simply apply enough determination and search hard enough. Unlike real life, where you have to try it (and sometimes waste a lot of time).</span></p><p><span>This lesson hit home when I was trying the following problem from Larson’s book, “Problem Solving Through Problems” which is a collection of math problems (mostly Putnam or Olympiad): </span></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png" width="1236" height="250" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:250,&quot;width&quot;:1236,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><div><p><span> I beat my head against this one for ages, and couldn’t find any traction.

I started playing around with the 8s, noting that 8*8 (=64) contains a 6. If you could show this keeps recurring, you’d have proven that there are an infinite number of 6. </span></p><p><span>Two 8s peters out (8, 8 -&gt; 6, 4 -&gt; 2, 4 -&gt; 8). </span></p><p><span>But three 8s:</span></p><p><span>8, 8, 8 -&gt; 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4 -&gt; 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4 -&gt; 8, 8, 8...</span></p><p><span>This is a cycle! It recurs infinitely! And it contains a 6! QED. But I’m not sure I’d have found this without the conviction that there </span><em>was</em><span> a possible solution (otherwise, why would Larson have included it in the book?).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Real life is not this clean; frequently you dive into an idea maze and the answer turns out to be “it’s too hard for these structural reasons, and unless you fix these structural reasons there isn’t a sufficiently scalable thing here” or something like that — this seems to be the fate of a lot of startups that tackle sectors like education or health, for example. This can be painful and suck up years of people’s lives.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is why I think of founders and scientists as courageous in precisely the same way: they are driven by a faith that there’s a findable answer there, and they’re willing to dash themselves against the rocks and risk failure to get to that answer. And in many cases it turns out that there </span><em>isn’t</em><span> one, at least not by the paths of the maze that they’ve been exploring. </span></p><p><strong>4.</strong><span> </span></p><p><span>I think of this when reading </span><a href="https://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00092" rel="">Newton’s notebooks</a><span>. They’re not structured, they’re more him writing down questions about literally everything, and sketching out little proofs / thoughts. </span></p><p><span>They’re breathtaking – the sheer diversity of questions he asks, and the audacious scope of his conjectures. And what’s striking is he wonders – profusely – about very small physical things that a child might wonder about (I modernized the spelling):</span></p></div><ul><li><p>“Why is breath or sweat seen in winter more than in summer”</p></li><li><p>“Why water is clearer than Vapors”</p></li><li><p>“Why flints do break upon a soft thing sooner than a hard one”</p></li><li><p>“Why does water freeze first &amp; most next the Air”</p></li></ul><p>-- but in between these very physical questions are questions of much grander scope, like:</p><ul><li><p>Whether the soul is immortal</p></li><li><p>What the first matter would have consisted of</p></li><li><p>“Whether Moses his saying in Gen the 1st that the evening &amp; the morning were the first day etc. do prove that God created time.”</p></li></ul><div><p><span>It feels weird to read these intertwined, since they seem like very different kinds of question to us. But this is only because we know that the physical questions are answerable in terms of science (because we have pretty good answers to them now -- often thanks to Newton!), and the second type of question isn’t, at least as far as we know. </span></p><p><span>But it’s possible that from Newton’s perspective, both of these kind of questions were </span><em>equally</em><span> mysterious, and for all he knew he could find answers to </span><em>both</em><span> kinds by trying really hard! [3] Before Newton, maybe people were </span><em>more</em><span> confident about the theological questions – (“yes, obviously the soul is immortal”) – than about the physical kind – (“well, I have no idea what makes the planets move!”). Newton made the mysterious banal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>5.</strong></p><p><span>Another thing I’m struck by, in puzzles, is the role of </span><em>really wanting to know the answer.</em><span> You might say, facetiously, that a scientist is someone who really wants to know the answer, to a degree that is pathological (and maladaptive) to a normal person. (Elsewhere I referred to this trait as the ‘</span><a href="https://nabeelqu.co/understanding" rel="">will to think</a><span>’, after Shockley).</span></p><p><span>Complacency afflicts us all, to some extent. Solving chess puzzles makes this blindingly clear, because how good you are at them is inversely related to how complacent you are. Our brains want to stop thinking as soon as possible, probably because thinking hard takes up </span><em>a lot of energy</em><span> and if you didn’t curb that impulse… well, you’d get a very impractical scientist or a mathematician, who spent all their time lost in thought. For most of us, you have to </span><em>actively fight</em><span> complacency, which comes in the form of “yeah this answer seems good enough”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There’s a striking passage in Jonathan Rowson’s book “</span><a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Chess-Zebras-Thinking-Differently-about/dp/1901983854" rel="">Chess for Zebras</a><span>” where he’s tutoring a student on a puzzle. The student gets the ideas in the puzzle, but doesn’t quite make the leap to the answer. The tutor gets frustrated, because he knows the student </span><em>can</em><span> get to the answer (paraphrased):&nbsp;</span></p></div><blockquote><div><p><span>Tutor: No. You were sort of right about shortcomings. You see this position is about problem-solving, as most chess is. You have to be really persistent if you want to get somewhere...</span></p><p><span>[Student says something about needing to improve on board vision]</span></p><p><span>Tutor: Well, to be honest, I think you have that. You can see that White has more space, the better bishop, etc. And you can see that you need to get the king in ... thus far you are up there with the best. You also notice that Bxg6 is an issue. </span></p><p><span>Student: But it’s how to do it! </span></p><p><span>Me: Well that’s what we are on about here. </span><strong>What stops you, I think, is a combination of not really believing you’ll get it and not really caring. Is that too harsh – or is it somewhere close to the truth?</strong></p></div></blockquote><div><p><span>Complacency hits especially hard in king and pawn endgames, when king moves that seem “good enough” can in fact be losing or drawing, and you really have to calculate each and every move very exactly to figure out a win. You have to be </span><em>unreasonably thorough</em><span> and check every single move, to a degree that seems quite pedantic. [4]</span></p><p><span>I notice this in people who are good at science, too: they are really, really thorough and check every edge case.</span></p><p><span>This tendency can, again, be maladaptive in some context. I’ve noticed that sometimes good scientists have trouble when cast into more CEO-like / founder-like roles, including things like:</span></p></div><ul><li><p>Going down ‘rabbit holes’, i.e. getting super interested in one particular aspect of the business to the exclusion of all else</p></li><li><p>Difficulty in making themselves interested in “less interesting” problems (e.g. sales, operations), resulting in e.g. mismanagement of finances because they weren’t willing to get into the weeds of the ‘boring’ area</p></li><li><p>Wanting more information before making a decision than it’s possible to really get and moving too slowly as a result</p></li></ul><div><p><span>I think this is a consequence of what I’ll call “scientist-brain” vs. “founder-brain”. (Yes, I’m generalizing, many exceptions exist and it’s not this clean in real life.)</span></p><p><span>Scientist-brain is unreasonably thorough and wants to check every single case; is very curious about things and willing to follow that curiosity, but doesn’t have a natural check on this process; and prefers working on things that are interesting to them, finding it extremely painful if this is not the case. This is </span><em>great</em><span> when you are doing science, because you need the ‘driver’ to be curiosity, and small details matter. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But it’s often bad in CEO or founder type roles, where you often need to move fast, decide based on imperfect information, maintain context on 10+ workstreams including sometimes intellectually boring ones, and above all not go down rabbit holes unless they’re super critical to the business. The tragedy of CEO roles is that you’re often not spending much time on the most interesting things at all.</span></p><p><span>(This is also why CEOs/founders want you to be terse in communication and give them the bottom line up front. CEOs are holding so much in their heads already that unnecessary details have a high marginal cost.)</span></p><p><span>Again, these are very, very broad generalizations! And there are some very successful scientist-founders. But I think these are two very different archetypes, and paired together they often make a stellar team.</span></p><p><strong>6.</strong></p><p><span>Chess players usually end up converging on a consistent thought process for every move. [5] Thought process is useful, and it’s often helpful to have a laundry list of these techniques to apply to the problem at hand. But it’s not as if giving you the thought process is magically going to lead you to the right answer.</span></p><p><span>One constraint you run up against hard when doing chess puzzles is</span><strong> </strong><span>working memory. The more context you have to hold in your head, the harder it is to make more calculations. </span></p><p><span>Once, frustrated by my accuracy rate, I decided to allow myself to use a scratch Google Docs page to record all my calculations, as an exercise. My accuracy shot up; I rarely got anything wrong. Being able to write things down freed up ‘mental scratchpad’ space, which made my calculations more accurate overall, and made it easier to check I hadn’t missed anything. [6]</span></p><p><span>I’m pretty sure people who are great at chess have better working memory than people who aren’t. And it seems like working memory is innate and fixed, though I’d welcome any counter-evidence. [7]&nbsp;Indeed, Adams and Hurtado find that grandmasters have better intuition and identify the right answer very quickly; they calculate far quicker and more accurately than amateurs; in general, it seems that visualizing and thinking far ahead is much easier for them than the amateurs, the result of thousands of hours of practice and probably innate talent. I think this is clearly true of math too: more gifted people traverse the maze faster, and seem to have a preternatural instinct for what’s going to turn out to be a blind alley versus what’s not. </span></p><p><span>I’ve always been struck by Jonathan Rowson’s account of playing Grischuk, a super-grandmaster, and analyzing the game together with him afterwards:</span></p></div><blockquote><p><span>During the post-mortem I was deeply impressed by the fluency and depth of his analysis, and the sense of balance in his assessment of positions. To be honest, it left me feeling a little deflated. </span><strong>It was abundantly clear to me that he was a different class of player. I could perhaps compete with him in a single game, but not in the long haul.</strong><span> There aren’t many players I feel that way about, but Morozevich made the same impression, and to a lesser extent, Kasimdzhanov, Aronian and Sutovsky. </span><strong>There are some players who just seem to function a few orders of magnitude higher – as if they are qualitatively stronger, speaking a different language. </strong><span>(Jonathan Rowson, Chess for Zebras)</span></p></blockquote><div><p><span>Some people are just different. [8] Still: lean into what you’re good at, practice, and you can always get better!</span></p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>Anyway, there are other lessons that I didn’t go into here, because I don’t want to spoil the entire book(s). Needless to say, they contain many excellent hacks for problem-solving. So if all of this piqued your interest, I’d highly recommend:</span></p><p><span>Think Like A Super-GM, Adams and Hurtado (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Super-GM-Michael-Adams/dp/1784831670" rel="">Amazon</a><span>)</span><br><span>Problem Solving Through Problems, Larson (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Through-Problems-Problem-Mathematics/dp/0387961712" rel="">Amazon</a><span>)</span><br><span>Think Like A Grandmaster, Kotov (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Grandmaster-Alexander-Kotov/dp/0713478853" rel="">Amazon</a><span>)</span><br><span>How To Solve It, Polya (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It" rel="">Wikipedia</a><span>)</span><br><span>Chess for Zebras, Jonathan Rowson (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chess-Zebras-Thinking-Jonathan-Rowson/dp/191146583X" rel="">Amazon</a><span>)</span></p><p><em><span>Thanks to </span><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/" rel="">Tyler Cowen</a><span> for feedback on a draft.&nbsp;</span><br></em><span> </span><br><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p><span>[1] In online chess games, a nice hack to make this easier for yourself is to flip the board to the opponent’s perspective when you’re trying to decide if a move works or not.

A 4 is just 2*2 (and 2+2) so the solution won’t involve any 4s, and anything larger than 4 is going to be too big. </span></p><p><span>It’s easy – but wrong – to guess from this that the maximizing answer is probably either 3^333 + 1, or 2^500. You can then go down a rabbit hole to figure out which one is bigger, or use a calculator and find that it’s 3^333+1. </span><em>Complacency</em><span> would stop here and conclude that that’s probably the answer.</span></p><p><span>But it’s not! It’s helpful to work out some smaller examples first, such as 10:</span></p></div><ul><li><p>5+4+1 = 10, and 5*4*1 = 20</p></li><li><p>4+3+2+1 = 10, and the product is 24</p></li><li><p>3+3+2+2 = 10, and the product is 36</p></li></ul><div><p><span> Clearly,&nbsp;</span><em>the right answer never contains a 1</em><span>. So revisiting the 3^333 + 1 answer, the ‘next’ solution would be 3^332 + 2^2, which is indeed the correct answer.</span></p><p><span>[5] When doing a puzzle, you’re typically told to examine </span><em>checks, captures and threats</em><span> first -- in that order.</span></p><p><span>The Russian chess player Alexander Kotov wrote a famous book, Think Like a Grandmaster, which he outlines a more general thought process for every move and introduces the concept of </span><strong>the candidate move</strong><span> -- essentially, a plausible move in the position. His point is that you should list out all candidate moves first, before going into analysis of each one. Amateurs tend to find an interesting-looking move, and then dive in and analyze it, but it’s best to list all the plausible moves first so that you have an organized list of all the possibilities. </span></p><p><span>Larson has a similar set of techniques for math problems too. Unlike chess, it’s hard to have a consistent thought process for all math problems because they’re so different, so these lists tend to look more like a bunch of useful hacks: search for a pattern, draw a figure, modify the problem, choose good notation, consider extreme cases, and so on.</span></p><p><span>[6] Hence the GTD recommendation to write everything down: “your mind is for having ideas, not holding them”. </span></p><p><span>[7] </span><a href="https://gwern.net/dnb-faq#n-back-in-general" rel="">Gwern’s review of dual n-back</a><span> is interesting here, but as far as I can tell the conclusion is that it’s unclear whether this has any real benefit to working memory.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>[8] When you watch interviews with grandmasters about Magnus Carlsen, they usually identify a few traits of his that make him exceptional. </span></p><p><span>One of these is his insane chess memory (see </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC1BAcOzHyY&amp;t=105s" rel="">this YouTube video</a><span> for a vivid demonstration of this). Clearly, it’s the result of many hours and days of hard work. But there’s also some innate thing going on here. </span></p><p><span>Another is his chess intuition, which is chess player speak for “a disturbing knack for getting the right answer without any apparent effort, at sub-second speed”. There’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1SCXb2WA2U" rel="">a great video showing this at work here</a><span> -- most players end up memorizing these endgames, but Magnus doesn’t, he works them out on the spot. At one point, he makes a very weird-looking move, the interviewer asks him why he made it, and Magnus says “That wins because, well honestly I don't know.” Similarly, at around 15:00, the interviewer asks if Magnus found the solution using the ‘key squares’ concept -- which most GMs would study explicitly -- and Magnus says in effect: no, it’s obvious to him on sight.</span></p><p><span>Another is that he’s insanely competitive, wants to win, and doesn’t get tired or let up even in extremely boring positions. </span></p><p><span>I’m sure he cultivates all of these things. But I’m also pretty sure they’re innate.</span></p></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Meta tracks in detail the activity of users of its Facebook and Instagram platforms. Users are profiled based on where they are, what type of content they show interest in and what they publish, amongst others. These personal profiles are used for marketing purposes – so called behavioural advertising. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that the practice of Meta is illegal and is therefore imposing a temporary ban of behavioural advertising on Facebook and Instagram.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ban</h2>
<p>In&nbsp;December last year, the Irish Data Protection Commission issued a decision on behalf of all data protection authorities across the EEA which established that Meta has conducted illegal behavioural advertising. Since then, Meta has made certain changes, but <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-07/cp230113en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fresh decision from the Court of Justice of the European Union (curia.europa.eu)</a> has stated that Meta’s behavioural advertising still does not comply with the law. Therefore, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority is now taking action by imposing a temporary ban.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;ban will apply from 4 August and last for three months, or until Meta can show that it complies with the law. Should Meta not comply with the decision, the company risks a coercive fine of up to one million NOK per day. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s decision only applies to users in Norway.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The platforms can still operate in Norway</h2>
<p>Many people in Norway use and enjoy social media – <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/publication/documents/2023-04/Ipsos%20SoMe-tracker%20Q1%202023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">figures from Ipsos (ipsos.com)</a> show that 82% of the adult Norwegian population have Facebook accounts and 65% have Instagram accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s decision does not ban Facebook or Instagram in Norway. The purpose is rather to ensure that people in Norway can use these services in a secure way and that their rights are safeguarded, says Head of International in the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, Tobias Judin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Norwegian Data Protection Authority does not ban personalised advertising on Facebook or Instagram as such. The decision does not for example stop Meta from targeting advertising based on information a user put in their bio, such as place of residence, gender and age, or based on interests a user has provided themselves. Nor does the decision stop Meta from showing behavioural advertising to users who have given valid consent to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- All business models must respect privacy as a human right. Users must have sufficient control over their own data, and any tracking must be limited, Judin says.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Behavioural advertising one of the largest risks to privacy</h2>
<p>Meta, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, holds vast amounts of data on Norwegians, including sensitive data. Many Norwegians spend a lot of time on these platforms, and therefore tracking and profiling can be used to paint a detailed picture of these people’s private life, personality and interests. Many people interact with content such as that related to health, politics and sexual orientation, and there is also a danger that this is indirectly used to target marketing to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Invasive commercial surveillance for marketing purposes is one of the biggest risks to data protection on the internet today, Judin says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Meta decides what adverts someone is shown, they also decide what not to show someone. This affects freedom of expression and freedom of information in society. There is a risk that behavioural advertising strengthens existing stereotypes or could lead to unfair discrimination of various groups. Behavioural targeting of political adverts in election campaigns is particularly problematic from a democratic perspective.</p>
<p>As tracking is hidden from view, most people find it difficult to understand. There are also are many vulnerable people who use Facebook and Instagram that need extra protection such as children, the elderly and people with cognitive disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>European co-operation and the way forward</h2>
<p>As Meta has its European headquarters in Dublin, it is normally the Irish Data Protection Commission that supervises the company in the EEA. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority can nevertheless intervene directly against Meta when there is an urgent need to act, and in such cases we can issue a decision which is valid for a period of three months. We consider that the criteria for acting urgently in this case are fulfilled, in particular because Meta has recently received both a decision and a judgment against them to which they have not aligned themselves with. If we don’t intervene now, the data protection rights of the majority of Norwegians would be violated indefinitely.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we may take the matter to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), of which we are a member, after the summer. The EDPB will decide whether the decision may be extended beyond its initial three month validity period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meta has expressed its views in relation to the case, and the company disagrees with our assessments. Meta can decide to challenge the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s decision in the Oslo District Court.</p>

If they sent you a certificate you don't know if that's an attackers certificate or the owner's certificate.</p><p>The CA system is a (very imperfect) method of verifying ownership by having a trusted third party do the ownership verification. This way the certificate the owner gives you is effectively "notarized" so to speak.</p><p>tl;dr - DNS has no built-in signing or encryption, and is "MiTM'd" by design. It's common practice for your DNS server to be set to your company's DNS server, your ISP, etc. And those can send any response they want, and you have no way to authenticate if it's been modified or not.
