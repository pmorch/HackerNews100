<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_148">
<p>We all know that homeopathy is a placebo therapy: its assumptions fly in the face of science, its remedies are normally devoid of active ingredients, and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Homeopathy-Undiluted-Including-Comprehensive-Z/dp/3319435906/?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the evidence from clinical trials is uniformly negative</a>. After the UK and France, now even Germany, homeopathy’s home country, agrees with this position. The <a href="https://edzardernst.com/2024/05/wow-the-german-medical-association-bans-homeopathy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">128th ‘German Medical Assembly’ recently declared that</a>:</p>
<p><em>“the use of homeopathy … is not an option that is compatible with rational medicine, the requirement for the best possible treatment and an appropriate understanding of medical responsibility and medical ethics”.</em></p>
<p>But such arguments fail to deter homeopaths. They argue that there are plenty of clinical trials of homeopathy that arrived at positive conclusions. And to be fair, they are not even entirely wrong. There have been <a href="https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2046-4053-3-142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several studies that did imply that homeopathy works beyond placebo</a>.<sup> &nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>How come? Why do some studies of homeopathy show positive results? The obvious answer is because these studies are not rigorous; they are not randomised, or not double blind, or not placebo-controlled, for instance. But this assumption might also not be entirely true.</p>
<p>In 2020, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33010094/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frass et al published a trial that seemed to prove it wrong</a>. This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study showed that the quality of life of cancer patients improved significantly with homeopathy compared to placebo. In addition, survival was significantly longer in the homeopathy group versus placebo and control.</p>
<p>When it was first published, this study was celebrated by homeopaths, while it raised many skeptics’ eyebrows. The trial seemed rigorous, was published in a highly reputed journal, and was conducted by well-known experts. Its lead author, Michael Frass, was a respected professor at the Vienna Medical School (the institution to which I too once belonged).</p>
<p>When I first read his paper, <a href="https://edzardernst.com/2020/10/homeopathy-prolongs-survival-of-lung-cancer-patients-can-it-be-true/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I was nevertheless suspicious</a>, not least because I had previously found that Frass (whom I have never met in person) had published <a href="https://edzardernst.com/2015/11/prof-frass-remarkable-studies-of-homeopathy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no less than 12 studies of homeopathy all of which arrived at positive conclusions</a>. This had long led me to the conclusion that there must be something wrong with Frass’ research.</p>
<p>I was therefore not surprised that, soon after the publication of Frass’ new trial, an in-depth analysis by Norbert Aust and Viktor Weisshäupl <a href="https://edzardernst.com/2021/06/a-thorough-analysis-of-prof-m-frass-recent-homeopathy-trial-casts-serious-doubts-on-its-reliability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disclosed several important inconsistencies</a>. They eventually prompted complaints to both the journal, Oncologist, and the Vienna Medical School about suspected scientific misconduct. The Medical School then referred the case to the Austrian Agency for Scientific Integrity. The agency took their time, but recently, more that 3 years after the Frass study was published, they made available the&nbsp;final on-line summary of their assessment; here is <a href="https://oeawi.at/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jahresbericht-Kommission-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my translation of part of this document</a>:</p>
<p><em>After establishing sufficient suspicion of various violations of good scientific practice, the Commission declared itself responsible and initiated proceedings. In the course of this, the principal investigator was given the opportunity to submit a written statement and to provide the Commission for Research Integrity Annual Report 2022 material that would help to clarify the facts of the case, which the accused submitted in large quantities.</em></p>
<p><em>In a very complex, comprehensive investigation, which required, among other things, the on-site inspection of original documents, the Commission was able to substantiate the suspicion of data falsification, fabrication and manipulation. In a final statement, the study director, who no longer works for the university in question, and the numerous co-authors were informed in detail about the course and results of the commission’s investigation and informed of the recommendations to the university and journal.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The Commission recommended that the university concerned should consider investigating its own responsibilities and act accordingly, and that the publication should be withdrawn as a matter of urgency. The journal responsible for the publication was asked to withdraw the publication on the basis of the findings of the investigation.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the scandal does not end here. Despite the Agency’s urgent call to the journal to withdraw the fabricated study, this has still not happened. Merely <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9732219/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an ‘expression of concern’ has been added to the paper on Medline</a>. It has been up for many months and reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>This is an Expression of Concern regarding: Michael Frass, Peter Lechleitner, Christa Gründling, Claudia Pirker, Erwin Grasmuk-Siegl, Julian Domayer, Maximilian Hochmair, Katharina Gaertner, Cornelia Duscheck, Ilse Muchitsch, Christine Marosi, Michael Schumacher, Sabine Zöchbauer-Müller, Raj K. Manchanda, Andrea Schrott, Otto Burghuber, Homeopathic Treatment as an Add-On Therapy May Improve Quality of Life and Prolong Survival in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Prospective, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Three-Arm, Multicenter Study,&nbsp;The Oncologist, Volume 25, Issue 12, December 2020, Pages e1930–e1955,&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13548</a></em></p>
<p><em>In August 2022, the journal editors received credible information from the Austrian Agency for Research Integrity about potential data falsification and data manipulation in this article. While&nbsp;The Oncologist&nbsp;editorial team investigates and communicates with the corresponding author, the editors are publishing this Expression of Concern to alert readers that, pending the outcome and review of a full investigation, the research results presented may not be reliable.</em></p>
<p>Consequently vulnerable cancer patients might still be misled by the fake findings of Frass and colleagues.</p>
<p>The sorry story of Frass and his research illustrates some of the fundamental problems with research into homeopathy in particular, and alternative medicine in general. Sadly, scientific fraud is not uncommon in medicine.&nbsp;In conventional medicine, financial interests are often the driving force. This situation is very different in the field of alternative medicine, where ideological conflicts dominate.</p>
<p>To put it into a nutshell: researchers in this field tend to initiate studies primarily because they want to prove that their favourite therapy is effective. By not honestly testing their hypotheses, but dishonestly trying to prove them, they abuse research. This enables people like Frass to publish one positive result for homeopathy after another. On my blog, I summarise this growing group of people in the satirically named ‘<a href="https://edzardernst.com/2024/02/richard-c-niemtzow-inventor-of-the-battle-field-acupuncture-enters-the-alternative-medicine-hall-of-fame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE HALL OF FAME</a>‘. It currently includes 24 (pseudo)scientists, 6 of whom specialise in researching homeopathy.</p>
<p>This could all be quite amusing but, of course, it is also very serious. Scientific fraud causes considerable damage. In the case of the Frass study, we even have to ask ourselves how many people’s lives it has shortened. Therefore, we should look for ways to minimise this phenomenon.</p>
<p>This would certainly not be an easy task, and there is no patent remedy for achieving it. In the field of alternative medicine, I have long advocated that researchers like Michael Frass, who produce nothing but implausible results that mislead us all, <a href="https://edzardernst.com/2012/11/the-trustworthiness-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should be barred from receiving public research funding</a>. This, one might hope, would stop at least some of the chronically deluded pseudoscientists of alternative medicine.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">On July 4, YouTube released an updated eraser tool for creators so they can easily remove any copyrighted music from their videos without affecting any other audio such as dialog or sound effects.</p>

<p>YouTube chief Neal Mohan posted about the tool on X and said, “Good news, creators: our updated Erase Song tool helps you easily remove copyright-claimed music from your video (while leaving the rest of your audio intact).”</p>

<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good news creators: our updated Erase Song tool helps you easily remove copyright-claimed music from your video (while leaving the rest of your audio intact). Learn more… <a rel="nofollow" href="https://t.co/KeWIw3RFeH">https://t.co/KeWIw3RFeH</a></p>— Neal Mohan (@nealmohan) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/nealmohan/status/1808587459132825844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p>In the video, the company said that it had been testing the eraser tool for a while, but it wasn’t as accurate in removing a copyrighted song. It noted that the new tool uses an AI-powered algorithm to specifically detect and remove that song without impacting other audio in the clip.</p>

	
	


<figure></figure>

<p>On its <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2902117?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">support page</a>, YouTube still warns that, at times, the algorithm might fail to remove just the song. </p>

	
	


<p>“This edit might not work if the song is hard to remove. If this tool doesn’t successfully remove the claim on a video, you can try other editing options, such as muting all sound in the claimed segments or trimming out the claimed segments,” the company said. </p>

<p>Alternatively, creators can choose to select “Mute all sound in the claimed segments” to silence bits of video that possibly has copyrighted material. Once the creator successfully edits the video, YouTube removes the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/youtube-changes-its-content-id-appeals-process/">content ID claim</a> — the company’s system for identifying the use of copyrighted content in different clips.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-cc3220de=""><p><strong>UUID</strong>s are often used as database table <strong>primary keys</strong>. They are easy to generate, easy to share between distributed systems and guarantee uniqueness.</p><p>Considering the size of UUID it is questionable if it is a right choice, but often it is not up to us to decide.</p><p>This article does not focus on "<em>if UUID is the right format for a key</em>", but how to use <strong>UUID</strong> as a primary key with <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> efficiently.</p><hr><h2 id="postgres-data-types-for-uuid" tabindex="-1">Postgres Data Types for UUID <a href="#postgres-data-types-for-uuid" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Postgres Data Types for UUID&quot;">​</a></h2><p>UUID can be seen as a string and it may be tempting to store them as such. Postgres has a flexible data type for storing strings: <code>text</code> and it is often used as a primary key to store UUID values.</p><p>Is it a right data type? Definitely not.</p><p>Postgres has a dedicated data type for UUIDs: <code>uuid</code>. UUID is a 128 bit data type, so storing single value takes 16 bytes. <code>text</code> data type has 1 or 4 bytes overhead plus storing the actual string.</p><p>These differences are not that important in small tables, but become an issue once you start storing hundreds of thousands or millions of rows.</p><p>I run an experiment to see what is the difference in practice. There are two tables that have just one column - an <code>id</code> as a primary key.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dynomight.net/centuries/">https://dynomight.net/centuries/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40884356">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Here’s a sentence from Steven Pinker’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Now">Enlightenment Now</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Enlightenment is conventionally placed in the last two-thirds of the 18th century, though it flowed out of the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Reason in the 17th century and spilled into the heyday of classical liberalism in the first half of the 19th.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s try an experiment. I’m going to give you a question, which you should try to answer as quickly as you can. Ready? OK: Did the American revolution happen <em>before</em>, <em>during</em>, or <em>after</em> the Enlightenment?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join,_or_Die"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/centuries/Join-or-Die.svg" alt="join or die" title="Happy 4th of July BTW"></a></p>

<p>Now, suppose the above sentence had been written like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Enlightenment is conventionally placed in the last two-thirds of the 1700s, though it flowed out of the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Reason in the 1600s and spilled into the heyday of classical liberalism in the first half of the 1800s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prudence of copy-editing the guy who wrote your <a href="https://dynomight.net/2021/02/07/writing-as-a-craft/#steven-pinker-the-sense-of-style-2014">favorite book on writing</a> is debatable. But still—if you’re like me, you’ll find the question much easier to answer given the second version of the sentence, because you remember the American revolution as starting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">1776</a>, not in <em>the 76th year of the 18th century</em>.</p>

<p>The issue, of course, is that “counted centuries” are off by one from how we normally interact with dates—the <em>13</em>th century starts in AD <em>12</em>01.</p>

<p>There’s a simple solution. Avoid saying “the 18th century”, and say “the 1700s” instead. Besides being easier to understand, it’s also slightly shorter.</p>

<p>And—what’s that? Do I see an objection in the back?</p>

<h2 id="they-arent-the-same">They aren’t the same!</h2>

<p>Yes, yes, I know. Technically speaking:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Period</th>
      <th>First Day</th>
      <th>Last Day</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The 18th century</td>
      <td>1 Jan 1701</td>
      <td>31 Dec 1800</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The 1700s</td>
      <td>1 Jan 1700</td>
      <td>31 Dec 1799</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>They’re different. But if the difference matters and you really want “the 18th century”, then you might want to spell out the dates explicitly. Because are you sure the person you’re talking to knows the above table? And are you sure that they will be sure that <em>you</em> know?</p>

<p>No one gets confused about what “the 1700s” means.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-the-fancy-people-think">What will the fancy people think?</h2>

<p>People count centuries in formal writing, and I don’t suggest you buck this convention too hard. If you’re writing a legal brief for the US Supreme Court, go ahead and count centuries for now.</p>

<p>But take an analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I saw someone in the distance. They seemed to be following me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the 1970s, fancy people would have sniffed at using “they” rather than “he” for a single person of unknown sex like this. But today, fancy people would sniff at <em>not</em> doing that. How did that happen?</p>

<p>I think “they” climbed the prestige ladder—people slowly adopted it in gradually more formal and higher-status situations until it was everywhere.</p>

<p>That’s all that’s needed for language to evolve. When people <em>can</em> easily switch, they should go ahead and do it.</p>

<h2 id="arent-decades-vs-centuries-ambiguous">Aren’t decades vs centuries ambiguous?</h2>

<p>If someone says “the 2000s”, does that mean:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The 2000-2009 decade?</li>
  <li>The 2000-2099 century?</li>
  <li>(The 2000-2999 millennium?)</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this is the strongest objection. To deal with it, I suggest a convention that trailing zeros are ranges.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1490s means 1490-1499.</li>
  <li>1500s means 1500-1599.</li>
</ul>

<p>This leaves ambiguous how to refer to decades like 1800-1809. For these you should <del>specify the wildcard digits as “the 180*s”</del> manually write out the range. Please do not write “the 181st decade”.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>People will usually intuit the above convention without it being explained. The exception is if you say something like “the 1790s” (meaning 1790-1799) and “the 1800s” (meaning 1800-1899) in close proximity. If you need to do this, just write out one of the ranges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to refer to 2001-2100, it’s probably OK to write “the 21st century”, because people will mentally translate this into “the current century” without doing any math. Disregard if you are 76 or more years in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no good way to refer to 2000-2009, sorry.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Engine:</strong> PICO-8</li>
  <li><strong>Time Spent:</strong> 4 days (June 27th - June 30th)</li>
  <li><strong>Other Stuff:</strong> I built this game at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, a magical place that functions like a writers retreat for programmers. Consider applying!</li>

<h2 id="high-level-thoughts">High level thoughts</h2>
<p>This game is tiny! It takes 45 seconds, has no ambitions to be longer, and is based on a joke. I love it.</p>

<p>After the UI complexity and lack of a theme in <a href="https://eieio.games/game-diary/game-5-reshape-td">ReShape</a> it was refreshing to make something so limited. The scope of the game was perfect for learning a bit about the PICO-8 (and the PICO-8 probably pushed me to make a game of this scope, which is also great).</p>

<p>I think the gameplay itself is…fine? It’s kinda hard, but not that hard, and the strong theme + short length means that you’re probably gonna finish the game if you start it. This is the most arcadey game that I’ve built and it’s been really fun to get messages from friends with their high scores. At the time of writing the high score from a friend is 21 (mine is 26 but that was a freak accident).</p>

<p>This is also my first <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a> game! I loved some parts of the PICO-8 experience and did not like some of the others. But on the whole I’m happy that I gave it a try and I’m excited to make some more PICO-8 games this year.</p>

<h2 id="wait-the-pico-what">Wait, the PICO-what?</h2>
<p>A tl;dr of the PICO-8: it’s a “fantasy console<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>” with restrictions on graphics, sound, code size, and processor speed that mimic the consoles of the 80s. You can create sprites/music/sound effects and write code straight from the console.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/dvdlogo/comfypico.png" alt=""></p><p> A comfy little PICO-8 terminal </p>
    
</div>

<p>The tools that the PICO-8 gives you are pleasantly simple but also primitive relative to modern game engines; if you want collision or particle effects you’re gonna have to manually handle collision on a pixel-by-pixel basis and <a href="https://trasevol.dog/2017/04/04/doodle-insights-11-particles/">draw your particles by hand</a>. This simplicity is the point - constraints breed creativity and all that. And a fun side effect of these limitations is that PICO-8 games have a distinct and relatively consistent feel.</p>

<p>The most well-known PICO-8 game is likely the original version of <a href="https://www.celestegame.com/">Celeste</a>, which was made in the PICO-8 for a gamejam. The PICO-8 version of Celeste is playable as an easter egg in the real game! Check it out if you haven’t.</p>


<p>The PICO-8 comes with some built in tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A sprite editor. I found myself missing Aseprite a bit, but being able to edit sprites directly from the PICO was great! I may try using Asperite with the PICO in the future but it’s not a sure thing.</li>
  <li>A sound effect editor. I found the editor wildly unintuitive until I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwFcitLtCsA">this Gruber video</a> and then got the hang of it pretty quickly. It’s neat and I’m excited to play with it again.</li>
  <li>A music editor. I am too used to playing the keyboard to find it super pleasant, but the editor is relatively intuitive (and would be hard to swap out with how the PICO does music).</li>
  <li>A code editor that I absolutely cannot stand oh my goodness<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/dvdlogo/pico-editor.png" alt=""></p><p> The lines don't get longer if you make the editor wider. The font just grows. </p>
    
</div>

<p>Fortunately to swap out the code editor I just:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PollywogGames.pico8-ls">pico8-ls</a> extension for vscode, which gave me nice syntax highlighting and an API reference.</li>
  <li>Changed the code in my main pico8 file to just be <code>include code.pb</code> and wrote all of my code in <code>code.pb</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Step 2 is necessary because the PICO-8 stores sprite / music data in the same file that it stores code - I didn’t want to be editing the same file from vscode and the PICO-8.</p>

<p>I ended up pretty happy with this setup. My only gripe is that I need an easier-to-search PICO-8 language reference; <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html">this manual</a> is hard to search because there’s no way to limit your search to, say, just function names.</p>

<h2 id="the-pico-8-environment-vibes">The PICO-8 environment: vibes</h2>
<p>It felt super natural to ship a game this small on the PICO-8. I loved that!</p>

<p>During development I considered all sorts of extensions - for example, maybe you could collect tokens that gave you more time, or you could upgrade your TV / your DVD logo to make it easier to score points, or maybe there could be enemies that were trying to bump the logo. Maybe this game was actually meant to be a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/">Vampire Survivors</a> clone!</p>

<p>And I think if I was writing in Godot I might have given into more of those impulses (or at least tried them out). This game is so simple! Games are meant to have decisions and complexity and choices! It’d be silly to put the game up on itch in this state!</p>

<p>But the PICO-8 is so simple that it felt totally natural to ship this game as-is; I felt as though the simplicity of the console gave me permission to do something simple. Of course I’ve always had that permission. But sometimes it’s nice to have a push.</p>

<p>I’m excited to revisit the PICO-8 and that push is a big reason why.</p>

<h2 id="its-great-to-have-a-theme-again">It’s great to have a theme again</h2>
<p>As a game <em>player</em> I sometimes skip through themes to get to mechanics. As a kid I’d skip cutscenes; I’ve played hundreds of hours of <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/">Path of Exile</a> but absolutely cannot explain the story. This isn’t always true - my favorite game is <em>easily</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a> and that’s as much due to the story as the mechanics - but it’s often true.</p>

<p>And so when <em>making</em> games I sometimes talk myself into thinking that a theme isn’t that important. This was certainly true with <a href="https://eieio.games/game-diary/game-5-reshape-td">ReShape TD</a> and probably also with <a href="https://eieio.games/game-diary/game-4-click-click-trick-ppjjgg">click, click, trick</a>. Both games have some neat mechanics but it’s hard to explain what the games are <em>about.</em></p>

<p>“Put the DVD Logo in the Corner” is the exact opposite and I think that’s <em>great</em>. There is a single mechanic in this game and it is “make a square land in the corner of a bigger rectangle.” Not a very exciting mechanic! But I’ve had more fun telling folks about this game than anything else I’ve made - and that’s all because of the theme.</p>

<p>I’ll do my best to keep that in mind for future games.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>That’s it! I had a lot of fun making this game and working with the PICO-8. I’m interested in building some more small arcade-feeling games and looking forward to returning to the PICO.</p>

<p>Right now I’m toying with a game that relies entirely on an (ab)use of the <a href="https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch">OpenSearch spec</a> to build something that runs entirely from the Firefox address bar. I’ll probably get back to something more, uh, traditional next.</p>

<p><em>An update from the future (2024-07-05):</em> I ended using OpenSearch to <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/implementing-wordle-in-the-firefox-address-bar/">run Wordle in the Firefox address bar</a>. And I can’t say I’ve made a lot of traditional stuff since then :)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
In 1968, at the first NATO Software Engineering conference, the term "software crisis" was coined.

These conferences were pivotal moments in computing history, as they were some of the first efforts to pin down and codify the current practices in programming automatic computing machines.

On July 16th, 1969, the Apollo 11 mission launched, sporting some of the most advanced engineering practices known at the time. The last NATO Software Engineering conference was held in October of the same year.

I can imagine enthusiastic conversations about guidance control, redundancy, and general speculation around how the Apollo program's approach to constructing programs worked.

In his 1972 Turing Award lecture, Edsger Dijkstra made clear the perceived cause of the software crisis: an increase in computing hardware complexity and speed, without the organizational methods to address the growing complexity of software that utilized this hardware.

</p><p>
The term "software crisis" isn't featured much in current conversation around programming practices. We generally think we've "figured it out", with some minor difficulties that are deemed "essential" or "tolerable".

Time and distance from the "problems of the past", along with the development of new languages and organizational methods, has pushed us into a state of comfort. Our ecosystems are teeming with life and new software.

</p><p>
We've figured it out by now, right?

<i>Right?</i>
</p><p>

It seems as if this state of comfort is due to a sense of defeat and acceptance, rather than of a true, genuine comfort. We peer endlessly at the machines in front of us, and we establish mental models for their inner workings.

From seasoned programmers and technology enthusiasts to the passively invested users of technology, we form shortcuts, abstract models that allow us to avoid thinking about the millions of moving parts that make up the things we use.

</p><p>
Very rarely do these models reflect reality.

It's a nice coincidence when they do.

It's catastrophic when they don't.
</p><p>

Various efforts have been made to address pieces of the software crisis, but they all follow the same pattern of "abstract it away". If we sweep the unsavory details into structures we can control, we can achieve some level of "independence" at the cost of performance.

However, <i>much</i> of the early advancements in computing and adjacent fields occurred on machines where building towers of abstraction had a direct cost, and in contexts where that cost couldn't be paid. Every roadblock that was hit was met with a hardware upgrade.

In theory, this is a natural growth cycle. As we learn how to utilize our resources more efficiently, we hit a point where the current restrictions cannot be bypassed, necessitating a hardware upgrade. In practice, we grow hungry for capacity long before we've understood its limitations.

That hunger for ability was slow to grow before the advent of commercialization of personal computing, but companies selling equipment don't make money waiting for their users to master their products. The growth cycle accelerated, and accelerated, and accelerated...

</p><p>
As personal computing grew more popular, and hardware release cycles grew faster, "abstract it away" became the default mode of thinking.

Out of sight, out of mind.
</p><p>

We developed methods of building nested layers of abstractions, hiding information at multiple levels. We took the problem of constructing software and morphed it into towering layers. We integrated these layers into the software required to use our computers, and the software that drives our lives.

The wider software industry accelerated its release cycles and capital influence, bringing about the proverbial death of the individual developer. We lament the easy access to fundamental features of a machine, like graphics and sound. It is no longer easy to build software, and nothing comes with a manual.

If curious developers can no longer build software without scaling mountains, what hope is there for the broader problem? The software crisis doesn't just apply to the profession of building software, but to anybody that uses software. Users have little to no control, save for things afforded to them by the author.

</p><p>
Those who construct software are placed in a unique blind spot. We produce tools that we may not understand the true potential of for decades. We are often caught in fits of creative problem solving, the passion of the craft, or the pressure of peers.

</p><p>
We forget that software construction, just like software usage, is a human activity.
</p><p>

We are separated from the responsibility of the tools that we build. This has been the norm for several decades, with the perceived stakes being lowered as commercialization took hold. We continue reaching for abstraction as a tool to avoid the hard thoughts, and this has bled into how people develop and use software.

When machines were small, and we couldn't afford endless abstractions (unless they were "free"), we knew the cost of sweeping things under the rug. Small inefficiencies added up. There was a <i>limit</i> to how far you could separate yourself from the machine. Newcomers had a low-cost entry point, if they were curious enough.

</p><p>
The water was shallow enough to learn to swim in.
</p><p>

The solution to the software crisis will not be a reversion to more constrained platforms, but a constraint on the number of layers of abstraction we are allowed to apply, as well as the requirement of information preservation between these layers. We must narrow the (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_gap">semantic gap</a>) so that <i>everyone</i> may scale it.

Programming models, user interfaces, and foundational hardware can, <i>and must</i>, be shallow and composable. We must, as a profession, give agency to the users of the tools we produce. Relying on towering, monolithic structures sprayed with endless coats of paint cannot last. We cannot move or reconfigure them without tearing them down.

There have been movements to bring awareness to the software crisis, such as (<a href="https://handmade.network/manifesto">Handmade</a>), (<a href="https://permacomputing.net/Principles/">Permacomputing</a>), and various retro-computing circles. We're starting to realize just how deep in this crisis we are. Counterculture movements are health signals, and a fever is brewing.
</p><p>
Things can be better.

I'll show you how.
</p>

And it's probably not what you think. </p><p>I'm going to define "technical" skills and then make the case that they're everywhere and severely underrated. Handwaving over them allows us to dismiss the work of wide swaths of the population. And noticing them will light up your life and unlock new worlds. </p><p>❧</p><p>The specific moment that forever changed how I saw this came right at the end of the movie Free Solo.

Or a sanitized "making of" montage. But you so rarely get to see <em>what goes into</em> the final work. That's discussed behind closed doors, between practitioners and their coaches, off the record. </p><p>Which is such a shame, because it's so darn <em>interesting</em>. </p><p>For instance, the Steph Curry mystery. He is electric: he's been league MVP twice, lead his team to <em>four</em> championships, and is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">so good at shooting</a> that he's changing the way modern basketball is played. </p><p>The mystery is that he didn't start out that way. Sure, he was good enough to get drafted into the NBA, but he was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-nba-draft?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">drafted seventh—after two other point guards!</a> Even his dad <a href="https://fadeawayworld.net/my-hat-would-say-i-had-no-idea-dell-curry-never-knew-stephen-curry-could-be-this-great?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">didn't see it coming</a>: </p><blockquote>“In Chicago the other day I saw LaMelo Ball's dad at the game wearing a hat that said: I Told You So,” said Dell [Curry], mentioning the bombastic father of LaMelo and Lonzo. </blockquote><blockquote>“Well, my hat would say: I Had No Idea.”</blockquote><p>So how did Steph Curry go from a decent NBA shooter to the best all time? Sure, his dad was a pro, he played from a young age, and he had access to coaches—but so do <em>lots</em> of other players who stayed average, including (sorry, Seth Curry!) his brother. What factors and tactics go into that kind of breakthrough?</p><p>Also consider that movie, Free Solo. I admit, I thought it was going to be a boring movie. It's about an incredibly risky climb, and I already know the ending: he did the climb and he did not die. But reader...I was riveted and my palms were sweaty. How on earth did the filmmakers do that? So many technical elements must have gone into it—pacing, music, graphics, etc—but I can't even point to them, let alone know how to do them myself. </p><p>❧</p><p>In software, we have this tempting verbal shorthand. We find ourselves saying things like "she is really technical" or "he is not a technical manager" or "they didn't pass the technical screen." But we only ever use these terms to refer to some underspecified cluster of computer programming or software engineering skills. And people without these skills are labeled "not technical." </p><p>But if "technical skills" are the skills we use to produce our work (good software) then by extension, <strong><em>every</em> field has "technical" skills. </strong></p><p><strong>They're simply <em>the skills used to produce the work</em>. </strong></p><p>Do you know how to frame the story of your product so it resonates, how to figure out what customers want, where and how to put something in a customer's path, and how to tell if it worked? Marketers do.</p><p>Do you know how to tell if someone is a good prospect, which people to call first, and what words to use when they're giving you the runaround? Sales people do. </p><p>Do you know how to defuse an entrenched argument between coworkers, help a burned out coworker get out of a rut, or tell someone they're not doing a great job without making them furious? Managers do.</p><p>Even something as squishy as <a href="https://hbr.org/2024/02/how-to-become-a-supercommunicator-at-work?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">"good conversationalist" can be broken down into component technical skills</a>, that can then be noticed, admired, emulated, and honed. For instance, great conversationalists know how to: </p><ul><li>prepare before conversations</li><li>ask really good questions</li><li>make others feel heard (note: this not the same thing as "listen accurately")</li><li>handle a conversation partner who doesn't ask you questions back</li></ul><p>Just like any other skill, it's one you can break down into pieces to learn and practice. </p><p>❧</p><p>There are a few major benefits to noticing and unpacking others' technical skill sets. </p><p><strong>It makes your world more colorful</strong></p><p>Seeing great work is nice, but seeing great work <em>and</em> understanding how hard it was to make is sublime. It lets you appreciate the excellent song, jump shot, or sales call at a new level. </p><p>Ignoring the technical skills all around you leads to a duller, more impoverished life. It's simply more interesting to look around with these glasses on. </p><p><strong>It helps you learn</strong></p><p>To learn a new thing you have to know there <em>is</em> something to learn. If you think that being a good conversationalist is something you just weren't born with, why would you ever try to improve? And if you can't see someone else's greatness, why would you ever think to learn it too? </p><p>Noticing new skills is a key component of a <a href="https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">growth mindset</a> and a prerequisite to learning.</p><p><strong>You won't unwittingly reinforce unpleasant power dynamics</strong></p><p>We often dismiss skills that are not societally valued by pretending they are not  skills. Or, sure, maybe they're skills, but they're mysterious and ineffable!</p><p>You reinforce this idea each time you say <strong>"soft skills"</strong> instead of working to enumerate them. Perhaps you mean "interpersonal skills," "leadership skills," or "communication skills." These are all technical skills, and they all have names. </p><p>You're part of this dynamic if you've ever used <strong>strategic incompetence</strong>, which is when you let yourself believe that doing laundry, taking meeting notes, or organizing a birthday card for a coworker are things that some people "are naturally good at" and you are "just not good at." Real talk: no one is born knowing how to do these things. They just figure it out and ship it, and you can too. </p><p>And consider the "maker movement," which, in my most frustrated moments, I call "arts and crafts, but for <em>boys</em>." The "movement" has been careful to highlight its technical skills to position itself apart from similarly technical fields, like sewing. </p><p>You can probably list the "maker" technical skills: electronics, power drilling, cool robots, etc. But can you list the technical skills for sewing? There are a <em>lot</em>. </p><p>Let's look at only structural choices, not even going into aesthetic and design skills. You need to pick the right pattern, then pick the fabric that will work structurally for your particular garment. You need to understand the body you are making it for, and the exact complex 3D shape that will fit and flatter them (which in turn requires a 4D understanding of how they'll move, the physics of gravity, and how all that interplays with your fabric selection). Then you need to set up your sewing machine, an inscrutable piece of technical machinery that comes with mineral oil, a screwdriver, a parts catalog for repairs, and a detailed technical manual with lots of component diagrams. When your thread gets tangled, you need to reason about how the machine works to debug it. Then you need to cut things to exactly the right size and assemble them in the right order, and do it skillfully so they hold together while being worn and washed and otherwise under duress. And there are advanced technical details that make the difference between "where did you get that?" and "oh, did you make that?" </p><p>And if you want to make something out of t-shirt fabric, that's an entirely different set of equipment and techniques—so much so that the majority of sewists avoid it entirely. </p><p>My point is: <strong>sewing is <em>very technical</em>. </strong></p><p>And we can ONLY write sewing off as "just arts and crafts" and unimpressive compared to the Maker movement <em>if we choose to ignore that sewing is very technical. </em></p><p>Likewise, we can ONLY write off marketing, sales, management, design, product, HR, etc etc etc etc as less important because "they're not technical" if we choose to ignore that they are <em>very technical. </em></p><p>This distinction isn't just about semantics. It's also about value. </p><p>Erasing technical skills lets you erase value. </p><h2 id="so-where-does-this-leave-us">So where does this leave us?</h2><p>Please let me know in the comments if you have ideas for terminology options to replace "he is not technical" or "technical skills" when we're really talking about software skills. I got feedback from a few readers that they like this argument, but it <em>was</em> useful shorthand, and now they're sad because they're not sure how to be more specific. Fair! Let's brainstorm some options. </p><p>❧</p><p><em>Thanks to early readers for their encouragement, feedback, and critique, including a Slack user named Angélique, Laura Duane, Nick Seguin, Laura Lindzey, Fabian Tamp, Zach Lipp, Mindy Preston, Adam Kelly, Alex Chen, Stephanie Losi, Aditya Athalye, Emily Vomacka, Erika Rowland, Marilyn Cole, and probably others that I am forgetting now three months after its original writing.
