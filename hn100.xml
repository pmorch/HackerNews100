  <h4 data-block-key="gnu37">Our AI method has accelerated and optimized chip design, and its superhuman chip layouts are used in hardware around the world</h4><p data-block-key="2eiij">In 2020, we released a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10746" rel="noopener" target="_blank">preprint</a> introducing our novel reinforcement learning method for designing chip layouts, which we later <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published in Nature</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google-research/circuit_training" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open sourced</a>.</p><p data-block-key="1qnl3">Today, we’re <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08032-5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">publishing a Nature addendum</a> that describes more about our method and its impact on the field of chip design. We’re also releasing a <a href="https://github.com/google-research/circuit_training/?tab=readme-ov-file#PreTrainedModelCheckpoint" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-trained checkpoint</a>, sharing the model weights and announcing its name: AlphaChip.</p><p data-block-key="93pa">Computer chips have fueled remarkable progress in artificial intelligence (AI), and AlphaChip returns the favor by using AI to accelerate and optimize chip design. The method has been used to design superhuman chip layouts in the last three generations of Google’s custom AI accelerator, the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu?hl=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tensor Processing Unit</a> (TPU).</p><p data-block-key="dg0up">AlphaChip was one of the first reinforcement learning approaches used to solve a real-world engineering problem. It generates superhuman or comparable chip layouts in hours, rather than taking weeks or months of human effort, and its layouts are used in chips all over the world, from data centers to mobile phones.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="isrhj">How AlphaChip works</h2><p data-block-key="6vcl">Designing a chip layout is not a simple task. Computer chips consist of many interconnected blocks, with layers of circuit components, all connected by incredibly thin wires. There are also lots of complex and intertwined design constraints that all have to be met at the same time. Because of its sheer complexity, chip designers have struggled to automate the chip floorplanning process for over sixty years.</p><p data-block-key="4179m">Similar to <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphago/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AlphaGo</a> and <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphazero-and-muzero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AlphaZero</a>, which learned to master the games of Go, chess and shogi, we built AlphaChip to approach chip floorplanning as a kind of game.</p><p data-block-key="6j69d">Starting from a blank grid, AlphaChip places one circuit component at a time until it’s done placing all the components. Then it’s rewarded based on the quality of the final layout. A novel “edge-based” graph neural network allows AlphaChip to learn the relationships between interconnected chip components and to generalize across chips, letting AlphaChip improve with each layout it designs.</p>

  <p data-block-key="gnu37">To design TPU layouts, AlphaChip first practices on a diverse range of chip blocks from previous generations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_on_a_chip" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on-chip and inter-chip network blocks</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_controller" rel="noopener" target="_blank">memory controllers</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data transport buffers</a>. This process is called pre-training. Then we run AlphaChip on current TPU blocks to generate high-quality layouts. Unlike prior approaches, AlphaChip becomes better and faster as it solves more instances of the chip placement task, similar to how human experts do.</p><p data-block-key="blred">With each new generation of TPU, including our latest <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-trillium-6th-gen-tpus" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trillium</a> (6th generation), AlphaChip has designed better chip layouts and provided more of the overall floorplan, accelerating the design cycle and yielding higher-performance chips.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When you turn on your Xbox Series X, open the Microsoft Store, and buy <em>Farming Simulator 22</em>, you might think you own the game, but you’d be wrong. You actually paid for a license to play the game — not to own it. Companies can revoke the license at any time. It doesn’t happen all too often, but it does happen, especially with older games: Ubisoft made headlines earlier this year when it <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/ubisoft-is-stripping-peoples-licences-for-the-crew-weeks-after-its-shutdown-nearly-squandering-hopes-of-private-servers-and-acting-as-a-stark-reminder-of-how-volatile-digital-ownership-is/">delisted racing game <em>The Crew</em> in December</a>, took its servers offline, then started to pull licenses to the game. Licensing vs. actually owning a game becomes an issue, once again, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24172809/steam-games-when-you-die-gog-itchio-estate-planning">when you consider where your games go when you die</a> — you can’t technically pass your license along to another person, per many companies’ policies.</p><p>A new California bill (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2426">AB 2426</a>), signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday, is an attempt to bring transparency to the buying and selling of digital goods like movies, e-books, and, yes, video games. <a href="https://a42.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240916-assemblymember-irwin-urges-governor-sign-legislation-increasing">California assemblymember Jacqui Irwin introduced the bill</a>, in part, after hearing about Ubisoft’s move with <em>The Crew</em>. The law won’t change the fact that we’re all licensing games instead of actually owning them, but it will force companies that operate in California to be more transparent about it. Companies and storefronts that would have to comply include Microsoft with the Microsoft Store, Valve with Steam, Sony with the PlayStation Store, Nintendo with its eShop, and publishers with their own stores, like Ubisoft’s Ubisoft Store.</p><p>Polygon has reached out to all previously listed companies but did not hear back by publication time.</p><p>The law is expected to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2025, preventing companies that operate digital storefronts from using words like “purchase” or “buy” unless the company is clear that it’s selling a license, not “unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good.” This notice will have to be “distinct and separate” from other terms and conditions of the purchase, according to the text. The law doesn’t apply to subscription-based services, free downloads like demos, or companies that offer “permanent offline download[s]” of digital goods. Companies will be fined for breaking the rules.</p><p>“By sending AB 2426 to Governor Newsom, California is now the first state to recognize that when digital media retailers use terms like ‘buy’ and ‘purchase’ to advertise digital media licenses, they are engaged in false advertising,” University of Michigan professor Aaron Perzanowski said in a <a href="https://a42.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240916-assemblymember-irwin-urges-governor-sign-legislation-increasing">news release from Irwin</a>. “Consumers around the world deserve to understand that when they spend money on digital movies, music, books, and games, those so-called ‘purchases’ can disappear without notice. There is still important work to do in securing consumers’ digital rights, but AB 2426 is a crucial step in the right direction.”</p><p>Digital purchasing is already ubiquitous, as physical media becomes less easy to find. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23915567/best-buy-discontinue-physical-media-dvd-blu-ray">Stores like Best Buy have stopped selling physical movies entirely</a>, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see more retailers follow. Physical video games use a disc or cartridge as a license, and that object is yours. But a company could still take servers offline, for instance — ongoing access isn’t guaranteed.</p><div><p>Ownership of digital goods like movies and video games will continue to be an issue; beyond companies revoking licenses, it’s also becoming <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140123/what-happens-game-gets-delisted-spec-ops-the-line-adult-swim">increasingly common to see games being delisted from sale</a> or pulled offline entirely, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152760/kim-kardashian-hollywood-glu-mobile-game-legacy">like with popular mobile game <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em></a>. In that example, players lost a decade’s worth of digital purchases. Not only is it a consumer protection issue, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pc/24113466/adult-swim-games-delisting-law-warner-bros-discovery-archiving">but it’s a preservation problem, too</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 14:41:57 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/26/cz-changpeng-zhao-crypto-release-date-binance-founder/">https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/26/cz-changpeng-zhao-crypto-release-date-binance-founder/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41671091">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>On Friday, Changpeng Zhao will step out onto the streets of Long Beach, California as a free man for the first time in months. Since April, Zhao—who everyone knows as “CZ”—has been in <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/04/30/binance-founder-changpeng-cz-zhao-sentenced-to-4-months-in-prison-will-enter-as-countrys-richest-inmate/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/04/30/binance-founder-changpeng-cz-zhao-sentenced-to-4-months-in-prison-will-enter-as-countrys-richest-inmate/">federal custody</a> after agreeing to return to the U.S. from Dubai in order to serve a four-month sentence for failing to implement proper anti-money laundering controls at Binance, the giant crypto exchange he founded. During this time Zhao spent around two months at a minimum security prison in the California desert before being transferred to halfway house in Long Beach where, according to a prison official, he would have been able to make supervised excursions and even go to movies.</p><div>



<p>Now, Zhao will have many more options as he returns to society with a personal fortune of approximately $60 billion—the 25th biggest in the world—and his legal troubles behind him. Zhao did not immediately respond to a direct message inquiry about his plans, and his lawyer told <em>Fortune</em> that he did not wish to be interviewed on the day of his release. Nonetheless, it’s possible to make some informed guesses about his next moves.</p>



<p>On Friday, when he is freed two days ahead of his official release date (if a release date falls on a weekend, inmates leave custody early), he will likely get in a chauffeured car and be taken to a private jet in Long Beach or Los Angeles. His first stop is likely to be Dubai or Paris where his children live with their mother, He Ye, Zhao’s one-time romantic partner who is also a top executive at Binance.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/04/10/the-making-of-cz-changpeng-zhao-exclusive-interview-binance/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/04/10/the-making-of-cz-changpeng-zhao-exclusive-interview-binance/">a 2023 interview with <em>Fortune</em></a>, Zhao reflected on his brilliant but aloof late father, and expressed concern he had inherited some of his neglectful traits. It is possible Zhao will decide post-prison to make up for lost time by spending more time with his family, including his sister, his son and his mother—all of whom testified to his character and stood by his side at his sentencing this spring.</p>



<p>Those endorsements from his family helped persuade the sentencing judge to accept what some view as a lenient five month sentence. So too did what the judge described as Zhao’s “extraordinary commitments and dedication to philanthropic activity across the planet.”</p>



<p>For now, it remains to be seen to what degree Zhao will turn those philanthropic commitments into concrete activities. Prior to his incarceration, he launched a project called <a href="https://www.giggleacademy.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.giggleacademy.com/" rel="noopener">Giggle Academy</a> that pledges to create free, fun and easily accessible learning tools for children across the world.</p>



<p>“For the next chapter of my life, I want to provide opportunities for others, namely our youth. I’m building a platform to provide high-quality education for underprivileged kids, all around the world, for free,” Zhao said during his sentencing hearing.</p>



<p>For now, Giggle Academy appears to be little more than a website. The site includes several job listings that have been posted for months, but no information related to project timelines or the source and scope of its funding. This is perhaps unsurprising, though, given Zhao’s recent situation and it is possible more details about Giggle Academy will emerge in coming months.</p>



<p>In addition to his family and philanthropy, the now-free Zhao may turn his attention to a third pursuit: The cryptocurrency industry that made him immensely wealth and which he dominated for the better part of a decade.</p>



<p>On the crypto front, though, Zhao faces a major wrinkle: Under the terms of his criminal settlement, he was required to quit his post as CEO of Binance and stay away from any “day to day” activities involving the company. Meanwhile, the settlement also calls for Binance to accept two external monitors imposed by the U.S. government to ensure compliance.</p>



<p>Despite these apparent constraints, there is the reality that Binance no longer operates in the U.S. as it focuses on Asia and off-shore markets. And even if Zhao is no longer CEO, he remains the company’s largest shareholder, which should give him considerable influence on its future direction. </p>



<p>In response to a request for comment about Zhao’s release, a Binance spokesperson wrote: “We are delighted that CZ will be home with his family. While he is not managing or operating Binance, we are excited to see what he does next. Since last year, Binance has continued to thrive under the leadership of our current team, surpassing 229 million users globally.”</p>



<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that Zhao is only 47 years old—an age that is the prime of many executives’ careers, and one where many are just taking their first role as CEO. All of this suggests that Zhao is very much ready for a second act, and that his influence will be felt in crypto and business for years to come.</p></div><p>Learn more about all things crypto with short, easy-to-read lesson cards.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://variety.com/2024/legit/news/maggie-smith-dead-harry-potter-1236157839/">https://variety.com/2024/legit/news/maggie-smith-dead-harry-potter-1236157839/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41670429">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>British stage and screen actress <a href="https://variety.com/t/maggie-smith/" id="auto-tag_maggie-smith" data-tag="maggie-smith">Maggie Smith</a>, the “<a href="https://variety.com/t/downton-abbey/" id="auto-tag_downton-abbey" data-tag="downton-abbey">Downton Abbey</a>” and “<a href="https://variety.com/t/harry-potter/" id="auto-tag_harry-potter" data-tag="harry-potter">Harry Potter</a>” star who numbers two Oscars, three Emmys and countless stage awards to her credit, died Friday in London. She was 89.</p>
<p>“It is with great sadness we have to announce the death of Dame Maggie Smith,” her sons Toby Stephens and Chris Larkin said in a statement. “She passed away peacefully in hospital early this morning, Friday 27th September. An intensely private person, she was with friends and family at the end. She leaves two sons and five loving grandchildren who are devastated by the loss of their extraordinary mother and grandmother. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the wonderful staff at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital for their care and unstinting kindness during her final days.”

	</p>



<p>In her late 70s, Smith drew an entirely new legion of fans thanks to her starring role in the hugely successful series “Downton Abbey,” a hit for ITV, PBS’ “Masterpiece” and around the world. She picked up two Emmys and was nominated for two more for her role as the Dowager Countess.</p>
<p>And like virtually every other British actor or actress, Smith appeared in a number of entries in the “Harry Potter” film franchise, playing Professor Minerva McGonagall.</p>
<p>A master at classical and contemporary roles who was as renowned for her subtlety as for her broad-stroke mannerisms, the red-haired Smith delighted several generations of theatergoers on both sides of the Atlantic with signature performances in “Mary, Mary,” “Hedda Gabler,” “Othello,” “Private Lives,” “Night and Day” and “Lettice and Lovage,” and audiences around the world for her work in such films as “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,” “California Suite,” “A Room With a View,” “Travels With My Aunt,” “Hot Millions,” “A Private Function,” “Gosford Park,” “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” and its sequel.</p>
<p>In 2015 she starred in “The Lady in the Van,” Alan Bennett’s adaptation of his play, based on his true experiences, and directed by Nicholas Hytner, who had helmed the play.</p>
<p>In 1990, she was named Dame Commander of the British Empire, one of only a handful of her generation, including Judi Dench and Diana Rigg, to be so honored.</p>
<p>A British reviewer once credited her with the “power to make you look and listen all the time, laconic and nervous, super in comedy, touching in pathos, a gem of an actress.” Even her detractors, who complained that her mannerisms — perpetually protruding elbows, flying hands, triple takes, swooping vocal inflections — marred some of her performances (particularly in long-running plays) could not dispute the impact of her theatrical energy. Annoyed by such complaints, she responded that it was better to do too much onstage than too little.

	</p>

<p>Like other amazingly talented actors — Brando is one who springs to mind — the depth and breadth of her talent sometimes took her over the edge. But when she was on her game, she was unforgettable, deftly commanding the audience’s attention and stealing scenes from all those around her. Unlike other actors of her generation, Smith was not of the declamatory Laurence Olivier school of acting; she was seen as fresh and light-hearted. It turned out to be a mixed blessing: When young she had to convince others that she was a serious actress capable of holding her own with the classics.</p>
<p>Margaret Smith was born in Ilford, Essex, and attended the Oxford School for Girls before studying theater at the Oxford Playhouse School. By 1952 she was appearing in Oxford U. stage productions, revues in particular, such as “On the Fringe,” with which she sometimes traveled. When “On the Fringe” reached the West End, American producer Leonard Sillman saw her and asked her to join the Broadway variety show “New Faces of 1956”; she was the only Brit.</p>
<p>“New Faces” led to another comedic role in the revue “Share My Lettuce” in 1957 and a small film, “Nowhere to Go.” She returned to the stage in “The Stepmother” and then joined the Old Vic, where she began to establish her serious acting credentials in productions of “The Double Dealer,” “As You Like It,” “Richard II,” “The Merry Wives of Windsor” and “What Every Woman Knows.” In 1960, she co-starred for the first time with Olivier in Eugene Ionesco’s “Rhinoceros.” Then she appeared in “Strip the Willow,” Anouilh’s “The Rehearsal” and readings of Sean O’Casey’s “Pictures in the Hallway,” which would later lead to a role in the film “Young Cassidy,” with Rod Taylor as O’Casey.</p>
<p>Smith’s first Evening Standard award came for Peter Shaffer’s “The Private Ear/The Public Eye.” Her next triumph was Jean Kerr’s “Mary, Mary.”</p>
<p>Hollywood began to take notice of the actress at about this time: She held her own in a supporting role in the Richard Burton-Elizabeth Taylor vehicle “The V.I.P.s” in 1963 and was equally effective the following year in drama “The Pumpkin Eaters,” starring Anne Bancroft. Olivier then asked her to join his National Theatre Company as his Desdemona in “Othello,” which brought her theatrical acclaim and an Oscar nomination for the film version. For the National Theater, she racked up such productions as “The Recruiting Officer,” “The Master Builder,” a triumphant “Hay Fever,” “Much Ado About Nothing,” “Miss Julie,” “Black Comedy,” “A Bond Honoured” and an Ingmar Bergman-directed “Hedda Gabler,” which brought her another Evening Standard Award in 1970.</p>
<p>She won the coveted title role in “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie” over actresses who had performed it onstage such as Zoe Caldwell and Vanessa Redgrave and took home the Oscar for it. She was not at the ceremony but appearing in “The Beaux Strategem” in London at the time. During the period she also acted in films including “The Honey Pot,” “Hot Millions” and “Oh! What a Lovely War.”

	</p>

<p>Joining the Stratford Festival in Ontario, Smith starred in “Antony and Cleopatra,” “The Way of the World,” “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” and “As You Like It,” among other productions. She also appeared in 1976 with Brian Bedford in “The Guardsman” in Los Angeles and returned to Broadway in Tom Stoppard’s “Night and Day,” which brought her a second Tony nomination (the first was for “Private Lives”).</p>
<p>A second Oscar nomination came for George Cukor’s “Travels With My Aunt.” She was revealing in Neil Simon’s “California Suite,” so much so that she won a second Oscar, this time for supporting actress. Other film roles from the period included “Clash of the Titans,” “Quartet,” “Evil Under the Sun” and “Better Late Than Never.”</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until the mid-’80s that she appeared in movies that matched her abilities: “A Private Function,” written by Alan Bennett, and “A Room With a View,” which brought her a fifth Oscar nomination. Both “A Private Function” and “The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne,” which had its admirers, earned her BAFTA Awards for best actress.</p>
<p>Onstage, even her most difficult assignments, like Jean Cocteau’s “The Infernal Machine,” were worth seeing. Her “Virginia” (as in Woolf) brought her another Evening Standard award in 1981 and “The Way of the World” yet another in 1984. Alan Bennett wrote the brilliant monologue “Bed Among the Lentils” for her, and she received acclaim when she performed it on television in 1988.</p>
<p>Shaffer wrote “Lettice and Lovage” for her. This wonderful comedy was totally suited to her talents. She triumphed in London and then brought it to New York, where she finally won her Tony. It was at about this time that she was diagnosed with Graves’ disease, which compromised her health thereafter, curtailing her ability to work as frequently or for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, she racked up some impressive performances, particularly her award-winning “Three Tall Women,” written by Edward Albee, on the London stage in 1994. She appeared in several films including Steven Spielberg’s “Hook,” the mainstream hit “Sister Act” and its sequel, “The Secret Garden,” “The First Wives’ Club,” “Washington Square” and, impressively, the Ian McKellen fascist take on “Richard III.” She also appeared in the light-hearted “It All Came True” with Michael Caine and alongside Cher in “Tea With Mussolini.” On television she was unforgettable in “Memento Mori” and “Suddenly Last Summer” (which brought an Emmy nomination), along with appearances in telepics “All the King’s Men” (about a WWI tragedy) and “David Copperfield” (another Emmy nom).</p>
<p>She earned an Emmy in 2003 for the HBO telepic “My House in Umbria,” was nominated again in 2010 for “Capturing Mary,” then earned two more for her regular role as Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham, in the celebrated U.K. TV series “Downton Abbey.”

	</p>

<p>In the 2000s, Smith made a solid impact in mainstream features with supporting roles in “Gosford Park,” “Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,” “Becoming Jane,” “Keeping Mum” and “Nanny McPhee Returns.” She was introduced to the masses of J.K. Rowling fans when she played Minerva McGonagall in the “Harry Potter” movie series. However, amid production of the “Potter” pics, Smith, at age 74, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She made a full recovery and returned to the big and small screen.</p>
<p>Her work continued with a role in 2009’s “From Time to Time,” voicework in the 2011 animated pic “Gnomeo and Juliet,” as well as appearances in hit film “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” and its sequel. In 2012 Smith starred in the Dustin Hoffman-directed “Quartet,” Ronald Harwood’s adaptation of his own play about folks at a retirement home for opera singers, and she starred in “My Old Lady,” Israel Horovitz’s feature directorial debut based on his own play.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Smith married actor Robert Stephens in 1967. After divorcing Stephens she married writer Beverly Cross in 1976; he died in 1998.&nbsp;She is survived by two sons, actors Christopher Larkin and Toby Stephens, and grandchildren.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div ast-blocks-layout="true" itemprop="text">

		
		
<p>What if I told you that Forbes Marketplace, the affiliate company operating on Forbes.com ALSO had agreements with CNN and USA Today?</p>



<p>And that Forbes Marketplace was stuffing those sites full of affiliate content just like it is with Forbes?</p>



<p>And what if Forbes Marketplace went to extreme efforts to hide everything?</p>



<p>I believe all this to be true.</p>



<p>If you haven’t been following the Forbes Marketplace story, <a href="https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/">read my first post here</a>. For the rest of this post, I’ll refer to this company as just Marketplace.</p>



<p>Once more, down the rabbit hole we go.</p>



<h2>The Hidden Website on CNN</h2>



<p>Let’s start at the top. Go to the CNN homepage and if you scroll down a tad, you’ll find CNN Underscored:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscore_Homepage-scaled.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="633" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscore_Homepage-1024x633.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscore_Homepage-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscore_Homepage-300x186.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscore_Homepage-768x475.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscore_Homepage-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscore_Homepage-2048x1267.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I’ve known about this for a while, thought it was a Wirecutter copycat. Turns out there’s a lot more going on.</p>



<p>Now, if you poke around the majority of CNN Underscored, it looks like a standard affiliate site. And as far as I know, it’s run by CNN itself.</p>



<p>EXCEPT for one section that I know about.</p>



<p>That section is CNN Underscored Money.</p>



<p>The first clue I found was in the staff bios.</p>



<p>Here’s a normal CNN Underscore bio:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Author_Bio-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="636" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Author_Bio-1024x636.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Author_Bio-1024x636.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Author_Bio-300x186.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Author_Bio-768x477.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Author_Bio-1536x955.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Author_Bio-2048x1273.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>At the very bottom, this person has a cnn.com email address. Good sign that it’s a real employee of CNN.</p>



<p>But what if we look up a bio of someone working on the Money section of CNN Underscored?</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Bio-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="650" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Bio-1024x650.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Bio-1024x650.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Bio-300x191.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Bio-768x488.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Bio-1536x975.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Bio-2048x1301.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>In this case, the email is under wbdcontractor.com. I assume that Warner Bro Discovery (the owner of CNN) uses this domain for all contractor emails. So this person isn’t an actual employee, they’re a contractor.</p>



<p>Now this particular person I found is a Lead Editor, not just a freelance writer where a contract relationship would be expected. An editor has a lot of influence over the content, especially a Lead Editor. If it was me, I’d want all my editors as employees, especially for a brand like CNN.</p>



<p>Every bio I checked under CNN Underscored Money had an email at wbdcontractor.com. Maybe I missed one but I checked a bunch.</p>



<p>Also, all the Money “employees” are separated from the rest of the Editorial staff on the CNN Underscored About page. They’re under a separate list called “Money.” Curious.</p>



<p>Why oh why are ALL the CNN Underscored Money folks contractors?</p>



<p>Might it be because they’re working for a COMPLETELY different company? Hmm. We’ll see.</p>



<h2>The CNN Underscored Money Website</h2>



<p>Now let’s turn to the CNN Underscored navigation bar. Here’s the normal one:</p>

<p>And here’s the navigation bar for the Money section of CNN Underscored:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Nav-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="96" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Nav-1024x96.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Nav-1024x96.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Nav-300x28.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Nav-768x72.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Nav-1536x144.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Nav-2048x192.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I took these screenshots with the same size browser window. And yet we see a LOT of differences.</p>



<ul>
<li>Money has a lot more categories.</li>



<li>The “Sign In” button has slightly different styling.</li>



<li>“More” has a little dropdown arrow in the main nav bar, it’s missing in the Money nav bar.</li>



<li>For the affiliate disclaimer, the main nav is italicized while the Money nav is not. And the copy in the Money section is different.</li>
</ul>



<p>Why would the navigation of CNN Underscored Money be different?</p>



<p>And why are there so many little details… <em>off</em>?</p>



<p>It’s almost like someone spent a LOT of time and effort to make the nav appear identical… when they’re not.</p>



<p>What is going on?</p>



<p><strong>Easy: they’re DIFFERENT FUCKING websites.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the beginning of the source code for CNN Underscored:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Main_Source_Code.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="457" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Main_Source_Code-1024x457.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Main_Source_Code-1024x457.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Main_Source_Code-300x134.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Main_Source_Code-768x343.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Main_Source_Code-1536x685.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Main_Source_Code.jpg 1704w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>And for CNN Underscored Money:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Source_Code.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="422" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Source_Code-1024x422.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Source_Code-1024x422.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Source_Code-300x124.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Source_Code-768x317.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Source_Code-1536x634.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Source_Code.jpg 1702w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I’m not even a front-end dev and I can easily tell they’re very different.</p>



<p>Here’s a few differences I noticed:</p>



<ul>
<li>CNN Underscored Money has Google Tag Manager installed, I can’t find it on the normal CNN Underscored. It’s highly unusual to place GTM on just one category of a website in my experience. And if it is installed, I’d expect it to be installed in the same way.</li>



<li>For Underscored Money, a bunch of the WordPress files are in /cnn-underscored/money/wp-content/ which means there’s a separate and unique version of WordPress installed in /cnn-underscored/money/. I believe the main Underscored site is using cms.cnn.com for all its stuff.</li>



<li>CNN Underscored has Optimizely installed, CNN Underscored Money does not. Usually tools like this will run across an entire website.</li>
</ul>



<p>I could understand CNN Underscored having its own CMS from the rest of cnn.com. That makes sense.</p>



<p>But having ANOTHER WordPress installed for just the Money category of CNN Underscored, that makes zero sense. Unless you wanted to cordon off another company into a restricted area of your site. THAT makes sense.</p>



<p>I believe someone installed a unique version of WordPress so they could operate the Money category independently.</p>



<p>Who oh who could it be?</p>



<h2>My New Favorite Part of Every Website: Privacy Policies</h2>



<p>In my <a href="https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/">original post on Marketplace</a>, the privacy policy helped me figure out what was going on.</p>



<p>And for the rest of my career, every time I see a privacy policy, I will think to myself: “ahhh, privacy policies, the beacon of truth in a world drowning in bullshit.”</p>



<p>Just like the rest of CNN Underscored, there’s two of everything.</p>



<p>For the main CNN Underscored site, if you click on the privacy policy, you’ll end up here:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WBD_Privacy_Center-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="620" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WBD_Privacy_Center-1024x620.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WBD_Privacy_Center-1024x620.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WBD_Privacy_Center-300x182.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WBD_Privacy_Center-768x465.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WBD_Privacy_Center-1536x930.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WBD_Privacy_Center-2048x1239.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>It’s the Privacy Center for Warner Bros Discovery. Makes sense. Looks legit.</p>



<p>Buuuuuut what about the privacy policy for CNN Underscored Money?</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Privacy_Policy-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="443" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Privacy_Policy-1024x443.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Privacy_Policy-1024x443.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Privacy_Policy-300x130.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Privacy_Policy-768x332.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Privacy_Policy-1536x664.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Privacy_Policy-2048x886.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>It’s a COMPLETELY different privacy policy on its own URL: www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/money/privacy. That’s weird as hell.</p>



<p>And who’s Solutions Underscored LLC?</p>



<p>I’ve got a feeling that we’re on to something.</p>



<h2>Who Is Solutions Underscored LLC?</h2>



<p>Luckily, the organization running CNN Underscored Money included the address for their company Solutions Underscored LLC in the privacy policy. It’s based in Georgia.</p>



<p>So now we can look up the business registration of Solutions Underscored LLC.</p>



<p>You can do this with any business. But they’re rarely indexed by Google. You have to find the business registration website for that specific state, then search there. Since I have the address, I know what state to search instead of having to check every state.</p>



<p>If you search business registrations in Georgia, you will find one for Solutions Underscored LLC. Click around a bit and you’ll get the actual PDF of the business registration. The first page of the registration looks like this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions-Underscored-Business-Registration.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="789" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions-Underscored-Business-Registration-1024x789.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions-Underscored-Business-Registration-1024x789.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions-Underscored-Business-Registration-300x231.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions-Underscored-Business-Registration-768x592.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions-Underscored-Business-Registration-1536x1184.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions-Underscored-Business-Registration.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Pretty standard stuff.</p>



<p>If you check it yourself, I HIGHLY recommend looking at page 2:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions_Underscored_Manager_and_Authorizer.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="401" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions_Underscored_Manager_and_Authorizer-1024x401.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions_Underscored_Manager_and_Authorizer-1024x401.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions_Underscored_Manager_and_Authorizer-300x117.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions_Underscored_Manager_and_Authorizer-768x301.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions_Underscored_Manager_and_Authorizer-1536x601.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Solutions_Underscored_Manager_and_Authorizer.jpg 1798w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>The Manager and Authorizer of Solutions Underscored is listed as Thomas Callahan.</p>



<p>Where have I seen that name before?</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace-CFO.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="997" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace-CFO-1024x997.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace-CFO-1024x997.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace-CFO-300x292.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace-CFO-768x748.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace-CFO.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>IT’S THE CFO OF MARKETPLACE.</p>



<p>Or at least, someone with his exact same name. Maybe it’s a different Thomas Callahan. Or maybe it is the same guy and he has a COMPLETELY legitimate reason to be running a business that controls CNN Underscored Money. I doubt it. But it’s possible.</p>



<h2>What I Believe Is Happening with CNN Underscored Money</h2>



<p>Based on everything I’ve seen, here’s what I think happened:</p>



<ul>
<li>Marketplace wanted to expand. Running an affiliate program on Forbes wasn’t enough.&nbsp;</li>



<li>They reached out to CNN and offered to run a section of their website.</li>



<li>For some unfathomable reason, CNN agreed to a deal. What the fuck CNN? You’re CN fucking N. What in god’s name convinced you this was a good idea? And you already had a ramped up affiliate program. I say again: what the fuck CNN?</li>



<li>Folks involved decided that CNN would install a completely unique site under cnn.com/cnn-underscored/money/ for Marketplace.</li>



<li>Marketplace then went to absurd levels of effort to make that site look identical to the normal Underscored website. I believe this was intentional. It’s actually really easy to miss unless you’re looking for it. And there’s no way CNN didn’t realize what was going on.</li>



<li>I believe Marketplace has since been running CNN Underscored Money with little, if any, oversight from the main CNN team. If CNN was interested in oversight, I don’t see why they’d let another company set up a completely unique website on their domain in the first place. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe editors employed by CNN are involved in day-to-day content operations. I hope I’m wrong. Please tell me if I’m wrong.</li>
</ul>



<p>And for those of you that are curious about the success of this little endeavor, here’s the search traffic:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Search_Traffic.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="360" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Search_Traffic-1024x360.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Search_Traffic-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Search_Traffic-300x106.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Search_Traffic-768x270.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Search_Traffic-1536x541.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CNN_Underscored_Money_Search_Traffic.jpg 1540w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Got hit a bit in the Aug 2024 algo update but still doing over 600K search visits/month. And way up in the past few years.</p>



<p>Starting to rank for some real money terms too. At number 4 for me on “best mortgage lenders”:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_mortgage_lenders_-_CNN_Underscored.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="355" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_mortgage_lenders_-_CNN_Underscored-1024x355.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_mortgage_lenders_-_CNN_Underscored-1024x355.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_mortgage_lenders_-_CNN_Underscored-300x104.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_mortgage_lenders_-_CNN_Underscored-768x266.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_mortgage_lenders_-_CNN_Underscored-1536x532.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_mortgage_lenders_-_CNN_Underscored.jpg 1692w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Yeah, it’s not like mortgage lenders have any real impact on people’s lives.</p>



<p>Also number 2 for me on “best loan apps”:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_loan_apps_-_CNN_Underscored_Money.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="413" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_loan_apps_-_CNN_Underscored_Money-1024x413.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_loan_apps_-_CNN_Underscored_Money-1024x413.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_loan_apps_-_CNN_Underscored_Money-300x121.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_loan_apps_-_CNN_Underscored_Money-768x310.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_loan_apps_-_CNN_Underscored_Money-1536x619.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_loan_apps_-_CNN_Underscored_Money.jpg 1696w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<h2>The Same Thing is Going on With USA Today Blueprint</h2>



<p>To me, it looks like the exact same thing is happening with USA Today Blueprint.</p>



<p>Here’s the normal USA Today navigation bar:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Nav_Bar-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="175" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Nav_Bar-1024x175.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Nav_Bar-1024x175.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Nav_Bar-300x51.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Nav_Bar-768x132.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Nav_Bar-1536x263.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Nav_Bar-2048x351.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>And the USA Today Blueprint navigation bar:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_TODAY_Blueprint_Nav_Bar-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="107" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_TODAY_Blueprint_Nav_Bar-1024x107.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_TODAY_Blueprint_Nav_Bar-1024x107.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_TODAY_Blueprint_Nav_Bar-300x31.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_TODAY_Blueprint_Nav_Bar-768x81.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_TODAY_Blueprint_Nav_Bar-1536x161.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_TODAY_Blueprint_Nav_Bar-2048x215.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Tons of little differences:</p>



<ul>
<li>Spacing is off.</li>



<li>Font is different or has a slightly different weight.</li>



<li>The normal USA Today nav bar has a weather widget, a sign in button, and a CTA button for the USA Today subscription. USA Today Blueprint doesn’t have any of that stuff.</li>



<li>USA Today Blueprint doesn’t have as many ads but I could understand that, I’d fight to remove display ads in any affiliate program. Even a legit one.</li>
</ul>



<p>The sites look very different once you get under the hood too. Again, someone put in some real effort to make these sites look identical when they’re not.</p>



<p>But time for the smoking gun.</p>



<p>A few days ago, I grabbed this screenshot of a USA Blueprint bio:</p>

<p>In the bottom left, you’ll see the mouse-over for the email address tied to the email icon.</p>



<p>To make this easier, let’s ENHANCE:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Old_Author_Bio_Zoomed_Email.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="154" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Old_Author_Bio_Zoomed_Email-1024x154.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Old_Author_Bio_Zoomed_Email-1024x154.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Old_Author_Bio_Zoomed_Email-300x45.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Old_Author_Bio_Zoomed_Email-768x115.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Old_Author_Bio_Zoomed_Email.jpg 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>The domain is marketplace.co. Yes, THAT marketplace.co. The same website for the company that runs the affiliate program on Forbes:</p>



<figure><a href="http://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace_Homepage.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="765" src="http://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace_Homepage-1024x765.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace_Homepage-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace_Homepage-300x224.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace_Homepage-768x573.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace_Homepage-1536x1147.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Marketplace_Homepage-2048x1529.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>An Editor at USA Today Blueprint has an email address on the same domain as Marketplace. I’m going to assume that’s because the editor is an employee at Marketplace and NOT an employee of USA Today.</p>



<p>By the way, I just tried to get a better screenshot of that email address. Now the bios look like this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Author_Bio.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Author_Bio-1024x574.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Author_Bio-1024x574.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Author_Bio-300x168.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Author_Bio-768x430.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Author_Bio-1536x860.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Author_Bio-2048x1147.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Seems like the team is scrubbing info since my original post went viral. Feels like a rush job too. I wonder why?</p>



<p>The funny part: that marketplace.co email address is still listed on that email icon:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Bio_Email.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="323" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Bio_Email-1024x323.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Bio_Email-1024x323.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Bio_Email-300x95.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Bio_Email-768x243.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Bio_Email-1536x485.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_New_Bio_Email-2048x647.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>They missed scrubbing the best part!</p>



<p>As for the search traffic on USA Today Blueprint:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Search_Traffic.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="381" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Search_Traffic-1024x381.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Search_Traffic-1024x381.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Search_Traffic-300x112.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Search_Traffic-768x286.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA_Today_Blueprint_Search_Traffic.jpg 1436w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Took a sizable hit during the March 2024 algo update. Still doing over 800K search visits/month though.</p>



<p>Before we wrap for USA Today Blueprint, I’d like to point out a link added to the bottom of the About page for USA Today Blueprint:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/About_USA_TODAY_Blueprint.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="439" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/About_USA_TODAY_Blueprint-1024x439.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/About_USA_TODAY_Blueprint-1024x439.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/About_USA_TODAY_Blueprint-300x128.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/About_USA_TODAY_Blueprint-768x329.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/About_USA_TODAY_Blueprint-1536x658.jpg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/About_USA_TODAY_Blueprint-2048x877.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>See that link for Ethical Conduct For Newsrooms? It goes to the ethical conduct page used by all of USA Today.</p>



<p>On that page, there’s a section on maintaining independence.</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA-Today-Independence.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="630" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA-Today-Independence-1024x630.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA-Today-Independence-1024x630.jpg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA-Today-Independence-300x185.jpg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA-Today-Independence-768x473.jpg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USA-Today-Independence.jpg 1336w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>

In fact, this post has several, you just can’t see them (yet). </span></p><p>In this way, all Greenwich residents help grow our shared map of interesting places to visit and benefit from it.</p><p>Let me give you a sneak peek of how it feels to be a resident of Greenwich.</p><p><span>The idea for Greenwich came to me because I recently had the experience of wanting to </span><em><strong>suggest a link</strong></em><span> to the author of a blog post I was reading. I happened upon a sentence which reminded me of a different blog post I thought they’d enjoy and wanted to link it right there. </span></p><p>I wanted to be able to add a hyperlink to a webpage I didn’t own and I wanted future visitors of that page to see the suggested link I added, in line, right at the relevant section rather than buried in the comments. </p><p><span>I also wanted to stumble on a cool blog post and </span><strong>see that another curious reader had been there before me</strong><span>, and better yet, left me a portal to another interesting piece of reading that explored related ideas. I wanted the websites I visit to feel </span><em>visited</em><span>, alive, bustling. The only places that really feel that way today are the social media sites like Twitter and Instagram and as we all know, not always in a good way.</span></p><p>Isn’t it sort of insane that Twitter is the default place for discovering interesting links? Sure we have Reddit, Hacker News, and a few others but there has been very little experimentation in social features outside of Social Networks. We have our Times Squares, now it’s time for more West Villages. </p><p>So bring on the collective footnotes, the community superscripts!</p><p><strong>I am calling this idea</strong><em><strong> collaborative links</strong></em><span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2024-09-27</p><section><p>16 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6uXyuXT5ofnG9x4JGrR7jv/75c65f8e5c12f0913c0bed09416f2c1b/BLOG-2573_1.png" alt=""><div><p>We’ve been working on something new —&nbsp;a platform for running containers across Cloudflare’s network. We already use it in production for <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"><u>Workers AI</u></a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/"><u>Workers Builds</u></a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/browser-isolation/"><u>Remote Browsing Isolation</u></a>, and the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/"><u>Browser Rendering API</u></a>. Today, we want to share an early look at how it’s built, why we built it, and how we use it ourselves.</p><p>In 2024, Cloudflare Workers celebrates its 7th birthday. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers/"><u>When we first announced Workers</u></a>, it was a completely new model for running compute in a multi-tenant way —&nbsp;on isolates, as opposed to containers. While, at the time, Workers was a pretty bare-bones functions-as-a-service product, we took a big bet that this was going to become the way software was going to be written going forward. Since introducing Workers, in addition to expanding our developer products in general to include storage and AI, we have been steadily adding more compute capabilities to Workers:</p><p>With each of these, we’ve faced a question&nbsp;—&nbsp;can we build this natively into the platform, in a way that removes, rather than adds complexity? Can we build it in a way that lets developers focus on building and shipping, rather than managing infrastructure, so that they don’t have to be a distributed systems engineer to build distributed systems?</p><p>In each instance, the answer has been YES. We try to solve problems in a way that simplifies things for developers in the long run, even if that is the harder path for us to take ourselves. If we didn’t, you’d be right to ask — why not self-host and manage all of this myself? What’s the point of the cloud if I’m still provisioning and managing infrastructure? These are the questions many are asking today about the earlier generation of cloud providers.</p><p>Pushing ourselves to build platform-native products and features helped us answer this question. Particularly because some of these actually use containers behind the scenes, even though as a developer you never interact with or think about containers yourself.</p><p>If you’ve used AI inference on GPUs with <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"><u>Workers AI</u></a>, spun up headless browsers with <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/"><u>Browser Rendering</u></a>, or enqueued build jobs with the new <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/builds"><u>Workers Builds</u></a>, you’ve run containers on our network, without even knowing it. But to do so, we needed to be able to run untrusted code across Cloudflare’s network, outside a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/how-workers-works/#isolates"><u>v8 isolate</u></a>, in a way that fits what we promise:</p><ol><li><p>You shouldn’t have to think about regions or data centers. Routing, scaling, load balancing, scheduling, and capacity are our problem to solve, not yours, with tools like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-workers-smart-placement/"><u>Smart Placement</u></a>.</p></li><li><p>You should be able to build distributed systems without being a distributed systems engineer.</p></li><li><p>Every millisecond matters — Cloudflare has to be fast.</p></li></ol><p>There wasn’t an off-the-shelf container platform that solved for what we needed, so we built it ourselves — from scheduling to IP address management, pulling and caching images, to improving startup times and more. Our container platform powers many of our newest products, so we wanted to share how we built it, optimized it, and well, you can probably guess what’s next.</p><h2>Global scheduling — “The Network is the Computer”</h2><p>Cloudflare serves the entire world — region: earth. Rather than asking developers to provision resources in specific regions, data centers and availability zones, we think <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-network-is-the-computer/"><u>“The Network is the Computer”</u></a>. When you build on Cloudflare, you build software that runs on the Internet, not just in a data center.</p><p>When we started working on this, Cloudflare’s architecture was to just run every service via <a href="https://systemd.io/"><u>systemd</u></a> on every server (we call them “metals” — we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/gen-12-servers"><u>run our own hardware</u></a>), allowing all services to take advantage of new capacity we add to our network. That fits running <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/upgrading-one-of-the-oldest-components-in-cloudflare-software-stack/"><u>NGINX</u></a> and a few dozen other services, but cannot fit a world where we need to run <i>many thousands</i> of different compute heavy, resource hungry workloads. We’d <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/its-crowded-in-here/"><u>run out of space</u></a> just trying to load all of them! Consider a canonical AI workload —&nbsp;deploying <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/meta-llama-3-1-available-on-workers-ai/"><u>Llama 3.1 8B</u></a> to an inference server. If we simply ran a Llama 3.1 8B service on every Cloudflare metal, we’d have no flexibility to use GPUs for the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/"><u>many other models</u></a> that Workers AI supports.</p><p>We needed something that would allow us to still take advantage of the full capacity of Cloudflare’s entire network, not just the capacity of individual machines. And ideally not put that burden on the developer.</p><p>The answer: we built a control plane on our own Developer Platform that lets us schedule a container anywhere on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network/"><u>Cloudflare’s Network</u></a>:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/63nPDnWzVLvx2OB9ZPZXM5/3c0b8d46258be3bc3263db271a3dc73a/BLOG-2573_2.png" alt="BLOG-2573 2" width="1999" height="1277" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>The global scheduler is built on Cloudflare <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/"><u>Workers</u></a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/"><u>Durable Objects</u></a>, and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/"><u>KV</u></a>, and decides which Cloudflare location to schedule the container to run in. Each location then runs <i>its own</i> scheduler, which decides which metals within that location to schedule the container to run on. Location schedulers monitor compute capacity, and expose this to the global scheduler. This allows Cloudflare to dynamically place workloads based on capacity and hardware availability (e.g. multiple types of GPUs) across our network.</p><h2>Why does global scheduling matter?</h2><p>When you run compute on a first generation cloud, the “contract” between the developer and the platform is that the developer must specify what runs where. This is regional scheduling, the status quo.</p><p>Let’s imagine for a second if we applied regional scheduling to running compute on Cloudflare’s network, with locations in <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network/"><u>330+ cities, across 120+ countries</u></a>. One of the obvious reasons people tell us they want to run on Cloudflare is because we have compute in places where others don’t, within 50ms of 95% of the world’s Internet-connected population. In South America, other clouds have one region in one city. Cloudflare has 19:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/53Ba51lqKDRNQPbEBselC3/541a92d1e2702cc61d3e6c2f97d48c4d/BLOG-2573_3.png" alt="BLOG-2573 3" width="1044" height="492" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Running anywhere means you can be faster, highly available, and have more control over data location. But with regional scheduling, the more locations you run in, the more work you have to do. You configure and manage load balancing, routing, auto-scaling policies and more. Balancing performance and cost in a multi-region setup is literally a full-time job (or more) at most companies who have reached meaningful scale on traditional clouds.</p><p>But most importantly, no matter what tools you bring, you were the one who told the cloud provider, “run this container over here”. The cloud platform can’t move it for you, even if moving it would make your workload faster. This prevents the platform from adding locations, because for each location, it has to convince developers to take action themselves to move their compute workloads to the new location. Each new location carries a risk that developers won’t migrate workloads to it, or migrate too slowly, delaying the return on investment.</p><p>Global scheduling means Cloudflare can add capacity and use it immediately, letting you benefit from it. The “contract” between us and our customers isn’t tied to a specific datacenter or region, so we have permission to move workloads around to benefit customers. This flexibility plays an essential role in all of our own uses of our container platform, starting with&nbsp;GPUs and AI.</p><h2>GPUs everywhere: Scheduling large images with Workers AI</h2><p>In late 2023, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"><u>we launched Workers AI</u></a>, which provides fast, easy to use, and affordable GPU-backed AI inference.</p><p>The more efficiently we can use our capacity, the better pricing we can offer. And the faster we can make changes to which models run in which Cloudflare locations, the closer we can move AI inference to the application, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-workers-ai-more-efficient-with-kv-cache-compression"><u>lowering Time to First Token (TTFT)</u></a>. This also allows us to be more resilient to spikes in inference requests.</p><p>AI models that rely on GPUs present three challenges though:</p><ol><li><p>Models have different GPU memory needs. GPU memory is the most scarce resource, and different GPUs have different amounts of memory.</p></li><li><p>Not all container runtimes, such as <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1179"><u>Firecracker</u></a>, support GPU drivers and other dependencies.</p></li><li><p>AI models, particularly LLMs, are very large. Even a smaller parameter model, like <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct/"><u>@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct</u></a>, is at least 5 GB. The larger the model, the more bytes we need to pull across the network when scheduling a model to run in a new location.</p></li></ol><p>Let’s dive into how we solved each of these…</p><p>First, GPU memory needs. The global scheduler knows which Cloudflare locations have blocks of GPU memory available, and then delegates scheduling the workload on a specific metal to the local scheduler. This allows us to prioritize placement of AI models that use a large amount of GPU memory, and then move smaller models to other machines in the same location. By doing this, we maximize the overall number of locations that we run AI models in, and maximize our efficiency.</p><p>Second, container runtimes and GPU support. Thankfully, from day one we built our container platform to be <i>runtime agnostic</i>. Using <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-use-hashicorp-nomad/"><u>a runtime agnostic scheduler</u></a>, we’re able to support <a href="https://gvisor.dev/"><u>gVisor</u></a>, <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/"><u>Firecracker</u></a> microVMs, and traditional VMs with <a href="https://www.qemu.org/"><u>QEMU</u></a>. We are also evaluating adding support for another one: <a href="https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor"><u>cloud-hypervisor</u></a> which is based on <a href="https://github.com/rust-vmm"><u>rust-vmm</u></a> and has a few compelling advantages for our use case:</p><ol><li><p>GPU passthrough <a href="https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/blob/main/docs/vfio.md"><u>support</u></a> using VFIO</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/blob/main/docs/device_model.md#vhost-user-net"><u>vhost-user-net</u></a> support, enabling high throughput between the host network interface and the VM</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/blob/main/docs/device_model.md#vhost-user-net"><u>vhost-user-blk</u></a> support, adding flexibility to introduce novel network-based storage backed by other Cloudflare Workers products</p></li><li><p>all the while being a smaller codebase than QEMU and written in a memory-safe language</p></li></ol><p>Our goal isn’t to build a platform that makes you as the developer choose between runtimes, and ask, “should I use Firecracker or gVisor”. We needed this flexibility in order to be able to run workloads with different needs efficiently, including workloads that depend on GPUs. gVisor has <a href="https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/gpu/"><u>GPU support</u></a>, while Firecracker microVMs currently <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1179"><u>does not</u></a>.</p><p>gVisor’s main component is an application kernel (called Sentry) that implements a Linux-like interface but is written in a memory-safe language (Go) and runs in userspace. It works by intercepting application system calls and acting as the guest kernel, without the need for translation through virtualized hardware.</p><p>The resource footprint of a containerized application running on gVisor is lower than a VM because it does not require managing virtualized hardware and booting up a kernel instance. However, this comes at the price of reduced application compatibility and higher per-system call overhead.</p><p>To add GPU support, the Google team introduced <a href="https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/gpu/"><u>nvproxy</u></a> which works using the same principles as described above for syscalls: it intercepts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioctl"><u>ioctls</u></a> destined to the GPU and proxies a subset to the GPU kernel module.</p>

          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1jqt4l5joKUkPNek1xACaM/0eb2e4546ac21b2d6da502919cd759a1/image__19_.png" alt="BLOG-2573 4" width="1256" height="1428" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>To solve the third challenge, and make scheduling fast with large models, we weren’t satisfied with the status quo. So we did something about it.</p><h2>Docker pull was too slow, so we fixed it (and cut the time in half)</h2><p>Many of the images we need to run for AI inference are over 15 GB. Specialized inference libraries and GPU drivers add up fast. For example, when we make a scheduling decision to run a fresh container in Tokyo, naively running docker pull to fetch the image from a storage bucket in Los Angeles would be unacceptably slow. And scheduling speed is critical to being able to scale up and down in new locations in response to changes in traffic.</p><p>We had 3 essential requirements:</p><ul><li><p>Pulling and pushing very large images should be fast</p></li><li><p>We should not rely on a single point of failure</p></li><li><p>Our teams shouldn’t waste time managing image registries</p></li></ul><p>We needed globally distributed storage, so we used <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/"><u>R2</u></a>. We needed the highest cache hit rate possible, so we used Cloudflare’s <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/"><u>Cache</u></a>, and will soon use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/"><u>Tiered Cache</u></a>. And we needed a fast container image registry that we could run everywhere, in every Cloudflare location, so we built and open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/serverless-registry"><u>serverless-registry</u></a>, which is built on <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/"><u>Workers</u></a>. You can deploy serverless-registry to your own Cloudflare account in about 5 minutes. We rely on it in production.</p><p>This is fast, but we can be faster. Our performance bottleneck was, somewhat surprisingly, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/push/"><u>docker push</u></a>. Docker uses <a href="https://www.gzip.org/"><u>gzip</u></a> to compress and decompress layers of images while pushing and pulling. So we started using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd"><u>Zstandard</u></a> (zstd) instead, which compresses and decompresses faster, and results in smaller compressed files.</p><p>In order to build, chunk, and push these images to the R2 registry, we built a custom CLI tool that we use internally in lieu of running docker build and docker push. This makes it easy to use zstd and split layers into 500 MB chunks, which allows uploads to be processed by Workers while staying under <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#request-limits"><u>body size limits</u></a>.</p><p>Using our custom build and push tool doubled the speed of image pulls. Our 30 GB GPU images now pull in 4 minutes instead of 8. We plan on open sourcing this tool in the near future.</p><h2>Anycast is the gift that keeps on simplifying — Virtual IPs and the Global State Router</h2><p>We still had another challenge to solve. And yes, we solved it with anycast. We’re Cloudflare, did you expect anything else?</p><p>First, a refresher&nbsp;— Cloudflare operates <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/"><u>Unimog</u></a>, a Layer 4 load balancer that handles all incoming Cloudflare traffic. Cloudflare’s network uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network"><u>anycast</u></a>, which allows a single IP address to route requests to a variety of different locations. For most Cloudflare services with anycast, the given IP address will route to the nearest Cloudflare data center, reducing latency. Since Cloudflare runs almost every service in every data center, Unimog can simply route traffic to any Cloudflare metal that is online and has capacity, without needing to map traffic to a specific service that runs on specific metals, only in some locations.</p><p>The new compute-heavy, GPU-backed workloads we were taking on forced us to confront this fundamental “everything runs everywhere” assumption. If we run a containerized workflow in 20 Cloudflare locations, how does Unimog know which locations, and which metals, it runs in? You might say “just bring your own <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/load-balancing/"><u>load balancer</u></a>” — but then what happens when you make scheduling decisions to migrate a workload between locations, scale up, or scale down?</p><p>Anycast is foundational to how we build fast and simple products on our network, and we needed a way to keep building new types of products this way —&nbsp;where a team can deploy an application, get back a single IP address, and rely on the platform to balance traffic, taking load, container health, and latency into account, without extra configuration. We started letting teams use the container platform without solving this, and it was painfully clear that we needed to do something about it.</p><p>So we started integrating directly into our networking stack, building a sidecar service to Unimog. We’ll call this the Global State Router. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li><p>An eyeball makes a request to a virtual IP address issued by Cloudflare</p></li><li><p>Request sent to the best location as determined by BGP routing. This is anycast routing.</p></li><li><p>A small <a href="https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/"><u>eBPF</u></a> program sits on the main networking interface and ensures packets bound to a virtual IP address are handled by the Global State Router.</p></li><li><p>The main Global State Router program contains a mapping of all anycast IPs addresses to potential end destination container IP addresses. It updates this mapping based on container health, readiness, distance, and latency. Using this information, it picks a best-fit container.</p></li><li><p>Packets are forwarded at the L4 layer.</p></li><li><p>When a target container’s server receives a packet, its own Global State Router program intercepts the packet and routes it to the local container.</p></li></ul>

          </figure><p>This might sound like just a lower level networking detail, disconnected from developer experience. But by integrating directly with Unimog, we can let developers:</p><ol><li><p>Push a containerized application to Cloudflare.</p></li><li><p>Provide constraints, health checks, and load metrics that describe what the application needs.</p></li><li><p>Delegate scheduling and scaling many containers across Cloudflare’s network.</p></li><li><p>Get back a single IP address that can be used everywhere.</p></li></ol><p>We’re actively working on this, and are excited to continue building on Cloudflare’s anycast capabilities, and pushing to keep the simplicity of running “everywhere” with new categories of workloads.</p><h2>Low latency &amp; global — Remote Browser Isolation &amp; Browser Rendering</h2><p>Our container platform actually started because of a very specific challenge, running <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/browser-isolation/"><u>Remote Browser Isolation</u></a> across our network. Remote Browser Isolation provides Chromium browsers that run on Cloudflare, in containers, rather than on the end user’s own computer. Only the rendered output is sent to the end user. This provides a layer of protection against zero-day browser vulnerabilities, phishing attacks, and ransomware.</p><p>Location is critical — people expect their interactions with a remote browser to feel just as fast as if it ran locally. If the server is thousands of miles away, the remote browser will feel slow. Running across <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/"><u>Cloudflare’s network of over 330 locations</u></a> means the browser is nearly always as close to you as possible.</p><p>Imagine a user in Santiago, Chile, if they were to access a browser running in the same city, each interaction would incur negligible additional latency. Whereas a browser in Buenos Aires might add 21 ms, São Paulo might add 48 ms, Bogota might add 67 ms, and Raleigh, NC might add 128 ms. Where the container runs significantly impacts the latency of every user interaction with the browser, and therefore the experience as a whole.</p><p>It’s not just browser isolation that benefits from running near the user: WebRTC servers stream video better, multiplayer games have less lag, online advertisements can be served faster, financial transactions can be processed faster. Our container platform lets us run anything we need to near the user, no matter where they are in the world.</p><h2>Using spare compute — “off-peak” jobs for Workers CI/CD builds</h2><p>At any hour of the day, Cloudflare has many CPU cores that sit idle. This is compute power that could be used for something else.</p><p>Via anycast, most of Cloudflare’s traffic is handled as close as possible to the eyeball (person) that requested it. Most of our traffic originates from eyeballs. And the eyeballs of (most) people are closed and asleep between midnight and 5:00 AM local time. While we use our compute capacity very efficiently during the daytime in any part of the world, overnight we have spare cycles. Consider what a map of the world looks like at night-time in Europe and Africa:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/CtkNFxhvusjLx1khXh9gs/e79ee41386f2ac057888d2293b06bb59/BLOG-2573_6.png" alt="BLOG-2573 6" width="1044" height="492" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>As shown above, we can run containers during “off-peak” in Cloudflare locations receiving low traffic at night. During this time, the CPU utilization of a typical Cloudflare metal looks something like this:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6sXsQ3p19bFecokbR0X1yj/273f7dd5f764111420195f2aa3aa19bf/BLOG-2573_7.png" alt="BLOG-2573 7" width="1999" height="1238" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>We have many “background” compute workloads at Cloudflare. These are workloads that don’t actually need to run close to the eyeball because there is no eyeball waiting on the request. The challenge is that many of these workloads require running untrusted code — either a dependency on open-source code that we don’t trust enough to run outside of a sandboxed environment, or untrusted code that customers deploy themselves. And unlike <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/"><u>Cron Triggers</u></a>, which already make a best-effort attempt to use off-peak compute, these other workloads can’t run in <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/how-workers-works/#isolates"><u>v8 isolates</u></a>.</p><p>On Builder Day 2024, we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/builder-day-2024-announcements"><u>announced Workers Builds in open beta</u></a>. You connect your Worker to a git repository, and Cloudflare builds and deploys your Worker each time you merge a pull request. Workers Builds run on our containers platform, using otherwise idle “off-peak” compute, allowing us to offer lower pricing, and hold more capacity for unexpected spikes in traffic in Cloudflare locations during daytime hours when load is highest. We preserve our ability to serve requests as close to the eyeball as possible where it matters, while using the full compute capacity of our network.</p><p>We developed a purpose-built API for these types of jobs. The Workers Builds service has zero knowledge of where Cloudflare has spare compute capacity on its network — it simply schedules an “off-peak” job to run on the containers platform, by defining a scheduling policy:</p><p><code>scheduling_policy: "off-peak"</code></p><h2>Making off-peak jobs faster with prewarmed images</h2><p>Just because a workload isn’t “eyeball-facing” doesn’t mean speed isn’t relevant. When a build job starts, you still want it to start as soon as possible.</p><p>Each new build requires a fresh container though, and we must avoid reusing containers to provide strong isolation between customers. How can we keep build job start times low, while using a new container for each job without over-provisioning?&nbsp;</p><p>We prewarm servers with the proper image.&nbsp;</p><p>Before a server becomes eligible to receive an “off peak” job, the container platform instructs it to download the correct image. Once the image is downloaded and cached locally, new containers can start quickly in a Firecracker VM after receiving a request for a new build. When a build completes, we throw away the container, and start the next build using a fresh container based on the prewarmed image.</p><p>Without prewarming, pulling and unpacking our Workers Build images would take roughly 75 seconds. With prewarming, we’re able to spin up a new container in under 10 seconds. We expect this to get even faster as we introduce optimizations like pre-booting images before new runs, or <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/snapshotting/snapshot-support.md"><u>Firecracker snapshotting</u></a>, which can restore a VM in under 200ms.</p><h2>Workers and containers, better together</h2><p>As more of our own engineering teams rely on our containers platform in production, we’ve noticed a pattern: they want a deeper integration with Workers.</p><p>We plan to give it to them.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s take a look at a project deployed on our container platform already, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/key-transparency/"><u>Key Transparency</u></a>. If the container platform were highly integrated with Workers, what would this team’s experience look like?</p><p>Cloudflare regularly audits changes to public keys used by WhatsApp for encrypting messages between users. Much of the architecture is built on Workers, but there are long-running compute-intensive tasks that are better suited for containers.</p><p>We don’t want our teams to have to jump through hoops to deploy a container and integrate with Workers. They shouldn’t have to pick specific regions to run in, figure out scaling, expose IPs and handle IP updates, or set up Worker-to-container auth.</p><p>We’re still exploring many different ideas and API designs, and we want your feedback. But let’s imagine what it might look like to use Workers, Durable Objects and Containers together.</p><p>In this case, an outer layer of Workers handles most business logic and ingress, a specialized Durable Object is configured to run alongside our new container, and the platform ensures the image is loaded on the right metals and can scale to meet demand.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5GsXRuYvVELJY1syOmfq3z/c451ea0686d2d44e4460ec97dbaf2cfe/BLOG-2573_8.png" alt="BLOG-2573 8" width="1162" height="550" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>I add a containerized app to the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/"><code><u>wrangler.toml </u></code><u>configuration file</u></a> of my Worker (or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatically-generating-cloudflares-terraform-provider"><u>Terraform</u></a>):</p>
            <pre><code>[[container-app]]
image = "./key-transparency/verifier/Dockerfile"
name = "verifier"

[durable_objects]
bindings = { name = "VERIFIER", class_name = "Verifier", container = "verifier" } }
</code></pre>
            <p>Then, in my Worker, I call the runVerification <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/"><u>RPC method</u></a> of my Durable Object:</p>
            <pre><code>fetch(request, env, ctx) {
  const id = new URL(request.url).searchParams.get('id')
  const durableObjectId = env.VERIFIER.idFromName(request.params.id);
  await env.VERIFIER.get(durableObjectId).runVerification()
  //...
}
</code></pre>
            <p>From my Durable Object I can boot, configure, mount storage buckets as directories, and make HTTP requests to the container:</p>
            <pre><code>class Verifier extends DurableObject {
  constructor(state, env) {
    this.ctx.blockConcurrency(async () =&gt; {

      // starts the container
      await this.ctx.container.start();

      // configures the container before accepting traffic
      const config = await this.state.storage.get("verifierConfig");
      await this.ctx.container.fetch("/set-config", { method: "PUT", body: config});
    })
  }

  async runVerification(updateId) {
    // downloads &amp; mounts latest updates from R2
    const latestPublicKeyUpdates = await this.env.R2.get(`public-key-updates/${updateId}`);
    await this.ctx.container.mount(`/updates/${updateId}`, latestPublicKeyUpdates);

    // starts verification via HTTP call 
    return await this.ctx.container.fetch(`/verifier/${updateId}`);
  }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>And… that’s it.</p><p>I didn’t have to worry about placement, scaling, service discovery authorization, and I was able to leverage integrations into other services like KV and R2 with just a few lines of code. The container platform took care of routing, placement, and auth. If I needed more instances, I could call the binding with a new ID, and the platform would scale up containers for me.</p><p>We are still in the early stages of building these integrations, but we’re excited about everything that containers will bring to Workers and vice versa.</p><h2>So, what do you want to build?</h2><p>If you’ve read this far, there’s a non-zero chance you were hoping to get to run a container yourself on our network.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Jingjing invited me to her office and asked me to wait for her to finish work before we headed out to dinner together.<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> At the time, she was working in a third-party payment company—what, in the jargon of the money-laundering industry, is known as a ‘gateway’ (通道, <em>tongdao</em>). Like another similar enterprise I had previously visited, their premises was in a dozen hotel rooms above a casino in Sihanoukville that were rented monthly. The managers had replaced the beds with desks and now the business was up and running. As I sat on the couch waiting for Jingjing, the office was filled with the rapid and frequent tapping of keyboards and the constant notification alerts of new Telegram messages. It felt like I had entered the trading hall of a traditional stock exchange, but the work being performed here was very different. The job of Jingjing and her colleagues was to match the right buyers (‘clients’, 客户) and sellers (‘account providers’, 账户供应商) and facilitate transactions in exchange for a commission.</p>



<p>Money-launderers call this type of ‘matchmaking transaction’ (撮合交易) process ‘moving bricks’ (搬砖, <em>banzhuan</em>), in which money is the commodity being moved from one place to another, sometimes through direct transfers between accounts and sometimes by withdrawing cash and then depositing it in other bank accounts. Jingjing told me that if a client entrusts them to receive a sum of money on their behalf, the company will contact an outside team that operates bank accounts, which they refer to as ‘motorcades’ (车队), to prepare to receive the sum. In the words of one of her colleagues with whom I had a chance to speak: ‘We are just natural carriers, acting as middlemen to earn a commission.’ But what is it that they broker?</p>



<p>The term <em>banzhuan </em>has an interesting history. Originally, it literally referred to moving bricks at a construction site; then, by extension, it came to represent any sort of repetitive physical work.Later, Chinese netizens mockingly used the phrase to refer to hard and poorly paid work. At the same time, <em>banzhuan </em>also refers to the commercial practice of buying and selling at a profit or ‘arbitrage’—that is, taking advantage of the difference in the price of goods between different platforms to earn a profit. It is in this last meaning that the term has entered official discourse in law enforcement circles. For instance, in 2022, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate of the People’s Republic of China issued a press release about its investigation of cyber-scam money-laundering channels. It documented a money-laundering case in which a Chinese man frequently bought and sold Tether (a type of cryptocurrency commonly known by the acronym USDT) on different online trading platforms (Jian and Cai 2022). The man claimed he was just ‘moving bricks’ with friends to earn commissions, but in fact he was laundering money for cyber-scam operations.</p>



<p>Indeed, the ‘clients’ to whom Jingjing was referring were cyber-scam companies, which she and her colleagues call <em>pankou </em>(盘口). In the context of the cyber-scam industry, ‘moving bricks’ refers to the activity of assisting or brokering these money-laundering transactions. This is an aspect of the sector that is widely known but so difficult to penetrate that the existing literature often gloss over it, except for a few studies and reports based mostly on blockchain analysis (Reiter and Bitrace Team 2024; Griffin and Mei 2024; UNODC 2024; for valuable journalistic takes, see Keeton-Olsen 2023; Faux 2023). Its existence serves as a reminder of how the cyber-scam industry is a complex industrial chain or ecosystem that includes not only the teams or companies that perpetrate scams, but also those who conduct ancillary activities of money-laundering, personal information buying and selling, software development outsourcing, and so on.</p>



<p>To fill this gap in the literature, I interviewed four employees of three Cambodia-based money-laundering firms, which I call Company P, Company W, and Company G. Some of them shared internal documents with me and showed me the private Telegram groups managed by their companies. I also participated in some of their after-work chats, conducted informal interviews with nearly a dozen stakeholders in the money-laundering industry, and observed related public Telegram groups and websites over several years to understand the ecology of the sector. In particular, the essay presents money-laundering brokerage in Cambodia as occupying a liminal space between the legal and illegal, between risk and trust, and between different financial systems. By outlining the ambiguities and personal reflections on values, ethics, and legitimacy of the actors involved in these illegal activities, I argue that these practices are consistent with neoliberal beliefs in economic rationality and free markets and are intertwined with the institutional environment of Cambodia’s free circulation of US dollars and a thriving underground financial sector that provides a critical infrastructure for the global operations of cyber-scam groups.</p>



<h3>The Gateway as Information Broker: Framing the Information Network</h3>



<p>In the public Telegram groups run by Company P, every day many people post all sorts of supply and demand information related to cyber-scams. You can see bank account providers (the ‘motorcades’) actively promoting their services, claiming that their ‘advantages’ are ‘fast pick-up, large amounts, speed’ or ‘guaranteed time, guaranteed quantity’. There are also companies introducing their scam techniques and seeking to recruit motorcades<em> </em>for long-term cooperation. They require their prospective partners to be ‘safe, smooth, [and] not likely to be caught by the police’. One adds sentimentally: ‘Partners once, friends for a lifetime.’ There are also service providers specialising in finding out why bank accounts are frozen, buyers and sellers of personal information, and scam software outsourcing services. If the actors in this illicit market could work openly in a free market, this would look like a huge cyber-bazaar.</p>



<p>Telegram’s encryption and anonymity provide a readymade technological platform for illicit activity, helping people to overcome information barriers and gaps in the circulation of information. Whereas previously one had to know someone who could provide these types of services, now everything is online for those who know where to look. Company P alone has thousands of groups on Telegram that are used to facilitate transactions and provide a channel for the circulation of information. Most of these groups are publicly accessible (they are called ‘public groups’, 公群), and in them various players in the cyber-scam industry can find business information and establish private relationships with service providers and other actors. Company P draws revenue from advertisements that appear in these groups and from commissions for every transaction conducted through them, for which it also acts as a guarantor.</p>



<p>In addition, ‘gateway’ businesses like Company P often have private groups for specific trades, which they call ‘trading groups’ (交易群). Hezi, an employee of Company W, spends his days in the trading groups matching trades between scam groups, or <em>pankou</em>, and motorcades, then keeping track of the volume of daily trades generated by each transaction for the company’s finance officers to reconcile the bills and settle the commissions. All transactions take place in the Telegram trading groups opened by the gateway company, and the traders work every day to forward the orders and bank account information, and to follow up on the progress of the processing of the scam funds. Hezi describes his job, which follows a repetitive pattern, as ‘copy and paste’. This process and the flow of funds between the scammers in the <em>pankou</em>, the middlemen in the gateway, and the money-laundering motorcade are illustrated in Diagram 1.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1265" src="https://globalchinapulse.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Money-Laundering-Chart-scaled.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://globalchinapulse.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Money-Laundering-Chart-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://globalchinapulse.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Money-Laundering-Chart-300x148.jpeg 300w, https://globalchinapulse.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Money-Laundering-Chart-1024x506.jpeg 1024w, https://globalchinapulse.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Money-Laundering-Chart-768x380.jpeg 768w, https://globalchinapulse.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Money-Laundering-Chart-1536x759.jpeg 1536w, https://globalchinapulse.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Money-Laundering-Chart-2048x1012.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"><figcaption>Diagram 1: Visual depiction of the process and flow of funds between the scammers in the pankou, the middlemen in the gateway, and the money-laundering motorcade. The motorcades who operate money-laundering and the tools they use such as bank accounts together make up what they call the ‘water house’ (水房).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Through Hezi’s simple ‘copy and paste’, the <em>pankou</em> will be matched to a suitable bank account. The scam target then wires the money directly to the bank account provided by the motorcade and the funds, after fees and exchange rate differences are deducted, are settled to the <em>pankou</em> in USDT through the financial settlement of the gateway<em> </em>company—a process also known in Chinese as 卡接回U. ‘It’s like an intermediary platform,’ says Yaya, who works for Company P. Semantically, the Chinese word <em>tongdao</em>, which we chose to translate as ‘gateway’, parallels the English word ‘channel’—a linguistic coincidence that shows the intermediary nature of these businesses, which act as a channel for the circulation of both information and money.</p>



<h3>The Gateway as Money Broker: Framing the Transaction Network</h3>



<p>Using terms such as ‘copy and paste’ and ‘natural carrier’, money-laundering brokers distinguish their role from the scams that generate these funds, emphasising that they function only as a supposedly neutral ‘channel of information’. However, they clearly play a critical role, facilitating the matchmaking of scammers and launderers. In so doing, they inform the rules of the game, with some gateways such as Company P becoming more influential than others as they establish themselves as authoritative actors in the sector.</p>



<p>This resonates with much anthropological literature on brokerage. In the past, anthropologists focused on the role of the broker in integrating cultural and social structures (Wolf 1956; Geertz 1960), such as integrating villages and communities into the nation-state, but this paradigm declined with the collapse of the colonial system. In the 1980s, the neoliberal turn brought about what has been described as ‘the return of the broker’ (Lindquist 2015). Scholars have since increasingly focused on how brokerage generates particular forms and frameworks in this new stage of global transformation. Brokers are no longer seen just as mediators (conveying meaning without transformation), but also as intermediaries, ‘transforming, translating, distorting and modifying the meaning or the elements they are supposed to carry’ (Latour 2007: 39).</p>



<p>Taking investment scams as an example, what happens after someone takes the bait and invests in the fake financial product? First, scam operators will coach them to invest money at certain times, claiming they have privileged information that enables them to predict trends, but also warning that the investment will be profitable only if it is made within minutes. Once the target agrees to proceed, the scam operator will send a message to the Telegram group run by the gateway explaining the currency and amount of money about to be remitted by the scam target. Brokers at the gateway will then send the details to the motorcade group to match bank accounts. After the motorcade group provides the information, the gateway will send the appropriate details and trading rules back to the scam operator.</p>



<p>The ‘trading rules’ provided by Hezi’s gateway company impose a clear limit on the remittance period: within 30 minutes of when the account information is sent. If it takes more than 30 minutes to get the scam target to agree to the transfer, the <em>pankou </em>must ‘place an order’ again. Scam<em> </em>operators endeavour to get their targets to send money to the designated account within the specified time as behind the seemingly simple rule lies a complex act of balance and risk distribution. If the money is not sent within the time limit, the <em>pankou</em> may receive a different bank account when placing another order. This can easily raise the target’s suspicion, which risks them realising that something is amiss. Furthermore, if something goes awry, all risks and costs are borne by the <em>pankou</em>, including compensation for higher bank account fees, frozen funds, and so on.</p>



<p>As for the motorcade, they usually operate many bank accounts at the same time. To avoid banks’ anti–money-laundering (AML) scrutiny, they must strictly control the time interval in which each bank account receives different remittances, as well as the amount of each remittance. To do this and reduce the risk of their accounts being frozen or closed, they work with people with professional AML knowledge and experience. Moreover, when the money in a bank account reaches a certain amount, they must dispose of it in a timely manner in ways that suit the banking system of the country in which the account is located. For instance, motorcades located in China might choose to withdraw the funds, deposit them into another, unrelated bank account, and then convert them into US dollars or USDT, which usually takes less than two hours.</p>



<p>Motorcades also adapt their money-laundering strategies to the AML policies of the country in which the bank account is opened. In recent years many people in China have sold their bank accounts to scam gangs and other illicit actors for often paltry sums of money. In response, the Chinese authorities have taken harsh measures, beginning with a ‘Card-Breaking Operation’ (断卡行动) launched in 2020 (Ministry of Public Security 2020). This crackdown has been successful in tracing and freezing large amounts of funds and bank accounts involved in money-laundering. As a result, Chinese motorcades gradually moved away from the ‘old way’ of dispersing funds to different accounts through online transfers and began to go directly to bank counters to withdraw cash and then deposit it into different accounts. This method is more expensive, as motorcades must sometimes fly people to different locations to physically withdraw funds, but it is also much harder for authorities to track.</p>



<p>Gateway businesses must coordinate the work of <em>pankou</em> and motorcades and, in so doing, must keep up to speed with the AML policies of each country to avoid conflicts or disputes as much as possible. Thus, money-laundering brokers serve as a channel to circulate information and facilitate cross-border transactions, but also reconcile the different scales of market rules and conflicts, which include not only patterns of interactions between scam operators and scam targets, but also specialised knowledge in operating accounts in accordance with the financial systems of different countries. As well as requiring specific expertise, this helps shape the market for international illicit transactions.</p>



<h3>The Gateway as Arbitrator: Risk Redistribution</h3>



<p>As intermediaries and platforms for matching scam operators and motorcades dispersed all over the world, gateway businesses also act as an arbitrator and guarantor. As mentioned, the target of the scam does not send money directly to the <em>pankou</em>; rather, the money first passes through the motorcade and gateway, which makes the process fraught with uncertainty and potential risk.</p>



<p>Stories of people ‘running away with the money’ (卷钱跑路) often circulate on Chinese-language social media in Cambodia. For instance, one Chinese broker whom I met three years ago in Sihanoukville was wanted by the owner of a cyber-scam operation, who had put out a reward notice to try to get ‘his’ money back and possibly exact revenge. This man, who was working on his own, had not settled the money with the <em>pankou</em> after receiving it from the motorcade, and had instead absconded with it. To prevent such occurrences, <em>pankou</em> and motorcades usually seek a guarantor or arbitrator to guarantee the transaction, and in most cases this role falls to a gateway that has a ‘good reputation’ in the industry, such as Company P. The mechanism is like that of a guarantor bank in international trade, which holds the money during the period between the shipment and the delivery of goods.</p>



<p>Xin, an employee of Company G, mentioned to me that her company owned its own money-laundering motorcade. To prevent foul play, <em>pankou</em> would usually ask them to pay a deposit (上押) to Company P before the transaction begins:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is the one who receives the money [on behalf of others] that has to pay the deposit … First, you talk about the rules and regulations—that is, rules like, if the money is dead [死钱, meaning that the bank account has been frozen], who is responsible for that … Then there are practical situations, [such as] which party is responsible to pay—if it is the demand side [the <em>pankou</em>] or the supply side [the motorcade]. Then it is up to the two sides to provide evidence and, if there is a dispute, to see which evidence is more convincing and then pay to the other party accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>More specifically, during the transaction, Company P’s staff will act as an arbitrator and create a private group on Telegram (one of the ‘trading groups’ mentioned above) where the motorcade and <em>pankou</em> share their own trading rules. After both parties agree, the staff of Company P will collect a deposit from the motorcade. Once the transaction amount exceeds the deposited amount, the motorcade must settle the balance of the payment before any further transactions can occur. Should the scam continue and bring in more funds, the motorcade can repeat the process and transfer funds against its original deposit, provided it settles the earlier transaction. The gateway arbitrator keeps track of the amount of each transaction through a bookkeeping bot inserted in the Telegram group and takes a commission.</p>



<p>When a transaction dispute occurs, the gateway will ask both parties to provide evidence. Acting as an arbitrator, the broker will not directly decide which party is liable for the loss but wait for both parties to reach a consensus. If the dispute remains unresolved, Company P will continue to withhold the deposit. The arbitration regulates the allocation of risk in an illicit transaction and ensures that the motorcade will not run away with the money, while at the same time forming a flexible arbitration system.</p>



<p>Transaction disputes are often triggered by the freezing of bank accounts, which Simon, an employee at Company P, calls ‘risk-control risk’ (风控风险). It is an ironic term that refers to a risk caused by state and bank AML regulations, which Simon also calls the ‘friction cost’ for a company. Since there are risks, there are risk controls, and Simon’s work is to ‘control the risk-control risk’ by developing standard operating procedures for employees to avoid exposing the company to losses due to operational errors by their staff. By means of ‘internal risk control’, gateway businesses attempt to transfer the risks resulting from state regulation outside the company.</p>



<p>When Hezi first joined Company W, he participated in internal training. The manager familiarised staff with the trading rules, after which they had to pass an exam arranged by the company. The purpose of these rules is to provide grounds to argue with clients in case of disputes.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For example, 100,000 dollars come and then the account is frozen, but the money is in the account. But the account was frozen before the maintenance period [that is, a period during which the <em>pankou </em>is bound by the gateway to keep up the pretence of a legitimate investment with the scam target] was up, so … this is a [scam target] who transferred it in, and then reported the account [to the police]. It is because of the client that the money was frozen, but the <em>pankou </em>denies this … So, we have to show the rules and tell them: ‘Your payment wasn’t frozen because of us’ … That’s why we have to know the rules, so we can clear it with the client; otherwise, sometimes the client … will play dumb, he pretends that he doesn’t know the rules.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Safe Harbour Off the Land</h3>



<p>US dollars circulate freely in Cambodia today. After Pol Pot destroyed the country’s monetary system during the Khmer Rouge era (1975–79), the United Nations temporarily took over national administration in 1991–93 and the Cambodian economy was rehabilitated through multilateral and bilateral international aid (Xiao et al. 2020). A large volume of US dollars flowed into Cambodia, creating a dual monetary system in which both US dollars and Khmer riel circulate. Although the government has been actively encouraging the increased use of the riel in recent years, this system remains today and has spawned a variety of underground financial networks. The free flow of US dollars constitutes an important infrastructure for the development of the money-laundering industry, as brokers like the gateway businesses discussed in this essay usually trade in US dollars and the US dollar-pegged Tether (or USDT). Both the large Company P and the smaller Company G provide their services to<em> pankou</em> based not only in Cambodia, but also in Myanmar, the Philippines, and other countries. Their transnational business model is well expounded by a corporate slogan for Company P that was related to me by its CEO: ‘Rooted in Cambodia, looking to Southeast Asia, going global’ (扎根柬埔寨, 放眼东南亚, 走向全世界).</p>



<p>After decades of growth, the cyber-scam industry has developed into a behemoth that targets people all over the world. The actors providing money-laundering services for scam operators have expanded accordingly, and some have public-facing businesses and are well-known for their seemingly legitimate parallel business endeavours. Of the three brokerage companies I observed, Company P legally holds a Cambodian Payment Service Institution licence. In addition to its gateway<em> </em>business, this company has developed a money farm (钱庄, a traditional type of banking service with a long history in China), fiat currency exchange, cryptocurrency exchange, and a diverse range of other businesses. It also has a bank that legally holds a banking licence. Announcements in Company P’s official Telegram group (which is public) show that their gatewaybusiness already covers more than 20 countries and regions, making it one of the largest such businesses in Cambodia.</p>



<p>The ‘actual global’, as Ong and Collier (2005) put it, is loaded with heterogeneity and instability, while at the same time it has a distinctive capacity for de-contextualisation and re-contextualisation, with various technologies and values constantly reassembling. In a world of globalised flows of commodities, interactions between the legal and the illegal constitute the context in which we live (Nordstrom 2007). At the same time, interactions between the licit and the illicit reshape perspectives on the political legitimacy of those engaged in illegal activities (Roitman 2007). Brokers, as intermediaries connecting two or more worlds, not only graft local and global markets, but also connect the legal and illegal worlds. My interviewee Simon says that people like him and his colleagues ‘are not creating a new market, they’re solving a very old problem of getting into the banking system people who have long been shut out of it’. Such market needs have always existed. He used an analogy to describe the service they provide:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s put it this way … It’s like a merchant ship, a cargo ship, a ship that can legally dock at the pier, as opposed to a pirate ship, which has no licence or a black flag. Well, there is no way for a pirate ship to dock, they will not let you dock. This kind of ship will always be floating in the sea. Then we are kind of floating on the sea, kind of like a small centre, kind of like a harbour off the land, especially for all pirate ships to come here to spend and unload. This is the kind of feeling. It’s not a country; it’s not a port; it’s just a place where you don’t know how many ships are coming tomorrow and you don’t know how many are going to leave … But we’re just another channel for ships that don’t have a way to dock. Yes, another solution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In conversations with various global outlaws, Nordstrom has found that they do not understand the world in terms of legal versus illegal, but rather in terms of ‘what works best’, which coincides with Simon’s view. For Simon, their work is like ‘playing with the rules’ (玩规则), playing with different market actors, playing with different countries’ financial systems, and exploring how to do things without going through ‘due process’. Situated in Cambodia, these brokers are protected by powerful partners and the local government and participate in the country’s legal economy, but their activities are also connected to a massive international money-laundering network. Embedded in the discourse of the ‘market’, the ambiguous border between legality and illegality continues to challenge our thinking about politics, economics, and ethics.</p>



<p>The scale of the cyber-scam industry continues to grow. With policy changes in Southeast Asian countries, cyber-scam operators are gradually migrating from places like Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos to West Africa, Georgia, and the United Arab Emirates. Maizi, an employee of an online gaming company who I have known for a long time, has spent the past three years moving from Cambodia to Dubai, then back to the company’s earliest home base in Manila. No matter where these businesses move,<em> </em>gateway brokers can handle their money transfer needs remotely while sitting in their offices in Cambodia.</p>



<p>This essay has sketched the network of the illicit money market in terms of an intermediary practice. From the practices of the actors I discussed, we can see that this underground market is still forming and transforming. This illicit market network is full of uncertainty and resilience, just like the neoliberal world we experience every day. Through these brokers’ interactions with financial markets and online scams in different regions and the process of reconciliation at different scales, a large, complex, and multifaceted underground financial market is penetrating all corners of the world.</p>



<p>The CEO of Company P shared with me his view on cyber-scams. For him, the distinction between legal and illegal is an issue of power rather than law and behind it lies the question of ‘who has the power to define what is illegal?’. Power, in turn, depends on access to social resources. In international money-laundering transactions, the actors involved are often at war with the financial systems of different countries and know how to play with their rules. In Cambodia, they can get the payment service provider and banking licences they need to enter the Cambodian financial system and build apparently legitimate fronts, but it would be a mistake to blame this exclusively on the shortcomings of the Cambodian political and financial systems: some companies have also obtained cryptocurrency exchange licences in a compliant manner in European countries. They hold the romantic view of themselves as bandits who ‘rob the rich to give to the poor’ in a cruel capitalist world, but ironically, at best, they only ‘rob from the rich’ (and even that claim is highly questionable), never giving anything to the poor. The truth is more prosaic: they are just the last representatives in a long line of ‘entrepreneurs who use private, formally unlicensed violence as a means of social control and economic accumulation’ (Sidel 1999: 71–72).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							        
									<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p>In the movies, spies are usually ripped hunks who carry lots of gadgets, like James Bond and Jason Bourne. That’s rarely the case in real life, however. When the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA, was established in haste at the outset of WWII, the spies tapped to join were librarians, professors, and researchers quite literally pulled from college campuses.</p><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p>
<p>They proved to be uniquely suited to the job of discerning intel buried in mountains of documents, traveling to far-flung archives in occupied territories and weaseling their way in, and generally slipping under the radar as the bookish types they were, in order to gather and deliver highly sensitive information. Some of them were sent to learn the real rules of spycraft at the training schools of the Special Operations Executive, Britain’s clandestine intelligence agency.</p>
<p>Some of the instructors there were burned agents who had returned from the field; others had never been agents themselves, but had expertise in other fields that turned out to be remarkably useful for spycraft. The school’s first explosives instructor was Bill Cumper, a boisterous character who walked around with his pockets full of bomb parts and “a detonator behind his ear as if it were a cigarette.” Cumper was an army engineer who knew, as all army engineers do, that the world has two kinds of engineering journals: civil engineering journals, which explain how to build bridges, and military engineering journals, which explain how to blow up those same bridges.</p>
<span>It might seem like a self-evident fact: spies don’t act like spies; they act like normal people.</span>
<p>Paul Dehn, who taught propaganda, worked in civilian life as a reporter and movie critic. After the war, he wrote the screenplays for the movies <em>Goldfinger</em>, <em>The Spy Who Came In from the Cold</em>, and <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>. Ralph Vibert, a lawyer, used his courtroom experience to teach students how to hold up under interrogation. Peter Folis, an actor, taught cover stories and disguises. And Nobby Clark, that wilderness survival instructor who tended game on the king’s estate, used his experience with fighting poachers when he taught students how to become poachers themselves. A good poacher must know a variety of ways to set snares for rabbits, to stalk birds, to knock out fish, to hide his tracks so the authorities can’t find him. Clark threw in instruction on how to set traps big enough to catch human beings, which was reportedly one way he fended off poachers at Sandringham.</p>
<p>SOE schools often had shelves of selected spy fiction available for students to read in their free time. The message seemed to be that, in the absence of a more established form of schooling, students could pick up tips on how to be spies by reading spy novels. SOE-approved titles included Helen MacInnes’s <em>Assignment in Brittany</em> (1942), about an intrepid English spy who goes undercover in France; Geoffrey Household’s <em>Rogue Male</em> (1939), about an intrepid English hunter who finds himself hunted by, and who then hunts down, a Hitler expy; and John Buchan’s <em>The Thirty-Nine Steps</em> (1915), then England’s most famous spy story, about an intrepid English amateur detective who foils a German invasion of England.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>These novels favored high romance over the low practicalities of spycraft; yet they also managed to understate its dangers. As the students who moved through Beaulieu would come to learn in the field, the reality was far deadlier. Nora Inayat Khan, who at one point was the only uncaptured radio operator in all of Paris, was shot, together with three other women agents, in the Dachau concentration camp. Vera Leigh, who was a couture garment maker in civilian life, and whose instructors praised how nimble her fingers were when she wired up explosives, died a horrible death in the Natzweiler concentration camp, where a camp official injected her with a paralyzing agent and then threw her, alive, into a furnace. Andrée Borrel and Diana Rowden, two other SOE agents, died in the same way. One staffer estimated that half of the women who infiltrated France for the SOE died in action, and their deaths were often so cruel and degraded that no novelist would use the stories.</p>
<p>As a result, agents often carried suicide pills—so-called L pills, made from potassium cyanide—to give themselves an easier death than the Nazis would. As a general rule, you could have either a weapon or a cover, but not both; being caught with a gun or a knife, to say nothing of some hybrid shoe-dagger-radio from a spy novel, would give the lie to whatever innocent cover story an agent might give her interrogators. But you could carry a newspaper and keep in your head the knowledge of how to fold it into a weapon. You could carry a matchbox and hope that your combat instructor was right about being able to use it to disarm a gunman. And you could carry a little rubber-coated pill in the lining of your handkerchief—and hope that, when the moment came, you had time to take it.</p>
<p>It might seem like a self-evident fact: spies don’t act like spies; they act like normal people. But in novels and movies, which had furnished the students with all they knew about spycraft, spies <em>don’t</em> act like normal people; they act in ways designed precisely to satisfy the expectations that an audience brings to a spy story. Perhaps that’s why, again and again, the training at Allied spy schools stressed the difference between spycraft in fiction and in real life.</p>
<p>If you’re a spy, and you want to use a secret passphrase to identify yourself to someone you’re meeting in a park or on a street corner, you shouldn’t choose a passphrase like “The black falcon flies at midnight,” because everyone who overhears you will know you’re a spy. They’ve all been to the movies. Instead, you should choose something belligerent, because then the call-and-response will seem like some loser picking a fight on a bad day. A real password exchange between spies might go:</p>
<p>“Nice hat, chump.”</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>“What the hell’s your problem?”</p>
<p>This was just one of many lessons on the real lives of spies that filled the curriculum at Beaulieu, which was designed to be dense, specific, and relentlessly practical. Instructors would have to counter popular ideas about spy behavior at every turn while training these spycraft novices, setting out guidelines from their first moments undercover—to potentially their last.</p>
<p>An agent, regardless of whether she is working in a neutral or an occupied country, should set about assembling a network of informants from the day she enters the field, the instructors at Beaulieu told their students. Most informants don’t know they’re informants, so the network should appear, even to its members, to be an innocent scandal society of people who like to gossip and are in a position to hear the latest stories: for example, bankers, café staff, clergymen, doctors, dressmakers, hairdressers, hotel staff, launderers, mail carriers, railroad employees, shopkeepers, or telephone operators. If the agent is <em>very</em> bold, she might make an informant of a police officer.</p>
<p>The agent’s method should not be to drill her informants with questions about sensitive topics—how gauche, how obvious—but rather to encourage “careless talk.” Trifling gossip over cups of <em>café national</em>, the famously terrible rationed coffee of Occupied France. If she wants to know something specific, but doesn’t want people to notice her asking questions, she should simply make incorrect statements while in the company of experts. Her companions will correct her, especially if they’re men.</p>
<span>Even the classic spy tropes, like invisible ink and secret codes, had to take the most prosaic of forms. The easiest forms to overlook.</span>
<p>The scoops she gets from her informants will help her to survive, help her fellow agents to survive, and help the Baker Street Irregulars back home figure out exactly how to wage their irregular warfare. If the Germans roll out new planes or guns, what’s new in the design? (No detail is unimportant. The British were able to distinguish different enemy air squadrons by counting the blades in the propellers.) Have more trains been moving through town recently? Have the police suddenly suspended the civilian use of some roads? Are lots of new soldiers in town? Are soldiers in town complaining about their leave being canceled? (Those last details might indicate preparations for a military strike.)</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>Women had a reputation for performing well as couriers, so the SOE and the OSS often reserved this role for women agents. Women didn’t need to explain to the Gestapo why they weren’t off fighting; women faced no danger of getting caught in a <em>rafle</em>, one of the periodic raids in which the Gestapo seized the local men who happened to be out on the street and put them on a train to work in some German factory; and women could carry around bulky baskets, big enough to hold, say, a twenty-pound radio transmitter, since a layer of vegetables atop their real cargo was enough to show they were simply out shopping.</p>
<p>(Once, a courier in France named Maureen O’Sullivan, while she was moving the radio to a new location on her bicycle, was standing at an intersection when a Gestapo agent leaned out of the window of a nearby car, gestured at the weekend suitcase leashed to her bicycle, and demanded to know what was in it. She gave him a dazzling smile and replied, “I’ve got a radio transmitter and I’m going to contact London and tell them all about you.” He scolded her for joking—“You’re far too pretty to risk your neck with such stupidities”—and went on his way.)</p>
<p>Radio operators would give coded messages to couriers, and the couriers would deliver them to their associates. The women at Beaulieu learned how to write messages in code and invisible ink, so that they could leave letters in a “letter box” in a library or a bookstore or the forest for associates to find. They learned how to write “Innocent Letters” that appeared to be innocent <em>billets-doux</em> or picture postcards or reminders to do the shopping. They learned more about paper and ink than many archivists do in a lifetime.</p>
<p>If you want to write with invisible ink, you should use plain matte paper and a dip pen, making sure the nib never scrapes the page. You can make good invisible inks from alum powder (tell a pharmacist you have aching feet), lead acetate (you have swollen joints), or ammonia (you want to clean jewelry); or, in a pinch, you can spread Vaseline on a page, let it dry, set the page on top of the Innocent Letter with the Vaseline facing down, and apply your pen to the page on top.</p>
<p>Boffins at Liverpool University worked on devising ever more elaborate invisible inks, but here, as in most other aspects of spycraft, simplicity and shrewdness beat spy-fiction science. The enemy can’t find a secret message on a page they don’t look at, so crumple up a “blank” sheet with invisible ink on it and throw it next to some tree in the woods like an old food wrapper. Use handwriting instead of a typewriter, since a motivated sleuth can track down a specific typewriter. No need for a color-changing microdot to tell you whether an envelope’s been opened; just tip in some cigarette ashes, as if you were smoking as you wrote.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>If you encrypt your message with a cipher, you don’t need a personal Enigma machine; you just need a book. Include in the letter a five-digit number—37016, for instance—that will tell your correspondent (who has agreed in advance on what book to use) the page (61), line (7), and first n number of words (3) to read as the secret message. If you don’t have two copies of the same book, you can just commit the same poem to memory, then use a more complicated system involving keywords from the poem to encrypt your message.</p>
<p>Once again, even the classic spy tropes, like invisible ink and secret codes, had to take the most prosaic of forms. The easiest forms to overlook.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Collaborative text editing algorithms allow several users to concurrently modify a text file, and automatically merge concurrent edits into a consistent state. Existing algorithms fall in two categories: Operational Transformation (OT) algorithms are slow to merge files that have diverged substantially due to offline editing; CRDTs are slow to load and consume a lot of memory. We introduce Eg-walker, a collaboration algorithm for text that avoids these weaknesses. Compared to existing CRDTs, it consumes an order of magnitude less memory in the steady state, and loading a document from disk is orders of magnitude faster. Compared to OT, merging long-running branches is orders of magnitude faster. In the worst case, the merging performance of Eg-walker is comparable with existing CRDT algorithms. Eg-walker can be used everywhere CRDTs are used, including peer-to-peer systems without a central server. By offering performance that is competitive with centralised algorithms, our result paves the way towards the widespread adoption of peer-to-peer collaboration software.

<div id="article-body">
<p>Last winter, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took a whirlwind tour of the Far East, meeting with high-powered execs from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-is-talking-to-tsmc-about-ai-chip-venture" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-is-talking-to-tsmc-about-ai-chip-venture">companies like TSMC</a>, Samsung, and SK Hynix, but he didn't make the best first impression. According to a report in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/business/openai-plan-electricity.html" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/business/openai-plan-electricity.html" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">New York Times</a> this week, senior TSMC execs allegedly dubbed the OpenAI chief a “podcasting bro” after the meeting(s) after his absurd requests for 36 new chipmaking plants that would cost an astounding $7 trillion. The NYT claims it discussed OpenAI's negotiations with nine people close to the discussions but who wish to remain anonymous.</p><p>Altman used his multi-stop trip to pitch his plans to progress AI, involving Asia's manufacturing muscle, Middle Eastern money, and U.S. regulators. The NYT sources say that the scale of investment would be in trillions of dollars – similar in size to a quarter of U.S. annual output for a year. However, the latest OpenAI statements have rolled back such talk to "mere" hundreds of billions. It is reported that years of construction time would also be needed to satisfy the OpenAI compute scaling plans.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="moonshot-dreams-crash-to-earth-at-tsmc-3">Moonshot dreams crash to earth at TSMC</h2><p>The OpenAI CEO is noted for his ambition. Perhaps Altman is right to have an abundance of confidence in his vision and moonshot-style plans after taking just a few years to become one of the most influential names in tech. Nevertheless, his plans have allegedly not stirred confidence in the hard-nosed execs at TSMC.</p><p>The NYT report claims that during Altman’s visit to Taiwan, he told TSMC execs that he envisioned a $7 trillion investment over several years. The result would be 36 new semiconductor plants and data centers driving AI forward. TSMC execs allegedly found Altman’s ideas absurd, and according to one of the NYT’s sources, the chipmaking execs subsequently called Altman a “podcasting bro.” Even implementing a fraction of the OpenAI CEO’s ideas would be incredibly risky, the execs are said to have openly pondered.</p><p>This dismissive attitude to OpenAI’s ambition dovetails with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/new-tsmc-chairman-cc-wei-brands-openais-sam-altman-too-aggressive-for-me-to-believe" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/new-tsmc-chairman-cc-wei-brands-openais-sam-altman-too-aggressive-for-me-to-believe">a report we published</a> this summer. During TSMC’s 2024 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, newly elected chairman Dr. C. C. Wei was quoted as making several controversial statements. On the OpenAI CEO, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/new-tsmc-chairman-cc-wei-brands-openais-sam-altman-too-aggressive-for-me-to-believe" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/new-tsmc-chairman-cc-wei-brands-openais-sam-altman-too-aggressive-for-me-to-believe">Wei is quoted</a> as saying, "Sam Altman, he’s too aggressive, too aggressive for me to believe."&nbsp;</p><p>Altman also visited South Korea to talk with high-level Samsung and SK hynix representatives at around the same time. However, negotiations were cut short by national <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security">security</a> concerns, indicates the NYT, as back then, countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) maintained relationships with China.</p><p>Things may be different for tech plans involving the UAE now, as earlier this week, President Biden and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the Emirati president, met at the White House and directed their senior officials to develop a memorandum detailing future collaboration on AI. Earlier this week, we reported on the latest rumors regarding&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/chip-giants-tsmc-and-samsung-reportedly-mull-building-mega-factories-in-the-uae" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/chip-giants-tsmc-and-samsung-reportedly-mull-building-mega-factories-in-the-uae">TSMC and Samsung mega factories in the UAE</a>.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-evLhbMAoep8KhjJP9bjav3"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><p>The NYT highlights a lot of uncertainty about OpenAI’s incredibly ambitious plans. Details about who would put in what, and what they would get from their investments, remain hazy. However, firms such as the Emirates tech investment specialist MGX, plus household tech titans like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, Nvidia, and Apple, were named as still being in talks with OpenAI.</p><h2 id="ai-continues-to-be-a-money-pit-with-no-killer-app-3">AI continues to be a money pit with no killer app</h2><p>OpenAI’s business model, as it exists today, doesn’t really inspire confidence, as it seems to exist on the promise of ‘jam tomorrow.’ Specifically, the firm has an income of approximately $3 billion per year, which is put in deep shade by its $7 billion annual expenditure.</p><p>Altman’s grand plan seems to stem from his theory that AI will be like electricity. As AI becomes more readily available, people will find more and better ways to use it. But at the time of writing, &nbsp;leading tech companies can’t find a killer app for AI.

  <time datetime="2024-09-27T00:00:00Z">2024-09-27</time>
  <p>Writing code for a computer is hard enough.
You take something big and fuzzy, some large vague business outcome you want to achive.
Then you break it down recursively and think about all the cases until you have clear logical statements a computer can follow.
Computers are very good at following logical statements.</p>
<p>Now, let's crank it up a notch.
Let's try to write code for <em>humans</em>!</p>
<p>I need to clarify what I mean.
I'm talking about code that other humans will interact with.
More specifically, I'm talking about the art of crafting joyful frameworks, libraries, APIs, SDKs, DSLs, embedded DSLs, or maybe even programming languages.</p>
<p>Writing this code is much harder, because you're not just telling a computer what to do, you're also grappling with another user's mental model of <em>your</em> code.
Now it's equal part computer science and psychology of reasoning, or something.
How do you get that person to understand <em>your</em> code?</p>
<p>Feynman famously said: <em>Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.</em> about something very different, but in a funny way I think this describes programming for humans a bit.
The person interpreting <em>your</em> code actually has feelings!</p>
<p>Let's talk about some ways we can make it easier.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-_is_-the-product">Getting started <em>is</em> the product</h2>
<p>It's obviously great to listen to your users and take their feedback into account.
As it turns out, most of that feedback will come from power users who use your product all the time!</p>
<p>How does that affect the distribution of the feedback you're getting?
Will it be skewed?
And what does this picture of an airplane have to do with it?</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/dev-tools/survivorship-bias.png" alt="survivorship bias"></p>
<p>Of course, there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a> going on here.
There are users who don't use your tool because they never get started.
You will typically never hear their feedback!</p>
<p>Consumer products have had growth hackers for many years optimizing every part of the onboarding funnel.
Dev tools should do the same.
Getting started shouldn't be an afterthought after you built the product.
Getting started <em>is</em> the product!</p>
<p>And I mean this to the point where I think it's worth restructuring your entire product to enable fast onboarding.
Get rid of mandatory config.
Make it absurdly easy to set up API tokens.
Remove all the friction.
Make it possible for users to <em>use your product</em> on their laptop in a couple of minutes, tops.</p>
<p>You might dismiss this as, I don't know, “who cares about lazy users”.
Then let me lean back on my bean bag chair, open a bag of Doritos, and explain something:</p>
<p>There's currently 7,000,000,000 dev tools out there.
Users don't have a ton of energy or patience to go deep and try to understand what's different about your LRU cache NPM package or whatever.
Sorry!</p>
<h2 id="humans-learn-from-examples-not-from-core-concepts">Humans learn from examples, not from “core concepts”</h2>
<p>Humans are amazing pattern matching machines, in contrast to computers who obey Boolean logic and follow strict instructions.
It's common to see documentation for dev tools structured like a computer program.
It starts with defines a core data model and the relations and the atoms.
It starts with “core concepts” and how to configure and how to run things.</p>
<p>Humans don't learn about things this way.</p>
<p>Two seconds after writing the above paragraph, I ran into this on Twitter which basically captures what I'm trying to say:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Too many programming books and tutorials are like “let’s build a house starting from scratch, brick by brick” when what I want to “here is a functioning house, let’s learn about it by changing something and then seeing what happens”</p>— Chris Albon (@chrisalbon) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon/status/1831497223076770217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote>



<p>Instead of writing an 5,000 word “core concepts” chronicle, may I suggest putting together a dozen examples instead.
This has a few benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans will look at the examples and learn how your tool works from that. This is how humans learn!</li>
<li>A person with a problem in mind will look for a starting point that's <em>close enough</em>.
The more potential starting points, the more likely they are to have something that's closer to what they need.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="falling-into-the-pit-of-success">Falling into the pit of success</h2>
<p>The sad but true part of programming is, the default mode is that you're fixing an error of some sort.
This means that users are going to spend the majority of the time with your tool trying to figure out what's not working.
Which is why pushing them back into success is so core.</p>
<p>A succinct list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developers getting to success faster are happy developers.
They will like your tool.</li>
<li>Developers banging their heads against errors are sad developers.
They will blame your tool.</li>
</ol>
<p>Think about every error as an opportunity to nudge a user towards the happy path.
Put code snippets in the exceptions.
Emit helpful warnings when users are likely to do something weird.
Do what you got to do to make the user succeed.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-conceptual-overload">Avoid conceptual overload</h2>
<p>Every new conceptual <em>thing</em> you have to understand before using the tool makes is a new friction point. If it's 2-3 <em>things</em>, that's fine. But no one is going to bother learning 8 new concepts.</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/dev-tools/kubernetes.png" alt="kubernetes"></p>
<p>This example (Kubernetes) isn't even particularly egregious. You can get started just knowing a few of these. I mean you can find worse ones out there</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/dev-tools/databricks-terraform.png" alt="databricks terraform"></p>
<p>It's probably true you don't need the vast majority to get started.
But still, my head hurts when I have to learn new <em>things</em>.
Too many <em>things</em>!</p>
<p>There's something elegant about a framework with just 3-5 <em>things</em> that manages to be incredibly powerful.
I remember the feeling when I tried React the first time and got over the conceptual hump after an hour or two.
Just a few fairly simple building blocks that lets you build a whole cathedral. Magic stuff ✨.</p>
<p>To be clear, the challenge isn't to reduce concepts.
It's to <em>retain the possible set of things you can build</em> while reducing concepts.
Or at least reducing the former less than the latter.
I'm mentioning this because I picture some sort of a “dumb dev tools simplification doom loop” that goes something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/dev-tools/doomloop.png" alt="doom loop"></p>
<p>I don't know if this is a thing, but my point here is that there's a level of futility of “bad” simplification.
You ultimately want to push the frontier describing the tradeoff between “complexity” (what you need to know) and “ability” (what you can build).
Amazing tools are able to reduce complexity by 90% while keeping the ability the same,
But I'll also take a tool that reduces the former by 90% and reduces the latter by 10%.
That's still not bad!</p>
<h2 id="conceptual-duck-principle">Conceptual duck principle</h2>
<p>Somewhat related to the previous point, let's say in your framework you introduce a thing that takes some values and evalutes to a new values. What do you call it? A compute node? A valuator? A frobniscator?</p>
<p>No! You call it a <em>function</em>!</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/dev-tools/duck.jpg" alt="duck"></p>
<p>If it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, it probably <em>is</em> a duck.</p>
<p>Maybe it isn't exactly like a function in some subtle ways. Maybe the values are cached for instance. But that's close enough!</p>
<p>Calling it a <em>function</em> means you latch onto a users pre-existing mental model of what a function does. Which will save you like, 90% of the explanation of how to think about this object.</p>
<h2 id="programmability">Programmability</h2>
<p>People will do crazy things with your codebase.
They will take your things and put it inside a for-loop inside a function inside something else.
People are creative!</p>
<p>You want almost everything in your framework to be “programmable” for this reason.</p>
<p>This is a whole class of issues that are related in subtle ways.
Letting users call things directly in code rather than going through a CLI.
Avoiding config and making things directly part of an SDK or an API.
Making things easily to parametrize so you can create <em>n</em> things not just 1.</p>
<p>One weird benefit of this is it often lets users discover new use cases for you.
Harness people's desire to “hack” on top of your framework.
There will be some mild bloodshed coming from those users, but don't chastise them!
They might be on the verge of discovering something unexpected.</p>
<h2 id="be-extra-judicious-about-magic-defaults-and-syntactic-sugar">Be extra judicious about magic, defaults, and syntactic sugar</h2>
<p>Let's say you're building a tool that executes a Jupyter notebook in the cloud.
So you have a function <code>run_notebook</code> that takes a list of cells (with computer code) or something.</p>
<p>How does the user specify which container image they should use?
You have a few different option:</p>
<ol>
<li>An argument <code>image=...</code> that <em>always</em> has to be provided.</li>
<li>An argument <code>image=...</code> that defaults to some base image with “most” data science libraries pre-installed, but that they user can override.</li>
<li>You inspect the code in the cells and pick an image in a “magic” way based on what dependencies are needed.</li>
<li>Same as above, but you also let users optionally specify a specific image.</li>
</ol>
<p>What should you use? If you want to minimize the amount of typing for users, while supporting the widest possible set of use cases, go for the last option.
But here are some issues with all options except the first one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's be real — the magic will break in some % of situations.</li>
<li>Users reading code that relies on defaults will not realize that things are customizeable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless defaults apply in 97%+ of the time, and unless magic applies 99% of the time, be careful about introducing it.
These are not exact numbers obviously, but my point is, you need to be very very judicious.</p>
<p>It's tempting to think that job as a tool provider is to minimize the amount of code a user has to write.
But coding isn't golf!</p>
<p>I think about this a bit about how I think about Perl vs Python.
Perl tried very hard to optimize for shortest code until every program looked like a strong of special characters and nothing else.
Then Python came and it's code was 50% longer.
It never tried to be the shortest!
But it turned out Python code was super readable and thus much more understandable.
And people read code 10x more times than they write it.</p>
<p>Syntactic sugar belongs in a similar category.
It's tempting to introduce a special syntax for the most common use cases.
But it often obscures the consistency and makes it less clear how to customize code.
For similar reasons, unless the syntactic sugar applies 99%+ of the time, it's probably not a good idea to introduce it.</p>
<h2 id="writing-code-for-humans-is-hard">Writing code for humans is hard</h2>
<p>We are coming to an end, but there are so many more things I could keep going on about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most things (but not everything) should be immutable</li>
<li>Avoid “scaffolding” (code generation)</li>
<li>Make the feedback loops incredibly fast</li>
<li>Make deprecations easy for users to deal with</li>
<li>Use automated testing for code snippets in docs and examples</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably a lot more.
Those are maybe things for a future blog post!
Including what I think is maybe the most fascinating thing: why large companies are generally incapable of delivering great developer experience.</p>
<p>I sometimes think the challenge of designing for the 1st time user is similar to making a pop song. The producer will listen to the song a thousand times. But still the 999th time they hear it, they need to <em>imagine what it sounds like to a person that hears it the first time,</em> which seems… super hard.</p>
<p>This is probably why I ended up building dev tools rather than producing pop songs.</p>

    <p>Unless you have been living under a rock for the last few years, you probably have seen the same massive surge I’ve seen in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to pretty much every problem out there, in software testing, in software development, and in life in general.</p>

<p>Now, I am all for finding and developing new solutions to existing problems, but boy, am I tired of AI, of how it is used and of how it is marketed.</p>

<p>Every tech fart smelling of ‘AI’ these days is almost instantly labeled as a ‘game changer’, only to be replaced by the next ‘pivotal’ and ‘revolutionary’ ‘solution’ the next week.</p>

<p>Yes, I realize that thinking like this and writing this make me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism" target="_blank">Neo-Luddite</a> in your eyes. That’s fine. Everybody is entitled to their opinion, and this is mine. Feel free to stop reading if you’re not interested.</p>

<p>Please note that I don’t necessarily have anything against AI itself. I’m pretty sure that there are some areas where applying AI might be useful. I use AI myself, too, albeit sparingly and with caution. That doesn’t change the fact that I’m really, really tired of most of it.</p>

<p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-tired-of-ai-as-a-professional-in-software-testing">I am tired of AI as a professional in software testing</h3>

<p>I’ve been working in testing, with a focus on test automation, for some 18 years now. In that time, several things have changed, but there is a lot that has remained pretty much the same. Full-stack end-to-end tests have always been the slowest and most expensive. To address that challenge, discussing testability has always been a cornerstone in enabling the writing of faster, smaller tests. After that, writing good automated tests has always required a working knowledge of good fundamental programming principles.</p>

<p>There are no shortcuts to solving these problems, it takes time and experience to tackle them. Simply throwing more tools at the problem hasn’t helped so far. Yet, that’s exactly what many ‘AI-powered test automation solutions’ and similar buzzword bingo high score contenders do.</p>

<p>If anything, these tools will produce results faster. Sometimes, that’s exactly what you’re looking for. Often, what we would really benefit from, though, is <em>better</em> results, not merely <em>faster</em> results, and I’ve not seen a lot of AI-powered tools actually produce <em>better</em> results, if any at all.</p>

<p>Again, that doesn’t mean I never use AI in my work. Of course it doesn’t. If it helps me to get a result, or a suggestion towards to result, faster than using other methods, I’ll gladly use AI to do just that. But that’s exactly what AI is: a means to produce some result of indeterminate quality and value faster. I’ll still need to apply my own knowledge and experience to determine the usefulness of a result, and often also to wrangle the output so that it is actually usable. Are those AI-generated results helpful in certain cases? Absolutely. Do I trust it enough to replace what a skilled and experienced human being does? Absolutely not.</p>

<p>But I guess that doesn’t make for sexy marketing material.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-tired-of-ai-as-a-conference-program-committee-member-and-organizer">I am tired of AI as a conference program committee member and organizer</h3>

<p>Over the last few years, I’ve had the honour of being the member of the program committee for three different conferences, and a one-off reviewer for one or two more. What I have seen in these years is a significant rise in proposals that were clearly written with the help of, or in many cases, entirely by ChatGPT or similar software.</p>

<p>Is that a bad thing? Yes, I think it is, for multiple reasons.</p>

<p>First of all, all these auto-generated proposals sound very much the same. ‘In the ever-changing world of …’. ‘Delve’. ‘Pivotal’. All words and phrases that smell suspiciously like someone used ChatGPT to write a proposal, instead of taking the time and effort to do it themselves. I don’t think that’s a great way to stand out and demonstrate your knowledge or experience of or unique take on a subject.</p>

<p>Second of all, a proposal is your first, and often only, opportunity to show use who <em>you</em> are, and what <em>your</em> experience with or opinion on a certain topic is. Why on earth would you want to outsource that opportunity to a piece of software and reduce your unique and thoughtful ideas to a piece of run-of-the-mill text that’s dull as dishwater and about as impressive?</p>

<p>Third of all, if you can’t even write a proposal yourself, why on that same earth would we as the program committee trust you to come up with a unique presentation? Or are you just going to read prompt results out loud for 40 minutes, too? I hope not, but we will not take the chance.</p>

<p>It has gotten so bad that I, for one, immediately reject a proposal when it is clear that it was written by or with the help of AI, no matter how interesting the topic is or how good of a talk you will be able to deliver in person. I’m not taking the chance if you don’t put in the effort of writing a good proposal yourself, and I am pretty confident I’m not the only conference program committee member thinking that way.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-tired-of-ai-as-a-human-being">I am tired of AI as a human being</h3>

<p>Finally, and most of all, I am tired of AI as a human being.</p>

<p>Like so many people, I love listening to good music. Reading a moving book. Watching a captivating movie. What makes these pieces of music, books and movies so attractive is the fact that they are created by human beings, and that these human beings transported their thoughts, their feelings and their emotions to the sheet music, the book manuscript or the movie script.</p>

<p>There’s no way that creative process and the result can be replicated by AI, or at least, I haven’t seen it.</p>

<p>What I have seen, though, is a <em>lot</em> of dull AI-generated posts on social media, with dull AI-generated images, and even more dull AI-generated comments.</p>

<p>I’ve seen and heard examples of texts, videos and music that were generated by AI, and while technically impressive, it doesn’t even begin to evoke the same kind of emotional reaction in me that pieces of art and other human creations can, unless you count boredom as an emotion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile…</p>

<ul>
  <li>people are scared that AI is going to take their jobs</li>
  <li>companies continue to blindly throw ridiculous sums of money towards the next AI prodigy without ever seeing a decent ROI, and</li>
  <li>AI’s carbon footprint is reaching more alarming levels every day</li>
</ul>

<p>I honestly don’t think we’re moving in the right direction this way.</p>

<p>Again, there are <em>some</em> cases where AI is used as a force for good. Early detection of diseases, for example. That’s great. That’s progress. We should definitely keep using AI to do that, and try to make it even better.</p>

<p>But I’m pretty sure I can do without all that AI-generated music, images, text, conference proposals, test cases, LinkedIn posts and so much other AI-generated nonsense.</p>

<p>Popular smart TV models made by Samsung and LG can take multiple snapshots of what you are watching every second – even when they are being used as external displays for your laptop or video game console.</p>
<p>Smart TV manufacturers use these frequent screenshots, as well as audio recordings, in their automatic content recognition systems, which track viewing habits in order to target people with specific advertising. But researchers showed this tracking by some of the world’s most popular smart TV brands – Samsung TVs can take screenshots every 500 milliseconds and LG…</p>

<p>Microsoft recently introduced a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/new-outlook-for-windows-now-available/ba-p/3932068">new version of Outlook</a> on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-laptops/">Windows PCs</a>. It was designed to replace the aging Windows Mail and the classic Outlook, so it introduces a slick new design and significantly tighter cloud integrations while combining your email and calendar into one app. It also introduces new generative AI features, including writing assists and “other advanced AI features."</p>    <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. --><!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
<p>However, the app also introduces some serious privacy concerns. Based on research from the German blog <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Microsoft-lays-hands-on-login-data-Beware-of-the-new-Outlook-9358925.html">heise.de</a>, which we’ve been able to reproduce at XDA, it appears that the new Outlook app is far more tightly integrated with the cloud than a user might expect, opening up the scope of potential Microsoft data collection. This represents a significant privacy issue, so there are a lot of questions Microsoft needs to answer about user expectations.</p>    <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. --><h2 id="what-you-can-expect-from-the-new-outlook">

<p>The new version of Outlook has been available since early September and introduces a range of new features. The app already includes <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-copilot-offline-outlook-windows/">new Copilot AI features</a>, and Microsoft has stated that it intends for the new version of Outlook to replace the existing Outlook app within two years. The company has also announced a broader list of <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/things-to-look-forward-to-in-the-new-outlook-for-windows/ba-p/3975602">upcoming features</a>, which will likely be announced in the coming months (particularly around AI capabilities).

<p>When opening the new Outlook client for the first time, the user is asked to log in much like any other email client. If you enter an email address with a common provider, like Gmail or iCloud, the client will use an Oauth2 workflow to authenticate with your browser. If you enter a third-party domain, you'll be prompted for an IMAP password (if supported). This is all very normal for an email client.</p>    
<p>However, once you're authenticated, you're presented with an innocuous window informing you that to use the new version of Outlook, Microsoft will need to sync your emails, events, and contacts to Microsoft Cloud. A cancel option is available, but there's no option to refuse and continue using your client.

<p>From this warning, a user might reasonably assume that the email client they're logging into will continue acting as an email client and that the client might send some limited data for processing in the cloud. However, that's not the case. Instead of your email client authenticating, your credentials are passed to the Microsoft cloud, which authenticates on your behalf. From this point, all processing (including the fetching of your emails) is handled in the cloud. We could not observe any traffic traveling directly from the client to our email provider.</p>    
<p>This is true of both OAuth and IMAP workflows but is most visible when authenticating with a third-party IMAP server. In this case, the Outlook client takes the IMAP credentials provided by your email provider to access the application and transfers them directly to Microsoft's cloud over TLS. We could reproduce this by setting up a transparent man-in-the-middle proxy between the internet and the Outlook Client to intercept encrypted traffic. In the screenshot below, our app password generated from a third-party email provider is shared and stored directly with Microsoft's servers. The response to this request is an access and refresh token that's used to maintain a persistent authenticated session with Microsoft's servers.</p>

<p>The email provider we're using for this example records the IP address and access time of each new login. If the Outlook client was communicating directly with our mail server (i.e. acting like a client should), then the IP address the email provider records should be the same as the computer we're running Outlook on. In each case we tried this, no connection was recorded from our home IP address. Instead, the initial IMAP/SMTP connections came from a 52.x.x.x IP address. A quick WHOIS lookup shows that this IP address is registered with Microsoft. This would demonstrate that the Outlook "client" is nothing of the sort, acting entirely as a wrapper around Microsoft's cloud services and that our local client has never actually logged in at all.</p>

<p>There is a clear problem for the user here. By simply signing in to the new Outlook client, a user has effectively provided the Microsoft Cloud with blanket and unrestricted access to their entire email account. Microsoft's only mention of privacy on the linked support page is a set of links to its privacy statement and service agreements, both of which allow for blanket access to your data for improving Microsoft products and services. At least when authenticating with OAuth2, most email providers offer some kind of privacy summary (similar to the example from Google below). When authenticating with IMAP, a user is normally given even less warning, with most email providers assuming that email "clients" are at least acting as clients, not gateways to the cloud. It's also important to note that there's no obvious way to decline this cloud integration when logging into any email account or use the client in a mode with some AI features disabled.</p>

<p>The offloading of the client functionality of email to the cloud also removes the ability for security engineers or researchers to easily inspect what the client is doing. It's possible to track the requests made on your data from Microsoft (albeit tricky, as a user would need to run their own email server with access to its logs), but this doesn't allow for any indication as to how much additional processing, if any, is taking place. It's also important to remember that this access is ongoing. It's no longer possible to stop Microsoft's access to your emails by simply closing Outlook. Users may log in to Outlook on their desktop to test it out, decide they don't like it, and simply stop using it without signing out. Until the user does sign out (or revokes the session elsewhere), Microsoft will retain ongoing access to their data.</p>    <h2 id="dangerous-precedents-for-data">
                        Dangerous precedents for data

            Shoehorning data collection into local clients may be a step too far
    </h3>

<p>Data collection is, ultimately, something we're all accustomed to, whether we like it or not. However, the lack of transparent disclosure here from Microsoft and the piggybacking of desktop apps to get users' data into the cloud are concerning. Microsoft's subtly accepted licensing agreements allow almost unlimited data collection for the improvement or creation of new Microsoft tools, including using your email data to train generative AI or other tools.</p>    
<p>It's not made clear at any point that the Outlook desktop app will be acting as a wrapper around exclusively cloud services or what the limits and circumstances are under which Microsoft will access your data in the cloud. Given the scope of Microsoft's push into new cloud-based AI integrations and the lack of assurance otherwise, it's reasonable to assume Microsoft may be using this kind of data for training or testing purposes.</p>

<p>This may also be a serious problem for businesses. A corporate end user could unwittingly provide Microsoft access to large volumes of business or commercially sensitive data, possibly in breach of regulatory or security requirements. If this data was then used to train generative AIs or other machine learning models that are publicly released, it's possible that some aspects of that data could be surfaced for anyone to access. This is an extreme scenario, but it's clear where concerns might lie.</p>    
<p>Whether you're a power user in business, a systems administrator overseeing a network, or an end user looking for a new email client, it's important to know the privacy implications of signing in with Outlook. Microsoft, while offering a disclosure that it will sync data to the cloud, is taking far greater liberties than a user would reasonably expect with the extent of their access and the client's role at all.</p>    </div></div>]]></description>

<p>California recently became the first state to ban deceptive sales of so-called "disappearing media."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/24/governor-newsom-signs-consumer-protection-bills-targeting-medical-debt-overdraft-fees-and-unfair-subscription-practices/">signed</a> AB 2426 into law, protecting consumers of digital goods like books, movies, and video games from being duped into purchasing content without realizing access was only granted through a temporary license.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Democratic assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, the law makes it illegal to "advertise or offer for sale a digital good to a purchaser with the terms buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good, or alongside an option for a time-limited rental."</p>
<p>Moving forward, sellers must clearly mark when a buyer is only receiving a license for—rather than making a purchase of—a digital good. Sellers must also clearly disclose that access to the digital good could be revoked if the seller no longer retains rights to license that good.</p>
<p>Perhaps most significantly, these disclosures cannot be buried in terms of service, but "shall be distinct and separate from any other terms and conditions of the transaction that the purchaser acknowledges or agrees to," the law says.</p>
<p>An exception applies for goods that are advertised using "plain language" that states that "buying or purchasing the digital good is a license." And there are also carve-outs for free goods and subscription services providing limited access based on a subscription's duration. Additionally, it's OK to advertise a digital good if access isn't ever revoked, such as when users purchase a permanent download that can be accessed offline, regardless of a seller's rights to license the content.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Ubisoft, Sony called out for consumer harms</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://a42.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240916-assemblymember-irwin-urges-governor-sign-legislation-increasing">press release</a> earlier this month, Irwin noted that the law was drafted to "address the increasingly-common instance of consumers losing access to their digital media purchases through no fault of their own."</p>
<p>She pointed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-is-deleting-the-crew-from-players-libraries-reminding-us-we-own-nothing-165328083.html">Ubisoft revoking licenses</a> for purchases of its video game<em> The Crew</em> last April and Sony stirring backlash by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/playstation-is-erasing-1318-seasons-of-discovery-shows-from-customer-libraries/">threatening to yank access to Discovery TV shows</a> last year as prominent examples of consumer harms.</p>
<p>Irwin noted that the US has been monitoring this problem since at least 2016, when the Department of Commerce’s Internet Policy Task Force published a <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/white_paper_remixes-first_sale-statutory_damages_jan_2016_0.pdf">white paper</a> concluding that "consumers would benefit from more information on the nature of the transactions they enter into, including whether they are paying for access to content or for ownership of a copy, in order to instill greater confidence and enhance participation in the online marketplace."</p>
<p>It took eight years for the first state lawmakers to follow through on the recommendation, Irwin said, noting that sellers are increasingly licensing content over selling goods and rarely offer refunds for "disappearing media."</p>
<p>"As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important," Irwin said. "AB 2426 will ensure the false and deceptive advertising from sellers of digital media incorrectly telling consumers they own their purchases becomes a thing of the past."</p>
<p>In Irwin's press release, University of Michigan law professor Aaron Perzanowski praised California for trailblazing with a law that clearly labels this practice as false advertising.</p>
<p>"Consumers around the world deserve to understand that when they spend money on digital movies, music, books, and games, those so-called ‘purchases’ can disappear without notice," Perzanowski said. "There is still important work to do in securing consumers’ digital rights, but AB 2426 is a crucial step in the right direction."</p>

<p><a href="https://vanillaos.org/">Vanilla OS</a>, an immutable desktop
Linux distribution designed for developers and advanced users, has
recently published its <a href="https://vanillaos.org/blog/article/2024-07-28/vanilla-os-2-orchid---stable-release">2.0
"Orchid" release</a>. Previously based on Ubuntu, Vanilla OS has now
shifted to Debian unstable ("sid"). The release has made it easier to
install software from other distributions' package repositories, and it
is now theoretically possible to install and run Android applications as well.</p>

<p>The idea behind Vanilla OS is to maintain a small, immutable core
operating system while isolating additional software from that core
through containerization or sandboxing. The core of Vanilla OS is based
on <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative</a>
(OCI) images composed of packages from Debian sid. These images are
updated and managed by the <a href="https://abroot.vanillaos.org/">ABRoot</a> utility. Rather than
handling system updates through a package manager, Vanilla OS
downloads a new OCI image, and then uses the new image when it
reboots. This is similar to other image-based operating systems, like
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/977987/">Aeon</a> and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/954059/">Bluefin</a> that use <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/ab">A/B image
update</a> strategies—though each distribution has its own
method of doing so. All of this happens under the hood, so users don't
have to be aware of how updates work.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that Vanilla OS <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/929124/">shifted from Ubuntu to
Debian</a> was that the latter offers a more vanilla GNOME experience by
providing the software without significant customizations. As the
project's <a href="https://vanillaos.org/blog/article/2023-03-07/vanilla-os-20-orchid---initial-work">announcement</a>
from last year said:

</p><blockquote>
Ubuntu provides a modified version of the GNOME desktop, that does not
match how GNOME envisions its desktop. One of the high-level goals of
Vanilla OS is to be as vanilla as possible, so we reverted many of
these changes to reach that goal.
</blockquote>

<p>Another concern cited in the announcement was Ubuntu's
reliance on the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/core/services/guide/snaps-intro">Snap</a> packaging
format, with problems like slow startups and Canonical's control over the
official <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap store</a>.</p>

<h4>Installing the system and applications</h4>

<p>The project offers an <a href="https://vanillaos.org/download/orchid/stable">ISO image</a> for
x86-64 systems, with no support for other architectures. Only UEFI systems are
supported, and even on those systems, the installer seems quite finicky.
On two physical test machines, the installer seemed to run fine until it
aborted with a generic error message. I managed to install Vanilla OS in
a virtual machine (using <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/Boxes/">GNOME Boxes</a>) only after selecting Debian testing
as the operating system (and choosing UEFI, of course).</p>

<p>When the installer works, it is straightforward to use. After the first reboot, a
configuration wizard guides the user through creating an account and
selecting applications to install. After a second reboot, the user is
prompted to choose a password, followed by the installation of the
selected applications using <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a>.</p>

<p>Upon installation of these applications, a stock GNOME desktop
environment appears. The recommended way to install applications in
Vanilla OS is through the GNOME application <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/Software/">Software</a>, which is
configured to install applications as Flatpaks from <a href="https://flathub.org/">Flathub</a>. By default, Flatpaks installed
this way are updated automatically. Vanilla OS also checks for system
updates weekly, by default. Users can change this to daily, weekly, or
never if they choose. To minimize any impact on the user experience, the
updater considers factors such as system load, battery level, and
network connection before applying system updates. With the core operating system
and applications set for automatic updates, Vanilla OS aims to relieve
users of the often tedious task of keeping all packages updated.</p>

<h4>Installing non-Flatpak packages</h4>

<p>Although Flatpak has gained popularity, many applications are still
not available as Flatpaks. Given that Vanilla OS is based on Debian,
users might be tempted to install a <tt>.deb</tt> package directly into the core
operating system when there's no Flatpak version for it. However,
Vanilla OS doesn't offer that possibility. It addresses the need for
Debian packages with the <a href="https://vanillaos.org/blog/article/2024-07-16/discover-vso-v2-managing-your-vanilla-os-installation-like-never-before">Vanilla
System Operator</a> (VSO v2), a container where users can safely install
any <tt>.deb</tt> package.</p>

<p>VSO integrates software installed in a container with the desktop
so that it appears just like any other desktop application. After downloading a <tt>.deb</tt>
package, double-clicking on the file in the <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/Nautilus/">GNOME Files</a> application
launches the <a href="https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/sideload-utility">Sideload</a> utility, which installs the <tt>.deb</tt> package into
the VSO container. Once installed, the application is displayed among
other applications in GNOME's activities overview.
Launching the application runs it in a container, isolated from the
operating system but integrated with the user's home directory. Thus, an
application installed via a <tt>.deb</tt> package behaves similarly to one
installed via Flatpak.</p>

<p>There's also a command-line method for installing <tt>.deb</tt> files. The
default terminal emulator in Vanilla OS is <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/raggesilver/blackbox">Black Box</a>. When
launched, this application takes the user to a shell within the VSO
container rather than the core operating system. Packages can be
installed in this container using Debian's <tt>apt</tt> package manager.</p>

<p>This method is also useful for troubleshooting dependency issues. For
instance, I decided to install an open-source ChatGPT alternative
called <a href="https://jan.ai/">Jan</a> on Vanilla OS. 
When I attempted to install its <tt>.deb</tt> package with Sideload, the
application failed to start without any
clear indication of what was wrong. Opening Black Box and running the
<code>jan</code> command in the shell revealed an error message
regarding a missing library: <tt>libasound2.so</tt>. It turned out that Jan's
<tt>.deb</tt> package didn't list this library as a dependency. After executing
<code>sudo apt install libasound2</code> in Black Box, I was able to run
Jan successfully.</p>

<p>Vanilla OS offers a similar method for installing Android apps by
running them in a <a href="https://waydro.id/">Waydroid</a> container.
However, the developers caution that this is still an experimental
feature. I was able to initialize the Android subsystem with
<tt>vso android init</tt> in the VSO shell but encountered issues
when trying to manually open an Android <tt>.apk</tt> file with Sideload. Despite
several troubleshooting attempts, I was unable to get the Android
functionality running. This was possibly due to my test system running
in a virtual machine, a scenario that the project has not tested.</p>

<h4>Linux subsystems</h4>

<p>While VSO is the default container in Vanilla OS, the operating
system allows users to install separate "subsystems" based on various
Linux distributions through <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/docs/en/apx-manpage">Apx</a>, a wrapper
around <a href="https://distrobox.it/">Distrobox</a>. The latter, in
turn, is a wrapper around <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, or the simple container
manager <a href="https://github.com/89luca89/lilipod?tab=readme-ov-file">lilipod</a>
to create containers that are highly integrated with the host operating
system. Incidentally, Luca Di Maio, the creator of Distrobox and
lilipod, is also part of the <a href="https://vanillaos.org/team">Vanilla OS team</a> and one of its
co-founders.</p>

<p>Vanilla OS includes a graphical user interface for Apx, enabling
users to easily create a subsystem based on a <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/handbook/en/install-and-manage-applications#installing-applications-from-other-linux-distributions">stack</a> (Alpine, Arch
Linux, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Vanilla OS are supported by
default) and a package manager (apk, apt, dnf, pacman, or zypper). After
creating and starting the subsystem, the user can search its packages
and install them using commands in the VSO shell, such as:

</p><pre>    <tt>apx gecko search qucs</tt>
    <tt>apx gecko install qucs-s</tt>
</pre>

<p>Here <tt>gecko</tt> is the name I gave to the subsystem in this example, based on an openSUSE
container.</p>

<p>Applications installed this way are "<a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/usage/distrobox-export.md">exported</a>",
which is a feature of
Distrobox. The application then appears in GNOME's activities overview.
When clicking on the icon, the subsystem's container is automatically
started, and the application launches. This provides an easy way to
install software available in specific distribution repositories.
Furthermore, the <tt>apx</tt> package management commands are
consistent, regardless of the underlying package manager, so users don't
need to remember the differences between apt, dnf, or zypper, for
example.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/990072/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/vanillaos-software-and-apx-sm.png" alt="[Vanilla OS 2 screenshot]" title="Vanilla OS 2 screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Apx offers a lot of flexibility. Users can add other package
managers, such as <a href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay#yay">yay</a>
instead of pacman for an Arch Linux subsystem. This involves mapping
each <tt>apx</tt> package management command to the corresponding
<tt>yay</tt> command. Similarly, users can create their own stack by
referencing an image from one of the well-known container repositories.
A stack can also have a list of pre-installed packages. This is useful
for setting up a complete <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/handbook/en/develop-in-vanilla-os">development stack</a> in a container.</p>

<h4>Development and documentation</h4>

<p>Development is happening in the <a href="https://github.com/Vanilla-OS">Vanilla OS GitHub organization</a>,
which has 24 members. Its <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Vanilla-OS/repositories">more than 100
repositories</a> include numerous container files and various custom
tools. Although many of these tools were specifically created for Vanilla
OS, the developers try to make them as distribution-independent as
possible. For instance, there are instructions for <a href="https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/apx?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions-for-using-apx-in-other-distributions">using
Apx in other distributions</a>.</p>

<p>There's no fixed release cadence, but the <a href="https://vanillaos.org/components-lifecycle">lifecycle</a> of
Vanilla OS is clear: when a major version is released, the previous
major release enters the maintenance state. This means that it only gets
important bug fixes and security fixes. After six months in the
maintenance state, the release is declared end of life. <a href="https://vanillaos.org/updates">Updates</a> are released at
irregular intervals with detailed descriptions of bug fixes and
enhancements. The project does not have a separate
security-announcement list.</p>

<p>The transition from Vanilla OS 1 to 2 was significant, not only due
to the shift from an Ubuntu base to Debian, but also because tools like
ABRoot, VSO, and Apx were completely rewritten. However, the Vanilla OS
documentation site still primarily covers <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/docs/en/abroot">ABRoot v1</a>, <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/docs/en/vso">VSO v1</a>, and <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/docs/en/apx">Apx v1</a>. While the man
pages seem to have been updated, information about the new features in
Vanilla OS 2 remains fragmented, scattered across the project's web
site, <a href="https://vanillaos.org/blog">blog</a>, and GitHub repositories.</p>

<p>Overall, Vanilla OS appears to be a good choice for advanced users
who need applications from multiple distributions without risking
system instability. Major applications can be easily installed as
Flatpaks, while others can be installed in subsystems from various
distributions. Thanks to the tight integration of the VSO and Apx
containers with the host operating system, users can seamlessly work
with all those applications without worrying about the underlying
differences. And when something goes wrong with one of the
applications, the core operating system isn't impacted and the VSO or
Apx container can simply be recreated.</p><br clear="all"><table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After seven years of trying, the most recent struggle with Google proved that we need to change course on our adventure in the Android galaxy.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, Google changed its API policy and revoked iA Writer’s access to Google Drive on Android. By freezing up Android’s main storage option, our app was frozen in carbonite. It still lived but we couldn’t move forward before resolving it.</p>
<p>In order to allow our users to access their Google Drive on their phones we had to rewrite privacy statements, update documents, and pass a series of security checks, all while facing a barrage of new, ever-shifting requirements.</p>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/february24b-1.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>April:</strong> Another update. Google sends those almost weekly. Every time you need to go through a stack of links and things. Sometimes you end up in a forum with a group of desperate devs talking about quitting Android.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/verify-now.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>Warning:</strong> Five months and 55 updates later. It can’t be too far now. Let’s make sure we verify everything as expected. Then send the documents and the passport scan. Then we’ll be good. Right?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By September, we thought we had honored our side of the new agreement. But on the very day we expected to get our access back, Google altered the deal.</p>
<h2>“I’ve altered the deal. Pray that I don’t alter it any further.”</h2>
<p>We were told that read-only access to Google Drive would suit our writing app better than the desired read/write access. That’s right—read-only for a writing app.</p>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>Getting closer:</strong> Ah, not quite. After a series of updates, following exactly Google’s playbook they still want more privacy policy changes. But then, *then*, our customers get Google Drive back. Right… Right?</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/important.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>No:</strong> “You don’t really need Google Drive write access, for your writing app, do you?”</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>“Perhaps you think that you were treated unfairly?”</h2>
<p>When we pointed out that this was not what we had, or what our users wanted, Google seemed to alter the deal yet again. In order to get our users full access to <em>their</em> Google Drive on <em>their</em> devices, we now needed to pass a yearly CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) audit. This requires hiring a third-party vendor like KPMG.</p>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mycasa-su-casa.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>Warning:</strong> Google has altered the deal.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/don-t-do-this.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>Warning:</strong> Pray that they don’t alter it any further…</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The cost, including all internal hours, amounts to about one to two months of revenue that we would have to pay to one of Google’s corporate amigos. An indie company handing over a month’s worth of revenue to a “Big Four” firm like KPMG for a pretty much meaningless scan. And, of course, this would be a recurring annual expense. More cash for Google’s partners, while small developers like us foot the bill for Android’s deeply ingrained security shortcomings.<sup id="fnref-27202-scam"><a href="#fn-27202-scam" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>As we… googled… our new situation, it became clear this wasn’t just our battle—developers everywhere were facing similar bureaucratic entanglements, all designed to benefit Google’s partners while squeezing the life out of smaller companies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just finally completed and passed the assessment. Overall it took me about 60-80 hours of my time, and the process itself spanned 3-4 months, with 25-30 back and forth requests of varying complexity. It was awful, and if it’s not streamlined next year, I’ll be dropping this permission from my app and going another route.<sup id="fnref-27202-reddit"><a href="#fn-27202-reddit" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it’s normal. Seems like we had to bite the bullet. After all, we have been doing this for seven years. We have tens of thousands of users. We invested hundreds of thousands to make this works, and so it looks like…</p>
<h2>“We shall double our efforts!”</h2>
<p>This battle to give our customers access to their Google Drive is only the latest in a series of clashes we’ve had with the empire. Developing on Android is a daily worsening struggle with red tape, inconsistent device performance, app store search performance gaming<sup id="fnref-27202-gaming"><a href="#fn-27202-gaming" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, and rampant piracy.<sup id="fnref-27202-piracy"><a href="#fn-27202-piracy" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Every time we think we’ve overcome one hurdle, another two pop up. It’s an exhausting process that saps our resources, delays updates, and damages our reputation. Meanwhile, the negative reviews keep piling up for problems that are out of our control. That’s not the only problem.</p>
<p>There are certain devices that cause trouble. To fix the bugs you need to buy the device. Customers demand that. And often we did. Below you can see the 12,000 devices that were using iA Writer in 2017:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/iA-Writer-Android-Devices-Galaxy.png"></p><p>Developing for Android you navigate an asteroid field. Bugs surface across thousands of device types, Android versions, and flavors—One UI, MIUI, OxygenOS, Pixel Experience, you name it.</p>
<p>And before anyone says this is the price of an “open” OS—well, we don’t have this problem on Windows.<sup id="fnref-27202-flavor"><a href="#fn-27202-flavor" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<h2>“Put him in!”</h2>
<p>We could just comply—we could pay KPMG, surrender more of our revenue, and dig ourselves deeper into the red. And then accept the next forced change. And the next one. We could try to write our own framework for payment to avoid piracy. But why would we when no one wants to pay for it? And then what? Where does it end? Hiring someone to game our app reviews?</p>
<p>As long as we sell to Android end consumers, the economics of continuing development on Android is an ever-tightening Force Choke. Bit by bit the control over our app’s functionality, quality, or finances are being taken away from us. If we continue down the current path we damage our relationship with users, taint our reputation, lose money, nerves, and time.</p>
<p>So, as of today, we’re not just accepting our frozen-in-carbonite fate. We’re embracing it. We’re going to take the app offline. We know this decision will disappoint our loyal Android users, and we share your frustration. After seven years of continuous investment, this is way more painful for us than it is for any of you.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand why many developers choose not to engage with the Empire. You can’t win that battle. They do as they please. Existing users will keep their access, and we’ll push critical updates when necessary—if the empire allows it. But new features are off the table for now. Support will be friendly as always, but we have to be pragmatic.</p>
<h2>“What if he doesn’t survive? He’s worth a lot to me!”</h2>
<p>iA Writer for Android might return in the future—perhaps in a different chapter of this saga, where it can develop in a more controlled environment.</p>
<p>We are working towards a setup where organizations can pay us directly for all our software.<sup id="fnref-27202-directly"><a href="#fn-27202-directly" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> In a B2B setup, the Android hardware ecosystem may be economical and manageable, and then we can go back to sponsoring single-license users and their unruly pirate friends. Until that day comes, iA Writer for Android will remain frozen in carbonite, waiting for the right time to reawaken.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we’re focusing on projects that drive our business forward: finalizing a major Windows 11 update, enhancing iA Writer for Mac, iOS, and iPadOS, preparing to launch Web sharing for iA Presenter, and releasing the iOS/iPadOS app.</p>

</figure><p>A 25-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes started producing her own insulin less than three months after receiving a transplant of reprogrammed stem cells<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>. She is the first person with the disease to be treated using cells that were extracted from her own body.</p><p>“I can eat sugar now,” said the woman, who lives in Tianjing, on a call with <i>Nature</i>. It has been more than a year since the transplant, and, she says, “I enjoy eating everything — especially hotpot.” The woman asked to remain anonymous to protect her privacy.</p><p>James Shapiro, a transplant surgeon and researcher at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, says the results of the surgery are stunning. “They’ve completely reversed diabetes in the patient, who was requiring substantial amounts of insulin beforehand.”</p><p>The study, published in <i>Cell </i>today, follows results from a separate group in Shanghai, China, who reported in April that they had successfully transplanted insulin-producing islets into the liver of a 59-year-old man with type 2 diabetes<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. The islets were also derived from reprogrammed stem cells taken from the man’s own body and he has since stopped taking insulin.</p><p>The studies are among a handful of pioneering trials using stem cells to treat diabetes, which affects close to half a billion people worldwide. Most of them have type 2 diabetes, in which the body doesn’t produce enough insulin or its ability to use the hormone diminishes. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00400-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00400-x" data-track-category="body text link">type 1 diabetes</a>, the immune system attacks islet cells in the pancreas.</p><p>Islet transplants can treat the disease, but there aren’t enough donors to meet the growing demand, and recipients must use immune-suppressing drugs to prevent the body from rejecting the donor tissue.</p><p>Stem cells can be used to grow any tissue in the body and can be cultured indefinitely in the laboratory, which means they potentially offer a limitless source of pancreatic tissue. By using tissue made from a person’s own cells, researchers also hope to avoid the need for immunosuppressants.</p><h2>Reprogrammed cells</h2><p>In the first trial of its kind, Deng Hongkui, a cell biologist at Peking University in Beijing, and his colleagues extracted cells from three people with type 1 diabetes and reverted them into a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/452406a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/452406a" data-track-category="body text link">pluripotent state</a>, from which they could be moulded into any cell type in the body. This reprogramming technique was first developed by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/534310a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/534310a" data-track-category="body text link">Shinya Yamanaka</a> at Kyoto University in Japan almost two decades ago. But Deng and his colleagues modified the technique<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>: instead of introducing proteins that trigger gene expression, as Yamanaka had done, they <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.13416" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.13416" data-track-category="body text link">exposed the cells</a> to small molecules. This offered more control over the process.</p><p>The researchers then used the chemically induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to generate 3D <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-023-00861-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-023-00861-0" data-track-category="body text link">clusters of islets</a>. They tested the safety and efficacy of the cells in mice and non-human primates.</p><p>In June 2023, in an operation that lasted less than half an hour, they injected the equivalent of roughly 1.5 million islets into the woman’s abdominal muscles — a new site for islet transplants. Most islet transplants are injected into the liver, where the cells cannot be observed. But by placing them in the abdomen, the researchers could monitor the cells using magnetic resonance imaging, and potentially remove them if needed.</p><h2>Insulin free</h2><p>Two-and-a-half months later, the woman was producing enough <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02461-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02461-4" data-track-category="body text link">insulin</a> to live without needing top-ups, and she has sustained that level of production for more than a year. By that time, the woman had stopped experiencing the dangerous spikes and drops in blood glucose levels, which remained within a target range for more than 98% of the day. “That’s remarkable,” says Daisuke Yabe, a diabetes researcher at Kyoto University. “If this is applicable to other patients, it’s going to be wonderful.”</p><p>The results are intriguing, but they need to be replicated in more people, says Jay Skyler, an endocrinologist at the University of Miami, Florida, who studies type 1 diabetes. Skyler also wants to see that the woman’s cells continue to produce insulin for up to five years, before considering her ‘cured’.</p><p>Deng says the results for the other two participants are “also very positive”, and they will reach the one-year mark in November, after which he hopes to expand the trial to another 10 or 20 individuals.</p><p>Because the woman was already receiving immunosuppressants for a previous liver transplant, the researchers could not assess whether the iPS cells reduced the risk of rejection of the graft.</p><p>Even if the body doesn’t reject the transplant because it doesn’t consider the cells to be ‘foreign’, in people with type 1 diabetes, because they have an autoimmune condition, there is still a risk that the body could attack the islets. Deng says they didn’t see this in the woman because of the immunosuppressants, but they are trying to develop cells that can evade this autoimmune response.</p><h2>Donor cells</h2><p>Transplants using the recipient’s own cells have advantages, but the procedures are difficult to scale up and commercialize, say researchers. Several groups have started trials of islet cells created using donor stem cells.</p><p>Preliminary results for one trial, led by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston, Massachusetts, were reported in June. A dozen participants with type 1 diabetes received islets derived from donated embryonic stem cells that were injected into the liver. They were all treated with immunosuppressants. Three months after the transplant, all the participants began <a href="https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-announces-positive-results-ongoing-phase-12-study-vx-880" data-track="click" data-label="https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-announces-positive-results-ongoing-phase-12-study-vx-880" data-track-category="body text link">producing insulin</a> when glucose was present in their bloodstreams<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>. Some had become insulin independent.</p><p>Last year, Vertex launched another trial in which islet cells derived from donated stem cells were placed in a device designed to protect them from immune-system attacks. It was transplanted into a person with type 1 diabetes, who did not receive immunosuppressants. “That trial is ongoing,” says Shapiro, who is involved in the study, which aims to enrol 17 individuals.</p><p>Yabe is also about to start a trial using islet cells produced using donor iPS cells. He plans to develop sheets of islets and surgically place them in the abdominal tissue of three people with type 1 diabetes, who will receive immunosuppressants. The first participant should receive their transplant early next year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>
 Traditionally, mathematics research projects are conducted by a small number (typically one to five) of expert mathematicians, each of which are familiar enough with all aspects of the project that they can verify each other’s contributions. It has been challenging to organize mathematical projects at larger scales, and particularly those that involve contributions from the general public, due to the need to verify all of the contributions; a single error in one component of a mathematical argument could invalidate the entire project. Furthermore, the sophistication of a typical math project is such that it would not be realistic to expect a member of the public, with say an undergraduate level of mathematics education, to contribute in a meaningful way to many such projects.
</p><p>
For related reasons, it is also challenging to incorporate assistance from modern AI tools into a research project, as these tools can “hallucinate” plausible-looking, but nonsensical arguments, which therefore need additional verification before they could be added into the project.
</p><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant">Proof assistant</a> languages, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant)">Lean</a>, provide a potential way to overcome these obstacles, and allow for large-scale collaborations involving professional mathematicians, the broader public, and/or AI tools to all contribute to a complex project, provided that it can be broken up in a modular fashion into smaller pieces that can be attacked without necessarily understanding all aspects of the project as a whole. Projects to formalize an existing mathematical result (such as the formalization of the recent proof of the PFR conjecture of Marton, discussed in <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2023/11/18/formalizing-the-proof-of-pfr-in-lean4-using-blueprint-a-short-tour/">this previous blog post</a>) are currently the main examples of such large-scale collaborations that are enabled via proof assistants. At present, these formalizations are mostly crowdsourced by human contributors (which include both professional mathematicians and interested members of the general public), but there are also some nascent efforts to incorporate more automated tools (either “good old-fashioned” automated theorem provers, or more modern AI-based tools) to assist with the (still quite tedious) task of formalization.
</p><p>
However, I believe that this sort of paradigm can also be used to explore new mathematics, as opposed to formalizing existing mathematics. The online collaborative “Polymath” projects that several people including myself organized in the past are one example of this; but as they did not incorporate proof assistants into the workflow, the contributions had to be managed and verified by the human moderators of the project, which was quite a time-consuming responsibility, and one which limited the ability to scale these projects up further. But I am hoping that the addition of proof assistants will remove this bottleneck.
</p><p>
I am particularly interested in the possibility of using these modern tools to explore a <em>class</em> of many mathematical problems at once, as opposed to the current approach of focusing on only one or two problems at a time. This seems like an inherently modularizable and repetitive task, which could particularly benefit from both crowdsourcing and automated tools, if given the right platform to rigorously coordinate all the contributions; and it is a type of mathematics that previous methods usually could not scale up to (except perhaps over a period of many years, as individual papers slowly explore the class one data point at a time until a reasonable intuition about the class is attained). Among other things, having a large data set of problems to work on could be helpful for benchmarking various automated tools and compare the efficacy of different workflows.
</p><p>
One recent example of such a project was the <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/13132838">Busy Beaver Challenge</a>, which showed this July that the fifth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">Busy Beaver</a> number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BBB%285%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BBB%285%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BBB%285%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{BB(5)}"> was equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B47176870%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B47176870%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B47176870%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{47176870}">. Some older crowdsourced computational projects, such as the <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/">Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)</a>, are also somewhat similar in spirit to this type of project (though using more traditional proof of work certificates instead of proof assistants). I would be interested in hearing of any other extant examples of crowdsourced projects exploring a mathematical space, and whether there are lessons from those examples that could be relevant for the project I propose here.
</p><p>
More specifically I would like to propose the following (admittedly artificial) project as a pilot to further test out this paradigm, which was inspired by a <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/450930/is-there-an-identity-between-the-associative-identity-and-the-constant-identity">MathOverflow question</a> from last year, and discussed somewhat further on <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/110736805384878353">my Mastodon account</a> shortly afterwards.

The problem is in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra">universal algebra</a>, and concerns the (medium-scale) exploration of simple equational theories for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)">magmas</a>. A magma is nothing more than a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{G}"> equipped with a binary operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%3A+G+%5Ctimes+G+%5Crightarrow+G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%3A+G+%5Ctimes+G+%5Crightarrow+G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%3A+G+%5Ctimes+G+%5Crightarrow+G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\circ: G \times G \rightarrow G}">.

Of course, with additional axioms, such as the identity axiom or the associative axiom, one can get more familiar mathematical objects such as groups, semigroups, or monoids. Here we will be interested in (constant-free) <em>equational axioms</em>, which are axioms of equality involving expressions built from the operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\circ}"> and one or more indeterminate variables in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{G}">.

</p><p>
To illustrate the project I have in mind, let me first introduce eleven examples of equational axioms for magmas: 

</p><p>

 Thus, for instance, Equation7 is the commutative axiom, and Equation10 is the associative axiom. The constant axiom Equation1 is the strongest, as it forces the magma <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{G}"> to have at most one element; at the opposite extreme, the reflexive axiom Equation11 is the weakest, being satisfied by every single magma.
</p><p>
One can then ask which axioms imply which others. For instance, Equation1 implies all the other axioms in this list, which in turn imply Equation11. Equation8 implies Equation9 as a special case, which in turn implies Equation10 as a special case. The full poset of implications can be depicted by the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram">Hasse diagram</a>:
</p><p>
<img src="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/implications-2.png" width="500">
</p><p>
This in particular answers the MathOverflow question of whether there were equational axioms intermediate between the constant axiom Equation1 and the associative axiom Equation10.
</p><p>
Most of the implications here are quite easy to prove, but there is one non-trivial one, obtained in <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/450905/766">this answer to a MathOverflow post</a> closely related to the preceding one:

I will remark that the general question of determining whether one set of equational axioms determines another is undecidable; see Theorem 14 of <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/article?mr=236012">this paper of Perkins</a>. (This is similar in spirit to the more well known undecidability of various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_(mathematics)">word problems</a>.) So, the situation here is somewhat similar to the Busy Beaver Challenge, in that past a certain point of complexity, we would necessarily encounter unsolvable problems; but hopefully there would be interesting problems and phenomena to discover before we reach that threshold.
</p><p>
The above Hasse diagram does not just assert implications between the listed equational axioms; it also asserts <em>non-implications</em> between the axioms. For instance, as seen in the diagram, the commutative axiom Equation7 does <em>not</em> imply the Equation4 axiom </p><p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Bx%29%2By+%3D+y+%2B+x.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Bx%29%2By+%3D+y+%2B+x.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Bx%29%2By+%3D+y+%2B+x.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\displaystyle  (x+x)+y = y + x."></p><p>
 To see this, one simply has to produce an example of a magma that obeys the commutative axiom Equation7, but not the Equation4 axiom; but in this case one can simply choose (for instance) the natural numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+N%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+N%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+N%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf N}}"> with the addition operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Ccirc+y+%3A%3D+x%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Ccirc+y+%3A%3D+x%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Ccirc+y+%3A%3D+x%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x \circ y := x+y}">. More generally, the diagram asserts the following non-implications, which (together with the indicated implications) completely describes the poset of implications between the eleven axioms: 

</p><ul> <li> Equation2 does not imply Equation3. </li><li> Equation3 does not imply Equation5. </li><li> Equation3 does not imply Equation7. </li><li> Equation5 does not imply Equation6. </li><li> Equation5 does not imply Equation7. </li><li> Equation6 does not imply Equation7. </li><li> Equation6 does not imply Equation10. </li><li> Equation7 does not imply Equation6. </li><li> Equation7 does not imply Equation10. </li><li> Equation9 does not imply Equation8. </li><li> Equation10 does not imply Equation9. </li><li> Equation10 does not imply Equation6. 
</li></ul><p>

 The reader is invited to come up with counterexamples that demonstrate some of these implications. The hardest type of counterexamples to find are the ones that show that Equation9 does not imply Equation8: a solution (in Lean) can be found <a href="https://live.lean-lang.org/#codez=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">here</a>.

As one can see, it is already somewhat tedious to compute the Hasse diagram of just eleven equations. The project I propose is to try to expand this Hasse diagram by a couple orders of magnitude, covering a significantly larger set of equations.

 I have not yet generated the full list of such identities, but presumably this will be straightforward to do in a standard computer language such as Python (I have not tried this, but I imagine some back-and-forth with a modern AI would let one generate most of the required code).

Will most equations be incomparable with each other? Will it stratify into layers of “strong” and “weak” axioms? Will there be a lot of equivalent axioms? It might be interesting to record now any speculations as what the structure of this poset, and compare these predictions with the outcome of the project afterwards.

A brute force computation of the poset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> would then require <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560+%5Ctimes+%284560-1%29+%3D+20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560+%5Ctimes+%284560-1%29+%3D+20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560+%5Ctimes+%284560-1%29+%3D+20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{4560 \times (4560-1) = 20789040}"> comparisons, which looks rather daunting; but of course due to the axioms of a partial order, one could presumably identify the poset by a much smaller number of comparisons. I am thinking that it should be possible to crowdsource the exploration of this poset in the form of submissions to a central repository (such as the <a href="https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories">github repository I just created</a>) of proofs in Lean of implications or non-implications between various equations, which could be validated in Lean, and also checked against some file recording the current status (true, false, or open) of all the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{20789040}"> comparisons, to avoid redundant effort. Most submissions could be handled automatically, with relatively little human moderation required; and the status of the poset could be updated after each such submission.
</p><p>
I would imagine that there is some “low-hanging fruit” that could establish a large number of implications (or anti-implications) quite easily. For instance, laws such as Equation2 or Equation3 more or less completely describe the binary operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\circ}">, and it should be quite easy to check which of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{4560}"> laws are implied by either of these two laws. The poset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> has a reflection symmetry associated to replacing the binary operator <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\circ}"> by its reflection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%5E%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bop%7D%7D%3A+%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cmapsto+y+%5Ccirc+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%5E%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bop%7D%7D%3A+%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cmapsto+y+%5Ccirc+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%5E%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bop%7D%7D%3A+%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cmapsto+y+%5Ccirc+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\circ^{\mathrm{op}}: (x,y) \mapsto y \circ x}">, which in principle cuts down the total work by a factor of about two. Specific examples of magmas, such as the natural numbers with the addition operation, obey some set of equations in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> but not others, and so could be used to generate a large number of anti-implications. Some existing automated proving tools for equational logic, such as <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/">Prover9 and Mace4</a> (for obtaining implications and anti-implications respectively), could then be used to handle most of the remaining “easy” cases (though some work may be needed to convert the outputs of such tools into Lean). The remaining “hard” cases could then be targeted by some combination of human contributors and more advanced AI tools.
</p><p>
Perhaps, in analogy with formalization projects, we could have a semi-formal “blueprint” evolving in parallel with the formal Lean component of the project. This way, the project could accept human-written proofs by contributors who do not necessarily have any proficiency in Lean, as well as contributions from automated tools (such as the aforementioned Prover9 and Mace4), whose output is in some other format than Lean. The task of converting these semi-formal proofs into Lean could then be done by other humans or automated tools; in particular I imagine modern AI tools could be particularly valuable for this portion of the workflow. I am not quite sure though if existing blueprint software can scale to handle the large number of individual proofs that would be generated by this project; and as this portion would not be formally verified, a significant amount of human moderation might also be needed here, and this also might not scale properly. Perhaps the semi-formal portion of the project could instead be coordinated on a forum such as this blog, in a similar spirit to past Polymath projects. 
</p><p>
It would be nice to be able to integrate such a project with some sort of graph visualization software that can take an incomplete determination of the poset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> as input (in which each potential comparison <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE+%5Cimplies+E%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE+%5Cimplies+E%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE+%5Cimplies+E%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E \implies E'}"> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> is marked as either true, false, or open), completes the graph as much as possible using the axioms of partial order, and then presents the partially known poset in a visually appealing way. If anyone knows of such a software package, I would be happy to hear of it in the comments.
</p><p>
Anyway, I would be happy to receive any feedback on this project; in addition to the previous requests, I would be interested in any suggestions for improving the project, as well as gauging whether there is sufficient interest in participating to actually launch it. (I am imagining running it vaguely along the lines of a Polymath project, though perhaps not formally labeled as such.)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A joint mission between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-7">Landsat 7</a> was initially designed for a five-year mission. Beating the odds, the satellite observed the Earth for a quarter-century, delivering invaluable scientific data for the benefit of all humanity. &nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">

<p>Landsat 7 captured one of its final images on May 28 over Las Vegas, Nevada.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>These Landsat 7 images showcase the first and last captures of the Las Vegas area, taken on July 4, 1999, and May 28, 2024, respectively. The images highlight the city, the surrounding desert landscape, and Lake Mead, using shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to emphasize differences in vegetation, water, and urban growth. The final image, marking the satellite’s 25th anniversary, stands as a tribute to Landsat 7's quarter-century legacy of Earth observation.</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>Since its launch on April 15, 1999, Landsat 7 provided a wealth of imagery, enabling scientists, policymakers, and conservationists to track changes in land use, natural disasters, and environmental degradation with unprecedented accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>Landsat 7 was successfully launched on April 15, 1999, from the Western Test Range of Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, on a Delta II expendable launch vehicle.</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>“Landsat 7 data have been pivotal in documenting environmental changes such as natural disasters, deforestation, and urban growth over its 25 years,” said&nbsp;<strong>David Applegate, USGS Director</strong>. “Notably capturing significant events like Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Haiti earthquake in 2010, the Australian bushfires in 2019 - 2020, the dramatic growth of cities worldwide and more through its long-standing mission.”&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>This true-color image was taken by the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor aboard the Landsat 7 satellite on September 12, 2001, at roughly 11:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time. A day after the attack, smoke continues to billow out of the collapsed Twin Towers.</figcaption>

  </div>
</figure>
<p>The data have proven to be a useful asset as the foundation for countless studies, enhancing our understanding of agriculture, water resources, and wildland fires. By providing consistent data every eight days in conjunction with Landsat 5 until 2012, Landsat 7 improved our ability to monitor seasonal changes. Thanks to operational enhancements, Landsat 7 nearly doubled the daily data collected, from 250 to 450 scenes.</p>

<p><strong>The Land Imaging Satellite that Could</strong></p>
<p>When it was launched, Landsat 7 featured the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor, which built upon and improved the capabilities of its predecessors, the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor used on Landsat 4 and Landsat 5. As an eight-band, multispectral scanning radiometer, the ETM+ offered improvements over previous sensor technology including a 15-meter spatial resolution panchromatic band and 60-meter resolution thermal band.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>This color infrared image of Southeast South Dakota was advertised as the first image acquired by <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-7">Landsat 7</a>'s Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor on April 18, 1999. The Missouri River flows from the middle left of the image, to the lower right, where the Fort Randall Dam creates Lake Francis Case.&nbsp;</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>However, four years after Landsat 7’s launch, a piece of equipment known as the Scan Line Corrector failed on the ETM+, impacting the satellite's ability to capture complete images of the Earth's surface. This led to “striping,” or gaps in its data. Despite the setback, 78 percent of a scene’s pixels are still usable and are considered some of the world’s most geometrically and radiometrically accurate civilian satellite data.</p>

<p>Landsat 7 went on to produce images for five times its expected operational lifespan.</p>

<figure role="group">

    <figcaption>For 25 years, the Landsat 7 satellite acquired millions of images of Earth that supported studies of how land is used and how it has changed across urban, agriculture, forest, snow and ice-covered areas around the globe, as well as natural and manmade disasters. As the mission comes to a close, we look back at the magnitude and impact that Landsat 7 imagery brought to scientists and those interested in studying the Earth's landmasses: Over 5,000 scientific publications in 21 languages across 143 different countries152 of the articles have received a news, blog, and/or patent mention1,414 policy documents across 54 countries that cite 749 journal articles</figcaption>

  </div>
</figure>
<p>To allow Landsat 9, launched in September 2021, to share the same orbital position as Landsat 8, the USGS lowered Landsat 7’s orbit. Even at its lower altitude, Landsat 7 continued to collect valuable data. However, being lowered caused Landsat 7 to increasingly drift within its orbit. The drift exposed it to periods of full sunlight and earlier imaging times, impacting battery maintenance, imaging opportunities, and processing of reliable science data. As a result, the USGS decided to end imaging from the aging satellite.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Landsat Mission Continues</strong></p>
<p>With the end of Landsat 7’s role in the Landsat science mission and the advancing age of Landsat 8, launched in 2013, attention is now directed toward the Landsat Next mission as a critical next step to ensure continuity of Landsat’s unique global Earth science mission. The USGS is currently focused on ensuring the flow of data remains uninterrupted and that the quality of information keeps pace with evolving technological and environmental demands.</p>

<p>The newest mission, known as Landsat Next, promises enhanced capabilities over its predecessors, including improved spatial resolution, increased spectral bands, and faster revisit times. These advancements are essential for more detailed and frequent monitoring of Earth's changing landscapes and for supporting critical decisions in climate resiliency, disaster response, agriculture and water management.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>Landsat Next satellites circling the Earth. The mission is planned for late 2030/early 2031.</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Landsat Next is designed not only to continue the legacy of Landsat, but also to innovate and adapt to the pressing challenges of the 21st century, ensuring that scientists, policymakers, industry, and the public have access to the information needed to better monitor and sustainably manage our ever-changing planet.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a user at <a href="https://discourse.practicalzfs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Practical ZFS</a> asked a deceptively simple question:</p>



<p><em>I have a Proxmox pool of three four-wide RAIDz1 vdevs. Whenever my VM is running, all twelve drives chatter audibly at least once per second, all day long. How come, and can I fix that?</em></p>



<p>There is, of course, a simple answer to this simple question: the VM in question is probably just trickling a constant stream of writes to disk, and those writes are getting sync’d once per second to the underlying metal.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this simple answer doesn’t get to the heart of the question, and doesn’t offer any potential mitigations or solutions either. In order to <em>completely</em> answer the question–and offer some potential fixes–we have to dive down into some pretty deep fundamentals of how ZFS works, and why.</p>



<p>Answering this “simple” question required so many digressions, it felt a bit like asking the user to build <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/johnny-cash-s-one-piece-at-a-time-cadillac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnny Cash’s Cadillac</a> just so they could learn how to wash it!</p>



<h2>Awkward vdev width</h2>



<p>One of the first things that leaps to mind when looking at this user’s problem is their topology: They have twelve total drives, arranged in three RAIDz1 vdevs of four drives apiece. This isn’t an ideal width.</p>



<p>In order to understand why, we need to talk about how RAIDz works. In a nutshell, each <em>block</em>–the fundamental unit of ZFS storage data, whose size is defined by the <em>recordsize</em> or <em>volblocksize</em> properties as appropriate–is split into <em>n-p</em> pieces, where <em>n</em> is the total number of drives in the RAIDz vdev and <em>p </em>is the parity level.</p>



<p>Since block size must be an even power of 2, this means that <em>n-p</em> must also be an even power of 2, if you want the pieces of each block to divide up evenly amongst the drives in the vdev. Let’s see how that works out in practice:</p>



<ul>
<li>A 128KiB block is stored on a three-wide RAIDz1 vdev. 128KiB / (3-1) == 64KiB, so each drive gets 16 4KiB sectors written to it. The 128KiB block therefore occupies precisely 128KiB on disk (before parity), making this is an ideal width.<br></li>



<li>A 128KiB block is stored on a four-wide RAIDz1 vdev. We can’t divide 128KiB evenly among three drives, so what we do instead is write the data in full stripes, followed by a partial-width stripe. This works out to ten stripes of three data sectors and one parity sector, followed by a narrow stripe with the remaining two sectors, and one parity sector for them. This adds up to an aggregate storage efficiency of 32 data sectors / 44 total sectors == 72.7%, not the 75% naively expected…but this is at the default filesystem blocksize of 128KiB, not Proxmox’s default volblocksize of 8KiB or 16KiB. That’s going to make things much worse.<br></li>



<li>A 128KiB block is stored on an eight-wide RAIDz2 vdev. That means we”’ll need to write thirty-two data sectors–and since 32/6==5.3, we’ll have to write our block in five full-width stripes of six data sectors + two parity sectors, followed by a narrow stripe of two data sectors + two parity sectors. This comes out to the same 32 data sectors / 44 total sectors we saw for a four-wide Z1–again, only 72.7% rather than the 75% we naively expected.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, none of this is the end of the world–OpenZFS founding developer Matt Ahrens famously <a href="https://www.delphix.com/blog/zfs-raidz-stripe-width-or-how-i-learned-stop-worrying-and-love-raidz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that he learned to stop worrying and love RAIDz, and you should too. In particular, pools which mostly store compressible data are minimally affected by other-than-ideal vdev widths, because OpenZFS compression results in off-sized stripes anyway.</p>



<p>To be clear, I don’t disagree with Matt–the impact of off-size vdev widths is usually pretty minimal, and I rarely advise anyone to tear down a working pool just because they used an odd width.</p>



<p>With that said, if you’re building a new pool from scratch, the impact of offsize widths on both performance and efficiency <em>is</em> noticeable, so there’s no reason not to go ahead and build your pools optimally…and in this <em>particular</em> case, we aren’t just worried about performance and storage efficiency, we’re worried about noise.</p>



<p>We’re also working with very small blocksizes, which–as we’re about to see in the next section–amplifies all of these issues significantly.</p>



<h2>Awkward block size</h2>



<p>The next issue is a bit more subtle, and requires some knowledge of a ZFS-powered distribution to spot–the user is running Proxmox, a Debian-based “appliance” distribution which makes it easy to operate virtual machines (VMs) stored on top of OpenZFS.</p>



<p>Proxmox is a very opinionated distribution–it wants you to use zvols (block storage datasets) rather than filesystems (file storage datasets) for your virtual machines, and it defaults to very small <em>volblocksize</em>–8KiB for all but the most recent release, which bumps that up to 16KiB.</p>



<h3>volblocksize=8K is a bad idea</h3>



<p>Remember the math we did earlier, figuring out whether a vdev width was ideal or not? In Proxmox, using the default settings, there generally isn’t any ideal RAIDz vdev width–the blocks are too small to divvy up between them.</p>



<p>For anyone using Proxmox version 7 or earlier, the 8KiB volblocksize parameter means each block only has two sectors of data–and therefore, cannot be split evenly among more than two data drives.</p>



<p>Our noise-beleaguered questioner is running four-wide Z1, which means that each 8KiB block–two sectors of data–can only occupy three total sectors (two data and one parity). That’s only three drives wide–so OpenZFS stores each 8KiB block <em>on</em> only three drives, each of which writes a single sector only.</p>



<p>Since we are only writing to three disks per stripe, we’re only getting the 67% storage efficiency of a three-wide Z1, not the 75% storage efficiency we might naively expect from a four-wide Z1–or even the 72.7% we’d expect from that four-wide Z1 once we take extra stripes into account.</p>



<p>We’re also writing a single sector to each drive, with <em>ruinously</em> bad effect on both performance and drive noise–we’re maximizing the potential for fragmentation, which means maximal drive head seeks, minimal performance, and maximal drive noise.</p>



<h3>volblocksize=16K isn’t much better</h3>



<p>Beginning with Proxmox 8, the default volblocksize for new VMs is 16KiB, not 8KiB. This is still awfully narrow for many common use cases, but it’s at least not quite as punishing as the old 8KiB value.</p>



<p>As we saw in the previous section, we can’t split a block evenly into three pieces–so we’ll need one narrow stripe at the end of every block. Unfortunately, we’re only working with 16KiB at a time, not the 128KiB we looked at earlier–so the impact is more punishing.</p>



<p>Each 16KiB block must be split into four 4KiB sectors. Three of those sectors plus a parity sector go on one full-width stripe, then the remaining sector gets its own parity sector in a second, narrower stripe–leaving us with aggregate storage efficiency of 4 data sectors / 2 parity sectors == 67%.</p>



<p>The good news is, this does mean that on every block read or written, half of our drives get to do 8K I/O instead of 4K I/O. That will improve performance slightly, and <em>might</em> decrease noise a little…but probably not enough to notice, in either case.</p>



<h2>Minimizing noise and maximizing performance</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve built Johnny Cash’s Cadillac by hand, we can finally talk about washing it.</p>



<p>To recap, our user is unhappy with the amount of drive noise their Proxmox server is making. We know that the server has twelve drives, organized into three four-wide RAIDz1 vdevs. This is the user’s first Proxmox server, which means they’re almost certainly using default settings–meaning either volblocksize=8K, or volblocksize=16K.</p>



<p>As we’ve already learned, the combination of zvols, small volblocksize, and off-size RAIDz vdev widths means we’re writing more sectors than we really need to–potentially, a <em>lot</em> more sectors than naive napkin math might suggest.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, none of these poor configuration choices are easy to remedy–RAIDz vdevs cannot currently be reshaped, and volblocksize is immutable once set. So we’re looking at tearing down pretty much <em>everything</em> to hopefully resolve the problem.</p>



<h3>Pool topology improvements</h3>



<p>For pool topology, we can assume that our user was looking for that naive 75% storage efficiency that four-wide Z1 implies (but does not typically deliver). What we don’t know, yet, is how important that promised additional storage actually is.</p>



<p>If our user is really focused on that 75% storage efficiency, they’re pretty much out of luck–you don’t hit that number until you get to ten-wide RAIDz2, which is an ideal width offering a naive SE of 80%.</p>



<p>Our user does have twelve drives, so a ten-wide Z2 is at least possible–but our user would also be dropping from three vdevs to one, and would need a minimum volblocksize of 32KiB (eight 4KiB sectors) just to get full width writes at one sector per drive.</p>



<p>If the user is less focused on total capacity, it probably makes more sense to consider one of these topologies:</p>



<ul>
<li>Six 2-wide mirrors: six vdevs + full volblocksize writes to each disk + double IOPS for reads == maximum performance with minimum noise, at 50% SE and single redundancy</li>



<li>Four 3-wide Z1: four vdevs + half volblocksize written to each disk == very high performance with significantly reduced noise, at 67% SE and single redundancy</li>



<li>Three 4-wide Z2: three vdevs + half volblocksize written to each disk == high performance with significantly reduced noise, at 50% SE and dual redundancy</li>



<li>Two 6-wide Z2: two vdevs + quarter volblocksize written to each disk == moderate performance with possibly reduced noise, at 67% SE (maximum, see next section) and dual redundancy</li>
</ul>



<h3>Volblocksize improvements</h3>



<p>Generally speaking, the larger volblocksize is, the higher maximum throughput <em>may</em> be achieved–at the expense of increasing latency experienced per individual I/O operation. The maximum overall performance is achieved when volblocksize matches or <em>slightly</em> exceeds the most common random I/O operation size in the underlying workload.</p>



<p>This means that for a PostgreSQL DB using 8KiB pages, you want to use a volblocksize of either 8KiB or 16KiB. Although 8KiB is a direct match, 16KiB might be preferable–larger volblocksize offers higher compression potential, and larger I/O per individual disk (meaning higher per-disk performance). For our specific original complaint–noise–we <em>definitely</em> want to lean toward the higher volblocksize, because larger individual operations means fewer seeks, which in turn means less “platter chatter!”</p>



<p>However, most VMs aren’t dedicated PostgreSQL VMs. Even in the world of database engines–the most latency-sensitive applications–MySQL InnoDB defaults to 16KiB pages, and MSSQL generally defaults to 64KiB pages. Meanwhile, VMs used for bulk storage of “Linux ISOs” will mostly be moving entire multi-GiB files!</p>



<p>For a general-purpose VM, I recommend 64KiB volblocksize–this aims at a sweet spot between minimal latency and maximal throughput, with decent potential for compression.</p>



<h3>Putting it all together</h3>



<p>With volblocksize=16KiB on a pool consisting of three 4-wide Z1 vdevs, our user is experiencing a lot of unnecessary inefficiency as well as unwanted noise. Each write goes to only three of the four drives in each vdev, and consists of only a single sector per drive–absolutely maximizing fragmentation, which in turns minimizes performance and maximizes noise, all while screwing up the extra storage efficiency that our user was likely expecting to get.</p>



<p>Although we don’t know precisely what workload our user expects to see in their VM, we can assume a mixture of fileserving and desktop user interface stuff–in other words, “general-purpose use.” For this use case, we typically want each block to be around 64KiB.</p>



<p>If we rebuild the pool with four three-wide Z1 instead of three four-wide Z1, and change volblocksize from 16KiB to 64Kib, we will significantly increase the user’s storage efficiency and performance, as well as decreasing their experienced noise.</p>



<p>Let’s walk through the process of writing 64KiB to our original pool, and the same 64KiB to a redesigned pool using the same twelve drives:</p>



<ul>
<li>Our original pool uses 16KiB blocks and four-wide Z1 vdevs. Each block written is split into four two-sector wide writes (three data and one parity). It therefore requires four total blocks, and <strong>sixteen</strong> individual write operations, to commit 64KiB of data.</li>



<li>Our redesigned pool uses 64KiB blocks and three-wide Z1 vdevs. Each block written is split into three eight-sector wide writes (two data and one parity). It therefore requires only one total block, and <strong>three</strong> individual write operations, to commit the same 64KiB of data.</li>
</ul>



<p>When we compare these two setups, we can see that our user’s original pool requires a whopping <em>five times</em> more individual write operations for every 64KiB committed to disk than our revised setup does.</p>



<p>Obviously, this means our revised setup will enjoy much higher performance than the original–and thanks to the lessons learned in earlier sections, we also know that we’ll get improved on-disk storage efficiency to go along with it.</p>



<p>But more importantly–since the issue that caught our user’s attention in the first place was <em>noise</em>, not performance or capacity–20% of the total write operations issued means 20% of the opportunities to cause a drive’s head to seek, so we can expect our twelve-drive pool to be a <em>lot</em> less “chatty” while it works!</p>



<p>If that’s not good enough, a pool of six two-wide mirrors requires only <em>two</em> sixteen-sector-wide writes to commit the same 64KiB of data. That’s only 12.5% of the individual write operations the original setup needed!</p>



<h2>Visualization</h2>



<p>It may help to see a visual representation of how 64KiB of data will be written to several of the topologies and volblocksizes we’ve configured, from least performant (and noisiest) to most performant (and quietest).</p>



<p>We’ll show all twelve of our drives as they’re ordered in the pool topology, then we’ll show each sequential write operation necessary to commit 64KiB to that pool. Greyed-out areas of the graph don’t represent wasted space–they simply note that that drive was not used for that write operation.</p>

<p>If we’re working with Proxmox 7 or below, the default volblocksize is 8KiB. You simply can’t stretch an 8KiB block all the way across a four-wide RAIDz1 vdev, so we consistently write 3-wide stripes across groups of four drives.</p>



<p>This gives us terrible results for both performance and noise–each of our drives is forced to perform individual 4KiB (single-sector) operations on every vdev write.</p>



<p>We needed to issue 24 individual disk write operations, each only a single sector wide… which leaves us <em>hoping</em> that OpenZFS at least manages to order most of those single-sector operations contiguously both now and in the future.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="140" src="https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-4-wideZ1-16K-1024x140.png" alt="ZFS 64KiB write RAIDz visualization 4 wide Z1 16K output" srcset="https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-4-wideZ1-16K-1024x140.png 1024w, https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-4-wideZ1-16K-300x41.png 300w, https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-4-wideZ1-16K-768x105.png 768w, https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-4-wideZ1-16K.png 1340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image credits: Jim Salter, CC-BY-SA 4.0</figcaption></figure>



<p>Beginning with Proxmox 8, the default volblocksize is 16KiB. This is generally an improvement, but leaves us with a bit of a mixed bag due to our off-sized vdevs.</p>



<p>In order to write 16KiB blocks, OpenZFS issues each vdev one full stripe write (one sector to each drive) followed by a partial stripe write. The first stripe contains three of the four data sectors we need to write, along with another sector of parity. The second stripe consists of the remaining one data sector we need to write, along with a parity sector for it.</p>



<p>This mish-mash allows your drives to perform 8KiB operations roughly half the time, and 4KiB operations the other half. It is an improvement, but we’re still looking at 18 individual disk write operations to commit our 64KiB of data to disk.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="203" src="https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-3-wideZ1-1024x203.png" alt="ZFS 64KiB write RAIDz visualization 3 wide Z1 output" srcset="https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-3-wideZ1-1024x203.png 1024w, https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-3-wideZ1-300x60.png 300w, https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-3-wideZ1-768x152.png 768w, https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-3-wideZ1.png 1340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image credits: Jim Salter, CC-BY-SA 4.0</figcaption></figure>



<p>This time, we’re looking at ideal-width Z1 vdevs plus 64KiB volblocksize, with dramatic differences. We only need to write a single block, and that single block only lights up three total drives.</p>



<p>We committed the same 64KiB to disk, but gave the drives <em>six times</em> fewer opportunities to seek (remember: seeks both drop performance and irritate us with noise) when we did!</p>



<p>We also used the same total 24 4KiB sectors on-disk as the two four-wide Z1 vdevs did. Take this lesson to heart–just because a vdev is slightly wider doesn’t mean it’s necessarily going to offer greater storage efficiency.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="329" src="https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-mirrors-1024x329.png" alt="ZFS 64KiB write RAIDz visualization mirrors output" srcset="https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-mirrors-1024x329.png 1024w, https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-mirrors-300x96.png 300w, https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-mirrors-768x246.png 768w, https://allthingsopen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zfs-64KiB-write-RAIDz-visualization-mirrors.png 1340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image credits: Jim Salter, CC-BY-SA 4.0</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, we have my favorite topology for relatively small pools–mirror vdevs. We’re still using volblocksize=64K, so we’re still only issuing a single block write to our pool–but now we’re only issuing it to two disks, not three, saving us ⅓ the potential for platter chatter that our 3-wide RAIDz1 offered above.</p>



<p>Our mirror vdevs offer us significantly better performance than even the 3-wide RAIDz1 vdevs: we get half again the vdevs and double the read IOPS per vdev. Fault tolerance also increases <em>slightly</em>–each vdev still only survives a single disk failure, but there are fewer disks to fail per vdev.</p>



<p>If you want greater failure resistance, consider 4-wide or 6-wide RAIDz2 instead.</p>



<h2>An alternate approach</h2>



<p>Although we’ve successfully answered the question “<em>why</em> do my drives make noise?” we haven’t entirely answered the more important question, “and how do I stop hearing them.”</p>



<p>By properly configuring our pool topology and block size, we can drastically minimize the number of seeks issued to our drive heads, which in turn makes them far less “chattery.” But we should also ask the question, “what if we just can’t <em>hear</em> them?”</p>



<p>The amount of noise your mechanical drives make is largely influenced by the chassis you put them in. Ideally, you want a fairly heavy aluminum or steel case with rubber grommets for all the drive screws, and rubber bushings anywhere the drive might be expected to rest.</p>



<p>Dampening the vibrations transmitted to the chassis–and having a chassis with heavy panels, ideally <em>not</em> gamerriffic glass–will do wonders to make any noise your drives make much less obnoxious.</p>
