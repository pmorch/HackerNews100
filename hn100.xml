            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/traintoilet">https://www.devever.net/~hl/traintoilet</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39163797">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="nh">
          <main>
            <article><p>The other day I rode on a Class 800 train in the UK. This is the “Intercity
Express” train designed to replace the venerable HST (Intercity 125 with Mark 3
coaches, a train of which I have many memories and which I will dearly miss).</p>
<p>Modern trains in the UK have disabled toilets with power-operated doors. The
older models of these toilets had “open”, ”close” and “lock” buttons on the
inside, where you had to press “close”, wait for the door to close, and then
press ”lock”. There is no separate “unlock” button; pressing the “open” button
on the inside automatically unlocks and opens the door.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a reason for the separation of the closing and locking
functions, but not the opening and unlocking functions: it avoids a Denial of
Service attack where someone can just press “close” and then jump out before
the door closes. If the interior “close” button automatically locked the door,
this would result in the toilet becoming permanently inaccessible.</p>
<p>The problem with this design is that most people don't understand state
machines, and this design confused a lot of people who were unable to lock the
door correctly, or believed they'd locked the door when they hadn't.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.devever.net/~hl/img/toilet_fsm.svg" alt="">
<figcaption>The toilet door controls state machine (on older trains)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a result the newer disabled toilets on trains tend to have a lever you have
to move to lock the door:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.devever.net/~hl/img/toilet_controls" alt="TODO">
<figcaption>Train disabled toilet interior controls (Class 800)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This design is an improvement since it is more intuitively comprehensible to
most people. Except of course, this lever isn't a “real” lever directly
connected to a locking mechanism but just some input to a microcontroller. This
raises the question of what happens when the state of the lever doesn't match
up with the state of the door and how the microcontroller deals with that.</p>
<p>Some models of train in the UK solve this robustly by having the lever spring
back to the “unlocked” position if you try to move it to the “locked” position
when the door is open. Presumably this lever-return mechanism is
electromagnetically activated whenever the door is in the wrong state for the
lever to be active.</p>
<p>Hitachi, however, have chosen a different strategy: a tiny metal pin is
projected whenever you should not be able to move the door handle from
“unlocked” to “locked”. This pin itself locks the lock handle in the unlocked
position.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that there is some play in the lever around when
exactly the microcontroller detects the lever as being in the “locked”
position. As such, you can close the door, then hold the lever just beyond the
point at which the locking pin could engage with it, but not to the point where
it reads as “locked”. Then you can open the door, but the locking pin projects
into thin air; thus the lever is free and can be moved to the locked position.
The door close button remains active and you can then close the door. I
confirmed that the door will then immediately lock as soon as the door is
closed. Since I could do this and then jump out before the door closes, this is
effectively a toilet DoS vulnerability on a train.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaIDiwOQfSY">I've posted a video here where I demonstrate this issue.</a></p>
<p>You can also see the locking pin in the image above. Ordinarily, it should not
be visible projected, but because I have the handle at the precise point where
the logic thinks it's in the unlocked position but far enough away from it that
the locking pin can't make contact, the locking pin has projected into air.</p>
<p>This is the second opportunity I've had to test this issue on the Class 800. On
this particular occasion when I was testing this vulnerability, I seem to have
actually confused the toilet door controller enough that it decided “screw
this” and went into out-of-order mode, which didn't happen the first and
previous time. The toilet was working again when I alighted from the train; I
have no idea if it reset automatically after some period or if someone on the
train reset it.</p>
<p>Amusingly this is not the first DoS vulnerability I've found on a train — but
that will have to wait for another article.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="articleContent" id="article-content"><p>Moody’s Analytics has found 21 million “red flags” associated with shell companies that could be used to enable financial crimes, from ancient directors to dubious addresses.</p><div>



<p>For instance, more than 2,200 companies have directors aged 123 years and above, despite the fact that the oldest known human lived to 122, said Richard Graham, a director at Moody’s Analytics, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/about/insights/data-stories/kyc-innovation-shell-company-indicator.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;published Monday. One listed director — at 942 years old — would have been born in the 11th century.</p>



<p>Atypical directorship is just one of seven key behaviors highlighted in the research, including mass registration, dormancy and circular ownership. While new regulations across the world are looking to improve transparency at shell companies, there is still some way to go, with $1.6 trillion laundered annually, according to data from Moody’s Analytics.</p>



<p>“Organizations today face mounting complexity in understanding true ownership structures and detecting risky corporate relationships,” said Ted Datta, head of the financial crime compliance practice for Europe, Africa and Americas at Moody’s Analytics. “By detecting these discrepancies, we can equip investigators and analysts with the tools to better investigate fraud.”</p>



<p>Findings from its report included a China-based textile and clothing manufacturer that reported over $2 billion revenues in 2019, despite having only one employee. There’s also thousands of examples of directors below the age of five, and 22,000 entities with a registered address at Egypt’s pyramids. Meanwhile, one individual held 5,751 roles at 2,883 different entities.</p>



<p>The study looked at some 472 million companies in November. The country with the highest number of shell company risks was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-10/russian-money-laundering-of-war-profit-suspected-in-london-by-uk-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the UK</a>, with almost 5 million flags. Companies registered in the US had the most flags related to financial anomalies, at over 1.25 million. Panama is also a hotspot, with 47% of companies in the jurisdiction raising alarm, though the number of anonymous registrations dropped by half following the Panama Papers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-29/panama-law-firm-clients-targeted-in-u-s-tax-evasion-probe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigations</a>.</p>



<p>While shell companies might have legitimate purposes, their opaqueness is often use to hide criminal financial activity, Moody’s Analytics said. Other red governance flags included jurisdictional risk, outlier ultimate beneficial ownership and financial anomalies, it said.</p></div><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                            <p>The <a href="http://www.military.com/army">Army</a> is tossing its mandate for potential recruits to have a high school diploma or GED certificate to enlist in the service, in one of the most dramatic moves yet in the escalating <a href="https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces">recruiting</a> crisis hitting the entire Defense Department.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the service announced that individuals may enlist without those previously required education certifications if they ship to basic training this fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1.</p>

<p>Recruits must also be at least 18 years old and otherwise qualify for a job in the active-duty Army. They also must score at least a 50 on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or <a href="https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/asvab">ASVAB</a>, an SAT-style quiz to measure a potential recruit's academic ability.</p>

<p>A 50 on the test is a relatively low score, with 31 being the minimum to qualify for service. Combat arms jobs such as infantrymen and cavalry scouts need only minimal scores to serve, while admin work such as a human resources specialist or public affairs require scores of 100 or higher.</p>

<p>Previously, the Army would allow people to enlist if they hadn't finished high school yet at the age of 17 with parental consent. Those recruits typically wouldn't ship to basic training until they completed school.</p>

<p>The change follows another shift in policy this week when the service <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/06/23/army-relaxes-tattoo-rules-it-scrambles-new-recruits.html">relaxed its tattoo rules</a>, allowing potential recruits to enlist with tattoos on their hands and neck, which previously needed waivers.</p>

<p>The Army and its sister services <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/05/13/bigger-bonuses-pentagons-top-weapon-combat-recruiting-crisis-troops-head-exits.html">have scrambled this year, offering increasingly generous benefits and policy tweaks</a> in an effort to improve recruiting numbers. The Army has hit 40% of its recruiting goals this year, with the struggle to fill the ranks seemingly so grim the Defense Department reduced its planned total force size because prior recruiting goals were out of reach.</p>

<p>Those challenges come amid a low unemployment rate and a competitive civilian job market, with employers offering increased wages and benefits even for entry-level jobs.</p>

Solid-state cells differ from conventional lithium-ion batteries in their use of a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/john-goodenough-glass-battery-news-hydroquebec" target="_blank">glass</a> or <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ion-storage-systems-ceramic-electrolyte-news-solid-state-batteries" target="_blank">ceramic electrolyte</a>, instead of a liquid composed of lithium salts. Automakers are keen on solid-state batteries’ future, because the technology offers greater thermal stability than liquid-based batteries, thus allowing for substantially faster recharge, among other advantages.</p><p>Solid-state has also been the subject of recent announcements from battery manufacturers and mainstream automakers alike. In early January, Volkswagen Group’s <a href="https://www.powerco.de/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PowerCo SE</a> battery company <a href="https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/press-releases/powerco-confirms-results-quantumscapes-solid-state-cell-passes-first-endurance-test-18031" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said it tested lithium-metal cells</a> from <a href="https://www.quantumscape.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">QuantumScape</a>, achieving 1,000 charging cycles with 95 percent of the cell’s capacity still intact. The company said in a statement that the cell’s life-performance was analogous to “an electric car that could drive more than 500,000 kilometers (300,000 miles) without any noticeable loss of range.”</p><p>“What happens when you’re driving down I-75 and you hit a big pit in the road? What kind of damage would be done to the solid-state matrix?” <strong>—Bob Galyen, Galyen Energy </strong></p><p>Similarly, Toyota announced in October that it <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/toyota-solid-state-battery" target="_self">plans to incorporate solid-state batteries</a> in an unnamed number of production vehicles by 2027. The automaker said it is targeting a 1,000-km (600-mile) range with 80 percent DC fast-charge in 10 minutes or less. In December, Chinese automaker <a href="https://www.nio.com/et7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NIO</a> also got in the game, saying it is introducing a 150-kilowatt-hour “semi-solid-state battery” that would theoretically offer a 1,000-km range as soon as this summer.</p><p>Experts were quick to point out, however, that NIO’s battery, made by <a href="http://www.solidstatelion.com/en/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WeLion New Energy Technology Co.</a>, is not solid-state. “This is in fact a fairly conventional NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) cell with a gel electrolyte that has been in production for 15 years and is typically referred to as lithium-polymer,” noted Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for <a href="https://guidehouseinsights.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guidehouse Insights</a>. “Technically the gel is considered a semi-solid because it has properties of both a solid and liquid. But in a cell, it lacks the properties of a true solid-state electrolyte.” Notably, he said, semi-solid-state cells can be punctured on impact, which is closer to the nature of a traditional lithium-ion battery—and in contrast with actual solid-state cells, which would fracture. He also noted that semi-solid-state cells, with a manganese spinel chemistry, were used on a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-goes-high-tech-with-sonata-its-first-hybrid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyundai Sonata hybrid in 2009</a>.</p><h3>Engineering challenge</h3><p>The big challenge facing true solid-state cells, however, is the long climb to engineering validation. Galyen cites five “golden rules” of batteries–safety, performance, life, cost, and environmental–which must be met for solid-state cells to achieve industry-wide adoption.</p><p>The process is reminiscent of Elon Musk’s reference to “manufacturing hell” in 2018.</p><p>“Most of the solid-state battery companies fall short on at least three of the five golden rules,” he said. “I haven’t seen anyone publish life numbers that make any sense. And I haven’t seen cost numbers that are even close to competing with liquid-state, lithium-ion batteries.” Solid-state costs, he said, are about where conventional lithium-ion batteries were a decade ago.</p><p>Automakers also still need to verify the “performance rule” in three key areas–performance at temperature, performance at altitude, and performance under shock and vibration. Of those, Galyen said, shock and vibration are particularly concerning. “What happens when you’re driving down I-75 and you hit a big pit in the road?” he said. “What kind of damage would be done to the solid-state matrix?”</p><p>Automakers will not move to broad adoption until they are able to verify the new technology’s abilities in all those key areas, Galyen added. “None of these batteries have been validated yet,” he said. “So how do you plan on putting something into automotive production when it hasn’t been validated?”</p><p>Validation will take time, while automakers test factory-built cells in real-world conditions. To do that, manufacturers will first need to build battery factories, which could take two years, and then run a half-year of prototype products and distribute them to customers, who put them through their duty cycles. “Then you put the products into production and find out what your ‘gotchas’ are,” Galyen said of the inevitable problems.</p><p>The process is reminiscent of Elon Musk’s reference to “manufacturing hell” in 2018. Back then, Musk declared his company was about enter into six months of the so-called “hell” as it struggled to work out the kinks in its Model 3 production line. He told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-trip-through-hell-inside-the-2018-scramble-to-avoid-the-collapse-of-tesla-11627660800" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporters at the time</a> that a flood, a tornado, or even a ship sinking anywhere on earth could disrupt his company’s plans.</p><p>Galyen said that such headaches are commonplace in manufacturing, but particularly so in battery production. “There’s not one battery I’ve ever seen that doesn’t have a ton of ‘gotchas,’” he said.</p><p>To do the build-out, production, and validation could easily take seven or more years, Galyen said.</p><h3>Science nearly ready</h3><p>Experts expect the science to keep evolving during that period. Today, there are numerous versions of solid-state batteries using everything from traditional graphite to silicon to lithium metal in the anode, and there are cathodes made from traditional NMC and nickel-rich materials.</p><p>Most experts assume that more time is needed to run the gauntlet of engineering validation, even for the biggest, most secretive companies.</p><p><span></span>Battery scientists are optimistic that the new breed of batteries can overcome two key drawbacks of conventional lithium-ion. First, they say, nickel-rich cathodes will enable the battery industry to use less cobalt in the cathode. Second, solid-state chemistries will enable battery makers to use lithium metal in the anode.</p><p>The ability to reduce cobalt in the cathode is important because cobalt is scarce, expensive, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2023/ev-cobalt-mines-congo/" target="_blank">often mined in countries with weak labor laws</a>. And the ability to use lithium metal in the anode is important because it would boost energy density while promoting safety. Makers of liquid-based lithium-ion batteries currently don’t use lithium metal anodes due to fear of fires.</p><p>“This is why we started this (solid-state) journey in the first place–so we could use lithium metal,” noted <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=320005" target="_blank">Helena Braga</a>, an associate professor of engineering physics at the University of Porto, in Portugal, and a well-known researcher who worked with <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/goodenough/facts/" target="_blank">Nobel Prize</a> winner <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/john-goodenough-tribute" target="_self">John Goodenough</a> on solid-state batteries a decade ago. Braga said she is confident that the new chemistries will be ready soon, if they are not already.</p><p>What’s unknown is how far along those chemistries may be within some of the big manufacturing companies that make few public pronouncements, such as <a href="https://www.lgchem.com/main/index" target="_blank">LG Chem</a> and <a href="https://www.byd.com/us" target="_blank">BYD</a>. Some of those companies may be farther along, but it’s hard to know because there is so little reliable information.</p><p>For now, most experts assume that more time is needed to run the gauntlet of engineering validation, even for the biggest, most secretive companies.</p><p>“Most of the companies have great hope that they’re going to achieve success with the five golden rules,” Galyen said. “And they expect it to happen in the next decade.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>As you can see, even the checkmark wasn’t always there. But one thing remained constant: checkboxes were square.</p>
        <p>Why square? Because that’s how you can tell them from radio buttons:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radiobuttons@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="600" height="620">        </figure>
        <p>Their distinguishing feature is a single choice. If you select one, everything else is de-selected.</p>
        <p>I’m not sure when the distinction between square/round was introduced, but it seems to already exist in the 90-s:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>And since then, every major operating system followed this tradition. From Windows 3.11:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>through Windows 95:</p>

<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_windows_95@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="340">        </figure>
        <p>to Windows 11:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_windows_11@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="400"><figcaption>Windows 11 (2021)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>from Mac OS 4:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_mac_os_7.5@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="120"><figcaption>Mac OS 4 (1987)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>till macOS Sonoma:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>There was a brief confusion up until 1986 when Apple used rounded rectangles instead of circles:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_mac_os_3@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="200"><figcaption>Mac OS 3 (1986)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>but it was quickly resolved.</p>
        <p>The point is, every major OS vendor has been adhering to the convention that checkboxes are square and radio buttons are round.</p>
        <p>Then the Web came. And when I say Web, I mean CSS. And when I say CSS, I mean Flash and then JavaScript.</p>
        <p>You see, people on the Web think conventions are boring. That regular controls need to be reinvented and redesigned. They don’t believe there are any norms.</p>
        <p>That’s why it’s common to see radio buttons containing checkmarks:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/twitter@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="400"><figcaption>Twitter (2024)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>Or square radio buttons:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_yandex_maps@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="700" height="300"><figcaption>Yandex Maps (2024)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>Following the Web’s example, native apps introduced us to round checkboxes:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>Sometimes people just don’t make distinctions anymore. For example, here the first group is single-choice, while the second one is multiple-choice:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/yandex_maps@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="700" height="600"><figcaption>Yandex Maps (2024)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>Or here, one of those polls is single-answer, another is multiple-answer:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/telegram_polls@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="400" height="580"><figcaption>Telegram Web (2024)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>How are people supposed to know?</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/scooby@2x.jpg?t=1706380903" width="500" height="682">        </figure>
        <p>But despite all this chaos and temptation, operating system vendors knew better. To this day, they follow THE convention: checkboxes are square, radio buttons are round.</p>
        <p>Maybe it was part of their internal training. Maybe they had experienced art directors. Maybe it was just luck. I don’t know — it doesn’t really matter — but — somehow — they managed to stick to the convention.</p>
        <p>Until this day.</p>
        <p>Apple is the first major operating system vendor who had abandoned a four-decades-long tradition. Their new visionOS — for the first time in the history of Apple — will have round checkboxes.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/checkbox_vision@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="650" height="672"><figcaption><a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#visionos-apps" target="_blank">Apple Design Resouces — visionOS — Library</a></figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>How should we even call these? Radio checks? Check buttons?</p>
        <p>Anyway, with Apple’s betrayal, I think it’s fair to say there’s no hope for this tradition to continue.</p>
        <p>I therefore officially announce 2024 to be the year when the square checkbox has finally died.</p>

        <p>Kids these days will use a toggle anyway.</p>

  <a href="https://www.e-basteln.de/computing/65f02/65f02/"> 65F02</a></p>

  <p>The 6502 was the CPU in my first computer (an Apple II plus), as well as many other popular home computers of the late 1970s and 80s. It lived on well into the 1990s in game consoles and chess computers, mostly in its updated “65C02” CMOS version. Here’s a re-implementation of the 65C02 in an FPGA, in a pin-compatible format that lets you upgrade those old computers and games to 100 MHz clock rate!</p>
<h2 id="the-concept">The concept</h2>
<p>The idea of implementing a CPU core inside an FPGA is not new, of course. In fact, the CPU core I am using is not my own, but was developed as a 6502 core by Arlet Ottens, and extended to cover the 65C02 opcodes by Ed Spittles and David Banks. A big thank-you to Arlet, Ed, and Dave for developing the core and sharing it freely! Links to their original work are on the 
<a href="https://www.e-basteln.de/computing/65f02/65f02-links/">Files &amp; Links</a> page.</p>
<p>I packaged this in a Spartan-6 FPGA (with 64 kByte on-chip RAM), on a small circuit board which is just the size of a 40-pin dual inline package, with pins matching the 65C02 pinout. I added logic inside the FPGA which can access the external 65C02 bus with the correct timing, based on whatever clock is coming in from the host system. Inside the FPGA, the CPU core runs at 100 MHz. I dubbed this the “65F02”, where the “F” might stand for FPGA or for “Fast”. ;-)</p>

</figure>
<p>The idea is to use this as a “universal” accelerator for 6502 and 65C02-based host computers – just plug it into the CPU socket. The only thing the FPGA board needs to know about its host is the memory map: Where does the host have memory-mapped I/O? Up to 16 different memory maps can be stored in the FPGA, and selected via a mini DIP switch. Upon power-on, the 65F02 grabs the complete RAM and ROM content from the host and copies it into the on-chip RAM, except for the I/O area. Then the CPU gets going, using the internal memory at 100 MHz for all bus accesses except for any I/O addresses – for these, the internal CPU pauses, and an external bus cycle is started at whatever the external clock speed is.</p>
<p>Kudos to Roland Langfeld, who suggested this elegant way of integrating an accelerator into almost any host, and has contributed a lot during the testing and debugging effort. Roland’s original interest was in 6502-based chess computers (there were some really nice ones in the 1980s). But we have successfully tested the prototype 65F02s in an Apple II and a Commodore 8032, as well as various chess computers.</p>

<p>We have focused on Mephisto chess computers first, since these are at the center of Roland’s collector’s interest. But many others are on the wishlist, including Fidelity (Elite A/S Budapest and Glasgow, Prestige, Avantgarde), Novag (Super Constellation, Super Expert C), SciSys (Turbostar), …</p>

<li>Mephisto Rebell 5.0</li>
<li>Novag Constellation Forte A/B</li>
<li>Chafitz ARB (various Sargon versions) and MGS</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microcomputers">Microcomputers</h2>
<p>So far, we are supporting the two 6502-based members of the classic 1977 “Trinity” of home computers – the Apple II and the Commodore PET series. It may be possible and worthwhile to also support some slightly later machines: The Acorn BBC Micro, Atari 400 and 800, and maybe the Commodore C64 come to mind. I don’t have any of these computers though. Please contact me if you are interested to help with an adaptation of the 65F02!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple II</strong>, including the II plus and europlus, and presumably the //e. Quite a bit of hardware and software trickery by Steve Wozniak, and the older models do not support a real 65C02 – but the 65F02 is a bit more generous in its bus timing and works nicely. The Disk II floppy drive works nicely under DOS 3.3; support for the language card is under development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commodore PET/CBM up to 8032</strong>. A very clean and “by the book” design. The same memory map should work for all models from the PET 2001, the 3000 and 4000 series, and the 8000 series up to the 8032. (But excluding the 8096 and beyond, which require memory bank switching.) So far we have tested this on the 8032 only; the 8050 floppy drive works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A caveat is in order here. The home computers, with their flexibility and expandability on both the hardware and software side, are bound to encounter limitations and incompatibilities:</p>
<p>Memory expansion boards and bank switching need to be known to and emulated by the 65F02; and since the 65F02 only has 64 kByte of RAM on board, it cannot fully accelerate the extended memory. Also, while the 65F02 makes an effort to detect the access to time-critical peripheral devices, and switch back to the original slow speed temporarily, there will probably be incompatible software or add-on hardware. And finally, some software you simply don’t <em>want</em> to be accelerated – try an action video game at 100 MHz to understand that concern…</p>
<p>The 65F02 supports an optional hardware switch to disable the acceleration. This way, one can still select between accelerated operation and original speed before one starts the host computer. In non-accelerated mode, the 65F02 should be fully compatible with any software or add-on hardware. (Well; unless the software uses undocumented 6502 opcodes…)</p>
<h2 id="project-status">Project status</h2>
<p>This is a hobby project, and I have no plans at the moment to take it commercial.</p>
<p>Several of the small-form-factor PCBs have been assembled, and have been successfully tested in the above-mentioned computers. The tested computers include environments with TTL and CMOS logic levels, and clock rates ranging from 1 to 5 MHz. IRQs and NMIs are used in the hosts; some of the Mephisto chess computers actively use the READY signal to slow down the CPU, and the 65F02 respects that nicely. We have not used the SO (set overflow) input in earnest, but believe it to work.</p>
<p>The chess computer community has put the 65F02 through its paces and found some very nice improvements in playing strength for the old chess computers. Games and commentary can be found in the German

<p>If you have ideas for the 65F02, would like to help in developing support for additional computers, would like to write about it, please contact me via the email address provided in the About section.</p>
<p><mark>Update, July 2022:</mark> The global electronics supply bottlenecks affect this project too. The Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA (in the required package and speed grade) has moved from a lead time of more than one year to “we don’t know”. The 65F02 will sit on the back burner until the supply situation hopefully returns to normal.</p>

<p>For the past three years, Dan Pashman of <a href="https://www.sporkful.com/">The Sporkful podcast</a> has been on something of a mission: to invent a new pasta shape. All of Pashman's hard work has paid off with the debut of cascatelli pasta, <a href="https://www.sfoglini.com/products/sporkful">available for sale from Sfoglini</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/cascatelli-pasta-01.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Cascatelli pasta"></p>

<p>Pashman and Sfoglini engineered the new shape to maximize the amount of sauce that sticks to it, make it easier to get your fork on it, and have it feel good when you bite into it.</p>

<p><img src="https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/cascatelli-pasta-02.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Cascatelli Pasta 02"></p>

<blockquote><p>Cascatelli is designed to maximize the three qualities by which Dan believes all pasta shapes should be judged:</p>

<p>Sauceability: How readily sauce adheres to the shape<br>
Forkability: How easy it is to get the shape on your fork and keep it there<br>
Toothsinkability: How satisfying it is to sink your teeth into it</p></blockquote>

<p>Pashman documented the invention of cascatelli in a 5-part series on The Sporkful podcast — <a href="https://www.sporkful.com/mission-impastable-1-spaghetti-sucks/">you can listen to the first episode here</a> — and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODYzOTA1ODY2NDgzOTY0?igshid=fvqxwa81z7nc&amp;story_media_id=2517176903157538890">on Instagram</a>. You can <a href="https://www.sfoglini.com/products/sporkful">order some cascatelli</a> to try it out at home, but it looks like they are currently sold out of everything aside from 5-lb bulk bags.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Feature</span> Learning how to program is perhaps now easier than ever with AI, though the tools that suggest or generate source code for you have to be used wisely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programming requires patience and persistence, especially at the start of the learning process when nothing makes much sense. The rules for writing code seem confusing. There are all sorts of punctuation marks and symbols that have to be used carefully. Missing a colon or a comma, or messing up the indentation can lead to errors, depending on the language used. Over time, with enough practice, it does click into place.</p>
<p>Like most beginners learning how to code online, I started by watching tutorials and solving problems in sets of programming exercises. When I got stuck on a problem, it was very tempting to turn to ChatGPT, which would easily help me jump to the right solution. These types of assistants are good at generating simple code, and some of them can even give you a complete answer just as you're describing it.</p>

    

<p>I realized this when wrestling with the implementation of a particular function, and turned off GitHub Copilot's autocomplete feature in Visual Studio Code to stop myself from cheating.</p>
<h3>Don't just copy and paste</h3>
<p>David Malan, a computer science professor at Harvard University teaching CS50, a popular introductory computer science course (that can be taken for free <a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science" rel="nofollow">online</a>), agreed that AI can be a little too helpful sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To dissuade students from using tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Bard to complete their assignments, teachers offered them an alternative: a virtual rubber duck. The CS50 duck is a coding chat-bot powered by GPT-4 but has guardrails in place to prevent students from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/19/copilot_github_students/">cheating</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>Rubber duck debugging, as you may be aware, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://medium.com/@arnoldcsubastil/the-psychology-behind-rubber-duck-debugging-f19141c70060">is a thing</a> in software development: if you're stuck on some code, talking though the problem with some toy or other inanimate object can help you figure out the solution all by yourself. It's quite effective.</p>
<p>The CS50 duck debugger is an homage to that: the bot has been primed to be friendly and supportive, it only responds to queries that are related to the course, and doesn't provide the answers to homework problems, Malan told <em>The Register</em>.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>"Our policy at the course's start is that students may not use third-party software like ChatGPT and Copilot; they simply tend to be too helpful, all too willing to provide students with solutions outright rather than guide them toward them, as a good teacher might. But students are allowed and encouraged to use CS50's own AI-based software, which has those pedagogical guardrails in place," he said.</p>
<p>The CS50 duck was introduced last year, and the feedback has been mostly positive. Having a virtual tutor on hand means students can ask for help at any time they want. But like all AI models, it can make mistakes and isn't always accurate. Initial tests showed it was able to answer about 88 percent of questions related to the curriculum correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coding bot is useful for instructors, too; it gives them more time to help students in other areas beyond homework. In a research paper [<a href="https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/publications/V1fp0567-liu.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF</a>] analyzing the duck debugger's impact, teachers at Harvard said their experiment building a virtual AI coding assistant has paid off. They believe "generative AI [can] bolster student learning, not merely disrupt it," and are looking at ways the technology can be applied in other subjects.</p>
<h3>Saving time with less Googling</h3>
<p>For what it's worth, my academic background is in physics and science journalism, and not computer science. I started learning how to code just before the latest generation of chat bots took off. Previously I would try to understand software concepts or fix bugs by, like many people, reading blog posts or searching for examples of similar code on sites like Stack Overflow. AI allows me to shortcut this process.</p>
<p>Instead of sifting through lots of information to find solutions that best match my problem, I can now turn to a large language model for direct help. I'm learning so that I can better understand the technologies that others are using; these digital assistants get me up to speed faster than poring over multiple articles about, say, slices versus arrays, or leafing through other people's software projects.</p>

        

<p>Machine-written code, however, isn't always useful, and can <a target="_blank" href="https://devclass.com/2024/01/24/ai-assistance-is-leading-to-lower-code-quality-claim-researchers/">lower the quality</a> of a code base. If I copied and pasted an AI assistant's output into my source, it would often introduce new errors because it didn't fit with the rest of my program. Trying to fix these mistakes can be tricky, especially if you don't understand what has been generated. As a novice, it wasn't always clear whether the errors were because the code was just plain wrong or whether it was being used in the wrong context.</p>

</ul>
<p>"I think if someone wanted to learn to code [using the current] crop of AI tools, they should approach it with two goals: Take the time to learn to code enough to know what the tool is generating. [And] adopt the role of 'code reviewer' and study how to identify and improve bad code," Zed Shaw, a software developer and the author of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>, told <em>The Register</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programmers should be able to spot errors in machine-made code and shouldn't trust the bots completely. "The fact that ChatGPT gives solutions quicker wrapped in reassuring phrases like 'I think this should solve your problem..." make it so we turn off our critical thinking, and we don't question its solutions as carefully as we should," said Charles Severance, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan's School of Information, who has <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://online.dr-chuck.com/">released</a> free coding courses online.</p>
<p>"Always assume that ChatGPT is a less-skilled programmer than you are. The only safe way to use AI tools is when you are confident the solution that it produces is correct," he added.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>You need to know what you're doing</h3>
<p>To use these tools effectively, you must understand your problem and explain it clearly in your prompt. The quality of the code returned in the output depends on the way you frame your questions in the input, Inbal Shani, chief product officer at GitHub, told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>Users should interact with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/22/github_copilot_learns_new_tricks/">GitHub Copilot</a> as if they were talking to a colleague, she suggested. "The more detail you give that assistant that sits next to you about what your intention is, where you're going for the problem you're trying to solve, the better response you'll get because the AI gets more context. It knows how to do a more detailed search to find that right piece of code or recommend the right testing infrastructure for you," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The programming languages we use have become more aligned with human language; chat tools are just the next step in this evolution</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phillip Compeau, a assistant teaching professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who created the <a href="https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/" rel="nofollow">Rosalind</a> platform and <a href="https://programmingforlovers.com/" rel="nofollow">Programming for Lovers</a> tutorial, for people interested in computational biology, agreed.</p>
<p>When he's teaching students who are beginning to code, he encourages them to stay away from AI. But for more advanced students who know the basics, he teaches them how to use the technology to be more productive and efficient in their work.</p>
<p>"One of the things that I show students is that the best way to get a clean, correct answer from an AI tool generating code is if you are able to clearly and correctly specify exactly what the computer needs to do. That is the very definition of programming a computer, and over time, the programming languages we use have become more aligned with human language; chat tools are just the next step in this evolution," he told <em>The Register</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figuring out what you want your program to do, how it should work, and where it's gone wrong, is crucial in coding. Learners can only build these core skills over time with consistent practice. You can't skip this process by relying on AI if you want to be a competent software developer. But if you use it wisely, you can improve quickly and become a good programmer - and maybe it'll even be fun. ®</p>

I find common internet completely stupid: Twitter, tiktok, Instagram, etc. What a huge waste of energy</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>or</p> <blockquote> <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31312967">When someone chooses to blog on twitter you know it's facile at best, and more likely simply stupid (as in this case)</a></p> </blockquote> <p>These kinds of comments are fairly common, e.g., I pulled up Foone's last 10 Twitter threads that scored 200 points or more on HN and 9 out of 10 had comments like this, complaining about the use of Twitter.</p> <p>People often express bafflement that anyone could have a reason for using [bad platform], such as in "<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33234817">how many tweets are there just to make his point? 200? nobody thinks 'maybe this will be more coherent on a single page'? I don't get social media</a>" or "<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31723037">Come on, typing a short description and uploading a picture 100 times is easier than typing everything in one block and adding a few connectors here and there? ... objectively speaking it is more work</a>".</p> <p>Personally, I don't really like video as a format and, for 95% of youtube videos that I see, I'd rather get the information as a blog post than a video (and this will be even more true if Google really cracks down on ad blocking) and I think that, for a reader who's interested in the information, long-form blog posts are basically strictly better than long threads on [bad platform]. But I also recognize that much of the content that I want to read wouldn't exist at all if it wasn't for things like [bad platform].</p> <p>Stepping back and looking at the big picture, there are four main reasons I've seen that people use [bad platform], which are that it gets more engagement, it's where their friends are, it's lower friction, and it monetizes better.</p> <h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3> <p>The engagement reason is the simplest, so let's look at that first. Just looking at where people spend their time, short-form platforms like Twitter, Instagram, etc., completely dominate longer form platforms like Medium, Blogspot, etc.; you can see this in the valuations of these companies, in survey data, etc. Substack is the hottest platform for long-form content and its last valuation was ~$600M, basically a rounding error compared to the value of short-form platforms (I'm not including things like Wordpress and or Squarespace, which derive a lot of their valuation from things other than articles and posts). The money is following the people and people have mostly moved on from long-form content. And if you talk to folks using substack about where their readers and growth comes from, that comes from platforms like Twitter, so people doing long-form content who optimize for engagement or revenue will still produce a lot of short-form content<sup id="fnref:O"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:O">1</a></sup>.</p> <h3 id="friends">Friends</h3> <p>The friends reason is probably the next simplest. A lot of people are going to use whatever people around them are using. Realistically, if I were ten years younger and started doing something online in 2023 instead of 2013, more likely than not, I would've tried streaming before I tried blogging. But, as an old, out of touch, person, I tried starting a blog in 2013 even knowing that blogging was a dying medium relative to video. It seems to have worked well enough for me, so I've stuck with it, but this seems generational. While there are people older than me who do video and people younger than me who write blogs, looking at the distribution of ages, I'm not all that far from the age where people overwhelmingly moved to video and if I were really planning to do something long-term instead of just doing <a href="https://danluu.com/writing-non-advice/#friction">the lowest friction thing when I started</a>, I would've started with video. Today, doing video is natural for folks who are starting to put their thoughts online.</p> <h3 id="friction">Friction</h3> <p>When [bad platform] is a microblogging platform like Twitter, Mastodon, Threads, etc., the friends reason still often applies — people on these platforms are frequently part of a community they interact with, and it makes more sense for them to keep their content on the platform full of community members than to put content elsewhere. But the bigger reason for people whose content is widely read is that a lot of people find these platforms are much lower friction than writing blog posts. When people point this out, [bad platform] haters are often baffled, responding with things like</p> <blockquote> <p>Come on, typing a short description and uploading a picture 100 times is easier than typing everything in one block and adding a few connectors here and there? ... objectively speaking it is more work</p> </blockquote> <p>For one thing, most widely read programmer/tech bloggers that I'm in touch with use platforms that are actually higher friction (e.g., <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1204576631890698240">Jekyll</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1244050309648797697">friction</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@danluu/109542037575670321">Hugo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1244050309648797697">fric</a><a href="https://commaok.xyz/post/on_hugo/">tion</a>. But, in principle, they could use substack, hosted wordpress, or another platform that this commenter considers "objectively" lower friction, but this fundamentally misunderstands where the friction comes from. When people talk about [bad platform] being lower friction, it's usually about the emotional barriers to writing and publishing something, not the literal number of clicks it takes to publish something. We can argue about whether or not this is rational, whether this "objectively" makes sense, etc., but at the end of the day, it is simply true that many people find it mentally easier to write on a platform where you write short chunks of text instead of a single large chunk of text.</p> <p>I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@danluu/">sometimes write things on Mastodon</a> because it feels like the right platform for some kinds of content for me. Of course, since the issue is not the number of clicks it takes and there's some underlying emotional motivation, other people have different reasons. For example, <a href="https://nitter.net/Foone/status/1066548390517854208">Foone says</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Not to humblebrag or anything, but my favorite part of getting posted on hackernews or reddit is that EVERY SINGLE TIME there's one highly-ranked reply that's "jesus man, this could have been a blog post! why make 20 tweets when you can make one blog post?"</p> <p>CAUSE I CAN'T MAKE A BLOG POST, GOD DAMN IT. I have ADHD. I have bad ADHD that is being treated, and the treatment is NOT WORKING TERRIBLY WELL. I cannot focus on writing blog posts. it will not happen</p> <p>if I try to make a blog post, it'll end up being abandoned and unfinished, as I am unable to edit it into something readable and postable. so if I went 100% to blogs: You would get: no content I would get: lots of unfinished drafts and a feeling of being a useless waste</p> <p>but I can do rambly tweet threads. they don't require a lot of attention for a long time, they don't have the endless editing I get into with blog posts, I can do them. I do them a bunch! They're just rambly and twitter, which some people don't like</p> </blockquote> <p>The issue Foone is referring to isn't even uncommon — three of my favorite bloggers have mentioned that they can really only write things in one sitting, so either they have enough momentum to write an entire blog post or they don't. There's a difference in scale between only being able to get yourself to write a tweet at a time and only being able to write what you can fit into a single writing session, but these are differences in degree, not differences in kind.</p> <h3 id="revenue">Revenue</h3> <p>And whatever the reason someone has for finding [bad platform] lower friction than [good platform], allowing people to use a platform that works for them means we get more content. When it comes to video, the same thing also applies because <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1588318512258650112">video monetizes so much better than text</a> and there's a lot of content that monetizes well on video that probably wouldn't monetize well in text.</p> <p>To pick an arbitrary example, automotive content is one of these areas. For example, if you're buying a car and you want detailed, practical, reviews about a car as well as comparisons to other cars one might consider if they're looking at a particular car, before YouTube, AFAIK, no one was doing anything close to the depth of what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AAutoBuyersGuide">Alex Dykes does on Alex on Autos</a>. If you open up a car magazine from the heyday of car magazines, something like Card and Driver or Road and Track from 1997, there's nothing that goes into even 1/10th of the depth that Alex does and this is still true today of modern car magazines. The same goes for quite a few sub-categories of automotive content as well, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tyrereviews">Jonathan Benson's on Tyre Reviews</a>. Before Jonathan, no one was testing tires with the same breadth and depth and writing it up (engineers at tire companies did this kind of testing and much more, but you had to talk to them directly to get the info<sup id="fnref:V"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:V">2</a></sup> . You can find similar patterns in a lot of areas outside of automotive content as well. While this depends on the area, in many cases, the content wouldn't exist if it weren't for video. Not only do people, in general, have more willingness to watch videos than to read text, video monetizes much better than text does, which allows people to make providing in depth information their job in a way that wouldn't be possible in text. In some areas, you can make good money with a paywalled newsletter, but this is essentially what car magazines are and they were never able to support anything resembling what Alex Dykes does, nor does it seem plausible that you could support something like what Jonathan Benson does on substack.</p> <p>Or, to pick an example from the tech world, shortly after Lucy Wang created her YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechwithLucy">Tech With Lucy</a>, when she had 50k subscribers and her typical videos had thousands to tens of thousands views with the occasional video with a hundred thousand views, <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1589775359243091969">she noted that she was making more than she did working for AWS (with most of the money presumably coming in from sponsorships)</a>. By comparison, my blog posts all get well over a million hits and I definitely don't make anywhere near what Lucy made at AWS; instead, my blog barely covers my rent. It's possible to monetize some text decently well if you put most of it behind a paywall, e.g., <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/">Gergely Orosz does this with his newsletter</a>, but if you want to have mostly or exclusively have freely available content, video generally dominates text.</p> <h3 id="non-conclusion">Non-conclusion</h3> <p>While I would prefer that most content that I see on YouTube/Twitter/Threads/Mastodon/etc. were hosted on a text blog, the reality is that most of that content wouldn't exist at all if it had to be written up as long-form text instead of as chunked up short-form text or video. Maybe in a few years, summary tools will get good enough that I can consume the translations but, today, all the tools I've tried often get key details badly wrong, so we just have to live with the content in the form it's created in.</p> <pre>[If you're looking for work, Freshpaint is hiring a recruiter, Software Engineers, and a Support Engineer](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/freshpaint/bfe56523-bff4-4ca3-936b-0ba15fb4e572?utm_source=dl).

<p>The hackers who recently broke into Microsoft’s network and monitored top executives’ email for two months did so by gaining access to an aging test account with administrative privileges, a major gaffe on the company's part, a researcher said.</p>
<p>The new detail was provided in vaguely worded language included in a post Microsoft published on Thursday. It expanded on a disclosure Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/microsoft-network-breached-through-password-spraying-by-russian-state-hackers/">published late last Friday</a>. Russia-state hackers, Microsoft said, used a technique known as password spraying to exploit a weak credential for logging into a “legacy non-production test tenant account” that wasn’t protected by multifactor authentication. From there, they somehow acquired the ability to access email accounts that belonged to senior executives and employees working in security and legal teams.
</p><h2>A “pretty big config error”</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/01/25/midnight-blizzard-guidance-for-responders-on-nation-state-attack/">Thursday’s post</a> updating customers on findings from its ongoing investigation, Microsoft provided more details on how the hackers achieved this monumental escalation of access. The hackers, part of a group Microsoft tracks as Midnight Blizzard, gained persistent access to the privileged email accounts by abusing the OAuth authorization protcol, which is used industry-wide to allow an array of apps to access resources on a network. After compromising the test tenant, Midnight Blizzard used it to create a malicious app and assign it rights to access every email address on Microsoft’s Office 365 email service.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In Thursday’s update, Microsoft officials said as much, although in language that largely obscured the extent of the major blunder. They wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Threat actors like Midnight Blizzard compromise user accounts to create, modify, and grant high permissions to OAuth applications that they can misuse to hide malicious activity. The misuse of OAuth also enables threat actors to maintain access to applications, even if they lose access to the initially compromised account. Midnight Blizzard leveraged their initial access to identify and compromise a legacy test OAuth application that had elevated access to the Microsoft corporate environment. The actor created additional malicious OAuth applications. They created a new user account to grant consent in the Microsoft corporate environment to the actor controlled malicious OAuth applications. <b>The threat actor then used the legacy test OAuth application to grant them the Office 365 Exchange Online full_access_as_app role, which allows access to mailboxes.</b> [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin Beaumont—a researcher and security professional with decades of experience, including a stint working for Microsoft—<a href="https://cyberplace.social/@GossiTheDog/111823778988979816">pointed out on Mastodon</a> that the only way for an account to assign the all-powerful full_access_as_app role to an OAuth app is for the account to have administrator privileges. “Somebody,” he said, “made a pretty big config error in production.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it insider trading if I bought Boeing puts while I am inside the
wrecked airplane?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Insider information is information obtained from an "insider" such as an executive or director of the company, or perhaps someone subject to a non-disclosure agreement with the company. Engaging in stock trading based upon confidential information from an insider source, before it is publicly disclosed, is illegal in most cases. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1164964/000101968715004168/globalfuture_8k-ex9904.htm" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. From the first link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC Rule 10b-5 prohibits corporate officers and directors or other
insider employees from using confidential corporate information to
reap a profit (or avoid a loss) by trading in the Company’s stock.
This rule also prohibits “tipping” of confidential corporate
information to third parties.</p>
<p>· Who is an insider?</p>
<p>An “insider” is an officer, director, 10%
stockholder and anyone who possesses inside information because of his
or her relationship with the Company or with an officer, director or
principal stockholder of the Company. Rule 10b-5’s application goes
considerably beyond just officers, directors and principal
stockholders. This rule also covers any employee who has obtained
material non-public corporate information, as well as any person who
has received a “tip” from an Insider of the Company concerning
information about the Company that is material and nonpublic, and
trades (i.e. purchase or sells) the Company’s stock or other
securities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you are not personally an insider, and you are relying on your own personal knowledge, you are not relying on knowledge from an "insider", so you are not engaged in insider trading.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that Boeing is an aircraft manufacturer, not an airline. So, no one employed by the airline flying the plane would be an insider with respect to Boeing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is on a roll when it comes to having its hand forced by state entities and governing bodies: Alternative payment methods, stripping features from existing hardware,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/apples-app-store-now-permits-streaming-game-stores-adds-in-app-purchase-for-mini-apps-games-or-ai-chatbots/"> allowing alternate app stores</a> and genuine browser default competition — everywhere you turn it seems to be satisfying some reversal, owing either to trial judgments not going its way or to lawmakers regulating its preferred way of doing business out of existence.</p>
<p>Apple does not enjoy this, which should surprise exactly no one. What should be a tad more surprising is how willing Apple is to whine and mewl to its customers about how much it doesn’t like this, and about how it thinks this will be bad for them — the users, who Apple seems to consider its weak-willed wards in some regards.</p>
<p>“Across every change, Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce — but don’t eliminate — new risks the DMA poses to EU users,” is text taken from <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple’s own press release</a> announcing changes it’s making in iOS 17.4 that comply with the newly implemented Digital Markets Act in Europe. The release even includes, “For users, the changes include new controls and disclosures, and expanded protections to reduce privacy and security risks the DMA creates” directly as a second subhead in big, bold font.</p>
<p>Third-party app install vectors and things like sideloading, which is available on Android right now, indeed could pose additional risks for users who are uninformed and don’t take proper precautions or responsibility themselves to ensure they have good software hygiene and are installing reputable software from trustworthy sources. But Apple’s scaremongering is likely overstating the problem, since Android as mentioned has exposed users to this risk for quite a while now — and Mac and Windows devices have always done the same. Somehow, despite that, society remains intact and people are mostly okay with using those platforms with reasonable success.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Apple also announced that developers would be able to link out to the web to tell them about alternative subscription methods for content available as digital purchases in-app. There were multiple catches, however, including that how and where that link appear are tightly controlled, and Apple has to provide special permission to apps to allow them to even do this to begin with. Also, the real kicker is that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/17/apple-allows-devs-to-promote-subscriptions-on-the-web-with-a-27-cut/#:~:text=Image%20Credits%3A%20TechCrunch&amp;text=This%20followed%20the%20U.S.%20Supreme,a%2027%25%20cut%20to%20Apple."> Apple says anyone who makes a purchase through that link owes it a 27% cut</a>, and it throws up a scare sheet as the user is on their way out to follow your link as well.</p>
<p>It’s extremely understandable why Apple doesn’t want to make these changes; Apple’s control of the App Store, and its cut of purchases (typically 30%, with some exceptions) represents a significant chunk of its service revenue, which could have a material impact on earnings if eroded over time. What isn’t so understandable is just how petulant the company is being about prying open fingers on its tightly closed fist when it comes to compliance here.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are already looking to poke Apple’s monolithic business in various spots to see if it isn’t creeping into antitrust territory — or, as in Europe, already enacting laws to limit their control and power. Acting like a kicked puppy when it comes to actually putting these things into practice isn’t going to convince these regulators of Apple’s arguments that these kinds of measures aren’t needed and are in fact user hostile.</p>
<p>At best, it seems short-sighted: Yes, doing so will mean Apple’s revenue picture doesn’t materially change in the near-term. But it also means it looks like a company supremely unwilling to work with the spirit of lawmaker efforts to increase competition and reduce the influence that multi-trillion-dollar companies like Apple have on the world overall. And developers are increasingly irate at Apple’s antics. Those ill feelings likely won’t mean much for platforms like iOS, which have unparalleled install bases and therefore are unavoidable if you’re building a mobile consumer software business, but they will mean a lot for any future efforts to get emerging platforms off the ground — like the Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>It also means that Apple could be more susceptible to competitors among its core businesses; it may seem impossible at this point that iOS could ever lose its power position in the mobile market, but stranger things have happened, and developers feeling spurned and insulted enough will be more likely to wan too help replicate the iPhone lightning strike for someone else if things get bad enough.</p>

In this video I explain what climate sensitivity is and why it is important. Climate sensitivity is a number that roughly speaking tells us how fast climate change will get worse. A few years ago, after various software improvements, a bunch of climate models began having a much higher climate sensitivity than previously. Climate scientists have come up with reasons for why to ignore this. I think it's a bad idea to ignore this. </p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4S9sDyooxf4?si=1x1Rb2YCVfjtSw5q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

That's below a peak of 47% during the pandemic but well above its prior average of around 3%.</em></p><p><em><strong>"The battle is over,</strong><span>" said Diana Scott, human capital center leader at The Conference Board. "There are so many other issues CEOs are facing.”</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Now that remote has been normalized for some time it was cool to also see some </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401" rel="">new research</a><span> on public firms and distributed work just published December, 2023. The full paper is worth reading, but the summary is what you would expect if you’re paying attention and viewing this issue objectively (emphasis mine).</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Using a sample of Standard and Poor’s 500 firms, we examine determinants and consequences of U.S. firms’ return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Results of our determinant analyses are consistent with managers using RTO mandates to reassert control over employees and blame employees as a scapegoat for bad firm performance. </em></p><p><em><span>…our findings do not support the argument that managers impose mandates because they believe RTO increases firm values. Further, </span><strong>our difference in differences tests report significant declines in employees’ job satisfactions mandates but no significant changes in financial performance or firm values after RTO mandates.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>So basically, TL;DR: you will make your employees hate their lives, make less money and be less efficient by electing to assert authoritarian control over their movements and do the same work in a different arbitrary building every day. And I am not being hyperbolic here, I have heard stories from friends in legacy sectors whose teams have started location-tracking employees during the day. It’s straight out of a dystopian panopticon science fiction novel.

Sane people will continue to point out the absurdity and hypocrisy. And for investors, employees or even just customers: remember any company doing “RTO” is a giant red flag they don't know what they're doing, are lying to the market, or hate their own employees. It’s really just layoffs by another name, because they can’t simply be honest.</p><p>In summary: remote work won, don’t let anyone gaslight you to believe otherwise.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

      <p>The vast scale of methane leaks from fossil fuel production and landfill sites has been exposed by analysis carried out exclusively for Sky News.</p><p>Around 1,300 "super-emitters" of the potent greenhouse gas have been identified so far in 2023 by the monitoring company Kayrros, which uses satellites to detect plumes of the gas.</p>
<p>It looks for non-natural sources of methane - primarily gas wells, pipelines, coal mines and landfill sites.</p><p>According to the data, the largest oil and gas source was on the Cheleken Peninsula in Turkmenistan, where a leak from one facility is estimated to have peaked at 333 tonnes per hour in August.</p><p>At that rate the hourly release of methane was equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from a car driving around 38,000 miles.</p>
<p>Another leak, from a blown-out drilling well in Kazakhstan, released between 21 and 56 tonnes of the methane every hour for 153 days between June and November.</p><p>Coal is also a problem with one facility in Shanxi, China, peaking at around 181 tonnes an hour last February.</p><p>And the methane release from buried waste at a landfill site in Dhaka city in Bangladesh peaked at 822 tonnes an hour in April.</p><p>Antoine Rostand, co-founder of Kayrros, told Sky News being able to observe emissions from space means there is no hiding.</p>        
<p>"Previously we could measure the amount of methane in the atmosphere, but now we really know exactly where it's coming from," he said.</p><p>"Which country, which company, which assets are emitting methane in the atmosphere."</p><p>Kayrros's data shows Turkmenistan had higher methane emissions than any other nation, followed by the United States, India, Russia and Pakistan.</p><p>Methane is the natural gas burned by boilers and other appliances in people's homes.</p><p>But if it is released without being burned, often during maintenance on pipelines, it acts as a heat "bomb" in the atmosphere.</p><p>The gas causes 80 times more global warming as the same amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.</p> <div aria-label="Consent required" data-component-name="sdc-article-custom-markup" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" data-consent="pending" data-vendor-name="spreaker">

Because it only persists in the atmosphere for around a decade rather than several centuries, as in the case of carbon dioxide, turning off the tap on emissions would have a rapid impact.</p><p>The United States has announced new rules for fossil fuel companies requiring them to monitor and fix leaks, which should reduce methane emissions by 58 million tonnes between 2024 and 2038.</p><p>Mr Rostand said the rules are overdue.</p><p>"The have the technology, they have the money, they know exactly what to do," he said.</p><p>"They're almost lacking any kind of overall regulation.</p><p>"A lot of players are doing a bit but some are not. And this is where regulation plays, because then it will put every single producer on an equal footing."</p>     <a href="https://news.sky.com/download-app" target="blank" data-tracking-label="ui-app-promo-download-link" data-type="" data-component-name="ui-app-promo">

It's the elephant in the room, the low hanging fruit."</p>
