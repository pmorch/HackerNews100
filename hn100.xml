                                        <p>BUTLER, Pa. (AP) — <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></span> was the target of an apparent assassination attempt Saturday at a Pennsylvania rally and said afterward that he was shot in the ear. The barrage of gunfire set off panic among thousands of attendees and a dramatic scene in which a bloodied Trump was surrounded by Secret Service and then escorted to his SUV as he pumped his first in a show of defiance. </p><p>Trump’s campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing “fine” after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p><p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place,” he wrote on his social media site.</p><p>Rallygoers screamed in panic. Shouts of “Get down!” rang through the crowd. At least one attendee was dead and two spectators were critically injured, authorities said. The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter — who it said attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue, a farm show in Butler, Pennsylvania — and that Trump was safe.</p><p>The attack was the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It came in a deeply polarized political atmosphere, just four months from the presidential elections and days before Trump is to be officially named the Republican nominee at <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/republican-national-convention">his party’s convention</a></span> — which his campaign said would proceed as planned. </p>
    


<p>“There’s no place in America for this type of violence,” President Joe Biden, who is running against Trump as the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in remarks. “It’s sick. It’s sick.”</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            </div><p>Two officials spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. They said the shooter was not an attendee at the rally and was killed by U.S. Secret Service agents. </p><p>The officials said the shooter was engaged by members of the U.S. Secret Service counterassault team. The heavily armed tactical team travels everywhere with the president and major party nominees and is meant to confront any active threats while other agents focus on safeguarding and evacuating the person at the center of protection.</p><p>Law enforcement recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene, according to a third person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.</p><p>Many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.”</p><p>There was no immediate information on the shooter or their motivations.</p>
    

    

    

<h2>A rally disrupted by gunfire</h2><p>Trump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the apparent shots began just after 6:10 p.m. It took two minutes from the moment of the first shot for Trump to be placed in a waiting SUV.</p><p>As Trump was talking, a popping sound was heard, and the former president put his right hand up to his right ear, as people in the stands behind him appeared to be shocked.</p>



<p>As the first pop rang out, Trump said, “Oh,” and grabbed his ear as two more pops could be heard and he crouched down. More shots were heard then.</p><p>Someone could be heard saying near the microphone at Trump’s lectern, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents tackled the former president. They piled atop him to shield him with their bodies, as is their training protocol, as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat.</p><div data-align-center="">

Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle. </p><h2>Witnesses heard multiple gunshots and ducked for cover</h2><p>“Everybody went to their knees or their prone position, because we all knew, everyone becoming aware of the fact this was gunfire,” said Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, who was sitting to Trump’s right on stage. </p><p>As he saw Trump raise his fist, McCormick said, he looked over his shoulder and noticed someone had been hit while sitting in the bleachers behind the stage. </p><p>Eventually, first responders were able to carry the injured person out of a large crowd so he could get medical care, McCormick said. </p><p>Reporters covering the rally heard five or six shots ring out and many ducked for cover, hiding under tables. After the first two or three bangs, people in the crowd looked startled, but not panicked. An AP reporter at the scene reported the noise sounded like firecrackers at first or perhaps a car backfiring.</p><p>When it was clear the situation had been contained and that Trump would not be returning to speak, attendees started filing out of the venue. One man in an electric wheelchair got stuck on the field when his chair’s battery died. Others tried to help him move.</p><div data-override-title="true" data-hide-title="false" data-align-center="" data-carousel-enhancement="">

        </div><p>Police soon told the people remaining to leave the venue and Secret Service agents told reporters to get “out now. This is a live crime scene.”</p><p>Two firefighters from nearby Steubenville, Ohio, who were at the rally told the AP that they helped people who appeared injured and heard bullets hitting broadcast speakers.</p><p>“The bullets rattled around the grandstand, one hit the speaker tower and then chaos broke. We hit the ground and then the police converged into the grandstands, said Chris Takach.</p><p>“The first thing I heard is a couple of cracks,” Dave Sullivan said.</p><p>Sullivan said he saw one of the speakers get hit and bullets rattling and, “we hit the deck.”</p><p>He said once Secret Service and other authorities converged on Trump, he and Takach assisted two people who may have been shot in the grandstand and cleared a path to get them out of the way.</p><p>“Just a sad day for America,” Sullivan said.</p><p>“After we heard the shots got fired, then the hydraulic line was spraying all around, you could see the hydraulic fluid coming out of it. And then the speaker tower started to fall down,” Sullivan said. “Then we heard another shot that, you could hear, you knew something was, it was bullets. It wasn’t firecrackers.”</p><h2>Political violence again shakes America</h2><p>The perils of campaigning took on a new urgency after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in California in 1968, and again in 1972 when Arthur Bremer shot and seriously hurt George Wallace, who was running as an independent on a campaign platform that has sometimes been compared to Trump’s. That led to increased protection of candidates, even as the threats persisted, notably against Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008.</p><p>Presidents, particularly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, have even greater layers of security. Trump is a rarity as both a former president and a current candidate.</p><p>Biden was briefed on the incident, the White House said. He received an updated briefing from Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall.</p><p>He told reporters after 8 p.m. that he hadn’t been able to reach Trump yet but was briefed that the former president was “doing well.”</p><p>“I hope I get to speak to him tonight,” he said. </p><p>Mayorkas, whose department oversees the Secret Service, said officials were engaged with the Biden and Trump campaigns and “taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.”</p><p>Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., posted a photo on X of Trump, his fist raised and his face bloody in front of an American flag, with the words: “He’ll never stop fighting to Save America.”</p><p>North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the three men on Trump’s shortlist for vice president, all quickly sent out statements expressing concern for the former president, with Rubio sharing an image taken as Trump was escorted off stage with his fist in the air and a streak of blood on his face along with the words “God protected President Trump.”</p><p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said in a statement on X that he had been briefed on the situation and Pennsylvania state police were on hand at the rally site.</p><p>“Violence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable. It has no place in Pennsylvania or the United States,” he said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Colvin, Balsamo and Price reported from New York. Long reported from Washington.

<p>The incident unfolded as Trump was giving a speech at the rally in Pennsylvania. Suddenly, he appeared to fall to the ground clutching his ear.</p><p>He was quickly surrounded by armed security and stayed down for around a minute. Screams from the audience rang out as the scene unfolded.</p><p>Trump then rose to his feet, pumped his fist in the air, and shouted "fight", before being whisked off stage and into a vehicle.</p><p>He was quickly driven away from the scene. Video appeared to show blood coming from his ear as he left the stage.</p><p>The US Secret Service said Trump was now "safe" and that it had implemented protective measures around him.</p>     <div data-component-name="sdc-article-strapline">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’m an AWS Serverless Hero, principal engineer at an AWS centric logistics company, and I build and maintain <a href="https://aws-news.com/" rel="nofollow">https://aws-news.com</a>. It’s fair to say that I am very interested in everything AWS does. But I fear AWS is no longer interested in what I do.</p>



<p>This post is about AWS’ obsession with Generative AI (GenAI) and how it pushes away everything that makes AWS, well, AWS. Of course it started with OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT, on November 30, 2022. Coincidentally, this date fell exactly in the middle of Re:Invent – Amazon’s yearly developer conference in Vegas. I was there and it was great. Werner Vogels had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfvL_423a-I">keynote</a> about event driven architectures and there were many sessions in areas like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/top-analytics-announcements-of-aws-reinvent-2022/">analytics</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-relational-database-reinvent-2022-recap/">relational databases</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/reinvent-2022-devops-and-developer-productivity-playlist/">devops</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/three-key-security-themes-from-aws-reinvent-2022/">security</a>, and very importantly, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/architecting-for-sustainability-at-aws-reinvent-2022/">sustainability</a>.</p>



<p>Fast forward one year, and the world couldn’t look more different. GenAI dominated Re:Invent 2023. Every topic was either about the infrastructure for GenAI, the integrations with GenAI, the data for GenAI, and how GenAI would make everything better, from customer interactions to content creation, from refactoring to operations. It was weird, but I dismissed it as peak hype cycle. And to be honest I too was pretty excited about all the opportunities GenAI would bring.</p>



<p>Then 2024 came around, and somehow AWS’ focus on GenAI took on hysterical proportions. It started with the global AWS summits, where at least 80% of the talks was about GenAI. Then there was AWS re:Inforce – the annual security conference – which was themed “Security in the era of generative AI”.</p>

<p>After re:Inforce came the flagship NYC summit. Corey Quinn wrote a great piece about the conference titled <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/amazon-genai-services/">Amazon GenAI Services</a>. A quote from his post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>However, the badge lanyards were GenAI branded, the keynote opening slide simply said “Generative AI,” and every single offering discussed during the ~98 minute keynote was centered around Generative AI. Nearly every expo hall booth was dripping with GenAI; Elastic even went so far as to rebrand itself as “The Search AI company.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I wasn’t at the NYC summit so I can’t speak for the in-person experience. But I did monitor the releases they announced during the event. I summarized my thoughts in this <a href="https://x.com/donkersgood/status/1811153913632149660">tweet</a>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="908" data-permalink="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/2024/07/13/dear-aws-please-let-me-be-a-cloud-engineer-again/image-17/" data-orig-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png" data-orig-size="1224,420" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=1024" tabindex="0" role="button" width="1024" height="351" src="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>And this is the crux: AWS is now focused so strongly on GenAI that they seem not to care about anything else anymore – including everything that made developers love them and made them the leading cloud provider on almost every metric.</p>



<h2>You need a business to benefit from GenAI</h2>



<p>Now don’t get me wrong. I like GenAI. I use it extensively at work and for the AWS News Feed. I use ChatGPT to shape new ideas, Copilot to speed up development, and Claude to generate summaries. The point is that all these features add to an existing business. This business has customers, data, business rules, revenue, products, marketing, and all the other things that make a business tick. And most businesses had these things before 2022. GenAI allows us to add new features, and often faster than before. <em>But GenAI has no value without an existing product to apply it to</em>.</p>



<p>And this is where my work, my interests, and my passions come in. I like building products. I like designing scalable infrastructure. I like developing maintainable applications. And I love AWS for the tools they provide me to do this.</p>



<h2>The implicit message</h2>



<p>But AWS and I are growing apart. I feel the things I value are no longer the things they value. By only talking about GenAI, they implicitly tell me databases are not important. Scalable infrastructure is not important. Maintainable applications are not important. Only GenAI is.</p>



<p>The same goes for feature releases. If the vast bulk of all new feature releases are geared towards GenAI, it implicitly means AWS is rerouting investments from classic infrastructure to shiny GenAI. It means that the products I love get smaller budgets. It means that the products I use will not get the next feature I want, or only at a slower pace.</p>



<p>In summary, AWS’ implicit messaging tells developers they should no longer focus on core infrastructure, and spend their time on GenAI instead. I believe this is wrong. Because GenAI can only exist if there is a business to serve. Many, if not almost all of us developers got into AWS because we want to build and support these businesses. We’re not here to be gaslighted into the “GenAI will solve every problem” future. We know it won’t.</p>



<h2>A better way</h2>



<p>I’m not saying there is no value in GenAI. I’m not even saying AWS shouldn’t be building GenAI products. What I’m saying is that AWS is not a <em>GenAI only</em> company and shouldn’t pretend to be. $22.8 billion of <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx">AWS operating income</a> in 2022 and $24.6 billion in 2023 is a hell of a user base to ignore. It is also a financial foundation that should allow them to focus on more than one thing.</p>



<p>I would love to see AWS un-ignore its roots. Show us you still value the businesses and products you supported in the past. Help developers build better applications by listening to them and solving their pain points. Educate them on the fundamentals of infrastructure: performance, reliability, cost efficiency, security, operational excellence, and sustainability.</p>



<p>Your first <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles">leadership principle</a> is customer obsession: “Leaders start with the customer and work backwards”. </p>



<p>I’m your customer, and I’m begging you: please let me be a cloud engineer again.</p>

<p>Hacktivist group NullBulge claims to have breached Disney, leaking 1.1 TiB of internal Slack data. The leak allegedly includes messages, files, code, and more. This comes amidst breaches affecting AT&amp;T and Ticketmaster.</p>


<p>A self-proclaimed hacktivist group named NullBulge, aiming to “protect artists’ rights and ensure fair compensation for their work,” claims to have breached Disney and leaked 1.1 TiB (1.2 TB) of the company’s internal Slack infrastructure. These claims were posted on the notorious cybercrime and hacker platform <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/breach-forums-return-clearnet-dark-web-fbi-seizure/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="117113" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breach Forums</a></strong> on July 12, 2024.</p>



<p>The breach, which is yet to be verified, allegedly contains a complete copy of the company’s Slack communications used by their development team including messages, files, and other data exchanged within the Slack workspace.</p>



<p>The hackers further claim the dump includes “almost 10,000 channels, every message and file possible, unreleased projects, raw images, code, logins, links to internal API/web pages, and more!”</p>

<p>NullBulge also used X (formerly Twitter) to <strong><a href="https://x.com/NullBulgeGroup/status/1811656487514546466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announce</a> </strong>the alleged hack, stating, “Disney has had their entire dev Slack dumped. 1.1 TiB of files and chat messages.

<p>The origins of the NullBulge Group are unknown.

<p>As for Disney, in recent years, the company has faced criticism and legal issues regarding the payment of fair shares to artists and writers. Prominent figures like Neil Gaiman have <strong><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/623157/neil-gaiman-calls-out-disney-for-failing-to-pay-royalties-to-writers-and-artists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighted</a> </strong>that Disney has stopped paying royalties to some writers and artists for works that include novelizations and graphic novels of Disney-owned properties. This issue affected various creators who worked on popular franchises such as “Star Wars” and “Alien.</p>



<p>The problem came into the spotlight when author Alan Dean Foster publicly stated that he had not received royalties for his “Star Wars” and “Alien” novels after Disney acquired the respective franchises. </p>



<p>Despite some high-profile settlements, many writers and artists <a href="https://wdwnt.com/2022/05/writers-and-artists-still-fighting-to-receive-overdue-royalties-from-disney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>continue to struggle</strong></a> to get their due payments. Organizations like the Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) have been actively campaigning for these creators, forming task forces to pressure Disney into fulfilling its financial obligations​.</p>



<p>Hackread.com has reached out to Disney for comment. Meanwhile, VX-Underground, an online malware repository, <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1811783405127749647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>tweeted</strong></a> that if proven legitimate, the hack could be the work of infostealer malware. </p>


<p>Nevertheless, the alleged data breach is just another in a series affecting companies based in the United States. On July 12, 2024, <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/att-data-breach-hackers-steal-call-text-records/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AT&amp;T announced</a> </strong>that hackers had stolen call records and text message logs of “nearly all” customers, impacting over 110 million Americans.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-permalink-context="/2024/Jul/13/give-people-something-to-link-to/">

<p>13th July 2024</p>

<p>If you have a project, an idea, a product feature, or anything else that you want other people to understand and have conversations about... give them something to link to!</p>
<p>Two illustrative examples are ChatGPT Code Interpreter and Boring Technology.</p>
<h4 id="chatgpt-code-interpreter-is-effectively-invisible">ChatGPT Code Interpreter is effectively invisible</h4>
<p><strong>ChatGPT Code Interpreter</strong> has been one of my favourite AI tools for over a year. It’s the feature of ChatGPT which allows the bot to write <em>and then execute</em> Python code as part of responding to your prompts. It’s incredibly powerful... and almost invisible! If you don’t know how to use prompts to activate the feature you may not realize it exists.</p>
<p>OpenAI don’t even have a help page for it (and it very desperately needs documentation)—if you search their site you’ll find <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/code-interpreter">confusing technical docs</a> about an API feature and <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/how-can-i-access-the-code-interpreter-plugin-model/205304">misleading outdated forum threads</a>.</p>
<p>I evangelize this tool <em>a lot</em>, but OpenAI really aren’t helping me do that. I end up linking people to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">my code-interpreter tag page</a> because it’s more useful than anything on OpenAI’s own site.</p>
<p>Compare this with Claude’s similar Artifacts feature which at least has an <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them">easily discovered help page</a>—though <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">the Artifacts announcement post</a> was shared with Claude 3.5 Sonnet so isn’t obviously linkable. Even that help page isn’t quite what I’m after. Features deserve dedicated pages!</p>
<p>GitHub understand this: here are their feature landing pages for <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Codespaces</a> and <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">Copilot</a> (I could even guess the URL for Copilot’s page based on the Codespaces one).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It turns out there IS documentation about Code Interpreter mode... but I failed to find it because it didn’t use those terms anywhere on the page! The title is <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8437071-data-analysis-with-chatgpt">Data analysis with ChatGPT</a>.</p>

<p>This amuses me greatly because OpenAI have been oscillating on the name for this feature almost since they launched—Code Interpreter, then Advanced Data Analysis, now Data analysis with ChatGPT. I made fun of this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/17/open-questions/#open-questions.034.jpeg">last year</a>.</p>

<h4 id="boring-technology-an-idea-with-a-website">Boring Technology: an idea with a website</h4>
<p>Dan McKinley coined the term <strong>Boring Technology</strong> in <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">an essay in 2015</a>. The key idea is that any development team has a limited capacity to solve new problems which should be reserved for the things that make their product unique. For everything else they should pick the most boring and well-understood technologies available to them—stuff where any bugs or limitations have been understood and discussed online for years.</p>
<p>(I’m very proud that Django has earned the honorific of “boring technology” in this context!)</p>
<p>Dan turned that essay into a talk, and then he turned that talk into a website with a brilliant domain name:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boringtechnology.club</a></strong></p>
<p>The idea has stuck. I’ve had many productive conversations about it, and more importantly if someone <em>hasn’t</em> heard the term before I can drop in that one link and they’ll be up to speed a few minutes later.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to do this myself for some of my own ideas: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/">baked data</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">git scraping</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/">prompt injection</a> all have pages that I frequently link people to. I never went as far as committing to a domain though and I think maybe that was a mistake—having a clear message that “this is the key page to link to” is a very powerful thing.</p>
<h4 id="this-is-about-both-seo-and-conversations">This is about both SEO and conversations</h4>
<p>One obvious goal here is SEO: if someone searches for your product feature you want them to land on your own site, not surrender valuable attention to someone else who’s squatting on the search term.</p>
<p>I personally value the conversation side of it even more. Hyperlinks are the best thing about the web—if I want to talk about something I’d much rather drop in a link to the definitive explanation rather than waste a paragraph (as I did earlier with Code Interpreter) explaining what the thing is for the upmteenth time!</p>
<p>If you have an idea, project or feature that you want people to understand and discuss, build it the web page it deserves. <strong>Give people something to link to!</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <h3 id="who-should-read-this">Who should read this</h3> <p>Do you want to understand exactly how AlphaFold3 works? The architecture is quite complicated and the description in the paper can be overwhelming, so we made a much more friendly (but just as detailed!) visual walkthrough.</p> <p>This is mostly written for an ML audience and multiple points assume familiarity with the steps of attention. If you’re rusty, see Jay Alammar’s <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Illustrated Transformer</a> for a thorough visual explanation. That post is one of the best explanations of a model architecture at the level of individual matrix operations and also the inspiration for the diagrams and naming.</p> <p>There are already many great explanations of the motivation for protein structure prediction, the CASP competition, model failure modes, debates about evaluations, implications for biotech, etc. so we don’t focus on any of that. Instead we explore the <em>how</em>.</p> <p><em>How are these molecules represented in the model and what are all of the operations that convert them into a predicted structure?</em></p> <p>This is probably more exhaustive than most people are looking for, but if you want to understand all the details and you like learning via diagrams, this should help :)</p> <h3 id="architecture-overview">Architecture Overview</h3> <p>We’ll start by pointing out that goals of the model are a bit different than previous AlphaFold models: instead of just predicting the structure of individual protein sequences (AF2) or protein complexes (AF-multimeter), it predicts the structure of a protein, optionally complexed with other proteins, nucleic acids, or small molecules, all from sequence alone. So while previous AF models only had to represent sequences of standard amino acids, AF3 has to represent more complex input types, and thus there is a more complex featurization/tokenization scheme. Tokenization is described in its own section, but for now just know that when we say “token” it either represents a single amino acid (for proteins), nucleotide (for DNA/RNA), or an individual atom if that atom is not part of a standard amino acid/nucleotide.</p> <div> <p><b>Interactive Table of Contents</b></p> <figure> <div> <p><img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/full_arch_for_labeling.png" alt="Full Architecture" usemap="#image-map"></p>              </div> <map name="image-map"> <area shape="rect" alt="Tokenization" title="Tokenization" coords="0.58,50.38,8.35,74.06" href="#tokenization" data-target="overlay-1"> <area shape="rect" alt="Retrieval" title="Retrieval" coords="8.35,3.26,22.16,40.98" href="#retrieval-create-msa-and-templates" data-target="overlay-2"> <area shape="rect" alt="Create atom-level representations" title="Create atom-level representations" coords="8.35,41.48,22.16,68.92" href="#create-atom-level-representations" data-target="overlay-3"> <area shape="rect" alt="Atom Transformer" title="Atom Transformer" coords="22.23,23.43,28.16,69.80" href="#update-atom-level-representations-atom-transformer" data-target="overlay-4"> <area shape="rect" alt="Atom-Level to Token-Level" title="Atom-Level to Token-Level" coords="28.16,40.23,31.89,69.80" href="#aggregate-atom-level--token-level" data-target="overlay-5"> <area shape="rect" alt="Template module" title="Template module" coords="34.56,34.59,40.56,56.02" href="#template-module" data-target="overlay-6"> <area shape="rect" alt="MSA module" title="MSA module" coords="42.15,34.21,48.16,56.02" href="#msa-module" data-target="overlay-7"> <area shape="rect" alt="Pairformer" title="Pairformer" coords="49.67,34.21,63.52,69.80" href="#pairformer-module" data-target="overlay-8"> <area shape="rect" alt="Diffusion module" title="Diffusion module" coords="68.37,41.48,90.20,70.18" href="#diffusion-module" data-target="overlay-9"> <area shape="rect" alt="Confidence and Loss" title="Confidence and loss" coords="90.96,20.05,99.71,47.37" href="#4-loss-function-and-other-training-details" data-target="overlay-10"> <area shape="rect" alt="Other training details" title="Other training details" coords="90.96,47.37,99.71,66.17" href="#other-training-details" data-target="overlay-11"> <area shape="rect" alt="Input preparation" title="Input preparation" coords="8.35,87.84,23.46,97.74" href="#1-input-preparation" data-target="overlay-12"> <area shape="rect" alt="Representation learning" title="Representation learning" coords="38.76,87.84,58.97,97.49" href="#2-representation-learning" data-target="overlay-13"> <area shape="rect" alt="Structure prediction" title="Structure prediction" coords="71.69,88.22,89.37,96.74" href="#3-structure-prediction" data-target="overlay-14"> </map> </figure>   <p>Full architecture.

We find similar sequences to our protein and RNA sequences of interest (collected into a multiple sequence alignment, “MSA”), and any structures related to those (called the “templates”), then include them as additional inputs to the model called <strong><span>m</span></strong> and <strong><span>t</span></strong>, respectively.</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/MSA_and_templates-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/MSA_and_templates-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/MSA_and_templates-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/MSA_and_templates.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>(Image from AF2)</p> </div> <details> <summary>Why do we want to include MSA and templates?</summary> <p> Versions of the same protein found in different species can be quite structurally and sequentially similar. By aligning these together into a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), we can look at how an individual position in a protein sequence has changed throughout evolution. You can think about an MSA for a given protein as a matrix where each row is the sequence of the analogous protein from a different species. It has been shown that the conservation patterns found along the column of a specific position in the protein can reflect how critical it is for that position to have certain amino acids present, and the relationships between different columns reflect relationships between amino acids (i.e. if two amino acids are physically interacting, the changes in their amino acids will likely be correlated across evolution). Thus, MSAs are often used to enrich representations of single proteins.</p> <p> Similarly, if any of these proteins have known structures, those are also likely to inform the structure of this protein. Instead of searching for full structures, only individual chains of the proteins are used. This resembles the practice of homology modeling, in which the structure of a query protein is modeled based on templates from known protein structures that are presumed to be similar. </p> </details> <details> <summary>So how are these sequences and structures retrieved?</summary> First, a genetic search is done searching for any protein or RNA chains that resemble any input protein or RNA chains. This does not involve any training and relies upon existing Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based methods<d-footnote>Specifically, they use jackhmmer, HHBlits, and nhmmer</d-footnote> to scan multiple protein databases and RNA databases for relevant hits. Then these sequences are aligned to each other to construct an MSA with N<sub>MSA</sub> sequences. As the computational complexity of the model scales with N<sub>MSA</sub> they limit this to N<sub>MSA</sub> &lt; 2<sup>14</sup>. Typically, MSAs are constructed from individual protein chains but, as described in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.463034v2.full.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AF-multimer</a>, instead of just concatenating the separate MSAs together into a block diagonal matrix, certain chains from the same species can be 'paired' as described <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/240754v3.full.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. This way, the MSA does not have to be as large and sparse, and evolutionary information can be learned about relationships between chains. <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/multi_chain_MSA-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/multi_chain_MSA-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/multi_chain_MSA-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/multi_chain_MSA.png" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> Then, for each protein chain, they use another HMM-based method (hmmsearch) to find sequences in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) that resemble the constructed MSA. The highest quality structures are selected and up to 4 of these are sampled to be included as "templates". </details> <p>The only new part of these retrieval steps compared to AF-multimer is the fact that we now do this retrieval for RNA sequences in addition to protein sequences. Note that this is not traditionally called “retrieval” as the practice of using structural templates to guide protein structure modeling has been common practice in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_modeling" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">homology modeling</a> long before the term RAG existed. However, even though AlphaFold doesn’t explicitly refer to this process as retrieval, it does quite resemble what has now been popularized as RAG.</p> <p><strong>How do we represent these templates?</strong></p> <p>From our template search, we have a 3D structure for each of our templates and information about which tokens are in which chains. First, the euclidean distances between all pairs of tokens in a given template are calculated. For tokens associated with multiple atoms, a representative <span>“center atom”</span> is used to calculate distances. This would be the <span>C<sub>ɑ</sub></span> atom for amino acids and <span>C<sup>1</sup>’</span> atom for standard nucleotides.</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/center_atoms-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/center_atoms-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/center_atoms-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/center_atoms.png" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Highlighting <span>"center atoms"</span> in single-token building blocks</p> </div> <p>This generates a N<sub>token</sub> x N<sub>token</sub> matrix for each template.

The first step is to calculate a “reference conformer” for each amino acid, nucleotide, and ligand. While we do not yet know the structure of the entire complex, we have strong priors on the local structures of each individual component. A conformer (short for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/conformational-isomer#:~:text=Conformations%20or%20conformational%20isomers%20have,the%20same%20configuration%2C%20if%20chiral." rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">conformational isomer</a>) is a 3D arrangement of atoms in a molecule that is generated by sampling rotations about single bonds. Each amino acid has a “standard” conformer which is just one of the low-energy conformations this amino acid can exist in, which can be retrieved through a look-up. However, each small molecule requires its own conformation generation. These are generated with <a href="https://rdkit.org/docs/RDKit_Book.html#conformer-generation" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RDKit’s ETKDGv3</a>, an algorithm that combines experimental data and torsion angle preferences to produce 3D conformers.</p> <p>Then we concatenate the information from this conformer (relative location) with each atom’s charge, atomic number, and other identifiers.

Anytime AF3 applies attention at the atom-level, we use a module called the Atom Transformer. The atom transformer is a series of blocks that use attention to update <strong><span>q</span></strong> using both <strong><span>p</span></strong> and the original representation of <strong><span>q</span></strong> called <strong><span>c</span></strong>. As <strong><span>c</span></strong> does not get updated by the Attention Transformer, it can be thought of as a residual connection to the starting representation.</p> <p>The Atom Transformer mostly follows a standard transformer structure using layer norm, attention, then an MLP transition. However, each step has been adapted to include additional input from <strong><span>c</span></strong> and <strong><span>p</span></strong> (including a secondary input here is sometimes referred to as “conditioning”.) There is also a ‘gating’ step between the attention and MLP blocks. Going through each of these 4 steps in more detail:</p> <h3 id="1-adaptive-layernorm">1. Adaptive LayerNorm</h3>  <p>Adaptive LayerNorm (AdaNorm) is a variant of LayerNorm with one simple extension. Recall that for a given input matrix, traditional LayerNorm learns two parameters (a scaling factor gamma and a bias factor beta) that adjust the mean and standard deviation of each of the channels in our matrix. Instead of learning fixed parameters for gamma and beta, AdaNorm learns a function to generate gamma and beta adaptively based on the input matrix. However, instead of generating the parameters based on the input getting re-scaled (in the Atom Transformer this is <strong><span>q</span></strong>), a secondary input (<strong><span>c</span></strong> in the Atom Transformer) is used to predict the gamma and beta that re-scale the mean and standard deviation of <strong><span>q</span></strong>.</p> <h3 id="2-attention-with-pair-bias">2.

Like in self-attention, the queries, keys, and values all come from the same 1D sequence (our single representation, <strong><span>q</span></strong>). However, there are 3 differences:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Pair-biasing</strong>: after the dot product of the queries and keys are calculated, a linear projection of the pair representation is added as a bias to scale the attention weights. Note that this operation does not involve any information from <strong><span>q</span></strong> being used to update <strong><span>p</span></strong>, just one way flow from the pair representation to <strong><span>q</span></strong>. The reasoning for this is that atoms that have a stronger pairwise relationship should attend to each other more strongly and <strong><span>p</span></strong> is effectively already encoding an attention map.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Gating</strong>: In addition to the queries, keys, and values, we create an additional projection of <strong><span>q</span></strong> that is passed through a sigmoid, to squash the values between 0 and 1. Our output is multiplied by this “gate” right before all the heads are re-combined. This effectively forces the model to ignore some of what it learned in this attention process. This type of gating appears frequently in AF3 and is discussed more in the ML-musings section. To briefly elaborate, because the model is constantly adding the outputs of each section to the residual stream, this gating mechanism can be thought of as the model’s way to specify what information does or does not get saved in this residual stream. It is presumably named a “gate” after the similar “gates” in LSTM which uses a sigmoid to learn a filter for what inputs get added to the running cell state.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sparse attention</strong>:</p> </li> </ol> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> Because the number of atoms can be much larger than the number of tokens, we do not run full attention at this step, rather, we use a type of sparse attention (called Sequence-local atom attention) in which the attention is effectively run in local groups where groups of 32 atoms at a time can all attend to 128 other atoms.

To create these token-level representations, we first project our atom-level representation to a larger dimension (c<sub>atom</sub>=128, c<sub>token</sub>=384). Then, we take the mean over all atoms assigned to the same token. Note that this only applies to the atoms associated with standard amino acids and nucleotides (by taking the mean across all atoms attached to the same token), while the rest remain unchanged<d-footnote>The AF3 paper describes these molecule types as having a representative atom per token (the center atom). Recall that this is the C<sub>α</sub> atom for amino acids and C<sup>1</sup>' atom for standard nucleotides.

So, entry <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong> of our pair representation is a c<sub>z</sub> dimensional vector meant to store information about the relationship between token i and token j in our token sequence.

Instead, only the updated pair representation (<strong><span>z</span></strong>) and single representation (<strong><span>s</span></strong>) enter the Pairformer and are used to update each other. As the transition blocks have already been described, this section focuses on the Triangle Updates and Triangle Attention, then briefly explains how the Single Attention with Pair Bias differs from the variant described earlier. These triangle-based layers were first introduced in AF2 are one of the pieces that not only remained in AF3, but now are even more present in the architecture, so they get quite a bit of attention.</p> <h3 id="why-look-at-triangles">Why look at triangles?</h3> <p>The guiding principle here is the idea of the triangle inequality: “the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than or equal to the third side”. Recall that each <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong> in the pair tensor encodes the relationship between positions i and j in the sequence. While it does not literally encode the physical distances between pairs of tokens, let’s think about it for a moment as if it did. If we imagine that each <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong> is the distance between two amino acids and we know <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong>=1 and <strong><span>z<sub>j,k</sub></span></strong>=1. By the triangle inequality <strong><span>z<sub>i,k</sub></span></strong> cannot be larger than \(\sqrt{2}\). Knowing two of the distances gives us a strong belief about what the third distance must be. The goal of triangle updates and triangle attention are to try to encode these geometric constraints into the model.</p> <p>The triangle inequality is not enforced in the model but rather, it is encouraged through ensuring each position <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong> is updated by looking at all possible triplets of positions (<strong>i</strong>,<strong>j</strong>,<strong>k</strong>) at a time. So <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong> is updated based on <strong><span>z<sub>j,k</sub></span></strong> and <strong><span>z<sub>i,k</sub></span></strong> for all other atoms k. Because <strong><span>z</span></strong> represents the complex physical relationship between these tokens, rather than merely their distance, these relationships can be directional. So for <strong><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></strong>, we also want to encourage consistency with <strong><span>z<sub>k,i</sub></span></strong> and <strong><span>z<sub>k,j</sub></span></strong> for all atoms k. If we think of the atoms as a graph, with <strong><span>z</span></strong> as a directed adjacency matrix, it makes sense that AlphaFold calls these “outgoing edges” and “incoming edges”.</p> <p>Consider row i=0 of this adjacency matrix, and let’s say we want to update <strong><span>z<sub>0,2</sub></span></strong>, which has been highlighted in purple. The idea behind the update is that if we know the distances between 0→1 and 2→1, that gives us some constraints on what 0→2 can be. Similarly, if we know the distances between 0→3 and 2→3, this also gives us a constraint on 0→2. This would apply for all atoms k.</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/adjacency_matrix-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/adjacency_matrix-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/adjacency_matrix-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/adjacency_matrix.png" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>So, in the triangle updates and attention, we effectively look at all directed paths for 3 nodes in this graph (a.k.a triangles, hence the name!).</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/triangle_paths-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/triangle_paths-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/triangle_paths-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/triangle_paths.png" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3 id="triangle-updates">Triangle Updates</h3> <p>Having carefully looked at the triangle operations from a graph theory perspective, we can see how this is implemented with tensor operations.

Structure Prediction</h2> <h2 id="basics-of-diffusion">Basics of Diffusion</h2> <p>Now, with these refined representations, we are ready to use <strong><span>s</span></strong> and <strong><span>z</span></strong> to predict the structure of our complex. One of the changes introduced in AF3 is that entire structure prediction is based on atom-level diffusion. Existing posts more thoroughly explain the <a href="https://www.superannotate.com/blog/diffusion-models" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">intuition</a> and <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">math</a> for diffusion, but the basic idea of a Diffusion Model is to start with real data, add random noise to your data, then train a model to predict what noise was added. Noise is iteratively added to the data over a series of T timesteps to create a sequence of T variants of each datapoint. We call the original data point x<sub>t=0</sub> and the fully noised version x<sub>t=T</sub>. During training, at timestep t, the model is given the x<sub>t</sub> and predicts what noise was added between x<sub>t-1</sub> and x<sub>t</sub>. We take a gradient step on the predicted noise added compared to the actual noise that had been added.</p> <p>Then, at inference time, we simply start with random noise, which is equivalent to x<sub>t=T</sub>. For every time step, we predict the noise the model thinks has been added, and remove that predicted noise. After a pre-specified number of timesteps, we end up with a fully “denoised” datapoint that should resemble the original data from our dataset.</p> <p>Conditional Diffusion lets the model ‘condition’ these de-noising predictions on some input. Practically this means that for each step of the model, it takes three inputs:</p> <ol> <li>The current noisy iteration of our generation</li> <li>A representation of the current time step we are at</li> <li>The information we want to condition on (this could be a caption for an image to generate, or properties for a protein).</li> </ol> <p>As a result, the final generation is not just a random example that resembles the training data distribution, but should specifically match the information represented by this conditioning vector.</p> <p>With AF3, the data we learn to de-noise is a matrix <strong><span>x</span></strong> with the x,y,z coordinates of all the atoms in our sequences. During training, we add Gaussian noise to these coordinates until they are effectively fully random. Then at inference time, we start with random coordinates. At each time step, we first randomly rotate and translate our entire predicted complex. This data-augmentation teaches the model that any rotation and translation of our complex is equally valid, and replaces the much more complicated Invariant Point Attention used in AF2. <d-footnote>AF2 had developed a complicated architecture called Invariant Point Attention meant to enforce equivariance to translations and rotations. This led to a vigorous debate over the importance of IPA in AF2's success. In AF3, this is dropped in favor of a much simpler approach: applying random rotations and translations as data-augmentations to help the model learn such equivariances naturally. So here we simply randomly rotate all atoms' coordinates around the center of our current generation (the mean over all atoms' coordinates), and randomly sample a translation in each dimension (x, y, and z) from a N(0,1) Gaussian. It appears from the algorithm that the translation is universal, that is the same translation is applied to every atom in our current generation. This type of data augmentation was popularize with CNNs but in the past few years, equivariant architectures like IPA have been considered an more efficient and elegant approach to solve the same problem. Thus, when AF3 replaced equivariant attention with data-augmentation, it sparked a lot of internet discussions.</d-footnote> We then add a small amount of noise to the coordinates to encourage more heterogeneous generations.<d-footnote>It benefits us for the model to generate several slightly different variations. At inference time, we can score each using our confidence head, and return only the generation with the highest score.</d-footnote> Finally, we predict a de-noising step using the Diffusion Module.

Now we provide some additional information about the loss function, auxiliary confidence heads, and training details.</p> <h2 id="4-loss-function-and-other-training-details">4. Loss Function and Other Training Details</h2> <h2 id="loss-function-and-confidence-heads">Loss function and confidence heads</h2> <p>\(L_{\text{loss}} = L_{\text{distogram}}*\alpha_{\text{distogram}}+L_{\text{diffusion}}*\alpha_{\text{diffusion}}+L_{\text{confidence}}*\alpha_{\text{confidence}}\)</p> <p>The loss is a weighted sum of 3 terms:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>L<sub>distogram</sub></strong> which evaluates the accuracy of the predicted distogram at a token-level</li> <li> <strong>L<sub>diffusion</sub></strong> which evaluates the accuracy of the predicted distogram at an atom-level. It looks at all pairwise distances then includes additional terms to prioritize distances between nearby atoms and atoms involved in protein-ligand bonds.</li> <li> <strong>L<sub>confidence</sub></strong> which evaluates the model’s self-awareness about which structures are likely to be inaccurate</li> </ul> <h3 id="ldistogram">L<sub>distogram</sub> </h3> <p>The output of our model is atom-level coordinates, which can easily be used to create an atom-level distogram<d-footnote>Recall how the distograms were initially created by binning pairwise distances between atoms</d-footnote>. However, this loss evaluates a token-level distogram. To get the xyz coordinates for tokens, we just use the coordinate of the “center atom”. As these distogram distances are categorical, the predicted distogram is then compared to the true distogram via cross entropy.</p> <h3 id="ldiffusion">L<sub>diffusion</sub> </h3> <p>The diffusion loss itself is a weighted sum of three terms each computed over the atom positions, additionally scaled by the amount of noise<d-footnote>t<sup>^</sup>, the sampled noise level for the current time step, and σ<sub>data</sub>, the variance of the data which scales the amount of noise at each time step</d-footnote> added at the current time step: \(L_{\text{diffusion}} = (L_{\text{MSE}} + L_{\text{bond}} * \alpha_{\text{bond}}) * (\hat{t}^2 + \sigma_{\text{data}}^2)/(\hat{t}+\sigma_{\text{data}})^2 + L_{\text{smooth_lddt}}\)</p> <ul> <li> <strong>L<sub>MSE</sub></strong> is a version of the distogram loss we just discussed, but over all atoms rather just “center atoms” (and with DNA, RNA, and ligand atoms upweighted). Additionally, it looks at the mean squared error between positions, rather than binning them into a distogram.</li> <li> <strong>L<sub>bond</sub></strong> aims to ensure the accuracy of bond lengths for protein-ligand bonds by adding an additional MSE loss on the difference in predicted and ground-truth distograms for atom-pairs that are part of protein-ligand bonds.<d-footnote>There are various stages of training and α<sub>bond</sub> is set to 0 in the initial stages, so this term is only introduced later.</d-footnote> </li> <li> <strong>L<sub>smooth_LDDT</sub></strong> (smoothed local distance difference test) is yet another variant of the distogram loss that tries to capture the accuracy of local distances. An atom-pair’s predicted distance “passes the test” if it is within a given threshold of the atom-pair’s true distance. To make this metric smooth and differentiable, we pass the difference between predicted and ground-truth distograms through a sigmoid centered on the test’s threshold. We can think of this as generating a probability (between 0 and 1) that this atom-pair passes the test. We take the average of four “tests’’ with increasingly tight thresholds (4, 2, 1, and .5 Å). Using this loss encourages the model to reduce the probability of failing each test. Finally, to make the test “local”, we ignore the loss for an atom-pair if that atom-pair’s ground truth distance is large, as we only want the model to focus on accurately predicting an atom’s distances to nearby atoms<d-footnote>Specifically, for an atom-pair l,m, we ignore the loss for l and m if l and m are more than 30 Å away if atom m is part of a nucleotide. We ignore the loss for l and m if they are more than 15 Å away from each other and m is not a nucleotide (so is part of a protein or ligand).</d-footnote>.</li> </ul> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/smooth_lddt-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/smooth_lddt-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/smooth_lddt-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/smooth_lddt.png" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3 id="lconfidence">L<sub>confidence</sub> </h3> <p>The goal of this loss is not to improve the accuracy of the structure, but rather to teach the model to predict its own accuracy. This loss is a weighted sum of 4 terms that each correspond to a method of evaluating the quality of a predicted structure:</p> \[L_{\text{confience}} = L_{\text{plDDT}} + L_{\text{PDE}} + L_{\text{resolved}} + L_{\text{PAE}} * \alpha_{\text{PAE}}\] <ul> <li> <p><strong>lDDT</strong> Atom-level “local distance difference test”, capturing the expected accuracy of an atom’s predicted distances to nearby atoms.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>PAE</strong> Predicted alignment error between token i’s predicted and the ground-truth positions.

At a selected diffusion step t, the predicted coordinates <strong><span>r<sup>t</sup></span></strong> are used to update the single and pair representations created in the representation learning trunk. The predicted errors are then calculated from linear projections of the updated pair representation (for PAE and PDE) or this updated single representation (pLDDT and experimentally resolved). Then, the actual error metrics are calculated based on the same generated atom coordinates (process described below, if interested) for comparison.</p> <p>While these terms are included in the confidence head loss, gradients from these terms are only used to update the confidence prediction heads and do not affect the rest of the model.</p> <details> <summary>How are the actual error metrics calculated?</summary> <p><b>pLDDT:</b> The LDDT for atom l is calculated in the following way: in the current predicted structure, we calculate the distance between atom l and a set of atoms R that is indexed by m, and compare this to the ground truth equivalent. To be in this set, an atom m must be part of a polymer chain, within 15 or 30 Å of l depending on the molecule m is a part of, and the center atom of a token. We then calculate four binary distance tests with increasingly tight thresholds (4, 2, 1, and .5 Å) and take the average pass rate, and sum over the atoms in R. We bin this percentage into 50 bins between 0 and 1.</p> <p>At inference time, we have a pLDDT head. This head takes the single representation of a given token, repeats it out across all the atoms "attached" to this token<d-footnote>Technically, the max number of atoms attached to any token, so that we can stack tensors</d-footnote>, and projects all those atom-level representations to the 50 bins of our pLDDT_l. We treat these as logits across the 50 "classes", use a softmax to convert to probabilities, and take a multi-class classification loss across the bins.</p> <p><b>Predicted Alignment Error (PAE):</b> Every token is considered to have a frame, that is a 3D coordinate frame created from three atoms (called a, b, c) involved in that token. Atom b within those three atoms forms the origin in this frame. In cases where each token has a single atom "attached", the center atom of the frame is the single atom of the token, and the two other nearest tokens of the same entity (e.g., same ligand) form the basis of the frame. For every token pair (i,j) we re-express the predicted coordinates of the center atom for token_i using the frame of token_j. We do the same for the ground-truth coordinates of the center atom of token_i. The euclidean distance between these transformed true and predicted coordinates of the center atom of token_i is our alignment error, binned into 64 bins. We predict this alignment error from the pair representation <b><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></b>, projecting it to 64 dimensions that we treat as logits and convert to probabilities with a softmax. We train this head with a classification loss, which each bin as a class. See <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/inputs-and-outputs/evaluating-alphafolds-predicted-structures-using-confidence-scores/pae-a-measure-of-global-confidence-in-alphafold-predictions/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a> for additional details.</p> <p>Third, AF3 predicts the distance error (PDE) between tokens. The true distance error is calculated by taking the distance between center atoms for every token pair, and binning these distances over 64 uniformly-sized bins from 0 Å to 32 Å. The predicted distance error comes from projecting the pair representation <b><span>z<sub>i,j</sub></span></b> plus the pair representation <b><span>z<sub>j,i</sub></span></b> into 64 dimensions that we again treat as logits, and again convert to probabilities with a softmax.</p> <p>Finally, AF3 predicts whether each atom was experimentally resolved in the ground-truth structure. Similar to the pLDDT head, we repeat the <b><span>s<sub>i</sub></span></b> single representation out for the number of atoms this token represents, and project to 2 dimensions and use a binary classification loss.</p> </details> <hr> <h2 id="other-training-details">Other Training Details</h2> <p>Now that the architecture is covered, the last pieces are some of the additional training details.</p> <h3 id="recycling">Recycling</h3> <p>As introduced in AF2, AF3 recycles its weights; that is, rather than making the model deeper, the model weights are re-used and inputs are run through the modules multiple times to continually improve the representations. Diffusion inherently uses recycling at inference time, as the model is trained to incorporate the timestep information and use the same model weights for every time step.</p> <h3 id="cross-distillation">Cross-distillation</h3> <p>AF3 uses a mix of synthetic training data generated by itself (via self-distillation) but also by AF2, via <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-024-02002-0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cross-distillation</a>. Specifically, the authors note that, by switching to the diffusion-based generative module, the model stopped producing the characteristic “spaghetti” regions that allowed users of AF2 to visually identify low-confidence and likely disordered regions. Just visually looking at the diffusion-based generations, all regions appeared equally high in confidence, making it more difficult to identify potential hallucinations.</p> <p>To solve this problem, they included generations from AF2 and AF-Multimer in the training data for AF3, allowing the model to learn that, when AF2 was not confident in its prediction, it should output these unfolded regions and to “instruct” AF3 to do the same.<d-footnote>Nucleic acids and small molecules in distillation datasets had to be removed as they could not be processed by AF2 and AF-multimer. However, once previous models generated new predicted structures, and these structures got aligned to the originals, the removed molecules were added back in. If adding these back in created new atom clashes, the whole structure was excluded, to avoid accidentally teaching the model to accept clashes.</d-footnote></p> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/cross_distillation-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/cross_distillation-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/cross_distillation-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/cross_distillation.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>(Diagram from AF3 paper)</p> </div> <h3 id="cropping-and-training-stages">Cropping and Training Stages</h3> <p>While no part of the model has an explicit restriction on the length of the input sequences, the memory and compute requirements increase significantly with sequence length (recall the multiple O(N<sub>tokens</sub><sup>3</sup> operations)). Thus, for efficiency the proteins get randomly cropped. As introduced in AF-multimer, because we want to model the interactions between multiple chains, the random cropping needs to include all of these. They use 3 methods for cropping and all 3 of these are used in different proportions depending on the training data (ex: PDB crystal structure vs disordered PDB complex vs distillation, etc.)</p> <ul> <li>Contiguous cropping: Contiguous sequences of amino acids are selected for each chain</li> <li>Spatial cropping: Amino acids are selected based on distance to a reference atom (typically this atom is part of a specific chain or binding interface of interest)</li> <li>Spatial interface cropping: Similar to spatial cropping, but based on distances to atoms that specifically at a binding interface.</li> </ul> <p>While a model trained on random crops of 384 can be applied to longer sequences, to improve the model’s ability to handle these sequences, it is iteratively fine-tuned on larger sequence lengths. The mix of datasets and other training details is also varied in each training stage as is shown in the table below.</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/training_stages-480.webp 480w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/training_stages-800.webp 800w,https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/training_stages-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://elanapearl.github.io/assets/img/af3_post/training_stages.png" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>(Table from AF3 supplement)</p> </div> <h3 id="clashing">Clashing</h3> <p>The authors note that AF3’s loss does not include a clash penalty for overlapping atoms. While switching to a diffusion-based structure module means the model could in theory predict two atoms to be in the same location, this seems to be minimal after training. That said, AF3 does employ a clashing penalty when ranking generated structures.</p> <h3 id="batch-sizes">Batch sizes</h3> <p>Although the diffusion process sounds quite involved, it is still significantly less computationally expensive than the trunk of the model. Thus, the AF3 authors found that it is more efficient from a training perspective to expand the batch size of the model after the trunk. So for each input structure, it gets run through the embedding and trunk, then 48 independent data-augmented versions of the structure are applied, and these 48 structures are all trained in parallel.</p> <p><strong>That’s it for the training process!</strong> There are some other small details but this is probably already more than you need, and if you’ve made it this far, the rest should be easy to pick up from reading the AF3 supplement.</p> <h2 id="ml-musings">ML Musings</h2> <p>Having walked so thoroughly through the architecture of AF3 and its comparisons to AF2, it is interesting how the choices made by the authors fit into broader Machine Learning trends.</p> <h3 id="alphafold-as-retrieval-augmented-generation">AlphaFold as Retrieval-Augmented Generation</h3> <p>At the time AF2 was released, it was not common to include retrievals from the training set at inference time. In the case of AF, utilizing an MSA and template search. MSA-based methods were being used for protein modeling, but this type of retrieval was less used in other areas of Deep Learning (i.e., ResNets do not embed relevant training images at inference time when classifying a new image in Computer Vision, for example). Although AF3 reduces the emphasis on the MSA compared to AF2 (it is no longer operated on and updated in the 48 blocks of the Evoformer/Pairformer), they still incorporate both the MSA and templates, even as other protein prediction models such as ESMFold have dropped retrieval in favor of fully parametric inference.</p> <p>Interestingly, some of the largest and most successful Deep Learning models now often include similar additional information at inference time. While the details of the retrieval systems are not always disclosed, Large Language Models routinely use Retrieval Augmented Generation systems such as a traditional web search at inference time to orient the model toward relevant information (even if that information was likely already in its training data) that should guide inference. It will be interesting to see how the use of directly relevant examples at inference time develops in the future.</p> <h3 id="pair-bias-attention">Pair-Bias Attention</h3> <p>One of the major components of AF2 that is even more present in AF3 is Pair-Bias Attention. That is, attention where the queries, keys, and values all originate from the same source (like in self-attention), but where there is a bias term added to the attention map from another source. This effectively acts as a light-touch version of information sharing, without full cross-attention. Pair-Bias Attention appears in almost every module. While this type of attention is now used in other protein modeling architectures, we have not seen this particular type of cross-biasing used in other fields (although that does not mean it hasn’t been done!). Perhaps it only works well here because the pair-representation is naturally analogous to a self-attention map already, but is an intriguing alternative to pure self or pure cross-attention.</p> <h3 id="self-supervised-training">Self-supervised training</h3> <p>Self-supervised models like ESM have been able to achieve impressive results at predicting protein structure by replacing the MSA embedding with a “probabilistic MSA” using self-supervised pre-training. In AF2, the model had an additional task that predicted masked tokens from the MSA, achieving a similar self-supervision, but that was removed with AF3. We have not seen commentary from the authors on why they did not use any self-supervised language modeling pre-training approach on the MSA, and in fact decreased the compute used to process the MSA. Three possible reasons self-supervised learning is not used to initialize the MSA embeddings are 1) they viewed the massive pre-training phase as a suboptimal use of compute 2) they tried it and found that including a small MSA module outperformed pre-trained embeddings and was worth the additional inference-time cost or 3) utilizing a mix of pre-trained embeddings for amino acid tokens and randomly initialized embeddings for DNA/RNA/ligands would not be compatible or underperformed fully supervised training on their hybrid atom-token structure. <d-footnote>By focusing on self-supervision tasks, models in the ESM family are also much more simple than AF3 (although they don't handle DNA/RNA/ligands and have slightly different goals.) It is interesting to watch that as some models aim to maximize architectural simplicity, AlphaFold remains this complicated! </d-footnote></p> <h3 id="classification-vs-regression">Classification vs. Regression</h3> <p>As in AF2, AF3 continues to use a mix of MSE and binned classification losses. The classification components are interesting as, if the model predicts a distogram bin that is only off-by-one, it gets no “credit” for being close rather than way off. It is unclear what informed this design decision, but perhaps the authors found the gradients to be more stable than working with several different MSE losses, and perhaps the per-atom losses saw so many gradient steps that the additional signal from a continuous loss would not have proven beneficial.</p> <h3 id="similarities-to-recurrent-architectures-eg-lstms">Similarities to Recurrent Architectures (e.g LSTMs)</h3> <p>AF3’s architecture incorporates several design elements reminiscent of recurrent neural networks that are not typically found in traditional transformers:</p> <ul> <li>Extensive Gating: AF3 uses gating mechanisms throughout its architecture to control information flow in the residual stream. This is more akin to the gating in LSTMs or GRUs than the standard feed-forward nature of normal transformer layers.</li> <li>Iterative Processing with Weight Reuse: AF3 applies the same weights multiple times to progressively refine its predictions. This process, involving both recycling and the diffusion model, resembles how recurrent networks process sequential data over time steps using a shared set of weights. It differs from standard transformers, which typically make predictions in a single forward pass. This approach allows AF3 to iteratively improve its protein structure predictions without increasing the number of parameters.</li> <li>Adaptive Computation: The recycling is also similar to the iterative updating used in diffusion and quite related to the idea of adaptive compute time <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08983" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(ACT)</a>, originally introduced to dynamically determine how much compute to use for RNNs and more recently used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02258" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mixture-of-Depths</a> to achieve a similar goal with transformers. This contrasts with the fixed depth of standard transformers and theoretically would allow the model to apply more processing to challenging inputs.</li> </ul> <p>It was shown in the AF2 ablations that the recycling was important, but there was little disucssion on the importance of gating. Presumably it helps with training stability as in LSTMs but it is interesting that it is so prevalent here yet not in many other transformer-based architectures.</p> <h3 id="cross-distillation-1">Cross-distillation</h3> <p>The use of AF2 generations to re-introduce its distinctive style specifically for low-confidence regions is very interesting. If there is a lesson here, it may be the most practical of all: If your previous model is doing one specific thing better than your new model, you can try cross-distillation to get the best of both worlds!</p> <hr> <p>If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading and hope it was helpful!!

<p dir="auto">If you need to store some state in the processor thread which is neither <code>Send</code> nor <code>Sync</code>, e.g. a <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code>, then you can create a closure for initializing that state and pass it along with the processing closure when you build the Disruptor. The Disruptor will then pass a mutable reference to your state on each event. As an example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="use std::{cell::RefCell, rc::Rc};

struct Event {

        // Mutate your custom state:
        *s.data.borrow_mut() += 1;

<p dir="auto">Everything in the library is about low-latency and this heavily influences all choices made in this library.
As an example, you cannot allocate an event and <em>move</em> that into the ringbuffer. Instead, events are allocated on startup to ensure they are co-located in memory to increase cache coherency.
However, you can still allocate a struct on the heap and move ownership to a field in the event on the Ringbuffer.
As long as you realize that this can add latency, because the struct is allocated by one thread and dropped by another.
Hence, there's synchronization happening in the allocator.</p>
<p dir="auto">There's also no use of dynamic dispatch - everything is monomorphed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h2><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The SPSC and MPSC Disruptor variants have been benchmarked and compared to Crossbeam. See the code in the <code>benches/spsc.rs</code> and <code>benches/mpsc.rs</code> files.</p>
<p dir="auto">The results below of the SPSC benchmark are gathered from running the benchmarks on a 2016 Macbook Pro running a 2,6 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7. So on a modern Intel Xeon the numbers should be even better. Furthermore, it's not possible to isolate cores on Mac and pin threads which would produce even more stable results. This is future work.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have any suggestions to improving the benchmarks, please feel free to open an issue.</p>
<p dir="auto">To provide a somewhat realistic benchmark not only burst of different sizes are considered but also variable pauses between bursts: 0 ms, 1 ms and 10 ms.</p>
<p dir="auto">The latencies below are the mean latency per element with 95% confidence interval (standard <code>criterion</code> settings). Capturing all latencies and calculating misc. percentiles (and in particular the max latency) is future work. However, I expect the below measurements to be representative for the actual performance you can achieve in a real application.</p>

<p dir="auto">There's clearly a difference between the Disruptor and the Crossbeam libs. However, this is not because the Crossbeam library is not a great piece of software. It is. The Disruptor trades CPU and memory resources for lower latency and higher throughput and that is why it's able to achieve these results. The Disruptor also excels if you can publish batches of events as
demonstrated in the benchmarks with bursts of 10 and 100 events.</p>
<p dir="auto">Both libraries greatly improves as the burst size goes up but the Disruptor's performance is more resilient to the pauses between bursts which is one of the design goals.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
Earlier today Stephen Johnson, in a mailing list run by the
<a href="http://www.tuhs.org/">The Unix Heritage Society</a>,
described the birth of the <em>standard error</em> concept:
the idea that a program's error output is sent on a channel
different from that of its normal output.
Over the past forty years, all major operating systems and language libraries
have embraced this concept.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/blog/20131211/cat.png" alt="C/A/T phototypesetter">
The story starts with the Graphic Systems'
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAT_(phototypesetter)">C/A/T phototypesetter</a> used by the Bell Labs
in the 1970s.
This, washing-machine sized, equipment would typeset documents by
flashing a strobe to expose character glyphs
that were pre-installed on a rotating drum.
The drum supported four fonts (Times Roman, italic, bold, and Symbol);
a magnifying glass was used to change the font size.
The text input normally came from a paper tape, and the output was
rendered onto film,
which then required a cumbersome, dirty, and smelly development process.
<a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2013-December/002927.html">Brian Walden</a>
relates that "the chemical baths were nasty smelling and it
gummed up the rollers.
You'd needed to regularly take the developer roller and gear guts into
the janitor's closet and scrub it with a toothbrush in the slop sink
under running water."
</p>
<p>
As one might expect, Bell Labs didn't use the paper tape input.
<a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2013-December/002929.html">According to Doug McIlroy</a>,
"as soon as the machine arrived, Joe Ossanna [the author of troff]
bypassed the tape reader so the C/A/T could be driven
directly from the PDP-11. The manufacturer was astonished."
The connection was one-way only, so the corresponding device had
write-only permissions,
and there was no way to obtain status feedback from the phototypesetter.
Doug McIlroy also remembers that, amusingly,
"the first technical paper that came off
the C/A/T drew a query from the journal editor, who'd never seen a
phototypeset manuscript before: had it been published elsewhere?"
</p>
<p>
This ardous but cutting-edge phototypesetting process set the stage
for the invention of the standard error concept.
<a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2013-December/002933.html">Stephen Johnson describes the incident as follows</a>.
</p><blockquote>
"One of the most amusing and unexpected consequences of phototypesetting
was the Unix standard error file (!).   After phototypesetting, you had to
take a long wide strip of paper and feed it carefully into a smelly, icky
machine which eventually (several minutes later) spat out the paper with
the printing visible."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"One afternoon several of us had the same experience -- typesetting
something, feeding the paper through the developer, only to find a single,
beautifully typeset line: "cannot open file foobar"   The grumbles were
loud enough and in the presence of the right people, and a couple of days
later the standard error file was born..."
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a gem from the archive of the NY Times. One day in September 1976, NY Times food critic Mimi Sheraton and Colonel Harland Sanders <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/09/archives/for-the-colonel-it-was-fingerlickin-bad.html">stopped into a Manhattan Kentucky Fried Chicken</a>. The Colonel, then estranged from the company he founded, strolled into the kitchen after glad-handing some patrons and proceeded to tear into the quality of the food:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once in the kitchen, the colonel walked over to a vat full of frying chicken pieces and announced, ‘That’s much too black. It should be golden brown. You’re frying for 12 minutes — that’s six minutes too long. What’s more, your frying fat should have been changed a week ago. That’s the worst fried chicken I’ve ever seen. Let me see your mashed potatoes with gravy, and how do you make them?”</p>
	
<p>When Mr. Singleton explained that he first mixed boiling water into the instant powdered potatoes, the colonel interrupted. “And then you have wallpaper paste,” he said. “Next suppose you add some of this brown gravy stuff and then you have sludge.” “There’s no way anyone can get me to swallow those potatoes,” he said after tasting some. “And this cole slaw. This cole slaw! They just won’t listen to me. It should he chopped, not shredded, and it should be made with Miracle Whip. Anything else turns gray. And there should be nothing in it but cabbage. No carrots!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Sanders sold his company to an investment group in 1964, which took the company public two years later and eventually sold to a company called Heublein. After selling, Sanders officially still worked for the company as an advisor but grew more and more dissatisfied with it, as evidenced by the story above. When the company HQ moved to Tennessee, the Colonel was quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>This ain’t no goddam Tennessee Fried Chicken, no matter what some slick, silk-suited son-of-a-bitch says.</p></blockquote>

<p>And he got sued by a KFC franchisee after he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZskrsscU7HkC&amp;pg=SA4-PA17&amp;lpg=SA4-PA17&amp;dq=My+God,+that+gravy+is+horrible!+sanders&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zfKAaLx1Rx&amp;sig=iZUPCcCs3LlSlsdnEGKkbQzEJx0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTpZn_3t3OAhVMCsAKHaviCY8Q6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=My%20God%2C%20that%20gravy%20is%20horrible!%20sanders&amp;f=false">commented</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>My God, that gravy is horrible. They buy tap water for 15 to 20 cents a thousand gallons and then mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste. And I know wallpaper paste, by God, because I’ve seen my mother make it.</p>

<p>To the “wallpaper paste” they add some sludge and sell it for 65 or 75 cents a pint. There’s no nutrition in it and the ought not to be allowed to sell it.</p>

<p>And another thing. That new crispy chicken is nothing in the world but a damn fried doughball stuck on some chicken.</p></blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/gpu.cpp">https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/gpu.cpp</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40952182">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">gpu.cpp</h2><a id="user-content-gpucpp" aria-label="Permalink: gpu.cpp" href="#gpucpp"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">gpu.cpp is a lightweight library that makes portable GPU compute with C++ simple.</p>
<p dir="auto">It focuses on general purpose native GPU computation, leveraging the WebGPU
specification as a portable low-level GPU interface. This means we can drop in
GPU code in C++ projects and have it run on Nvidia, Intel, AMD, and other GPUs.
The same C++ code can work on a wide variety of laptops, workstations, mobile
devices or virtually any hardware with Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX support.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Technical Objectives: Lightweight, Fast Iteration, and Low Boilerplate</h2><a id="user-content-technical-objectives-lightweight-fast-iteration-and-low-boilerplate" aria-label="Permalink: Technical Objectives: Lightweight, Fast Iteration, and Low Boilerplate" href="#technical-objectives-lightweight-fast-iteration-and-low-boilerplate"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With gpu.cpp we want to enable a high-leverage library for individual developers and researchers to incorporate GPU computation into programs relying on nothing more than a standard C++ compiler as tooling. Our goals are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>High power-to-weight ratio API: Provide the smallest API surface area that can cover the full range of GPU compute needs.</li>
<li>Fast compile/run cycles: Ensure projects can build nearly instantaneously, compile/run cycles should be &lt;5 seconds on a modern laptop.</li>
<li>Minimal dependencies and tooling overhead: A standard clang C++ compiler should be enough, no external library dependencies beyond the WebGPU native implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The implementation aims for a small API surface area with minimum boilerplate. There are a small number of library operations to carry out an broad range of low-level GPU operations. We avoid abstractions that add layers of indirection, making the mapping between the gpu.cpp library to raw WebGPU API clear when it's needed.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this spirit of fast experimentation, we also want near- instantaneous C++ builds taking no more than a second or two even on modestly capable personal computing devices. With this in mind, we not only keep the API surface area small, but also keep the implementation small and we also provide a prebuilt binary of the Dawn native WebGPU implementation.</p>
<p dir="auto">The core library implementation in the header-only <code>gpu.h</code> source code is around 1000 lines of code. In addition to enabling instantaneous, semi-interactive compilation cycles, the small implementation surface area keeps maintenance burden low and the velocity of improvements high.
We also pre-build Google's Dawn WebGPU implementation as a shared library binary. This allows builds to link the shared library with each build and incorporate Google's powerful native WebGPU implementation without paying the cost of re-compiling Dawn during development cycles.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more advanced users and release deployments, we include <code>cmake</code> examples for building both Dawn with gpu.cpp end-to-end, but this is not required nor recommended for most users to get started.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quick Start: Building and Running</h2><a id="user-content-quick-start-building-and-running" aria-label="Permalink: Quick Start: Building and Running" href="#quick-start-building-and-running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To build a gpu.cpp project, you will need to have installed on your system:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>clang++</code> compiler installed with support for C++17.</li>
<li><code>python3</code> and above, to run the script which downloads the Dawn shared library.
make to build the project.</li>
<li><code>make</code> to build the project.</li>
<li>Only on Linux systems - Vulkan drivers. If Vulkan is not installed, you can run <code>sudo apt install libvulkan1 mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-tools</code> to install them.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The only library dependency of gpu.cpp is a WebGPU implementation. Currently we support the Dawn native backend, but we plan to support other targets and WebGPU implementations (web browsers or other native implementations such as wgpu). Currently we support MacOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL).</p>
<p dir="auto">Optionally, Dawn can be built from scratch with gpu.cpp using the cmake build scripts provided - see the -cmake targets in the Makefile. However, this is recommended for advanced users only. Building Dawn dependencies with cmake takes much longer than using the precompiled Dawn shared library.</p>
<p dir="auto">After cloning the repo, from the top-level gpu.cpp, you should be able to build and run the hello world GELU example by typing:</p>

<p dir="auto">The first time you build and run the project this way, it will download a prebuilt shared library for the Dawn native WebGPU implementation automatically (using the setup.py script). This places the Dawn shared library in the third_party/lib directory. Afterwards you should see <code>libdawn.dylib</code> on MacOS or <code>libdawn.so</code> on Linux. This download only occurs once.</p>
<p dir="auto">The build process itself should take a few seconds. If the build and executions is successful, you should see the output of the GELU computation:</p>

<p dir="auto">As a real-world example for how to use gpu.cpp, let's start with a practical-but-simple example of a GPU kernel from neural networks.</p>
<p dir="auto">GELU is a non-linear embarassingly parallel operation often used in modern large language model transformer-based architectures.</p>
<p dir="auto">It takes as input a vector of floats and applies the GELU function to each element of the vector. The function is nonlinear, attenuating values below zero to near zero, approximating the y = x identity function for large positive values. For values close to zero, GELU smoothly interpolates between the identity function and the zero function.</p>
<p dir="auto">The GELU code below will illustrate the three main aspects of setting up a GPU computation with gpu.cpp:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The code that runs on the GPU (in WebGPU Shading Language, or WGSL), implementing the compute opporation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The code that runs on the CPU (in C++) that sets up the GPU computation by allocating and preparing resources. For high performance, this code should be run ahead-of-time from the hot paths of the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The code that runs on the CPU (in C++) that dispatches the GPU computation and retrieves the results. The key concern of hot-path dispatch code is to eliminate or minimize any unnecessary resource allocation or data movement (offloading such concerns to step 2). A secondary consideration is that GPU dispatches are asynchronous. We work with standard C++ asynchronous primitives to manage the asynchronous aspect of kernel dispatch.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Here's a GELU kernel implemented (based on the CUDA implementation in <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c">llm.c</a>) as an on-device WGSL shader and invoked from the host using gpu.cpp library functions and types. It can be compiled using a standard C++ compiler (we recommend Clang):</p>

<p dir="auto">Here we see the GPU code is quoted in a domain specific language called WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language). In a larger project, you might store this code in a separate file to be loaded at runtime (see <a href="https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/gpu.cpp/tree/main/examples/shadertui">examples/shadertui</a> for a demonstration of live WGSL code re-loading).</p>
<p dir="auto">The CPU code in main() sets up the host coordination for the GPU computation.
We can think of the use of gpu.cpp library as a collection of GPU nouns and
verbs.</p>
<p dir="auto">The "nouns" are GPU resources modeled by the type definitions of the library
and the "verbs" actions on GPU resources, modeled by the functions of the
library. The ahead-of-time resource acquisition functions are prefaced with
<code>create*</code>, such as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>createContext()</code> - constructs a reference to the GPU device context (<code>Context</code>).</li>
<li><code>createTensor()</code> - acquires a contiguous buffer on the GPU (<code>Tensor</code>).</li>
<li><code>createShader()</code> - constructs WGSL code string to run on the GPU) (<code>ShaderCode</code>)</li>
<li><code>createKernel()</code> - constructs a handle to resources for the GPU computation (<code>Kernel</code>), which combines bindings to GPU buffers from <code>createTensor()</code> with the computation definition from <code>createShader()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">These resource acquisition functions are tied to resource types for interacting with the GPU:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>Context</code> - a handle to the state of resources for interacting with the GPU device.</li>
<li><code>Tensor</code> - a buffer of data on the GPU.</li>
<li><code>ShaderCode</code> - the code for a shader program that can be dispatched to the
GPU. This is a thin wrapper around a WGSL string but also includes the
workgroup size the code is designed to run with.</li>
<li><code>Kernel</code> - a GPU program that can be dispatched to the GPU. This accepts a
<code>ShaderCode</code> and a list of <code>Tensor</code> resources to bind for the dispatch
computation. This takes an argument <code>Bindings</code> that is a list of <code>Tensor</code> instances and should map the bindings declared at the top of the WGSL code. In this example there's two bindings corresponding to the <code>input</code> buffer on the GPU and the <code>ouptut</code> buffer on the GPU.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In this example, the GELU computation is performed only once and the program immediately exits so preparing resources and dispatch are side-by-side. Other examples in the <a href="https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/gpu.cpp/blob/main/examples/">examples/</a> directory illustrate how resource acquisition is prepared ahead of time and dispatch occurs in the hot path like a render, model inference, or simulation loop.</p>
<p dir="auto">Besides the <code>create*</code> resource acquisition functions, there are a few more "verbs" in the gpu.cpp library for handling dispatching execution to the GPU and data movement:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>dispatchKernel()</code> - dispatches a <code>Kernel</code> to the GPU for computation. This is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately.</li>
<li><code>wait()</code> - blocks until the GPU computation is complete. This is a standard C++ future/promise pattern.</li>
<li><code>toCPU()</code> - moves data from the GPU to the CPU. This is a synchronous operation that blocks until the data is copied.</li>
<li><code>toGPU()</code> - moves data from the CPU to the GPU. This is a synchronous operation that blocks until the data is copied. In this particular example, <code>toGPU()</code> is not used because there's only one data movement from CPU to GPU in the program and that happens when the <code>createTensor()</code> function is called.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">gpu.cpp is aimed at enabling projects requiring portable on-device GPU computation with minimal implementation complexity and friction. Some example use cases are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Development of GPU algorithms to be run on personal computing devices</li>
<li>Direct standalone implementations of neural network models</li>
<li>Physics simulations and simulation environments</li>
<li>Multimodal applications - audio and video processing</li>
<li>Offline graphics rendering</li>
<li>ML inference engines and runtimes</li>
<li>Parallel compute intensive data processing applications</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Although gpu.cpp is meant for any general purpose GPU computation and not strictly AI, one area we're interested in is pushing the limits exploring the intersection of new algorithms for post-training and on-device compute.</p>
<p dir="auto">To date, AI research has primarily been built with CUDA as the priveledged first-class target. CUDA has been dominant at large scale training and inference but at the other end of the the spectrum in the world of GPU compute on personal devices, there exists far more heterogeneity in the hardware and software stack.</p>
<p dir="auto">GPU compute in this personal device ecosystem has been largely limited to a small group of experts such as game engine developers and engineers working directly on ML compilers or inference runtimes. Along with that, implementing against the Vulkan or even WebGPU API directly tends to be targeted mostly towards infrastrcture scale efforts - game engines, production ML inference engines, large software packages.</p>
<p dir="auto">We want to make it easier for a broader range of projects to harness the power of GPUs on personal devices. With a small amount of code, we can access the GPU at a low-level, focusing on directly implementing algorithms rather than the scaffolding and tech stack around the GPU. For example, in our AI research there's much to explore with the various forms of dynamic/conditional post-training computation - dynamic use of adapters, sparsity, model compression, realtime multimodal integrations etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">gpu.cpp lets us implement and drop-in any algorithm with fine-grained control of data movement and GPU code, and explore outside boundaries of what is supported by existing production-oriented inference runtimes. At the same time we can write code that is portable and immediately usable on a wide variety of and GPU vendors and compute form factors - workstations, laptops, mobile, or even emerging hardware platforms such as AR/VR and robotics.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What gpu.cpp is not</h2><a id="user-content-what-gpucpp-is-not" aria-label="Permalink: What gpu.cpp is not" href="#what-gpucpp-is-not"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">gpu.cpp is meant for developers with some familiarity with C++ and GPU programming. It is not a high-level numerical computing or machine learning framework or inference engine, though it can be used in support of such implementations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Second, in spite of the name, WebGPU has native implementations decoupled from the web and the browser. gpu.cpp leverages WebGPU as a portable <em>native</em> GPU API first and foremost, with the possibility of running in the browser being being a convenient additional benefit in the future.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you find it counerintuitive, as many do, that WebGPU is a native technology and not just for the web, watch Elie Michel's excellent talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHrx41aOTUQ" rel="nofollow">"WebGPU is Not Just About the Web"</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, the focus of gpu.cpp is general-purpose GPU computation rather than rendering/graphics on the GPU, although it can be useful for offline rendering or video processing use cases. We may explore directions with graphics in the future, but for now our focus is GPU compute.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations and Upcoming Features</h2><a id="user-content-limitations-and-upcoming-features" aria-label="Permalink: Limitations and Upcoming Features" href="#limitations-and-upcoming-features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>API Improvements</em> - gpu.cpp is a work-in-progress and there are many features and improvements to come. At this early stage, we expect the API design to evolve as we identify improvements / needs from use cases. In particular, the handling of structured parameters and asynchronous dispatch will undergo refinement and maturation in the short-term.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Browser Targets</em> - In spite of using WebGPU we haven't tested builds targeting the browser yet though this is a short-term priority.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Reusable Kernels and Shader Library</em> - Currently the core library is strictly the operations and types for interfacing with the WebGPU API, with some specific use case example WGSL implementations in <code>examples/</code>. Over time, as kernel implementations mature we may migrate some of the reusable operations from specific examples into a small reusable kernel library.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>More Use Case Examples and Tests</em> - Expect an iteration loop of use cases to design tweaks and improvements, which in turn make the use cases cleaner and easier to write. One short term use cases to flesh out the kernels from <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c">llm.c</a> in WebGPU form. As these mature into a reusable kernel library, we hope to help realize the potential for WebGPU compute in AI.</p>

<p>In the flesh it certainly looks the part and is very similar to the Amiga tank mouse we all know and love. Of course there’s two striking differences, the first of which is that this is now an optical mouse with the ball having been relegated to the history books. The second is the lack of a wire as this is now fully wireless, utilising either Bluetooth or 2.4Ghz to transmit the necessary signals back to your computer. You can switch between these options using a little 3-way switch underneath. This same switch is also used to power the mouse off when it’s placed in the middle position.</p>

<p>An optional extra that I purchased was the Tom adapter which came packaged separately in a little plastic bag. I have to confess to wondering why it was called Tom for a little while until I remembered the Tom and Jerry cartoons and then it all made perfect sense! Without this little gizmo the mouse will only work with modern computers which would defeat the purpose of it for me.</p>

<p>The Tom device is basically just a USB to DB9 adapter with some clever electronics to convert the USB signals into something old Commodore computers can understand. Compared to most of the Tom adapters available on eBay this one seems to be extremely compact and is actually referred to as a ‘Micro Tom’. It’s housed in a really nice 3D printed case that holds everything together securely.</p>

<p>When placed next to my original Amiga Tank mouse you can see just how close the design is. The main visible difference, besides the obvious lack of a wire, is that the buttons are a little narrower and spaced further apart on the new mouse. There’s a good reason for this that I will get to later on.</p>

<p>It’s powered by a couple of AAA batteries (rechargeable ones appear to work fine) which helps to add a bit of weight to it. I know some people like their mice light but I’m not one of them so the batteries went some way towards compensating for the lack of the ball.</p>

<h4>Mousing Around</h4>

<p>Before trying the wireless tank mouse with my retro machines I gave it a quick go in my Windows 11 PC and it worked immediately and completely flawlessly. I also tried it with my MorphOS Apple Mac Mini G4 with similar success. When used with modern machines you can use it with your favourite emulator for a more immersive experience or even as your daily driver should you wish.</p>
<p>In addition to the obligatory left and right mouse buttons the wireless tank mouse actually fully supports mouse scrolling too. Now you may well be thinking how’s that possible – it has no scroll wheel? Well remember earlier on when I mentioned about the buttons being spaced further apart? That’s because the designer has ingeniously incorporated a touch sensitive strip between the two buttons. You can simply swipe up and down with your finger to scroll in those directions. It works really well too. Obviously it lacks the tactile feedback of an actual wheel but having one of those would ruin the whole aesthetic.</p>

<p>I have plenty of mice for my modern computers though, I got this to use with my Amiga mainly so I plugged the Tom adapter into port 1 of my A1200 and powered it on, and it just worked. No messing around, no pairing, no software to install, just plug and play. The scrolling support worked seamlessly too, (I installed scroll wheel support for my existing wired Amga mouse years ago). Tracking was super accurate and smooth and the mouse was just as comfortable to hold as ever – in fact more so now as I’m not constantly fighting against the cable in the limited space I have available to use it!</p>

<p>Next I invoked ‘GO64’ and switched my MEGA65 into C64 mode to load up a BASIC <a href="https://lyonsden.net/a-c64-type-in-basic-listing-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solitaire</a> game that I typed in a few years ago. This was designed to work the the Commodore 1351 mouse and sure enough this also worked like a charm with just occasional jittering. Incidentally this is also a game that really benefits from switching the CPU to 40Mhz mode – no more lag when shuffling the cards!</p>
<p>I tried it with my real C64C computer and ran into my first problem. It simply refused to work. After a bit of RTFM (or RTFW in this case) I discovered the following…</p>

<h4>Switching between C64 and Amiga Mode</h4>

<p>Out of the box the Tom adapter is configured to run in Amiga mode. Consequently when plugging it into a C64 it just doesn’t work. (Same for the alternative C64 CORE in the MEGA65). Thankfully it can be switched into C64 1351 mode quite easily by plugging in a USB mouse, holding down the middle button (usually the scroll wheel) at bootup and whilst still holding it down press the left mouse button a few times until the red LED flashes 3 times and then you can let go. The adapter will now behave like a 1351 mouse forever until you change it back.</p>
<p>I did come a little unstuck trying to change it back to Amiga mode though. Either I have a slightly different model of Tom adapter or whoever wrote the instructions on the Sordan site got a bit confused. Thankfully after about 30 minutes of swapping different mice, power cycling, cursing and failing I figured it out. To switch to Amiga mode I had to hold down the right mouse button at bootup and then rapidly press the left button until the red LED flashed just the one time and then let go. (The instructions tell you to do the complete opposite which makes it flash twice which appears to be Atari ST mode).</p>

<h4>What do I think of it?</h4>

<p>All in this is a fantastic product that works with a huge range of machines, both old and new. It oozes nostalgia thanks to its design but at the same time embraces modernity by swapping the ball for an optical sensor, the wire for wireless connectivity and adds ‘invisible’ scrolling support beneath the plastic case. It works with pretty much every machine I own; all my Amigas, CD32, MEGA65, Commodore 64, Mac Mini running MorphOS and even my PC’s and emulators. My only criticism is the method of switching modes on the Tom adapter is a bit of a faff. I would much prefer a little 3-way toggle switch than trying to pull off some kind of weird secret handshake with the mouse. Other than that though the wireless tank mouse seems to be a jack of all trades and a master of them all and I’m really glad I picked one up.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<b>By Bill Watterson (C)2001
</b><p>From the book, "Calvin and Hobbes - Sunday Pages 1985 - 1995"</p></center>

</b>

<p>It's been five years since the end of <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, 
 the longest time I can remember in which I haven't drawn cartoons. 
 <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> was a wonderful experience, but it was an 
 all-consuming career. When I quit the strip, I put my cartoons in 
 boxes, and jumped into other interests. I haven't really considered 
 the strip since, so at the invitation to do this show, I thought 
 it might be time to look back at some of my work. 

</p><p>My first reaction in going through my old cartoons was some 
 amazement at the size and weight of the pile. For most successful 
 comic strips, ten years is just a drop in the bucket, but even that 
 amount of time yields a huge amount of material. It's no wonder 
 that decade seems like a blur. 

</p><p>Going through my old strips is sort of like looking at old 
 photographs of myself: they're personal and familiar, yet somewhat 
 bizarre at the same time. There are cartoons I've drawn that are 
 the equivalent of pictures of my younger self wearing yellow 
 pants: I know I'm responsible for that, but what on earth was I 
 thinking? As my tastes have changed, and as I've learned more, I 
 imagine that I would do many strips quite differently today. Not 
 better necessarily, but certainly differently. I was twenty-eight 
 when <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> was first published, and, of course, I would 
 make other choices now at age forty-three. 

</p><p>It's also sort of strange to see a record of my own learning 
 curve. Pick up a given strip, and I see how I struggled with 
 various writing and drawing problems, or how I finally surmounted 
 one. I remember sometimes feeling that the strip was better written 
 than I could actually write, and better drawn than I could actually 
 draw. I learned a great deal over the years by trying to push the 
 strip beyond my own abilities, and I'm very proud that <i>Calvin and 
 Hobbes</i> explored and developed all the way to the end. By the final 
 years, I see naturalness or a sense of inevitability to the drawing 
 and writing that is very satisfying. 


</p><p>I'm more appreciative of this kind of grace since returning to 
 the awkward stages of new learning curves. Of course, I'd also say 
 the times have caught up with some of my strips. It's frankly a 
 little discouraging to see how ordinary some of them look now. When 
 <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> first appeared, it was somewhat surprising to 
 treat reality as subjective, and to draw a strip with multiple 
 viewpoints, juxtaposing Calvin's vision with what others saw. I did  
 this simply as a way to put the reader in Calvin's head and to 
 reveal his imaginative personality. Now these juxtapositions are a 
 visual game for many comic strips, and after all these years, I 
 suspect readers know where this sort of joke is headed as soon as 
 they see it. The novelty cannot be recaptured. 

</p><p>Novelty, however, is probably overrated anyway. The <i>Calvin and 
 Hobbes</i> strips that hold up best, to my eye anyway, are the ones 
 where the characters seem big, vivid, and full of life, and where 
 the strip's world seems genuine and inviting. Punchlines come and 
 go, but something in the friendship between Calvin and Hobbes seems  
 to hold a small piece of truth. Expressing something real and 
 honest is, for me, the joy and the importance of cartooning. 

</p><p>The Sunday strips were usually the cartoons I had the most fun 
 with, and for this show I've chosen a few Sunday strips from each 
 year that I think show off the strip's strengths. 

</p><p>I have fond memories of reading the Sunday comics when I was a 
 kid. As far as I was concerned, the Sunday comics were the whole 
 reason for newspapers to exist. On weekdays, I read only the strips 
 I liked; but on Sundays, I read them all, and often several times. 
 The Sunday comics were always the most fun to look at, so when I 
 finally got the chance to draw my own comic strip, I knew I wanted 
 to make the Sunday Calvin and Hobbes something special. It took me 
 a little while to learn to use the larger Sunday space effectively. 
 It requires a somewhat different pace for the humor, and, of 
 course, a big color panel is no place to find out that you don't 
 know how to draw the back of your character's head. The Sunday 
 strip shows off both strengths and weaknesses. 

</p><p>Occasionally I would see that an idea I'd written for a Sunday 
 strip was not as substantial as I'd hoped it would be, and I'd 
 realize that some of the panels and dialogue weren't adding 
 anything significant to the story. If that were the case, I'd 
 remove everything extraneous and use the trimmed idea for a daily 
 strip instead. I held the Sundays to a different standard: any idea 
 for the Sunday strip had to need the extra space. I felt a Sunday 
 strip should do something that was impossible the rest of the week. 

</p><p>Over the years, I learned that daily strips are better suited for 
 certain kinds of ideas, while Sunday strips are better for others. 
 The daily strip is quick and to the point, perfect for a simple 
 observation, or a short exchange between characters. Daily strips 
 are also better for long stories, where a certain suspense can be 
 fostered by continuing the story day after day, and the reader can 
 remember what happened previously. 

</p><p>Extended conversations with real back and forth dialogue, however, 
 don't work very well in four tiny panels - the dialogue balloons 
 crowd out the drawings and the strip loses its grace. In a Sunday 
 strip, you can spread out, and let the characters yap a bit. This 
 is often funny in itself, and it's a wonderful way to let the 
 characters' personalities emerge. It also lets you explore a topic 
 a bit more fully. 

</p><p>You can talk about things without reducing them to one-liners 
 right away. And, of course, in today's minuscule comics, if an idea 
 requires any real drawing, the Sunday strip is the only possible 
 place for it. Likewise, any complex storytelling problem-a strip 
 illustrating a long expanse of time, for example, or an event 
 depicted in a succession of very tiny moments-is futile in the 
 daily format. Calvin's fantasies generally migrated to the Sunday 
 page for this reason. 

</p><p>In short, the Sunday page offered unique opportunities, and I 
 deliberately tried to come up with ideas that could take advantage 
 of them. 

</p><p>I usually wrote the Sunday strips separately from the dailies. 
 For the daily strips, I tried to write an entire month's worth of 
 ideas before inking any of them. This allowed a long period for 
 editing and rewriting. I was less able to do this for the Sunday 
 strips because the Sundays need to be drawn weeks further in 
 advance and because the strips took so much longer to draw. If at 
 all possible, however, I would try to keep two or three Sunday 
 ideas ahead of the deadlines. I always wanted to reserve the option 
 of abandoning an idea that didn't stand up to a few weeks of 
 scrutiny. 

</p><p>For those who are interested in technical matters, the early 
 strips were drawn on any cheap pad of Bristol board the local art 
 supply store happened to stock. The paper was usually rather thin 
 and sometimes the sheet wouldn't accept the ink consistently (bad 
 sizing or something), which would make drawing aggravating and time 
 consuming. Eventually I switched to heavier Strathmore Bristol 
 board, which was much nicer. I used a 2H pencil to rough in the 
 drawing, and then inked with a small sable brush and India ink. I 
 did as little pencil work as possible in order to keep the inking 
 more spontaneous, although the more elaborate panels required more 
 preliminary drawing. For lettering, I used a Rapidograph cartridge 
 pen. I drew the dialogue balloons and a few odds and ends with a 
 crow quill pen. To cover up unwanted marks, I used various brands 
 of Wite-Out, and in the early days, typewriter correction fluid. 
 (Remember typewriters?) No doubt this stuff will eat through the 
 paper or turn green in a few years, but as the original cartoons 
 were intended for reproduction, not picture frames and gallery 
 walls, I did not overly concern myself with archival issues or, for 
 that matter, neatness. At some point along the way, however, I did 
 ask the syndicate to send the printers a quality reproduction of 
 the Sunday cartoon, rather than the original drawing, in order to 
 reduce the amount of tape, registration marks, and general 
 crunchings and manglings to which the drawings had previously been 
 subjected. 

</p><p>Coloring the strips was a slow and tedious process. My 
 syndicate gave me a printed sheet showing numbered squares of color, 
 each a mixture of various percentages of red, yellow, and blue. 
 Using this sheet as a guide, I taped some tracing paper over the 
 finished cartoon, and painted watercolor approximations of the 
 available colors in the areas I wanted. This would give me a very 
 rough idea of what the newspaper version might look like. Then I 
 numbered each little spot of color. As the Sunday strips became 
 more visually complex, and as I started to use color more 
 deliberately for effects, this process became a real chore. These 
 days, I believe much of it can be done with a few clicks of a mouse. 

</p><p>Colors take on different characteristics when placed next to 
 other colors (a neutral-seeming gray might look greenish and dark 
 next to one color, but brownish and pale in relation to another). 
 Because of this, I came up with one little trick for coloring the 
 strip. I cut out each of the color squares provided by the printer, 
 so I had a stack of colors (like paint chips), rather than a sheet. 
 By laying out the cut squares and physically placing one color next 
 to the others I expected to use, I could see exactly how each color 
 behaved in that particular context. As I got better at this, I was 
 able to choose approprial "palettes" for each strip, and create 
 moods with color. One strip might call for contrasting, bright 
 colors; another strip might be done with a limited group of soft, 
 warm colors; another idea might call for a close range of grays and 
 darks, and so on. If I made Calvin's skin a dull pink-gray to 
 suggest dim lighting at night, I would have to find a dull 
 yellow-gray that would suggest his hair in the same light. These 
 challenges took an inordinate amount of time for work on deadline, 
 but I was often quite proud of the results. A comic strip should 
 always be fun to look at, and good use of color can contribute to 
 that appeal More than that, color creates its own emotional impact, 
 which can make the drawing more expressive. 

</p><p>The half-page Sunday format required certain guaranteed panel 
 divisions. The strip had to be drawn in three rows of equal height, 
 and there was one unmovable panel division within each row. This 
 allowed editors to reduce and reconfigure the strip to suit their 
 particular space needs. The same strip could run in several shapes 
 by restacking the panels. 

</p><p>Editors commonly removed the entire top row altogether, so in 
 essence, a third of the strip had to be wasted on "throwaway 
 panels" that many readers would never see. The fixed panel divisions 
 were also annoying because they limited my ability to compose the 
 strip to best suit the idea. For example, they often forced a small 
 panel where I needed more space for words. 

</p><p>Of course, a big part of cartooning is learning to work 
 effectively within tight space constraints. Much of cartooning's 
 power comes from its ability to do more with less: when the 
 drawings and ideas are distilled to their essences, the result can 
 be more beautiful and powerful for having eliminated the clutter. 
 That said, there is a point at which simplification thwarts good 
 storytelling. You can't condense Moby Dick into a paragraph and get 
 the same effect. Over the years, my frustration increased and I 
 became convinced that I could draw a better comic strip than the 
 current newspaper format was permitting. Looking at examples of 
 comics from the 1930s, when a Sunday strip could fill an entire 
 page, I was amazed by the long-forgotten possibilities out there. 

</p><p>I took a sabbatical after resolving a long and emotionally 
 draining fight to prevent <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> from being 
 merchandised. Looking for a way to rekindle my enthusiasm for the 
 duration of a new contract term, I proposed a redesigned Sunday 
 format that would permit more panel flexibility. To my surprise and 
 delight, Universal responded with an offer to market the strip as 
 an unbreakable half page (more space than I'd dared to ask for), 
 despite the expected resistance of editors. 

</p><p>To this day, my syndicate assures me that some editors liked the 
 new format, appreciated the difference, and were happy to run the 
 larger strip, but I think it's fair to say that this was not the 
 most common reaction. The syndicate had warned me to prepare for 
 numerous cancellations of the Sunday feature, but after a few weeks 
 of dealing with howling, purple-faced editors, the syndicate 
 suggested that papers could reduce the strip to the size tabloid 
 newspapers used for their smaller sheets of paper. Another strip 
 could then run vertically down the side. Consequently, while some 
 papers, primarily in larger markets, ran the strip as a half page, 
 other papers reduced it. In some of the latter papers (including 
 the one I read at the time), I actually lost ground: the new Sunday 
 strip was printed even smaller than before. I was in no mood to 
 take on new fights, so I focused on the bright side: I had complete 
 freedom of design and there were virtually no cancellations. 

</p><p>For all the yelling and screaming by outraged editors, I remain 
 convinced that the larger Sunday strip gave newspapers a better 
 product and made the comics section more fun for readers. Comics 
 are a visual medium. A strip with a lot of drawing can be exciting 
 and add some variety. Proud as I am that I was able to draw a 
 larger strip, I don't expect to see it happen again any time soon. 
 In the newspaper business, space is money, and I suspect most 
 editors would still say that the difference is not worth the cost. 
 Sadly, the situation is a vicious circle: because there's no room 
 for better artwork, the comics are simply drawn; because they're 
 simply drawn, why should they have more room? 

</p><p>Business controversies aside, the new format opened up new ways 
 to tell stories, and I drew different kinds of strips as a result. 
 I could write and draw the strip exactly as I imagined it, so it 
 truly challenged my abilities. Whereas Sunday strips had previously 
 taken me a full day to draw and color, a complex strip would now 
 take me well into a second day to finish. Deadlines discourage this 
 kind of indulgence, and I had to steal that extra time from what 
 would have been some semblance of an ordinary life, but I was 
 thrilled to expand the strip's world. 

</p><p>Laying out the panels became a job in itself, now that I was no 
 longer confined to horizontal rows. could place boxes anywhere and 
 any size, but the reader's eye needs to flow naturally to the 
 proper panels without confusion, and big panels need to be designed 
 in such a way that they don't divert attention and spoil surprises. 
 The graphic needs of each panel must be accommodated and the panels 
 themselves should form a pleasing arrangement so the entire page is 
 attractive, balanced, and unified as well. Here again I looked for 
 guidance in the gorgeous Sunday pages of George Herriman's <i>Krazy Kat.</i>
 
</p><p>The new Sunday format necessitated a change in the format of my 
 book collections as well. Having won a bigger strip in newspapers, 
 I wanted the book reproductions to reflect the strip's new impact 
 as much as possible by printing the Sunday strips large. This 
 resulted in the rather awkward horizontal format of my later books. 
 They stick out of bookshelves, but the strips look nice. From this 
 point on, the Sunday strips were reproduced in color with each 
 collection, not just in the "treasury" collections, as before. 
 (Here's a piece of trivia: because of the timing of the book format 
 change, the cartoons from the <i>Snow Goons</i> collection were 
 never put in a treasury book, so those Sunday strips have been 
 reprinted only in black-and-white.)
 
</p><p>Ten years after starting <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, I ended the 
 strip. As much as I knew I'd miss the characters, the decision was 
 long anticipated on my part. Professionally, I had accomplished far 
 more than I'd ever set out to do and there were no more mountains I 
 wanted to climb. Creatively, my interests were shifting away from 
 cartooning toward painting, where I could develop my drawing skills 
 further. And personally, I wanted to restore some balance to my 
 life. I had given the strip all my time and energy for a decade 
 (and was happy to do so), but now I was that much older and I 
 wanted to work at a more thoughtful pace, out of the limelight, and 
 without the pressures and restrictions of newspapers. 

</p><p>The final Calvin and Hobbes strip was a Sunday strip. The 
 deadline for Sunday strips being early, I drew it well before 
 writing the daily strips that would eventually precede it in the 
 newspaper. I very much wanted to hit the right note for this final 
 strip. I think it worked, but it was a bittersweet strip to draw. 

</p><p>Since <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, I've been teaching myself how to 
 paint, and trying to learn something about music. I have no 
 background in either subject, and there are certainly days when I 
 wonder what made me trade proficiency and understanding in one 
 field for clumsiness and ignorance in these others. On better 
 days, I enjoy having so many new challenges and surprises. Even so, 
 these new endeavors have only deepened my appreciation for comics. 
 I no longer take quite so much for granted the versatility of 
 comics and their ability to depict complex ideas in a beautiful, 
 accessible, and entertaining form. For all their seeming simplicity, 
 the expressive possibilities of comics rival those of any other art 
 form. Five years after <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, I love the comics 
 as much as ever.
