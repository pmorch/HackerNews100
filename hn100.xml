<p>If that's not enough to deter you from sharing voice recordings with Amazon, note that the company allowed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/amazon-admits-that-employees-review-small-sample-of-alexa-audio/">employees to listen to Alexa voice recordings.</a> In 2019, Bloomberg reported that Amazon employees listened to as many as 1,000 audio samples during their nine-hour shifts. Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230">says</a> it allows employees to listen to Alexa voice recordings to train its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems.</p>
<p>Other reasons why people may be hesitant to trust Amazon with personal voice samples include the previous usage of Alexa voice recordings <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/amazon-must-give-up-echo-recordings-in-double-murder-case-judge-rules/">in criminal trials </a>and Amazon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/ftc-amazon-ring-workers-illegally-spied-on-users-of-home-security-cameras/">paying a settlement</a> in 2023 in relation to allegations that it allowed "thousands of employees and contractors to watch video recordings of customers' private spaces" taken from Ring cameras, per the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<h2>Save recordings or lose functionality</h2>
<p>Likely looking to get ahead of these concerns, Amazon said in its email today that by default, it will delete recordings of users’ Alexa requests after processing. However, anyone with their Echo device set to “Don’t save recordings” will see their already-purchased devices’ Voice ID feature bricked. Voice ID <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYCXKY2AB2QWZT2X">enables Alexa</a> to do things like share user-specified calendar events, reminders, music, and more. Previously, Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230">has said</a> that "if you choose not to save any voice recordings, Voice ID may not work." As of March 28, broken Voice ID is a guarantee for people who don't let Amazon store their voice recordings.</p>
<p>Amazon's email says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alexa voice requests are always encrypted in transit to Amazon’s secure cloud, which was designed with layers of security protections to keep customer information safe. Customers can continue to choose from a robust set of controls by visiting the Alexa Privacy dashboard online or navigating to More &gt; Alexa Privacy in the Alexa app.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazon is forcing Echo users to make a couple of tough decisions: Grant Amazon access to recordings of everything you say to Alexa or stop using an Echo; let Amazon save voice recordings and have employees listen to them or lose a feature set to become more advanced and central to the next generation of Alexa.</p>
<p>However, Amazon is betting big that Alexa+ can dig the voice assistant out of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/alexa-had-no-profit-timeline-cost-amazon-25-billion-in-4-years/">financial pit</a>. Amazon has publicly committed to keeping the free version of Alexa around, but Alexa+ is viewed as Amazon's last hope for keeping Alexa alive and making it profitable. Anything Amazon can do to get people to pay for Alexa takes precedence over other Alexa user demands, including, it seems, privacy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Citibank revealed in court filings on Wednesday that the FBI, the EPA, the EPA inspector general, and the Treasury Department have all requested that the bank freeze accounts of several nonprofits and state government agencies.</p>

<p>The accounts were frozen in February, but the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25559919-citibank-ggrf-funds-lawsuit-filing-3-12-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new documents</a> make public details that had previously been unknown, including a full list of the nonprofits under FBI scrutiny.</p>







<p>The funds were disbursed as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, a law <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/16/winners-losers-abound-as-inflation-reduction-act-becomes-law/">passed by Congress in 2022</a>. Of that, the EPA received <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/us-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/">$14 billion for a National Clean Investment Fund</a>, which provides grants to green banks.</p>

<p>Green banks use those funds to provide financing for clean technology projects around the country. Startups that have technologies that are ready to scale commercially were eligible to receive financing to make projects a reality.</p>

<p>The funding was mostly to be used for loans, which were to be paid back and recycled for future lending. Green banks tend to have delinquency rates on par with commercial and residential portfolios held by other commercial lenders.</p>

<p>Citibank was selected as the financial agent to administer that money, holding it in accounts under the names of the awardees. It is also administering a separate, $6 billion Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program. The EPA’s contract with Citibank was publicly announced in April 2024.</p>

<p>The FBI has requested that Citibank place 30-day administrative freezes on accounts held by nonprofits that were recipients of the green bank funding. It also asked the bank to freeze other nonprofit and state government agency accounts, including Habitat for Humanity, United Way, the Colorado Clean Energy Fund, and New York State Department of Taxation and Finance.</p>


<p>Three nonprofits that received green bank funds have sued Citibank, asking the bank to release the money in their accounts.</p>

<p>EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has said that the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund doesn’t align with the agency’s priorities and that he has concerns about fraud, though he has not provided evidence to support that claim.</p>

<p>In a hearing on Wednesday, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia questioned a Justice Department attorney representing the EPA.</p>







<p>“Can you proffer any evidence that [the grant] was illegal, or evidence of abuse or fraud or bribery — that any of that was improperly or unlawfully done, other than the fact that Mr. Zeldin doesn’t like it?” Judge Tanya Chutkan <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/12/judge-epa-climate-grant-cancellations-00227643">said</a>.</p>

<p>Judge Chutkan also ordered the Justice Department to provide the court with details about the alleged fraud, “because I don’t have the credible evidence that’s required.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<time>2025-03-14</time>
<address>by David Jones</address>
<p>Here is a font i am working on; i hope you like it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/010stork.png"></p>
<p>The letterforms are reversed out against a vertically striped background.
In a manner similar to <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/32260/schaefer-versalien">Schaeffer
Versalien</a>.
The graphic effect is inspired-by/stolen-from Schaefer Versalien, but
the letterforms are modified from my found stencil font
<a href="https://drj11.itch.io/arugula-font">Arugula</a>.</p>
<p>Bear in the mind that with a font like this, the parts that are drawn
are the black parts.</p>
<p>So, let's consider a word like SALTY:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/020salty.png"></p>
<p>Looks okay? Perhaps you think is fine and there is nothing to comment on.</p>
<p>What about the kerning, in this case between <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong>?
In the good old days of metal type the only kerns were when <code>/f</code> projected
outside the edge of its body.
This would not have been kerned and we were ok with that
(larger wooden type may have been kerned with a saw or a file, but
in this design, the cuts would have to be made to line up the stripes
exactly; tricky business).</p>
<p>Here’s what this particular example looks like without kerning:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/030saltynokern.png"></p>
<p>I’m not going to go back and forth over the merits of kerning,
i‘m here for the nerdy technical details.</p>
<p>In most, normal, fonts kerning is done with position rules (GPOS lookups);
that doesn’t work here, because if we reposition <strong>T</strong> to
be slightly further left, we get something like this disaster:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/040saltybad.png"></p>
<p>It looks a bit like <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong> have been clipped, but in fact
they’ve been drawn over. Black parts of <strong>L</strong> overlap
the <strong>T</strong>, and vice versa: black parts of the
<strong>T</strong> overlap <strong>L</strong>.
The effect is what you can see, where <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong> share a space,
the black bars overlap and are solid, obliterating the reversed out
letterforms.</p>
<p>So how do i kern this font, if not with GSPOS lookups?</p>
<p>With GSUB lookups! GSUB (for substitution) lookups substitute
one sequence of glyphs for another.
The details can get quite complicated, but the way i use them here
is relatively simple.</p>
<p>I split <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong> into two pieces each, and recombine
the middle two pieces into the drawing of the kerned part.</p>
<p>I’ll illustrate the steps. With glyphs that have been articifically spaced out,
so that you can see each individual glyph.</p>
<p><strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong> as individual glyphs</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/050LTspace.png"></p>
<p>Each of <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong> is split into two pieces. So we get 4 glyphs:
<code>/L.left</code> <code>/L.right</code> <code>/T.left</code> <code>T.right</code>.
This is done with GSUB lookup rule like <code>sub L by L.left L.right ;</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/060split.png"></p>
<p>The two middle pieces, <code>/L.right</code> and <code>T.left</code>, get replaced with
what i call a <em>joiner</em> the kerned piece in the middle shared by
both <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong>.</p>
<p>Here the GSUB rules look like <code>sub L.right T.left by L_T.joiner ;</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/070joined.png"></p>
<p>That’s actually it. The next image is just the previous one without
the extra spacing, and is how it would actually appear.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/080LTcomplete.png"></p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The pattern of vertical stripes means that kerns can only be a multiple
of the stripe repeat (not quite true, and i have sketched out more
general versions of this, but it <em>is</em> true for this font).</p>
<p>The gaps in the pattern help avoid solid black-to-black joins, which
might work when everything is a vector, but tend to leave sub-1-pixel
gaps when rasterised.
The gaps are also why a glyph isn’t split down the middle to
make the <code>.left</code> and <code>.right</code> parts.
That would leave a sub-1-pixel gap when rejoining.
Better to split at a gap.</p>
<p>The glyph names, used in the rules above, don’t matter at that level,
but i suspect affect the PDF; in particular cutting-and-pasting
from PDF, so there might be some tweaking of names.</p>
<p>For each letter (glyph) that participates in kerning, there
are two more glyphs for its <code>.left</code> and <code>.right</code> parts.
And...</p>
<p>For each <em>kerned pair</em> there is a glyph for its joiner, because
each one is unique.
Those are going to mount up quickly, which suggests kerning
only when strictly necessary.</p>
<p>None of the splits and joiners are drawn by hand, and
none of the GSUB rules are made by hand.
In both cases it is a <em>Small Matter of Programming</em>,
also known as Custom Python Scripts.
The libraries <a href="https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools">fontTools</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/simoncozens/fontFeatures">fontFeatures</a> were <em>invaluable</em> in this.</p>
<p>This font is not yet complete, but right now it is a real font and
really does work like this.
I've only kerned <strong>L</strong>, so there’s a few more kerns to do.
And right now is has a very basic alphabet, just A to Z;
i will draw some more letters and a few more decorative items, but
i plan for it to have a fairly small repertoire, partly because the
kerning and the vertical stripe design add to the constraints.</p>
<p>And if you thought kerning was problematic (and hopefully now you do),
consider how accents and other diacritics are going to work. ;)</p>

<p>In recent months I’ve assembled a <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/24/how-many-hydrogen-transit-trial-failures-are-enough/">long, long list of hydrogen bus trials</a> that ended up with the transit agencies realizing what should have been obvious before they started: hydrogen buses are a lot more expensive and battery electric buses are much cheaper and more reliable. More come out of the woodwork regularly, for example <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/11/the-hydrogen-bus-illusion-essen-mulheims-costly-reality/">Essen and Munheim in Germany</a>, stuck with 19 buses that they have to drive a long way to refuel at great overall expense, something I wrote about this week.</p>
<p>The head of <em>CleanTechnica</em>, Zach Shahan, was stunned by this as he was finalizing the story for publication, <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/12/why-hydrogen-electric-bus-programs-totally-confuse-me/">asking</a>:</p>
<p><em>How is the hydrogen bus market not completely dead by now?</em></p>
<p>Having had the discussion with multiple transit professionals now, I can tell you what I consider the reasons.</p>
<p>First, transit agencies excel at keeping buses moving and commuters satisfied, mastering logistics through decades of practical experience. They are extraordinarily good at moving their passengers reliably day after day, month after month, and year after year on low budgets. Yet, when it comes to evaluating novel claims — especially around emerging technologies — they can be surprisingly vulnerable.</p>
<p>As Daniel Kahneman highlights in <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, decision-makers often default to intuitive judgments (System 1 thinking), which can leave them susceptible to accepting persuasive narratives without adequate critical scrutiny. Agencies typically lack deep internal expertise on technical innovation or energy alternatives. Without robust analytical capabilities, they become reliant on compelling yet potentially misleading stories.</p>
<p>Next, transit agencies pay meticulous attention to day-to-day details — like the repeatedly vandalized bus stop on route 47 — but rarely pause to reconsider the bigger picture. Their thinking, shaped by decades of routine, reflects the intuitive, narrow focus of Kahneman’s “System 1.”</p>
<p>The last significant shift most agencies faced was replacing trolley buses with diesel models decades ago — a transition largely driven by persuasive suppliers, not rigorous analysis. Since then, their attention has stayed fixed on immediate, local issues rather than broader strategic choices.</p>
<p>Transit agencies suffer from what Kahneman calls “what you see is all there is” (WYSIATI): they’re deeply aware of familiar, visible problems — like the route 47 bus stop — but don’t know what’s happening in the next town’s transit agency, never mind China. To future-proof transit, agencies need to look beyond familiar horizons and question comfortable assumptions, moving past intuition and local crises toward evidence-driven, strategic thinking.</p>
<p>Then transit agencies are often told a compelling but deeply misleading story: hydrogen buses are a simple drop-in replacement. Just swap the vehicle, change the fuel, and everything else magically stays the same.&nbsp;It’s a seductive idea. Agencies, already focused heavily on daily operational challenges, rarely probe beneath the surface. The promise of easy solutions taps into their intuitive desire for minimal disruption, bypassing critical analysis and masking significant technical and logistical realities.</p>
<p>Without deeper scrutiny, agencies risk investing in a solution that seems frictionless but, in reality, demands costly and complex infrastructure changes. Understanding this cognitive bias can help transit leaders resist appealing oversimplifications and pursue genuinely effective, evidence-based solutions.</p>
<p>Then there is the reality of range. Hydrogen fuel-cell buses often promise impressive 1,000 km ranges, appealing directly to transit managers who feel pressured to decarbonize their longest routes immediately. Yet most urban transit routes don’t require that kind of extreme range. While some available battery-electric buses offer limited ranges (200–300 km), many already comfortably serve average daily needs. Today’s battery buses routinely deliver 300–400 km, with leading-edge models like Solaris and BYD already exceeding 500 km — more than sufficient for the vast majority of urban routes.</p>
<p>Back to WYSIATI. Transit operators see the gap between the longest route and current battery ranges and conclude they must immediately adopt hydrogen buses. They overlook the steady, rapid progress in battery range and falling costs, which will close this gap entirely within just a few years. A smarter approach would involve electrifying average routes first, capitalizing on battery technology today, and phasing in longer-range electric buses as technology inevitably improves.</p>
<p>Then there’s winter range. Transit managers accustomed to diesel buses rarely think about winter heating. Diesel buses effortlessly heat passengers and drivers with abundant waste heat from their inefficient engines — free warmth, no extra cost, no fuss. Fuel cell buses do produce sufficient waste heat, but here’s the problem: it’s exceptionally expensive heat. Every degree of warmth comes from hydrogen — a fuel that’s costly to produce, store, and transport. Unlike diesel, heating with hydrogen’s waste heat is technically easy but economically painful.</p>
<p>Battery-electric buses face a different challenge. The ones with limited range see further range issues further as batteries power heating directly, cutting operational mileage precisely when range is already tightest — in winter. That makes today’s battery buses less forgiving during cold snaps.</p>
<p>Traditional bus makers mostly aren’t insulating their buses more and investing in heat pumps, so they are again inefficient. As I noted recently, Harbin in northern China, which has a two-month ice city festival which is an international attraction, gets by just fine with electric buses that are <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/12/22/heat-pumps-for-electric-buses-blow-another-meme-out-of-water/">insulated, have heat pumps, and have radiative electric heaters</a> in with the passengers.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a double-edged sword, because fuel cell and diesel buses have to power air conditioning in the summer with range hits as well, and both lose range in winter too, just less impactfully. This isn’t all a one-way bus route. But once again, long range buses exist, more will arrive, and they’ll get cheaper. All bus companies, not just BYD and Yutong, will figure out insulation and heat pumps.</p>
<p>To be clear, there have been some notable failures among electric bus manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic, which hydrogen lobbyists have been quick to amplify.</p>
<p>In North America, Proterra’s bankruptcy left several transit agencies wary of battery-electric buses — though, perhaps their skepticism should have focused on the risks of purchasing critical fleet infrastructure from startups.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Europe, Keolis Nederland faced substantial reliability issues with 250 BYD electric buses delivered in late 2020. Quality concerns and frequent breakdowns caused operational disruptions, again giving hydrogen proponents ammunition to cast doubt on battery-electric solutions. Lots of work was done by Keolis and BYD to resolve them, BYD stood behind its contract, and compensation to Keolis was agreed to, with the amount undisclosed. The fixes and BYD standing behind its products don’t get reported, but the initial problem does.</p>
<p>This was also a relatively isolated issue for BYD. In 2013, Schiermonnikoog introduced six BYD electric buses, marking one of Europe’s early adoptions of such technology. An independent survey in 2014 rated this fleet as the best in the Netherlands, highlighting passenger satisfaction with low noise levels, ease of boarding, and overall comfort. ​In 2015, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport incorporated 35 BYD K9 electric buses for passenger transfers between terminals and gates. There have been no significant reports of operational problems with this fleet. But transit teams and hydrogen lobbyists don’t talk about all the successes with battery electric and its dominance in markets globally, they talk about the relatively rare problems.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2025/02/24/hydrogen-electrolysis-cost-projections-from-major-organizations-low-by-60-to-300/">transit agencies have been consistently misled by credible organizations</a> — such as the IEA, IRENA, BloombergNEF, the Hydrogen Council, and CSIRO — which have repeatedly understated the real-world costs of hydrogen electrolyzers and green hydrogen itself.</p>
<p>These optimistic projections began around 2020, promising a future of cheap hydrogen, but they’ve been repeatedly revised upward each year. Despite these corrections, even the latest figures from these reputable organizations still significantly underestimate actual project costs. Transit agencies, relying on these authoritative but flawed analyses, were led to believe hydrogen buses would soon be economically competitive with battery-electric alternatives.</p>
<p>Research by Visa Siekkinen and Andrew Fletcher shows that real electrolyzer projects consistently cost significantly more than forecasts from respected groups. Fletcher highlights that current real-world system costs average around $3,000 per kW, nearly double CSIRO’s projections. The consistent underestimation stems from ignoring balance-of-plant expenses, infrastructure requirements, and overly aggressive assumptions on learning-curve-driven cost declines.</p>
<p>Transit agencies have fallen victim to anchoring, a cognitive bias described in <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>. Anchored to early, overly optimistic hydrogen cost projections from seemingly credible sources, these agencies made procurement decisions based on unrealistic expectations. Hydrogen lobbyists reinforced this bias by continually referencing these low estimates, effectively preventing agencies from adjusting their expectations upward, despite clear evidence that real-world costs are far higher. This anchoring has resulted in wasted resources and delayed transitions to proven, more cost-effective solutions like battery-electric buses.</p>
<p>Organizations like BloombergNEF have started admitting previous projections were far too optimistic — recently tripling its 2050 hydrogen cost estimates — but even these updated numbers remain unrealistically low. The result? Transit managers continue chasing the mirage of cheap hydrogen buses, misallocating investments instead of moving forward with demonstrably cheaper, proven electric alternatives.</p>
<p>We urgently need these major forecasting institutions to openly acknowledge their errors, recalibrate forecasts based on actual data, and transparently communicate realistic costs. Otherwise, transit agencies and policymakers will remain trapped in decisions driven by wishful thinking and cognitive biases rather than rigorous economic analysis.</p>
<p>Of course, in Canada there’s another problem, which is that the transit “think” tank which is supposed to look around the world at leading practices, is supposed to be analytical, is supposed to be good at transformation and is supposed to avoid bias, the Canadian Urban Transit Research and Innovation Consortium (CUTRIC), is <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/11/19/canadian-transit-think-tank-cutric-riddled-with-conflicts-of-interest/">riddled with conflicts of interest and bias toward hydrogen</a>.</p>
<p>So, the answer to Zach’s question is that transit agencies repeatedly stumble into the same trap due to overlapping cognitive and institutional blind spots. Anchored to early, overly optimistic hydrogen cost projections from trusted but flawed organizations, they fail to adjust expectations as real-world costs become clear. Their operational focus on day-to-day logistics creates tunnel vision — WYSIATI — leaving them vulnerable to persuasive lobbying narratives promising easy drop-in replacements. Simultaneously, their lack of in-house expertise and analytical rigor leads them to trust reassuring external sources rather than questioning overly optimistic claims.</p>
<p>These reinforcing factors — anchoring, limited analytical depth, and susceptibility to appealing narratives — lock agencies into repeating costly mistakes instead of pivoting rapidly toward genuinely effective electrification strategies.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences. We provide the code, along with the model weights and blog post on the project page: <a href="https://m-arriola.com/bd3lms/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>

<li><strong>Metadata surveillance.</strong> Briar uses the Tor network to prevent
eavesdroppers from learning which users are talking to each other.
Each user’s contact list is encrypted and stored on her own device.</li>
<li><strong>Content surveillance.</strong> All communication between devices is
encrypted end-to-end, protecting the content from eavesdropping
or tampering.</li>
<li><strong>Content filtering.</strong> Briar’s end-to-end encryption prevents
keyword filtering, and because of its decentralized design there are
no servers to block.</li>
<li><strong>Takedown orders.</strong> Every user who subscribes to a forum keeps a
copy of its content, so there’s no single point where a post can
be deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Denial of service attacks.</strong> Briar’s forums have no central server
to attack, and every subscriber has access to the content even if
they’re offline.</li>
<li><strong>Internet blackouts.</strong> Briar can operate over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
to keep information flowing during blackouts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Briar is designed to resist surveillance and censorship by an adversary
with the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>All long-range communication channels (internet, phone network, etc)
are comprehensively monitored by the adversary.</li>
<li>The adversary can block, delay, replay and modify traffic on
long-range communication channels.</li>
<li>The adversary has a limited ability to monitor short-range
communication channels (Bluetooth, WiFi, etc).</li>
<li>The adversary has a limited ability to block, delay, replay and
modify traffic on short-range communication channels.</li>
<li>The adversary can deploy an unlimited number of devices
running Briar.</li>
<li>There are some users who can keep their devices secure - those who
can’t are considered, for the purposes of the threat model, to be
controlled by the adversary.</li>
<li>The adversary has a limited ability to persuade users to trust the
adversary’s agents - thus the number of social connections between
the adversary’s agents and the rest of the network is limited.</li>
<li>The adversary can’t break standard cryptographic primitives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our long-term plans go far beyond messaging: we’ll use Briar’s data
synchronization capabilities to support secure, distributed applications
including crisis mapping and collaborative document editing. Our goal is
to enable people in any country to create safe spaces where they can
debate any topic, plan events, and organise social movements.</p>

<p>I was recently interviewed for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/style/silicon-valley-stoics.html">piece in the Times</a> on why the philosophy of stoicism has become very popular in the Silicon Valley tech crowd. Only a sliver of my thoughts made it into the article, but the question from <a href="https://twitter.com/nelliebowles">Nellie Bowles</a> was very stimulating so I wanted to share more of my thoughts.</p>
<p>To begin with, like any ancient philosophy, stoicism has a physics and metaphysics–how it thinks the universe works–and separately an ethics–how it advises one to live, and judge good and bad action. The ethics is based on the physics and metaphysics, but can be divorced from it, and the ethics has long been far more popular than the metaphysics.&nbsp; This is a big part of why stoic texts surviving from antiquity focus on the ethics; people transcribing manuscripts cared more about these than about the others.&nbsp; And this is why thinkers from <span>Cicero</span> to Petrarch to today have celebrated stoicism’s moral and ethical advice while following utterly different cosmologies and metaphysicses.&nbsp; (For serious engagement with stoic ontology &amp; metaphysics you want Spinoza.)&nbsp; The current fad for stoicism, like all past fads for stoicism (except Spinoza) focuses on the ethics.</p>

Think of the pixels on a screen: what seem to be objects moving are in fact different parts of the screen changing color (i.e. changing&nbsp;<em>quality</em>) in sequence, creating the illusion of motion whereas in fact there is only variation in the surface of an object.&nbsp; (This is the stoic solution to Zeno’s paradoxes of motion <a href="https://www.exurbe.com/sketches-of-a-history-of-skepticism-part-i-classical-eudaimonia/">discussed here</a>). The stoic living universe is thus somewhat like the skin of a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=670116563163326">mimic octopus</a>, able to seem to be become a myriad different things while it remains one.&nbsp; And in addition to blueness, and whiteness, and opacity, and warmth, other attributes the universe manifests more in some places than others include what we would call in modern terms sentience, self-awareness, and reason–thus the human being is a spot of sentience against a background of less sentient substance, like a white spot on blue. But, the stoics argue, any property which is possessed by the part is possessed by the whole, so while sentience and reason are concentrated in the spots which are living humans, the whole thing is a vast, intelligent, rational whole, and when we die we merge back into it. Thus there is no individual immortality, but we are all part of something greater which is eternal, wise, and infinite.</p>
<p>Stoicism was likely influenced by Buddhism through contact with India during the wars of Alexander the Great, and shares a lot with Buddhism: the whole universe is one vast, living, divine whole.&nbsp; Life is full of suffering, but that suffering is a path to understanding a larger good.&nbsp; And there is a universal justice on the large scale beyond what a human from our limited P.O.V. can understand.&nbsp; In Buddhism this is karma, while for the stoics it is Providence, the same concept of Providence that Christianity later borrowed, which argues that everything in the world which seems bad is actually good in a way we cannot fully understand because of our limited perspective. It is as if we are a fingertip; we cannot understand why we must suffer the evil of being repeatedly banged against a hard, unyielding surface, because we don’t have the means to understand that the larger organism is typing up a blog post about stoicism, but if we did have the means to understand we would recognize that it’s worth-it on the large scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;The stoic justification for claiming the universe is perfect is the patterns we see in nature: trees have roots to drink the water they need, woodpeckers that eat bugs have beaks the shape they need to be, woodland animals have woodland camouflage, desert animals have desert camouflage, everything fits together in a vast, functional whole which (without Darwin to offer an alternative) the Greeks agreed implied intelligence, either in a creator (Aristotle’s demiurge), a source (Plato’s Good), or, for the stoics, the universe itself.</p>

<p>The stoics also argued (followed by some Christian thinkers) that there is no self-determination.&nbsp; We will all end up going where the Plan will have us go no matter what, but the one thing we do have power over is our own <em>inner&nbsp;</em>responses to the path fate gives us: do we curse, complain, fight, shake our fists at the heavens, or do we ascent, accept, relax, and gaze in happy awe on the vastness of which we are a part?&nbsp; A classic stoic image (and after this I’ll turn to ethics and the tech crowd) is that the human being is like a dog tied behind a cart.&nbsp; The cart is going somewhere, and there is absolutely nothing the dog can do to change the course the cart will take.&nbsp; The dog has freewill only in one thing: the dog can fight, snarl, tug at the collar, gnaw on the rope, dig its claws into the dirt until it bleeds, and exhaust itself with fighting, or it can trot along contentedly and trust the driver.</p>
</div>
<h3>An Action Ethics</h3>
<p>The majority of surviving stoic writings focus, not on the metaphysics, but on the actionable conclusion: given all this, how do we teach ourselves to assent?&nbsp; To become the contented dog who trusts in Providence enough to follow where our paths lead without being made miserable by anxiety, fear, and resistance?&nbsp; Stoics therefore teach self-mastery and detachment: you can’t keep terrible things from happening but you can control your own internal reaction to them and work on preventing yourself from being overwhelmed by them.&nbsp; You wake up to some terrible news in the morning: do you brood on it all day and lose your productivity and wellbeing? Or do you take control and carry on?</p>

<div>
<p>A lot of the surviving stoic writings are maxims, short pieces for contemplation designed to help you dwell less on bad things that are happening, sometimes more imagery than argument.&nbsp; Imagine–for example–that life is like being a guest at a banquet.&nbsp; Platters are being passed around and people are reaching out and taking what is offered them.&nbsp; Some platters come to you and you take of them–other platters never make it to you, or are empty when they do.&nbsp; But you are a guest, these things were not yours, they were offered as gifts, so you have no reason to be angry that you can only taste some of them–better to enjoy the platters that do reach you, and remember that the host who offered them is kind.</p>
<p>This is where stoicism serves very much like a self-help book, or more generally as philosophical therapy, which is what classical philosophies largely aimed to provide.&nbsp; Stoicism’s recommendations for how to resist pain are exquisite, as in this example from the Meditations. And the metaphysics crops up mainly as a way to justify the advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>XXV. What a small portion of vast and infinite eternity it is, that is allowed unto every one of us, and how soon it vanisheth into the general age of the world: of the common substance, and of the common soul also what a small portion is allotted unto us: and in what a little clod of the whole earth (as it were) it is that thou doest crawl. After thou shalt rightly have considered these things with thyself; fancy not anything else in the world any more to be of any weight and moment but this, to do that only which thine own nature doth require; and to conform thyself to that which the common nature doth afford.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ontology here serves the therapy.&nbsp; You lost the election?&nbsp; Got passed over for promotion?&nbsp; Got a bad review?&nbsp; These things are small and fleeting within the larger whole, all wealth will perish in infinity, all fame fade, nothing serious was really lost.&nbsp; You lost your arm to disease?&nbsp; It was not yours to begin with, it was leant to you be a kind universe which has a right to take it back again.&nbsp; You lost your best friend?&nbsp; Again, this was a brief good thing the universe leant you, don’t dwell on it, look instead to the other good things that still surround you.&nbsp; Goods are real, evils an illusion, and if you can believe that it becomes easier–the stoics promise–to let go.&nbsp; The approach works, sometimes.&nbsp; Scientific studies tell us that pain is more emotionally terrible when we know/believe it’s actually damaging us, i.e. that the same number of nerves firing off is more upsetting when than when we believe it’s permanently damaging a body part than when we know it’s hot wax or an electroshock and the effects won’t be lingering.&nbsp; So if you can actually convince yourself that nothing really important has been destroyed when something affects your fame, or fortune, it does hurt less.&nbsp; And millions of people over thousands of years have found stoicism a comfort on life’s tumultuous sea.</p>

<p>At this point I want to remind the reader that I personally&nbsp;<em>love&nbsp;</em>stoicism.&nbsp; It’s gorgeous.&nbsp; It’s brilliant.&nbsp; Revisiting it I find it always challenges assumptions, pushes me to hold myself to high standards, gives me new ideas to chew on.&nbsp; Its major texts, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, are ones I love to teach, love to revisit, love to grapple with again and again.&nbsp; I will continue to praise, and teach, and write about, and read, and make use of stoicism all the days of my life.&nbsp; But…</p>
<p>The new popularity of stoicism among the tech crowd, and also on Wall Street which is another place that’s been reading and naming things after stoics recently, is strikingly similar to stoicism’s popularity among the powerful elites of ancient Rome.&nbsp; In Hellenistic Greece, stoicism had been one of several different popular philosophical schools, along with Platnonism, skepticism, Pythagoreanism, cynicism, Aristotelianism, Hedonism etc.&nbsp; (Quick tip: names of philosophical systems are generally capitalized when named after people, not capitalized when named after other stuff, as in cynicism from <em>cynos</em>, dog; stoicism from <em>stoa</em>, porch, where the first stoics held their classes.)&nbsp; And like the rest of these ancient schools, stoicism focused on <em>eudaimonia</em>, i.e. happiness or the good life, the idea that the purpose of philosophical study was not primarily to understand everything, or to achieve power through knowledge, but to achieve personal happiness, usually through inner tranquility and armoring the soul against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune (<a href="https://www.exurbe.com/sketches-of-a-history-of-skepticism-part-i-classical-eudaimonia/">see my essay on eudaimonia for more</a>.)&nbsp; Stoicism was one of a number of methods to attempt this, so like all ancient schools it fulfilled the roles of a self-help book and Science 101 textbook rolled into one.</p>

<p>But in Rome stoicism surged in popularity compared to all the other systems, because it was the one Greek ethics which worked well for the rich and powerful.&nbsp; Other schools like Platonism, cynicism, and Epicureanism warned followers that participation in politics and the pursuit of wealth, power, or honor would only lead to stress and risk, and were incompatible with happiness.&nbsp; Epicurus said the happy life was found by leaving the political urban world to sit in a secluded garden, eating a simple meal while conversing with good friends. Cynicism advocated the more extreme step of renouncing personal property and living like a stray dog scrounging beside the road, which has no fear of being robbed or losing its status because it has nothing to lose.&nbsp; The Pythagoreans and many other sects lived in isolated communities not unlike monastic orders, and used strict diets, ascetic dress codes, even vows of silence.&nbsp; Plato too specified that the philosopher kings of the republic are made unhappy by the stress of having to rule, and a number of ancient figures even used the stress of rule to argue that the gods can’t possibly hear and act on human prayers or else the gods would be perpetually harassed and unhappy.</p>
<p>Stoicism, on the other hand, stressed the idea that everyone is part of a large perfect whole and thus that it’s everyone’s duty to fulfill the role Fate allots.&nbsp; In the ordering of nature the woodpecker should peck, the deer should graze, the bee should pollinate, and the wolf should hunt and kill.&nbsp; We too as humans have a duty to fulfill our roles, be that as servant, merchant, slave, or king.&nbsp; Some stoic authors were slaves themselves, like Epictetus author of the beautiful stoic handbook <em>Enchiridion</em>, and many stoic writings focus on providing therapies for armoring one’s inner self against such evils as physical pain, illness, losing friends, disgrace, and exile. But other stoic philosophers were great leaders of states, including leading statesmen like Cicero and Seneca, and the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<p>Stoicism caught on among Roman elites because it was the one form of philosophical guidance that didn’t urge them to renounce wealth or power.&nbsp; Politics is stressful, but rather than giving it up to live like a monk or a dog, stoicism says you should continue the hard work seek to attain an inner attitude in which you will not suffer misery when you do fail, when you do lose the election, face the criticism, suffer the setback, feel the blows of fortune.&nbsp; Stoicism alone recommended inner detachment, not walking away.&nbsp; For Roman patrician statesmen with long family traditions of political leadership, walking away from civic participation was a non-starter (especially since Roman ancestor worship meant that achieving a name in politics was also a religious duty which your very afterlife depended on!).&nbsp; Stoicism finally offered a philosophical ethics useful to the statesman, which is why Cicero–a skeptic who engaged with many sects of philosophy–favors it in his dialogs more consistently than any other sect (this may not sound like a strong endorsement but is a high a <a href="https://www.exurbe.com/sketches-of-a-history-of-skepticism-part-3-cicero-through-scholasticism/"><em>very high bar</em> for Cicero</a>.&nbsp; And Cicero is a <em>very big deal</em>).</p>

<p>Thus, turning to the questions that Nellie asked me for her article, when I see a fad for stoicism among today’s rising rich, I see a good side and a bad side. The good side is that stoicism, sharing a lot with Buddhism, teaches that the only real treasures are inner treasures–virtue, self-mastery, courage, charity–and that all things in existence are part of one good, divine, and sacred whole, a stance which can combat selfishness and intolerance by encouraging self-discipline and teaching us to love and value every stranger as much as we love our families and ourselves.&nbsp; But on the negative side, stoicism’s Providential claim that everything in the universe is already perfect and that things which seem bad or unjust are secretly good underneath (a claim Christianity borrowed from Stoicism) can be used to justify the idea that the rich and powerful are <i>meant&nbsp;</i>to be rich and powerful, that the poor and downtrodden are&nbsp;<i>meant&nbsp;</i>to be poor and downtrodden, and that even the worst actions are actually good in an ineffable and eternal way.&nbsp; Such claims can be used to justify complacency, social callousness, and even exploitative or destructive behavior.</p>
<p>Seen in the best light, a wealthy person excited by stoicism is seeking a philosophy that helps the mind resist greed and the capitalist rat race and offers a wiser perspective and inner happiness; seen in the worst light it can be a tool for justifying keeping one’s wealth and power and not trying to help others.&nbsp; In that sense it reminds me of the profession of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/17/wealth-therapy-tackles-woes-of-the-rich-its-really-isolating-to-have-lots-of-money">wealth therapists</a> who help the uber-wealthy stop feeling guilty about spending $2,000 on bed sheets or millions on a megayacht.&nbsp; Wealth does come with real emotional challenges, but as society calls more and more for fundamental reform to close the wealth gap and reduce the power wielded by the 1%, cultivating a pro-status-quo attitude can also be a way to deflect pressure to try to address society’s ills.</p>

<p>Seneca, an author I absolutely love, wrote exquisite maxims about selflessness and virtue which have been backbones of moral and political education for two millenia.&nbsp; So powerful are his arguments that Petrarch, when comparing the strengths of the ancient Romans and ancient Greeks in different arts (Homer v. Virgil in poetry, Demosthenes v. Cicero in oratory, Thucydides v. Livy in history etc.) concluded that Seneca alone makes the Latins wholly superior to the Greeks in matters of ethics.&nbsp; Seneca also risked his life trying to curb the tyranny of Nero, and eventually died for it.&nbsp; But for all Seneca’s powerful advice about the big picture and the meaninglessness of wealth, he was also a slave-owner who, when alerted that his male slaves were sexually abusing his female slaves, set up a brothel in his estate so he could make his male slaves pay him for the privilege of abusing his female slaves–not quite the behavior we imagine when Seneca says money is meaningless and all living beings are sacred.&nbsp; But stoicism urges us to turn our critical eye inward and improve ourselves, not to turn it outward and improve our worlds.&nbsp; It gave Seneca the courage and resolve to face the danger of Nero’s deadly whims day by day in order to do his duty to the Roman political elite, but it didn’t encourage him to question his world order.</p>

<p>Stoicism is an intellectually rich and stimulating system, and wonderful therapy against grief, against dwelling on setbacks, and against getting caught up in the chase for fame and fortune and the blinders of the rat race.&nbsp; It reminds us to zoom out from a world of praise, and blame, and status, and cruel things people said on Twitter, and the competition to see made the most sales, or had the most hits, or got the largest raise, all things which can be genuinely emotionally devastating if we let ourselves get too caught up in them.&nbsp; In all those ways stoicism is a great match for Silicon Valley, for Wall Street, also for my world of academia and tenure and their stresses and injustices.&nbsp; It’s also a great match for congresspeople, authors, journalists, actors, entrepreneurs, everyone whose life contains stresses and setbacks and moments when we need help to let us to take a deep breath and let it go.&nbsp; But Cicero was not Voltaire, and did not look at the evils and injustices around him and conclude that he should wield his power to make a fundamentally better world–he focused only on coping with the world as it already was, and fulfilling his duties within it.&nbsp; Stoicism predates <a href="https://www.exurbe.com/on-progress-and-historical-change/">the concept of human-generated progress</a> by more than a millennium. It doesn’t teach us how to change the terrible aspects of the world, it teaches us how to adapt ourselves to them, and to accept them, presuming that they fundamentally cannot be fixed.&nbsp; But we have two millenia more experience than Seneca.&nbsp; We know many of life’s evils can’t be fixed, but we also know, with human teamwork and the scientific method and a dose of Bacon and Voltaire, some of them can.</p>
<p>That’s why when I hear that rich, powerful people are into stoicism I think it’s great that people are excited by the idea that we should hold all life sacred and look for meaning beyond wealth and worldly power.&nbsp; I think it’s a great philosophy for anyone, and certainly for those who need help zooming out from a high-stress, high-competition world to think about the human and humane big picture, and to pay more attention to self-care, and loving others.&nbsp; But it also makes me a little wary.&nbsp; Because I think it’s important that we mingle some Voltaire in with our Seneca, and remember that stoicism’s invaluable advice for taking better care of ourselves <em>inside</em> can–if we fail to mix it with other ideas–come with a big blind spot regarding the world <em>outside</em> ourselves, and whether we should change it.&nbsp; An activist can be a stoic–activism absolutely needs some way to help cope with the pain when we pour our hearts and hours into trying to help someone, or pass new legislation, or resist, and fail.&nbsp; For such moments, stoicism is a precious remedy against despair and burn-out, but it doesn’t in itself offer us the impetus toward activism and resistance in the first place. That we need to get from somewhere else.</p>

At Amazon, we’ve spent decades working to abstract away engineering complexities so our builders can focus on what matters most: their unique business logic. There’s perhaps no better example of this journey than S3.</em></p><p><em>Today, on Pi Day (S3’s 19th birthday), I’m sharing a post from Andy Warfield, VP and Distinguished Engineer of S3. Andy takes us through S3’s evolution from simple object store to sophisticated data platform, illustrating how customer feedback has shaped every aspect of the service. It’s a fascinating look at how we maintain simplicity even as systems scale to handle hundreds of trillions of objects.</em></p><p><em>I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I did.</em></p><p><em>–W</em></p><hr><center><h2>In S3 simplicity is table stakes</h2></center><p>On March 14, 2006, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter successfully entered Martian orbit after a seven-month journey from Earth, the Linux kernel 2.6.16 was released, I was getting ready for a job interview, and S3 launched as the first public AWS service.</p><p>It’s funny to reflect on a moment in time as a way of stepping back and thinking about how things have changed: The job interview was at the University of Toronto, one of about ten University interviews that I was travelling to as I finished my PhD and set out to be a professor. I’d spent the previous four years living in Cambridge, UK, working on hypervisors, storage and I/O virtualization, technologies that would all wind up being used a lot in building the cloud. But on that day, as I approached the end of grad school and the beginning of having a family and a career, the very first external customer objects were starting to land in S3.</p><p>By the time that I joined the S3 team, in 2017, S3 had just crossed a trillion objects. Today, S3 has hundreds of trillions of objects stored across 36 regions globally and it is used as primary storage by customers in pretty much every industry and application domain on earth. Today is Pi Day — and S3 turns 19. In it’s almost two decades of operation, S3 has grown into what’s got to be one of the most interesting distributed systems on Earth. In the time I’ve worked on the team, I’ve come to view the software we build, the organization that builds it, and the product expectations that a customer has of S3 as inseparable. Across these three aspects, S3 emerges as a sort of organism that continues to evolve and improve, and to learn from the developers that build on top of it.</p><h2 id="listening-and-responding-to-our-builders">Listening (and responding) to our builders <a href="#listening-and-responding-to-our-builders"></a></h2><p>When I started at Amazon almost 8 years ago, I knew that S3 was used by all sorts of applications and services that I used every day. I had seen discussions, blog posts, and even research papers about building on S3 from companies like Netflix, Pinterest, Smugmug, and Snowflake. The thing that I really didn’t appreciate was the degree to which our engineering teams spend time talking to the engineers of customers who build using S3, and how much influence external builders have over the features that we prioritize. Almost everything we do, and certainly all of the most popular features that we’ve launched, have been in direct response to requests from S3 customers. The past year has seen some really interesting feature launches for S3 — things like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-tables-storage-optimized-for-analytics-workloads/">S3 Tables</a>, which I’ll talk about more in a sec — but to me, and I think to the team overall, some of our most rewarding launches have been things like <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2021/04/s3-strong-consistency.html">consistency</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/amazon-s3-enforcement-conditional-write-operations-general-purpose-buckets/">conditional operations</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/amazon-s3-up-1-million-buckets-per-aws-account/">increasing per-account bucket limits</a>. These things really matter because they remove limits and actually make S3 <em>simpler</em>.</p><p>This idea of being simple is really important, and it’s a place where our thinking has evolved over almost two decades of building and operating S3. A lot of people associate the term simple with the API itself — that an HTTP-based storage system for immutable objects with four core verbs (PUT, GET, DELETE and LIST) is a pretty simple thing to wrap your head around. But looking at how our API has evolved in response to the huge range of things that builders do over S3 today, I’m not sure this is the aspect of S3 that we’d really use “simple” to describe. Instead, we’ve come to think about making S3 simple as something that turns out to be a much trickier problem — we want S3 to be about working with your data and not having to think about anything other than that. When we have aspects of the system that require extra work from developers, the lack of simplicity is distracting and time consuming for them. In a storage service, these distractions take many forms — probably the most central aspect of S3’s simplicity is elasticity. On S3, you never have to do up front provisioning of capacity or performance, and you don’t worry about running out of space. There is a lot of work that goes into the properties that developers take for granted: elastic scale, very high durability, and availability, and we are successful only when these things can be taken for granted, because it means they aren’t distractions.</p><p>When we <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/">moved S3 to a strong consistency model</a>, the customer reception was stronger than any of us expected (and I think we thought people would be pretty darned pleased!). We knew it would be popular, but in meeting after meeting, builders spoke about deleting code and simplifying their systems. In the past year, as we’ve started to roll out conditional operations we’ve had a very similar reaction.</p><p>One of my favorite things in my role as an engineer on the S3 team is having the opportunity to learn about the systems that our customers build. I especially love learning about startups that are building databases, file systems, and other infrastructure services directly on S3, because it’s often these customers who experience early growth in an interesting new domain and have insightful opinions on how we can improve. These customers are also some of our most eager consumers (although certainly not the only eager consumers) of new S3 features as soon as they ship. I was recently chatting with Simon Hørup Eskildsen, the CEO of Turbopuffer — which is a really nicely designed serverless vector database built on top of S3 — and he mentioned that he has a script that monitors and sends him notifications about S3 “What’s new” posts on an hourly basis. I’ve seen other examples where customers guess at new APIs they hope that S3 will launch, and have scripts that run in the background probing them for years! When we launch new features that introduce new REST verbs, we typically have a dashboard to report the call frequency of requests to it, and it’s often the case that the team is surprised that the dashboard starts posting traffic as soon as it’s up, even before the feature launches, and they discover that it’s exactly these customer probes, guessing at a new feature.</p><p>The bucket limit announcement that we made at re:Invent last year is a similar example of an unglamorous launch that builders get excited about. Historically, there has been a limit of 100 buckets per account in S3, which in retrospect is a little weird. We focused like crazy on scaling object and capacity count, with no limits on the number of objects or capacity of a single bucket, but never really worried about customers scaling to large numbers of buckets. In recent years though, customers started to call this out as a sharp edge, and we started to notice an interesting difference between how people think about buckets and objects. Objects are a <em>programmatic</em> construct: often being created, accessed, and eventually deleted entirely by other software. But the low limit on the total number of buckets made them a very <em>human</em> construct: it was typically a human who would create a bucket in the console or at the CLI, and it was often a human who kept track of all the buckets that were in use in an organization. What customers were telling us was that they loved the bucket abstraction as a way of grouping objects, associating things like security policy with them, and then treating them as collections of data. In many cases, our customers wanted to use buckets as a way to share data sets with their own customers. They wanted buckets to become a programmatic construct.</p><p>So we got together and did the work to scale bucket limits, and it’s a interesting example of how our limits and sharp edges aren’t just a thing that can frustrate customers, but can also be really tricky to unwind at scale. In S3, the bucket metadata system works differently from the much larger namespace that tracks object metadata in S3. That system, which we call “Metabucket” has already been rewritten for scale, even with the 100 bucket per account limit, more than once in the past. There was obvious work required to scale Metabucket further, in anticipation of customers creating millions of buckets per account. But there were more subtle aspects of addressing this scale: we had to think hard about the impact of larger numbers of bucket names, the security consequences of programmatic bucket creation in application design, and even performance and UI concerns. One interesting example is that there are many places in the AWS console where other services will pop up a widget that allows a customer to browse their S3 buckets. Athena, for example, will do this to allow you to specify a location for query results. There are a few forms of this widget, depending on the use case, and they populate themselves by listing all the buckets in an account, and then often by calling <code>HeadBucket</code> on each individual bucket to collect additional metadata. As the team started to look at scaling, they created a test account with an enormous number of buckets and started to test rendering times in the AWS Console — and in several places, rendering the list of S3 buckets could take tens of minutes to complete. As we looked more broadly at user experience for bucket scaling, we had to work across tens of services on this rendering issue. We also introduced a new paged version of the <code>ListBuckets</code> API call, and introduced a limit of 10K buckets until a customer opted in to a higher resource limit so that we had a guardrail against causing them the same type of problem that we’d seen in console rendering. Even after launch, the team carefully tracked customer behaviour on <code>ListBuckets</code> calls so that we could proactively reach out if we thought the new limit was having an unexpected impact.</p><h2 id="performance-matters">Performance matters <a href="#performance-matters"></a></h2><p>Over the years, as S3 has evolved from a system primarily used for archival data over relatively slow internet links into something far more capable, customers naturally wanted to do more and more with their data. This created a fascinating flywheel where improvements in performance drove demand for even more performance, and any limitations became yet another source of friction that distracted developers from their core work.</p><p>Our approach to performance ended up mirroring our philosophy about capacity – it needed to be fully elastic. We decided that any customer should be entitled to use the entire performance capability of S3, as long as it didn’t interfere with others. This pushed us in two important directions: first, to think proactively about helping customers drive massive performance from their data without imposing complexities like provisioning, and second, to build sophisticated automations and guardrails that let customers push hard while still playing well with others. We started by being transparent about S3’s design, documenting everything from request parallelization to retry strategies, and then built these best practices into our Common Runtime (CRT) library. Today, we see individual GPU instances using the CRT to drive hundreds of gigabits per second in and out of S3.</p><p>While much of our initial focus was on throughput, customers increasingly asked for their data to be quicker to access too. This led us to launch <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-express-one-zone-high-performance-storage-class/">S3 Express One Zone</a> in 2023, our first SSD storage class, which we designed as a single-AZ offering to minimize latency. The appetite for performance continues to grow – we have machine learning customers like Anthropic driving tens of terabytes per second, while entertainment companies stream media directly from S3. If anything, I expect this trend to accelerate as customers pull the experience of using S3 closer to their applications and ask us to support increasingly interactive workloads. It’s another example of how removing limitations – in this case, performance constraints – lets developers focus on building rather than working around sharp edges.</p><h2 id="the-tension-between-simplicity-and-velocity">The tension between simplicity and velocity <a href="#the-tension-between-simplicity-and-velocity"></a></h2><p>The pursuit of simplicity has taken us in all sorts of interesting directions over the past two decades. There are all the examples that I mentioned above, from scaling bucket limits to enhancing performance, as well as countless other improvements especially around features like cross-region replication, object lock, and versioning that all provide very deliberate guardrails for data protection and durability. With the rich history of S3’s evolution, it’s easy to work through a long list of features and improvements and talk about how each one is an example of making it simpler to work with your objects.</p><p>But now I’d like to make a bit of a self-critical observation about simplicity: in pretty much every example that I’ve mentioned so far, the improvements that we make toward simplicity are really improvements against an initial feature that wasn’t simple enough. Putting that another way, we launch things that need, over time, to become simpler. Sometimes we are aware of the gaps and sometimes we learn about them later. The thing that I want to point to here is that there’s actually a really important tension between simplicity and velocity, and it’s a tension that kind of runs both ways. On one hand, the pursuit of simplicity is a bit of a “chasing perfection” thing, in that you can never get all the way there, and so there’s a risk of over-designing and second-guessing in ways that prevent you from ever shipping anything. But on the other hand, racing to release something with painful gaps can frustrate early customers and worse, it can put you in a spot where you have backloaded work that is more expensive to simplify it later. This tension between simplicity and velocity has been the source of some of the most heated product discussions that I’ve seen in S3, and it’s a thing that I feel the team actually does a pretty deliberate job of. But it’s a place where when you focus your attention you are never satisfied, because you invariably feel like you are either moving too slowly or not holding a high enough bar. To me, this paradox perfectly characterizes the angst that we feel as a team on every single product release.</p><h2 id="s3-tables-everything-is-an-object-but-objects-arent-everything">S3 Tables: Everything is an object, but objects aren’t everything <a href="#s3-tables-everything-is-an-object-but-objects-arent-everything"></a></h2><p>People have been storing tables in S3 for over a decade. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Parquet">Apache Parquet</a> format was launched in 2013 as a way to efficiently represent tabular data, and it’s become a de facto representation for all sorts of datasets in S3, and a basis for millions of data lakes. S3 stores exabytes of parquet data and serves hundreds of petabytes of Parquet data every day. Over time, parquet evolved to support connectors for popular analytics tools like Apache Hadoop and Spark, and integrations with Hive to allow large numbers of parquet files to be combined into a single table.</p><p>The more popular that parquet became, and the more that analytics workloads evolved to work with parquet-based tables, the more that the sharp edges of working with parquet stood out. Developers loved being able to build data lakes over parquet, but they wanted a richer table abstraction: something that supports finer-grained mutations, like inserting or updating individual rows, as well as evolving table schemas by adding or removing new columns, and this was difficult to achieve, especially over immutable object storage. In 2017, the <a href="http://iceberg.apache.org/">Apache Iceberg</a> project initially launched in order to define a richer table abstraction above parquet.</p><p>Objects are simple and immutable, but tables are neither. So Iceberg introduced a metadata layer, and an approach to organizing tabular data that really innovated to build a table construct that could be composed from S3 objects. It represents a table as a series of snapshot-based updates, where each snapshot summarizes a collection of mutations from the last version of the table. The result of this approach is that small updates don’t require that the whole table be rewritten, and also that the table is effectively versioned. It’s easy to step forward and backward in time and review old states, and the snapshots lend themselves to the transactional mutations that databases need to update many items atomically.</p><p>Iceberg and other open table formats like it are effectively storage systems in their own right, but because their structure is externalized – customer code manages the relationship between iceberg data and metadata objects, and performs tasks like garbage collection – some challenges emerge. One is the fact that small snapshot-based updates have a tendency to produce a lot of fragmentation that can hurt table performance, and so it’s necessary to <em>compact</em> and <em>garbage collect</em> tables in order to clean up this fragmentation, reclaim deleted space, and help performance. The other complexity is that because these tables are actually made up of many, frequently thousands, of objects, and are accessed with very application-specific patterns, that many existing S3 features, like Intelligent-Tiering and cross-region replication, don’t work exactly as expected on them.</p><p>As we talked to customers who had started operating highly-scaled, often multi-petabyte databases over Iceberg, we heard a mix of enthusiasm about the richer set of capabilities of interacting with a table data type instead of an object data type. But we also heard frustrations and tough lessons from the fact that customer code was responsible for things like compaction, garbage collection, and tiering — all things that we do internally for objects. These sophisticated Iceberg customers pointed out, pretty starkly, that with Iceberg what they were really doing was building their own table primitive over S3 objects, and they asked us why S3 wasn’t able to do more of the work to make that experience simple. This was the voice that led us to really start exploring a first-class table abstraction in S3, and that ultimately led to our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-s3-tables-apache-iceberg-tables-analytics-workloads/">launch of S3 Tables</a>.</p><p>The work to build tables hasn’t just been about offering a “managed Iceberg” product on top of S3. Tables are among the most popular data types on S3, and unlike video, images, or PDFs, they involve a complex cross-object structure and the need support conditional operations, background maintenance, and integrations with other storage-level features. So, in deciding to launch S3 Tables, we were excited about Iceberg as an OTF and the way that it implemented a table abstraction over S3, but we wanted to approach that abstraction as if it was a first-class S3 construct, just like an object. The tables that we launched at re:Invent in 2024 really integrate Iceberg with S3 in a few ways: first of all, each table surfaces behind its own endpoint and is a resource from a policy perspective – this makes it much easier to control and share access by setting policy on the table itself and not on the individual objects that it is composed of. Second, we built APIs to help simplify table creation and snapshot commit operations. And third, by understanding how Iceberg laid out objects we were able to internally make performance optimizations to improve performance.</p><p>We knew that we were making a simplicity versus velocity decision. We had demonstrated to ourselves and to preview customers that S3 Tables were an improvement relative to customer-managed Iceberg in S3, but we also knew that we had a lot of simplification and improvement left to do. In the 14 weeks since they launched, it’s been great to see this velocity take shape as Tables have introduced full support for the Iceberg REST Catalog (IRC) API, and the ability to query directly in the console. But we still have plenty of work left to do.</p><p>Historically, we’ve always talked about S3 as an object store and then gone on to talk about all of the properties of objects — security, elasticity, availability, durability, performance — that we work to deliver in the object API. I think one thing that we’ve learned from the work on Tables is that it’s these properties of storage that really define S3 much more than the object API itself.</p><p>There was a consistent reaction from customers that the abstraction resonated with them – that it was intuitively, “all the things that S3 is for objects, but for a table.” We need to work to make sure that Tables match this expectation. That they are just as much of a simple, universal, developer-facing primitive as objects themselves.</p><p>By working to really generalize the table abstraction on S3, I hope we’ve built a bridge between analytics engines and the much broader set of general application data that’s out there. We’ve invested in a collaboration with DuckDB to accelerate Iceberg support in Duck, and I expect that we will focus a lot on other opportunities to really simplify the bridge between developers and tabular data, like the many applications that store internal data in tabular formats, often embedding library-style databases like SQLite. My sense is that we’ll know we’ve been successful with S3 Tables when we start seeing customers move back and forth with the same data for both direct analytics use from tools like spark, and for direct interaction with their own applications, and data ingestion pipelines.</p><h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead <a href="#looking-ahead"></a></h2><p>As S3 approaches the end of its second decade, I’m struck by how fundamentally our understanding of what S3 is has evolved. Our customers have consistently pushed us to reimagine what’s possible, from scaling to handle hundreds of trillions of objects to introducing entirely new data types like S3 Tables.</p><p>Today, on Pi Day, S3’s 19th birthday, I hope what you see is a team that remains deeply excited and invested in the system we’re building. As we look to the future, I’m excited knowing that our builders will keep finding novel ways to push the boundaries of what storage can be. The story of S3’s evolution is far from over, and I can’t wait to see where our customers take us next. Meanwhile, we’ll continue as a team on building storage that you can take for granted.</p><p>As Werner would say: “Now, go build!”</p><h2 id="recommended-posts">Recommended posts <a href="#recommended-posts"></a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/07/building-and-operating-a-pretty-big-storage-system.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=simplicity+table+stakes">Building and operating a pretty big storage system called S3</a></li><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2024/08/continuous-reinvention-a-brief-history-of-block-storage-at-aws.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=simplicity+table+stakes">Continuous reinvention: A brief history of block storage at AWS</a></li><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/12/eventually_consistent.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=simplicity+table+stakes">Eventually Consistent - Revisited</a></li></ul></span></section><hr></div></div>]]></description>

Hopsworks can be considered an alternative to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/mlops-platform">MLOps platforms</a> such as AWS Sagemaker, GCP Vertex, and Databricks (for AI), but it has higher performance real-time AI, better Python integration to the Lakehouse, as shown in our <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626246.3653389">peer-reviewed SIGMOD’24 research paper</a>, and is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/feature-store-the-missing-data-layer-in-ml-pipelines">OG feature store for ML</a>.</p><p>Hopsworks provides both data and compute support, see Figure 1. There is a Lakehouse layer (Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, Iceberg coming soon) to store large amounts of historical <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-data">feature data</a> for training AI models and for batch inference. There is also a low latency database, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rondb.com/">RonDB</a>, that we develop for real-time AI workloads (including specialized query support for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/rondb-a-real-time-database-for-real-time-ai-systems">low-latency query support</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/the-journey-from-star-schema-to-snowflake-schema-in-the-feature-store">snowflake schema data models</a>). Hopsworks also supports compute (Jobs, Notebooks) on Kubernetes, supporting Python, Spark, and Ray and GPU sharing/optimization at scale. However, you can also provide your own compute, in which case you use Hopsworks primarily as a data layer to integrate your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/ai-pipelines">AI pipelines</a>. For this, Hopsworks also provides a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-registry">model registry</a> and supports deploying models on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/kserve">KServe</a>/<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/vllm">vLLM</a>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/618399cd49d125734c8dec95/67d00f6dd7b4afb64bb4b2d3_Figure%201%20AI%20Lakehouse_lightbox.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><strong><em>Figure 1. </em></strong><em>The Hopsworks stack deploys on a Kubernetes Cluster and requires a S3 storage bucket. Hopsworks also has several internal services that can be replaced by external services, including a Container Registry.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hopsworks serverless is a freemium version of Hopsworks where you can store up to 50GB of Lakehouse data, 100MB of low-latency feature data in RonDB, up to 100 models in the model registry, and serve 2 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-deployment">model deployments</a>. Hopsworks freemium is widely used to run <a target="_blank" href="https://serverless-ml.carrd.co/">serverless AI applications</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopsworks serverless, in effect, provides mostly free storage to users, but no free compute, which kept our hosting costs down to $8k/month on AWS. We could scale from 8k to 20k users without much additional cost (an extra TB of s3 storage only costs around $25/month). However, egress costs on AWS were a significant risk. In 2024, we released the Hopsworks Query Service, which provides high throughput read access to feature data from Python clients (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/python-centric-feature-service-with-arrowflight-and-duckdb">using Arrow and DuckDB</a>). Suddenly, clients could read 100s of MB or even GBs easily into Pandas DataFrames. We looked nervously at the growth in data egress and projected cost increases and decided to act. We knew OVH, given our shared European roots, and found out they provided as managed services all we needed to run Hopsworks - managed Kubernetes, a managed container registry, and S3 compatible object storage. Installing Hopsworks on OVH with Helm charts worked great, so we decided to migrate Hopsworks Serverless to OVHCloud - but we kept it in North America where most of our users are to maintain existing latency to those users.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="aws-ovh">Moving from AWS Services and to OVHCloud Services</h2></p><p>We really only had Kubernetes and S3 as dependencies. Hopsworks has its own observability stack, based on OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards, as well as its own metrics stack, based on Prometheus/Graphana.

Although OVH and Hopsworks are technologies built in Europe, Hopsworks serverless service is located in North America, where most Hopsworks users are located and OVH also provides cloud capacity. In Europe, Hopsworks and OVH have since become partners to provide a sovereign AI platform for developing and operating AI systems at scale. We like OVH’s simple pricing and lower pricing - not just network egress but most services are lower cost and the quality is generally good.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>According to Tesla delivery agents, Cybertruck deliveries are on hold. There’s a containment hold as many owners are reporting trims flying off the supposedly ‘bulletproof’ electric truck.</p>



<p>Many Tesla Cybertruck buyers are taking to forums and social media to report that their deliveries are being pushed.</p>



<p>There are 8 Cybertrucks buyers waiting for deliveries who reported the delay on the <a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/delayed-delivery-due-to-inspection.37854/">Cybertruck Owners Club</a> forum and many more on X and Facebook.</p>



<p>Most are being told by Tesla delivery specialists that there’s a “containment hold” on all Cybertruc deliveries.</p>	
	



<p>A containment hold generally occurs when an automaker finds something wrong with newly produced vehicles and wants to hold deliveries to fix the issue so that it can avoid recalling vehicles in customers’ hands.</p>



<p>In this case, most Cybertruck buyers are unaware of the issue. However, one buyer shared an image from Tesla’s service app where a Tesla rep said that the issue was due to the Cybertruck’s “cantrail trim”:</p>

<p>The cantrail trim is decorative trim that covers the roof ledge of a vehicle. For the Cybertruck, it consists of the highlighted section below:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-1.54.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>Despite the fact that Tesla has claimed that the Cybertruck is “bulletproof” and made out of an “exoskeleton”, the electric vehicle’s build is actually much closer to a traditional unibody system rather than “exoskeleton.” Most of the visible body parts, which would be part of the chassis in a exoskeleton build, are actually trims attached to the body.</p>



<p>In some cases, they are extremely flimsy trims.</p>



<p>We previously reported on <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/06/25/tesla-recalls-over-11000-cybertrucks-over-trim-detaching-wiper-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla recalling 11,000 Cybertrucks due to some trims detaching while driving</a>. That recall was in June of last year, but is looks like the problem might be coming back.</p>



<p>Images of the Cybertruck’s front plate being held by glue has recently been circulating on social media:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="1253" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Gl4wwoCX0AEHgTt.jpeg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=588" alt="" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Gl4wwoCX0AEHgTt.jpeg 720w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Gl4wwoCX0AEHgTt.jpeg?resize=86,150 86w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Gl4wwoCX0AEHgTt.jpeg?resize=172,300 172w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Gl4wwoCX0AEHgTt.jpeg?resize=588,1024 588w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Gl4wwoCX0AEHgTt.jpeg?resize=201,350 201w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Gl4wwoCX0AEHgTt.jpeg?resize=140,244 140w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Gl4wwoCX0AEHgTt.jpeg?resize=575,1000 575w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Gl4wwoCX0AEHgTt.jpeg?resize=150,261 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></figure>



<p>The previous recall also mentioned a problem with adhesive resulting in trims detaching.</p>



<p>In the case of the Cybertruck’s cantrail trim, Tesla’s service manual points to brackets holding the top part of the trims:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-1.45.24%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>The hold on Cybertruck deliveries appears to have started last weekend as some deliveries appoitments have been canceled and buyers have yet to be told when they will be able to pick up their vehicles.</p>




	<p>Here’s a good explanation of the issues with Tesla’s cantrail trim:</p>

<p>Tesla has yet to issue a public service bulletin on the issue. The last service bulletin for the Cybertruck is dated February 26, and it is about replacing the left body controller’s PCB on certain vehicles:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On certain Cybertruck vehicles, the left body controller’s printed circuit board was misaligned with its heatsink, which may cause the board to crack when the enclosure is closed. This may lead to a graceful power-off event. Replace the left body controller.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We have previously reported on Tesla getting around service bulletin and potentially even recalls on the Cybertruck.</p>



<p>Based on internal information, we reported on <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/12/20/tesla-finds-cell-dent-issues-in-cybertrucks-starts-replacing-battery-packs/">Tesla having a fairly widespread “cell dent” issue in some Cybertruck battery packs in December</a>.</p>

Strix Halo being productized as AMD Ryzen AI Max and we happen to have a system with one in it. So, but not just that, I happen to have...</p><p><strong>Mahesh Subramony:</strong><span> I'm Mahesh Subramony, Senior Fellow at AMD.</span></p><p><strong>George Cozma:</strong><span> And what do you do at AMD?</span></p><p><strong>Mahesh Subramony:</strong><span> I'm a technology advisor for the client business unit. But for the better part of the last decade, I was an SOC architect for chips within AMD.</span></p><p><strong>George Cozma:</strong><span> So, let's start with Strix Halo. Let's start with the CPU side, what's different about the Zen 5 here compared to say, I don't know, desktop Zen 5?</span></p><p><strong>Mahesh Subramony:</strong><span> Yeah, I mean, first off, I think putting that chip together has been a life's dream over the time. I think ever since we did the merger a long time ago with ATI to bring graphics in-house, we've always talked about building a big APU of sorts where we could match the CPU performance and the GPU performance on a single package and deliver that in the form factor that you see today. And took quite a few iterations to kind of get it to where it is right now to get that right value that we thought bring to the end user. And yeah, so it took four iterations to get here. And so we're glad we're here. And it had to check a lot of boxes because at the end of the day, it had to meet the needs of the consumer. And so we're very aware of that. The CPUs on here, they have the same DNA. It's still Zen 5. It's still the same architecture, but we needed to pay more attention to power.</span></p><p>So the CCDs that are featured to a first order in the desktop part, they have an actual PHY that connects the two dies. And so there is there's actually a distance that it needs to travel. It's a SERDES and you're able to go some distance between the two. That's how we've always connected the two. And that's a low cost interface, if you will. It is a high bandwidth interface. But that had low power states that could only take it so far. And you had retraining and latency implications every time the chip went down and came back up and so on. So for an always on kind of a desktop kind of machine, that seemed like the best interconnect to connect that as we try to build this into an APU. The first thing we had to do was to change the interconnect between the two dies. And so the CCD that you see here, the core die that you see here, has a different item. That's the first change.</p><p>That's a sea of wires. We use fan out, we're for level fan out in order to connect the two dies. So you get the lower latency, the lower power, it's stateless. So we're able to just connect the data fabric through that connect interface into the CCD. So the first big change between a Granite or a 9950X3D and this the Strix Halo always the die to die interconnect. Low power, same high bandwidth, 32 bytes per cycle in both directions, lower latency. So everything that and almost instant on and off stateless because it's just a sea of wires going across. So it's a little [bit of a tradeoff] of course, the fabrication technology is more expensive than the one over there [points to a 9950X3D], but it meets the needs of the customer and the fact that it has to be a low power that can actually connect.</p><p><strong>George Cozma:</strong><span> And are the FPUs in the Strix Halo cores the full 512 bit FPU or is it like Strix Point where it's similar to Zen 4 where it's 256 bit?</span></p><p><strong>Mahesh Subramony:</strong><span> This machine is intended to be a workhorse. It is a workstation. I almost joke about it saying it's a Threadripper to put in the palm of your hands. So we didn't pull any punches. These have the 512 bit data path. It is a full desktop architecture. We have binned the parts for efficiency. So it might not hit the peak frequency that you would see on the desktop. That's one of the second differences in the cores you would find over here and the cores over there. They're colder, so you get the efficiency that you would like on these parts when you run multi thread workloads, you're able to get a higher effective frequency on these. But what you give up is some peak frequency, which I think in a thin form factor that you have today, you don't have the thick cooling solutions that you would see on a desktop part anyway. So the demand of the form factor says that you need cores that are cooler, if you will, lower in that FP curve where you can extract efficiency. So these are binned, the same architecture, the same set of pipes, the data parts are the same. The differences are in how we bin the part and how we connect the two parts.</span></p><p><strong>George Cozma:</strong><span> Now moving from the CPU over to the big huge SOC tile over here that holds your iGPU, now I know that this wasn't mentioned in the slide deck, but there's 32 megabytes of what's known as MALL or infinity cache. How does that react with the CPU cores? So can the CPU cores access that 32 megs of cache?</span></p><p><strong>Mahesh Subramony:</strong><span> It cannot. So let me make sure I make that statement very clear. The MALL exists to amplify graphics bandwidth. I think that's the intent of it. So the only compute engine right now, I mean, it's a flexible allocation policy. We should start with that. But the intended way it is configured right now is writes from source from the GPU installs into the MALL. CPU writes do not install into the MALL. Can we change that with a flip of a bit but we don't see an application right now where we need to amplify CPU bandwidth.</span></p><p>So we reserve and there were times when we have worked on carve outs for say display or video encode/decode to kind of say, hey, look, can I have two slices of the MALL kind of be a place where the VCN or the video encode decoder, the display can kind of play or even the inference engine to store some weights. So we have played around with what can and cannot allocate into that structure. And the way it is defined right now is where only the GPU installs into the MALL. Now, as we explore more and more applications, you know, it's a software release where we can release a firmware that says, hey, look, we have changed the configuration of how the MALL is going to be set up. So much will be reserved for the GPU. And hey, we decided to carve this out for another computer engine and NPU, the video encode decoder display.</p><p>And now you're going to get X amount of speed up X amount of battery life, you know, so on. So any agent can install into it. I want to make sure the flexibility in the architecture exists. But the way it is defined right now, we've run a few use cases right now. We feel the best use of that MALL is for graphics to use it as a bandwidth amplifier. So graphics is the only compute engine with a flag set where all rights installed into the MALL. Now, the MALL is coherent. So when a CPU access comes in, it does check the MALL to say, is the line existing over there because it's a right that is waiting to be committed. And it either says no longer because somebody else asked the line. So let's just forward that that data over to whoever asked for it. So it stays coherent. It is part of the coherent fabric.</p><p>Every write to memory, there is a lookup into the MALL as well. It's a it's a it's a cache that we need to look up as well. But from a from a point of view as who gets the most benefit from that MALL, it is the GPU. It writes into the MALL. And depending on the traffic pattern, if there are more hits onto the MALL, you get that read bandwidth amplification, which in certain scenarios we've seen that to be double digit. So we are going from a GDDR memory that exists in a discrete solution to LPDRR. So we understand we are undersized, but the MALL acts as that as that amplifier. So for a large for a large GPU that that we have over here, 40 40 compute units, you know, the perfect use of that MALL is to get that.</p><p><strong>George Cozma:</strong><span> Speaking of that coherency, is MALL acting as your last layer of coherency for all your compute units?</span></p><p><strong>Mahesh Subramony:</strong><span> No, that is still a block in our data fabric that sits right before the memory controller. OK. That acts as the place where as the point of coherence. OK. All memory accesses. So memory is divided up into, you know, based on its interleaving. Here are the different controllers that if you want to access this line, you have to go to this controller and the data fabric IP that sits right before it's a any access to whatever is behind me comes to me. I'm the point of coherence for all lines below. OK. Now, I am going to check the profile structure to see if the CPU has the line. I'm going to check the MALL to see if that has been installed in here by some point of coherence runs through those data fabric IPs that interface with the memory controllers. So that's that stays as the point of coherency.</span></p><p><strong>George Cozma:</strong><span> It's not the point of coherency and speaking to again to the data fabric, are you seeing any clock speed benefit from the fact that it's just a sea of wires connecting the CPU to the SOC tile?</span></p><p><strong>Mahesh Subramony:</strong><span> We are able to get power benefits. Because prior to that, we had a GMI PHY that lived in there and that consumed a whole lot of power in order to be able to send this over high frequencies over short distances. Here we are clocking it at a way less than the 20 gigs that the GMI was being clocked at. This is anywhere between, you know, one to two gigahertz. You know, really clock rate match to the data fabric itself. So there is no asynchronous interface here where you have to pay a whole lot. It's just mapped to directly the fabric. So at a lower voltage, you are able to because we used a sea of wires, you are able to get that that high bandwidth to match it. We spend the area in terms of the wires that need to come through but we're able to clock it at a meaningfully lower speed so you get the power benefit.</span></p><p>Can we clock this even faster? Well, there would be no need for it if we don't we are not able to clock memory faster as well. Remember, there is no DDR here like desktop where you have OC and you're able to push this higher and higher. So moving the fabric clock gets you some benefits. This is LPDDR. It's a little tense, tends to be less conducive to overclocking. So being rate matched to memory in a more power efficient way, that was the target rather than trying to push the clock. But yeah, we have more flexibility here if you wanted to.</p><p><strong>George Cozma:</strong><span> And so sort of to end this conversation back where we started at the CPU with that fabric, how much memory bandwidth can the single CCD access since it is 32 bytes per cycle reads?</span></p><p><strong>Mahesh Subramony:</strong><span> It does really comes down to. We can have a single CCD saturate them. You don't need both. You can have a single CCD saturate data bandwidth. You can have four cores, even two cores if you write the right stream benchmark and saturate data bandwidth, because the CPU can issue a request every cycle. The CCD CPU can request an issue every cycle. So you're going to see that eventually you're going to get picked back by how quickly a response can come back. And a response can come back once every depending on where it goes and how the response comes back. You're eventually going to get clogged by how quickly the memory requests are draining on the on the on the UMC side of the memory controller side. So we have one to two CPUs being able to get close to saturating the bandwidth they want to do with the right stream bandwidth going to open pages and so on and so forth. </span></p><p>So but again, with the right mix of the right mix of traffic between reads and writes, like I said, a couple of CPU threads can saturate bandwidth. So it's not. But again, when it comes to bandwidth, we believe that NPU and the GPU are the ones that benefit more than from a CPU standpoint. I think latency and latency under load, 15 to 20 percent load, but still not have that hockey stick in terms of latency just jumping up. So we're not faking it that only the first request gets the lowest latency and everybody else does not take the bypass parts and pairs base heavy penalty, making sure you have steady low latency for the CPU and high bandwidth for GPU.</p><p><strong>George Cozma:</strong><span> And to finish off, the most important question, what's your favorite type of cheese?</span></p><p><strong>Mahesh Subramony:</strong><span> Gorgonzola. Is that is that a is that an answer? It's a good answer. The Gorgonzola ravioli [as a] shout out to to do a restaurant back in back in my hometown.</span></p><p><strong>George Cozma:</strong><span> Thank you so much for this interview. Mahesh. </span></p><p><strong>Mahesh Subramony:</strong><span> Always a pleasure.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">We don't need no stinkin' WebUSB!</h2><a id="user-content-we-dont-need-no-stinkin-webusb" aria-label="Permalink: We don't need no stinkin' WebUSB!" href="#we-dont-need-no-stinkin-webusb"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It turns out that there is a way for a web page to access USB devices <em>without</em> requiring WebUSB and its associated political disagreements! Not only that, a device can intentionally design itself to bypass all of the user consent requirements.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/i-cant-believe-its-not-webusb/blob/main/demo.gif"><img src="https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/i-cant-believe-its-not-webusb/raw/main/demo.gif" alt="demo video" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quick demo</h2><a id="user-content-quick-demo" aria-label="Permalink: Quick demo" href="#quick-demo"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Load <a href="https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/i-cant-believe-its-not-webusb/blob/main/u2f-hax.uf2">u2f-hax.uf2</a> onto a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040 version), and then load <a href="https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/i-cant-believe-its-not-webusb/blob/main/index.html">index.html</a> from either localhost or another secure context.</p>
<p dir="auto">The "On!" and "Off!" buttons will toggle the LED, and the state of pin <code>GP22</code> will be regularly updated on the page (you can conveniently short it to the adjacent GND pad with a piece of wire or metal).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How?!</h2><a id="user-content-how" aria-label="Permalink: How?!" href="#how"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Pico is programmed to emulate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor" rel="nofollow">U2F</a> dongle (i.e. a physical two-factor security key). However, instead of performing any security functions, arbitrary data is smuggled in the "key handle" and signature of <code>U2F_AUTHENTICATE</code> messages. As long as the key handle starts with 0xfeedface, the Pico instantly "confirms" user presence and returns data.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why is this possible?</h2><a id="user-content-why-is-this-possible" aria-label="Permalink: Why is this possible?" href="#why-is-this-possible"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By design, the U2F key handle is an opaque blob of data which is conceptually "owned by" the security dongle. It is supposed to be returned by the dongle as a result of a registration, stored as-is by the relying party, and then given as-is back to the security dongle when authenticating.</p>
<p dir="auto">One reason this key handle functionality exists is to enable an unlimited number of websites to be associated with a particular  low-cost dongle with very limited memory. This hypothetical dongle stores a unique "master" encryption key internally. When a new registration is created, it creates a new public/private key pair, returns the public key, encrypts the private key with the "master" key, and <em>returns the encrypted private key as the key handle</em>. No matter how many registrations are created, the dongle does not have to be responsible for storing the keys associated with them. When the key handle is passed back to the dongle during an authentication, the dongle just unwraps the private key using its master key.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to <em>allow for</em> all of these low-cost designs without <em>mandating</em> any particular internal algorithms, the key handle is treated as opaque, and so we can abuse it to smuggle arbitrary data.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to <em>return</em> data, we need to somehow smuggle it as an ECDSA signature. An ECDSA signature is a tuple of two numbers <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="9d860057dfcc06c6c609f835f8fee0ec">$(r, s)$</math-renderer>, where each of the numbers is calculated <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="9d860057dfcc06c6c609f835f8fee0ec">$\mod n$</math-renderer>, where <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="9d860057dfcc06c6c609f835f8fee0ec">$n$</math-renderer> is the <em>order</em> of the elliptic curve base point. This basically means any value from 0 up to 0xffffffff00000000ffffffffffffffffbce6faada7179e84f3b9cac2fc632551 (the order of the secp256r1 base point). These numbers are then packed into some ASN.1.</p>
<p dir="auto">Although it is <em>sometimes</em> possible to tell whether an ECDSA signature was actually calculated "properly" rather than being some numbers we just made up (see Issue #1), there isn't a good reason for anybody other than the relying party to perform anything beyond basic validity checks. Chrome appears to check whether the numbers in the signature are actually in the range from 0 to <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="9d860057dfcc06c6c609f835f8fee0ec">$n$</math-renderer>, but Firefox doesn't check even that.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a result, we can just generate some dummy ASN.1 and then put the data we actually want to send inside of it. In order to reliably get around Chrome's basic validity checks, we just waste the first byte of each number with the value 0x7f. This will result in numbers which are always positive and less than <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="9d860057dfcc06c6c609f835f8fee0ec">$n$</math-renderer>. The entire software stack up to browser JavaScript will pass these "valid-enough" numbers straight through.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, because "access to USB devices" is politically contentious but "make users more secure" has very broad political support across the entire browser industry, this capability is widely supported without requiring extraneous setup, configuration, nor prompting.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Is this a security vulnerability?</h2><a id="user-content-is-this-a-security-vulnerability" aria-label="Permalink: Is this a security vulnerability?" href="#is-this-a-security-vulnerability"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">No.</p>
<p dir="auto">This <em>cannot</em> be used to access arbitrary USB devices. It only works with devices which are <em>intentionally</em> breaking the rules. In essence, this is an intentionally vulnerable device.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>However</em>, it is known that the security model around USB devices is generally... questionable on most platforms. Plugging in a malicious USB device allows it to do anything that you yourself can do with devices such as a keyboard or a mouse.</p>
<p dir="auto">Do not plug arbitrary unknown devices into your computer (or your phone, etc.).</p>
