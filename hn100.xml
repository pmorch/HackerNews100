<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hiding on Slack isn’t all that hard, apparently; you just have to pretend you’re a bot. That’s what <em>IT Brew</em>’s Tom McKay did when he left <em>Gizmodo</em> in 2022, and he went undetected by the site’s management for months.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thetomzone/status/1760833981904228508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1760833981904228508%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc">In a post on X</a>, McKay shared some screenshots of the new “Slackbot” persona he took on after he officially left <em>Gizmodo</em>. He also confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that this silly prank really happened.</p><p>If you’re not glued to Slack for most of the day like I am, then you might not know that Slackbot is the friendly robot that lives in the messaging service. It helps you do things like set reminders, find out your office’s Wi-Fi password, or let you know when you’ve been mentioned in a channel that you’re not a part of.</p><p>When it was his time to leave, McKay swapped out his existing profile picture for one that resembled an angrier version of <a href="https://slack.com/resources/using-slack/a-guide-to-slackbot-custom-responses">Slackbot’s actual icon</a>. He also changed his name to “Slackbot.” You can’t just change your name on Slack to “Slackbot,” by the way, as the service will tell you that name’s already been taken. It <em>does</em> work if you use a special character that resembles one of the letters inside Slackbot, though, <a href="https://x.com/fromdanielwei15/status/1760860498780622947?s=20">such as replacing</a> “o” with the Unicode character “о.”</p><p>The move camouflaged McKay’s active Slack account for months, letting his account evade deletion. It also allowed him to send bot-like messages to his colleagues such as, “Slackbot fact of the day: Hi, I’m Slackbot! That’s a fact. Have a Slack-ly day!” My colleague Victoria Song, who previously worked at <em>Gizmodo</em>, isn’t all that surprised that this situation unfolded, and says, “As Tom’s former coworker and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/8/23788162/gizmodo-g-o-media-ai-generated-articles-star-wars">G/O Media survivor</a>, this tracks.” </p><p>Of course, not <em>every</em> company will fall for this trick, as some have security measures in place to prevent this kind of thing. But perhaps <em>Gizmodo</em>’s management thought that McKay’s account had already been deleted. Or maybe they just weren’t eagle-eyed enough to spot a duplicate Slackbot with a suspicious pair of brows.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <span>INTRINSIC LoRA (I-LoRA)</span> uncovers the hidden capabilities of generative models like VQGAN, StyleGAN-XL, StyleGAN-v2, and Stable Diffusion. I-LoRA modulates key feature maps to extract intrinsic scene properties such as normals, depth, albedo, and shading, using the models' existing decoders without additional layers, revealing their deep understanding of scene intrinsics.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Generative models have been shown to be capable of synthesizing highly detailed and realistic images. It is natural to suspect that they implicitly learn to model some image intrinsics such as surface normals, depth, or shadows. In this paper, we present compelling evidence that generative models indeed internally produce high-quality scene intrinsic maps. We introduce <span>INTRINSIC LoRA (I-LoRA)</span>, a universal, plug-and-play approach that transforms any generative model into a scene intrinsic predictor, capable of extracting intrinsic scene maps directly from the original generator network without needing additional decoders or fully fine-tuning the original network. Our method employs a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of key feature maps, with newly learned parameters that make up less than 0.6% of the total parameters in the generative model. Optimized with a small set of labeled images, our model-agnostic approach adapts to various generative architectures, including Diffusion models, GANs, and Autoregressive models.  We show that the scene intrinsic maps produced by our method compare well with, and in some cases surpass those generated by leading supervised techniques.

(Note: many of these are my own personal opinions that I’ve taken away from the paper.)</span></p><p>Small context windows and scattered dependencies make LLMs nearly unusable for non-boilerplate solutions in large codebases. Aside from any privacy concerns, it’s not feasible to paste in multiple files of code into an LLM when there could be 20+ dependencies from across a codebase in a C++ header file (as an example). Even if you do paste in multiple files, there is a time and cognitive cost to actually using and trying the code outputted by an LLM in a chat window or even in the code editor by GitHub Copilot.</p><p><span>The price of extra cognitive load cannot be understated. </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39460788" rel="">Hacker News commenters find the inaccuracies of GPT-based tooling exhausting and unreliable.</a><span> This is where the </span><strong>verification of outputs being both valid and non-regressive is extremely important.</strong></p><p><span>This means that for a long-term productivity boost in large codebases,</span><strong> improvements will probably come in incremental, specialized use cases</strong><span>, like test generation and </span><a href="https://blog.research.google/2023/05/resolving-code-review-comments-with-ml.html" rel="">automatic suggestions during code reviews</a><span>. These are also low risk ways to save cumulative developer time. Basically, “GPT wrappers” will continue to be useful 🙂.</span></p><p><strong>The real value of LLMs here are displayed through the edge cases</strong><span>. The paradox of writing good code is that </span><a href="https://web.mit.edu/nelsonr/www/Repenning=Sterman_CMR_su01_.pdf" rel="">nobody ever gets credit for fixing problems that never happened</a><span>.</span></p><p><a href="https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/" rel="">Will Wilson writes</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The fundamental problem of software testing… is that software has to handle many situations that the developer has never thought of or will never anticipate. This limits the value of testing, because if you had the foresight to write a test for a particular case, then you probably had the foresight to make the code handle that case too. This makes conventional testing great for catching regressions, but really terrible at catching all the “unknown unknowns” that life, the universe, and your endlessly creative users will throw at you.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Most of the test cases created by Meta’s TestGen-LLM only covered an extra 2.5 lines. However, one test case covered </span><em>1326 lines</em><span>! The value of that one test case is exponentially more valuable than most of the previous test cases and exponentially improves the value of TestGen-LLM. LLMs can vigorously “think outside the box” and the value of catching unexpected edge cases is very high here. </span></p><p><span>In fact, it’s so high that the creator of FoundationDB’s startup, </span><a href="https://antithesis.com/" rel="">Antithesis</a><span>, is entirely based on the fact that software testing edge cases are best found by AI. </span><a href="https://read.engineerscodex.com/p/how-apple-built-icloud-to-store-billions" rel="">For reference, FoundationDB was acquired by Apple and is the basis for Apple iCloud’s billions of databases.</a></p><p><span>Base model LLMs aren’t “plug-n-play" and shouldn’t reasonably ever be expected to. Sure, they might output pristine React and Tailwind CSS code, but that’s a narrow use case in most production codebases. They need a fair amount of processing and filtering for code generation tasks that require correctness. Part of this processing means grounding LLMs with examples. Google and Meta both make </span><strong>suggestions based on existing code</strong><span>, where the results are much, much better than raw generation.</span><strong> </strong><span>LLMs used in production should take ideas from how Meta processes and filters LLM outputs, and most outputs should be expected to be discarded.</span></p><p>LLMs do work best integrated into workflows. This is a reason why GitHub Copilot is so popular and another reason why Google’s Workspace integrations are a great idea.

Here’s how it works:</p><p><strong>Filter 1: Buildability:</strong><span> Initially, TestGen-LLM checks if the generated code can be built within the app's existing infrastructure. Any code that fails to build is immediately discarded.</span></p><p><strong>Filter 2: Execution (does the test pass?): </strong><span>Next, the system runs the tests that passed the buildability filter. Any test that doesn't pass is discarded. This step is crucial because, without a way to automatically determine the validity of a failing test (whether it's due to a bug or an incorrect assertion), TestGen-LLM opts to keep only those tests that can be used for regression testing (aka making sure they can protect current code against future regressions).&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Filter 3: Flakiness:</strong><span> To address the issue of </span><a href="https://www.swequiz.com/learn/what-are-flaky-tests" rel="">flakiness</a><span> (tests that pass or fail inconsistently under the same conditions), TestGen-LLM employs repeated execution. A test must pass consistently across multiple (five) executions to be considered non-flaky.</span></p><p><strong>Filter 3: Coverage Improvement:</strong><span> Finally, to ensure that new tests actually add value, TestGen-LLM evaluates them for their contribution to test coverage. Tests that do not enhance coverage by exploring new code paths or conditions are discarded. Only tests that provide new insights or protect against regressions are kept.</span></p><p>These processing filters are pretty important as they guarantee improvements to a test suite. It also shows that LLMs are very far from being “plug-and-play.” </p><p>The tests that successfully pass through all these filters are guaranteed to enhance the existing test suite, offering reliable regression testing capabilities without duplicating effort or wasting resources. Pre- and post-processing steps in TestGen-LLM facilitate the extraction and reconstruction of test classes, streamlining the integration of new tests into the software development workflow.</p><p>This paper is a good formalization of an use case that many devs probably already use LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Mistral/LLaMA for. Keeping it in writing is a good way of tracking the progress of future improvements on LLMs in the software reliability space. Unit tests are probably the lowest, most basic level of code generation where LLMs have the most immediate value, but as time goes on, we’ll definitely see LLMs be able to catch and test for bugs in increasingly complex software systems.</p><p>The question is - will that make software easier to develop in the long run or will it lead to a proliferation of software complexity in the future?</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div> 
<p>Tauri is a framework for building tiny, fast binaries for all major desktop and mobile platforms. Developers can integrate any frontend framework that compiles to HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for building their user experience while leveraging languages such as Rust, Swift, and Kotlin for backend logic when needed.</p>
<p>Get started building with <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app"><code dir="auto">create-tauri-app</code></a> by using one of the below commands. Be sure to follow the <a href="https://beta.tauri.app/guides/prerequisites/">prerequisites guide</a> to install all of the dependencies required by Tauri and then view the <a href="https://beta.tauri.app/guides/frontend/">Frontend Configuration guides</a> for recommended frontend configurations.</p>

<starlight-tabs> <div> <ul role="tablist"> <li role="presentation"> <a role="tab" href="#tab-panel-245" id="tab-245" aria-selected="true" tabindex="0"> Bash </a> </li><li role="presentation"> <a role="tab" href="#tab-panel-246" id="tab-246" tabindex="-1"> PowerShell </a> </li><li role="presentation"> <a role="tab" href="#tab-panel-247" id="tab-247" tabindex="-1"> npm </a> </li><li role="presentation"> <a role="tab" href="#tab-panel-248" id="tab-248" tabindex="-1"> Yarn </a> </li><li role="presentation"> <a role="tab" href="#tab-panel-249" id="tab-249" tabindex="-1"> pnpm </a> </li><li role="presentation"> <a role="tab" href="#tab-panel-250" id="tab-250" tabindex="-1"> Cargo </a> </li> </ul> </div> <div id="tab-panel-245" aria-labelledby="tab-245" role="tabpanel"><figure><pre tabindex="0" dir="ltr"><code><p><span>sh</span><span> </span><span>&lt;(</span><span><span>curl</span><span> https://create.tauri.app/sh</span></span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>--alpha</span></p></code></pre></figure></div> </starlight-tabs>  
<p>After you’ve created your first app you can explore the different features and recipes of Tauri in the <a href="https://beta.tauri.app/features/">List of Features &amp; Recipes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-tauri"></h2>
<p>Tauri has 3 main advantages for developers to build upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure foundation for building apps</li>
<li>Smaller bundle size by using the system’s native webview</li>
<li>Flexibility for developers to use any frontend and bindings for multiple languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more about the Tauri philosophy in the <a href="https://beta.tauri.app/blog/tauri-1-0">Tauri 1.0 blog post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="secure-foundation"></h3>
<p>By being built on Rust, Tauri is able to take advantage of the memory, thread, and type-safety offered by Rust. Apps built on Tauri can automatically get those benefits even without needing to be developed by Rust experts.</p>
<p>Tauri also undergoes a security audit for major and minor releases. This not only covers code in the Tauri organization, but also for upstream dependencies that Tauri relies on. Of course this doesn’t mitigate all risks, but it provides a solid foundation for developers to build on top of.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/policy">Tauri security policy</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/audits/Radically_Open_Security-v1-report.pdf">Tauri 1.0 audit report</a>.</p>
<h3 id="smaller-app-size"></h3>
<p>Tauri apps take advantage of the web view already available on every user’s system. A Tauri app only contains the code and assets specific for that app and doesn’t need to bundle a browser engine with every app. This means that a minimal Tauri app can be less than 600KB in size.</p>
<p>Learn more about creating optimized apps in the <a href="https://beta.tauri.app/concepts/size">App Size concept</a>.</p>
<h3 id="flexible-architecture"></h3>
<p>Since Tauri uses web technologies that means that virtually any frontend framework is compatible with Tauri. The <a href="https://beta.tauri.app/guides/frontend/">Frontend Configuration guide</a> contains common configurations for popular frontend frameworks and the <a href="https://beta.tauri.app/concepts/rendering">Rendering concept</a> discusses which rendering techniques work best with Tauri (such as SPAs and SSGs).</p>
<p>Bindings between JavaScript and Rust are available to developers using the <code dir="auto">invoke</code> function in JavaScript and Swift and Kotlin bindings are available for <a href="https://beta.tauri.app/guides/plugins/">Tauri Plugins</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao">TAO</a> is responsible for Tauri window creation and <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry">WRY</a> is responsible for web view rendering. These are libraries maintained by Tauri and can be consumed directly if deeper system integration is required outside of what Tauri exposes.</p>
<p>In addition, Tauri maintains a number of plugins to extend what core Tauri exposes. You can find those plugins alongside those provided by the community in the <a href="https://beta.tauri.app/features">Features and Recipes section</a>.</p>  </div>    <hr> <p>© 2024 Tauri Contributors.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Handwriting notes in class might seem like an anachronism as smartphones and other digital technology subsume every aspect of learning across schools and universities. But a steady stream of research continues to suggest that taking notes the traditional way—with pen and paper or even stylus and tablet—is still the best way to learn, especially for young children. And now scientists are finally zeroing in on why.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">A recent study in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full"><em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a> monitored brain activity in students taking notes and found that those writing by hand had higher levels of electrical activity across a wide range of interconnected brain regions responsible for movement, vision, sensory processing and memory. The findings add to a growing body of evidence that has many experts speaking up about the importance of teaching children to handwrite words and draw pictures.</p><h2 data-block="sciam/heading">Differences in Brain Activity</h2><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.</p><hr><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The new research, by Audrey van der Meer and Ruud van der Weel at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), builds on a foundational <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/">2014 study</a>. That work suggested that people taking notes by computer were typing without thinking, says <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/audrey.meer">van der Meer</a>, a professor of neuropsychology at NTNU. “It’s very tempting to type down everything that the lecturer is saying,” she says. “It kind of goes in through your ears and comes out through your fingertips, but you don’t process the incoming information.” But when taking notes by hand, it’s often impossible to write everything down; students have to actively pay attention to the incoming information and process it—prioritize it, consolidate it and try to relate it to things they’ve learned before. This conscious action of building onto existing knowledge can make it easier to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.591203/full">stay engaged and grasp new concepts</a>.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">To understand specific brain activity differences during the two note-taking approaches, the NTNU researchers tweaked the 2014 study’s basic setup. They sewed electrodes into a hairnet with 256 sensors that recorded the brain activity of 36 students as they wrote or typed 15 words from the game Pictionary that were displayed on a screen.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">When students wrote the words by hand, the sensors picked up widespread connectivity across many brain regions. Typing, however, led to minimal activity, if any, in the same areas. Handwriting activated connection patterns spanning visual regions, regions that receive and process sensory information and the motor cortex. The latter handles body movement and sensorimotor integration, which helps the brain use environmental inputs to inform a person’s next action.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“When you are typing, the same simple movement of your fingers is involved in producing every letter, whereas when you’re writing by hand, you immediately feel that the bodily feeling of producing A is entirely different from producing a B,” van der Meer says. She notes that children who have learned to read and write by tapping on a digital tablet “often have difficulty distinguishing letters that look a lot like each other or that are mirror images of each other, like the b and the d.”</p><h2 data-block="sciam/heading">Reinforcing Memory and Learning Pathways</h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><a href="https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=sophia-vinci-booher">Sophia Vinci-Booher</a>, an assistant professor of educational neuroscience at Vanderbilt University who was not involved in the new study, says its findings are exciting and consistent with past research. “You can see that in tasks that really lock the motor and sensory systems together, such as in handwriting, there’s this really clear tie between this motor action being accomplished and the visual and conceptual recognition being created,” she says. “As you’re drawing a letter or writing a word, you’re taking this perceptual understanding of something and using your motor system to create it.” That creation is then fed back into the visual system, where it’s processed again—strengthening the connection between an action and the images or words associated with it. It’s similar to imagining something and then creating it: when you materialize something from your imagination (by writing it, drawing it or building it), this reinforces the imagined concept and helps it stick in your memory.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The phenomenon of boosting memory by producing something tangible has been well studied. Previous <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-020-01804-w">research</a> has found that when people are asked to write, draw or act out a word that they’re reading, they have to focus more on what they’re doing with the received information. Transferring verbal information to a different form, such as a written format, also involves activating motor programs in the brain to create a specific sequence of hand motions, explains <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yadurshana-Sivashankar-2">Yadurshana Sivashankar</a>, a cognitive neuroscience graduate student at the University of Waterloo in Ontario who studies movement and memory. But handwriting requires <em>more </em>of the brain’s motor programs than typing. “When you’re writing the word ‘the,’ the actual movements of the hand relate to the structures of the word to some extent,” says Sivashankar, who was not involved in the new study.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">For example, participants in a 2021 study by Sivashankar <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658211.2021.1995877">memorized a list of action verbs</a> more accurately if they performed the corresponding action than if they performed an unrelated action or none at all. “Drawing information and enacting information is helpful because you have to think about information and you have to produce something that’s meaningful,” she says. And by transforming the information, you pave and deepen these interconnections across the brain’s vast neural networks, making it “much easier to access that information.”</p><h2 data-block="sciam/heading">The Importance of Handwriting Lessons for Kids</h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Across many contexts, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09500782.2012.704047#.UzeeNRaNtUQ">studies have shown</a> that kids appear to learn better when they’re asked to produce letters or other visual items using their fingers and hands in a coordinated way—one that can’t be replicated by clicking a mouse or tapping buttons on a screen or keyboard. Vinci-Booher’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8639586/">research has also found </a>that the action of handwriting appears to engage different brain regions at different levels than other standard learning experiences, such as reading or observing. Her work has also shown that handwriting improves letter recognition in preschool children, and the effects of learning through writing “last longer than <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8641140/">other learning experiences</a> that might <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34941347/">engage attention</a> at a similar level,” Vinci-Booher says. Additionally, she thinks it’s possible that engaging the motor system is how children learn how to break “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4091125/">mirror invariance</a>” (registering mirror images as identical) and begin to decipher things such as the difference between the lowercase b and p.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Vinci-Booher says the new study opens up bigger questions about the way we learn, such as how brain region connections change over time and when these connections are most important in learning. She and other experts say, however, that the new findings don’t mean technology is a disadvantage in the classroom. Laptops, smartphones and other such devices can be more efficient for writing essays or conducting research and can offer more equitable access to educational resources. Problems occur when people rely on technology <em>too much</em>, Sivashankar says. People are increasingly delegating thought processes to digital devices, an act called “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-022-02139-4">cognitive offloading</a>”—using smartphones to remember tasks, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-022-02149-2">taking a photo</a> instead of memorizing information or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6374493/">depending on a GPS</a> to navigate. “It’s helpful, but we think the constant offloading means it’s less work for the brain,” Sivashankar says. “If we’re not actively using these areas, then they are going to deteriorate over time, whether it’s memory or motor skills.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Van der Meer says some officials in <a href="https://education-profiles.org/europe-and-northern-america/norway/~technology">Norway</a> are inching toward implementing <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2023.1164856/full">completely digital schools</a>. She claims first grade teachers there have told her their incoming students barely know how to hold a pencil now—which suggests they weren’t coloring pictures or assembling puzzles in nursery school. Van der Meer says they’re missing out on opportunities that can help stimulate their growing brains.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“I think there’s a very strong case for engaging children in drawing and handwriting activities, especially in preschool and kindergarten when they’re first learning about letters,” Vinci-Booher says. “There’s something about engaging the fine motor system and production activities that really impacts learning.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>
    Oxford, UK — February 23, 2024
  </p>
  <p>Today, basically any language model you can name is a Transformer model.
OpenAI’s <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="\_blank">ChatGPT</a>, Google’s <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/" target="\_blank">Gemini</a>, and GitHub’s <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="\_blank">Copilot</a> are all powered by Transformers, to name a few.
However, Transformers suffer from a fundamental flaw: they are powered by <a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/" target="\_blank">Attention</a>, which scales quadratically with sequence length.
Simply put, for quick exchanges (asking ChatGPT to tell a joke), this is fine.
But for queries that require lots of words (asking ChatGPT to summarize a 100-page document), Transformers can become prohibitively slow.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Many models have attempted to solve this problem, but few have done as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752" target="\_blank">Mamba</a>.
Published two months ago by <a href="https://twitter.com/_albertgu" target="\_blank">Albert Gu</a> and <a href="https://tridao.me/" target="\_blank">Tri Dao</a>, Mamba appears to outperform similarly-sized Transformers while scaling linearly with sequence length.
If you’re looking for an in-depth technical explanation of Mamba, paired with a full Triton implementation, you’re in the wrong place.
<a href="https://srush.github.io/annotated-mamba/hard.html" target="\_blank">Mamba: The Hard Way</a> has already been written by the legend himself, <a href="https://rush-nlp.com/" target="\_blank">Sasha Rush</a>.
If you haven’t heard of Mamba (or Triton), or you’re looking for a higher-level overview of Mamba’s big ideas, I have just the post for you.</p>

<p>The prospect of an accurate linear-time language model has gotten many excited about the future of language model architectures (especially Sasha, who has <a href="https://www.isattentionallyouneed.com/" target="\_blank">money on the line</a>).
In this blogpost, I’ll try to explain how Mamba works in a way that should be fairly straightforward, especially if you’ve studied a little computer science before.
Let’s get started!</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Quadratic attention has been indispensable for information-dense modalities such as language... until now.</p><p>Announcing Mamba: a new SSM arch. that has linear-time scaling, ultra long context, and most importantly--outperforms Transformers everywhere we've tried.</p><p>With <a href="https://twitter.com/tri_dao?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tri_dao</a> 1/ <a href="https://t.co/vXumZqJsdb">pic.twitter.com/vXumZqJsdb</a></p></div>— Albert Gu (@_albertgu) <a href="https://twitter.com/_albertgu/status/1731727672286294400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2023</a></blockquote>


<h2 id="background-s4">Background: S4</h2>

<p>Mamba’s architecture is based primarily on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396" target="\_blank">S4</a>, a recent state space model (SSM) architecture.
I’ll summarize the important parts here, but if you want to understand S4 in more detail, I would highly recommend reading another one of Sasha’s blogposts, <a href="https://srush.github.io/annotated-s4/" target="\_blank">The Annotated S4</a>.</p>

<p>At a high level, S4 learns how to map an input \(x(t)\) to an output \(y(t)\) through an intermediate state \(h(t)\).
Here, \(x\), \(y\), and \(h\) are functions of \(t\) because SSMs are designed to work well with continuous data such as audio, sensor data, and images.
S4 relates these to each other with three continuous parameter matrices \(\mathbf{A}\), \(\mathbf{B}\), and \(\mathbf{C}\).
These are all tied together through the following two equations (1a and 1b in Mamba’s paper):</p>

<p>\[\begin{align}h'(t)&amp;=\mathbf{A}h(t)+\mathbf{B}x(t)\\y(t)&amp;=\mathbf{C}h(t)\end{align}\]</p>

<p>In practice, we always deal with discrete data, such as text.
This requires us to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization" target="\_blank"><em>discretize</em></a> the SSM, transforming our continuous parameters \(\mathbf{A}\), \(\mathbf{B}\), \(\mathbf{C}\) into discrete parameters \(\mathbf{\bar{A}}\), \(\mathbf{\bar{B}}\), \(\mathbf{C}\) by using a special fourth parameter \(\Delta\).
I’m not going to get into the details of how discretization works here, but the authors of S4 have written a nice <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2022-01-14-s4-3" target="\_blank">blogpost</a> about it if you’re curious.
Once discretized, we can instead represent the SSM through these two equations (2a and 2b):</p>

<p>\[\begin{align}h_t&amp;=\mathbf{\bar{A}}h_{t-1}+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_t\\y_t&amp;=\mathbf{C}h_t\end{align}\]</p>

<p>These equations form a recurrence, similar to what you would see in a <a href="https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-recurrent-neural-networks" target="\_blank">recurrent neural network</a> (RNN).
At each step \(t\), we combine the hidden state from the previous timestep \(h_{t-1}\) with the current input \(x_t\) to create the new hidden state \(h_t\).
Below, you can see how this would work when predicting the next word in a sentence (in this case, we predict that “and” follows “My name is Jack”).</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/rnn.svg">
</figure>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<p>In this way, we can essentially use S4 as an RNN to generate one token at a time.
However, what makes S4 really cool is that you can actually also use it as a <a href="https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-convolutional-neural-networks" target="\_blank">convolutional neural network</a> (CNN).
In the above example, let’s see what happens when we expand the discrete equations from earlier to try to calculate \(h_3\).
For simplicity, let’s assume \(x_{-1}=0\).</p>

<p>\[\begin{align}h_0&amp;=\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_0\\h_1&amp;=\mathbf{\bar{A}}(\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_0)+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_1\\h_2&amp;=\mathbf{\bar{A}}(\mathbf{\bar{A}}(\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_0)+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_1)+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_2\\h_3&amp;=\mathbf{\bar{A}}(\mathbf{\bar{A}}(\mathbf{\bar{A}}(\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_0)+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_1)+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_2)+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_3\end{align}\]</p>

<p>With \(h_3\) calculated, we can substitute this into the equation for \(y_3\) to predict the next word.</p>

<p>\[\begin{align}y_3&amp;=\mathbf{C}(\mathbf{\bar{A}}(\mathbf{\bar{A}}(\mathbf{\bar{A}}(\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_0)+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_1)+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_2)+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_3)\\y_3&amp;=\mathbf{C\bar{A}\bar{A}\bar{A}\bar{B}}x_0+\mathbf{C\bar{A}\bar{A}\bar{B}}x_1+\mathbf{C\bar{A}\bar{B}}x_2+\mathbf{C\bar{B}}x_3\end{align}\]</p>

<p>Now, notice that \(y_3\) can actually be computed as a dot product, where the right-hand vector is just our input \(x\):</p>

<p>\[y_3=\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{C\bar{A}\bar{A}\bar{A}\bar{B}} &amp; \mathbf{C\bar{A}\bar{A}\bar{B}} &amp; \mathbf{C\bar{A}\bar{B}} &amp; \mathbf{C\bar{B}}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
x_0\\
x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}\]</p>

<p>Since \(\mathbf{\bar{A}}\), \(\mathbf{\bar{B}}\), and \(\mathbf{C}\) are all constant, we can precompute the left-hand vector and save it as our convolutional kernel \(\mathbf{\bar{K}}\).
This leaves us with an easy way to compute \(y\) with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution" target="\_blank">convolution</a>, as shown by the following two equations<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> (3a and 3b in Mamba’s paper):</p>

<p>\[\begin{align}\mathbf{\bar{K}}&amp;=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{C\bar{B}} &amp; \mathbf{C\bar{A}\bar{B}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{C\bar{A}^k\bar{B}}\end{pmatrix}\\y&amp;=\mathbf{\bar{K}} * x\end{align}\]</p>

<p>Importantly, these recurrent and convolutional forms, which I like to call “RNN mode” and “CNN mode,” are <em>mathematically equivalent</em>.
This allows S4 to shape-shift depending on what you need it to do, with no difference in its outputs.
We can compare the differences between these “modes” in Table 1 from the S4 paper, which shows the runtime complexity of training and inference for each form (bold denotes the best result for each metric).<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p>



<p>Notice that CNN mode is better for training, while RNN mode is better for inference.
In CNN mode, we can take advantage of parallelism to train across many examples, all at once.
In RNN mode, although we can only calculate one step at a time, each step requires exactly the same amount of work.
Because S4 can use both modes, it essentially gets the best of both worlds: fast training, and even faster inference.</p>

<h2 id="idea-1-selectivity">Idea #1: Selectivity</h2>

<p>Now we can move on to the first major idea introduced by Mamba: <strong>selectivity</strong>.
Let’s recall the two equations that define the discrete form of S4:</p>

<p>\[\begin{align}h_t&amp;=\mathbf{\bar{A}}h_{t-1}+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_t\\y_t&amp;=\mathbf{C}h_t\end{align}\]</p>

<p>Note that in S4, our discrete parameters \(\mathbf{\bar{A}}\), \(\mathbf{\bar{B}}\), and \(\mathbf{C}\) are constant.
However, Mamba makes these parameters vary based on the input.
We’ll instead end up with something like this:<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>\[\begin{align}h_t&amp;=s_\mathbf{\bar{A}}(x_t)h_{t-1}+s_\mathbf{\bar{B}}(x_t)x_t\\y_t&amp;=s_\mathbf{C}(x_t)h_t\end{align}\]</p>

<p>The authors argue that selectivity, or input-dependence, is important for a number of tasks.
Here’s how I like to think about it: because S4 does not have selectivity, it is forced to treat all parts of the input exactly the same.
However, when you’re reading a sentence, some words inevitably matter more than others.
Imagine we have a model that classifies sentences based on intent, and we give it the sentence: “I want to order a hamburger.”
Without selectivity, S4 spends the same amount of “effort” processing each word.
Click on the buttons below to see what happens as the sentence is processed, one word at a time.</p>

<figure id="no-selectivity-demo">
<h3>Click on the arrows to update the hidden state</h3>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>I</span> <span>want</span> <span>to</span> <span>order</span> <span>a</span> <span>hamburger</span></p>

</div>
<div>
<h4>Hidden State</h4>

</div>
</div>
<figcaption>(This is an oversimplification, but it should give you a sense of what’s going on.)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But if you were a model trying to classify the intent of this sentence, you would probably want to “focus” more on some words than others.
How much value do the words “want” and “to” really contribute to the underlying meaning of this sentence?
In reality, it would be great if we could spend more of our limited mental energy on words like “order,” to know what the user wants to do, and “hamburger,” to know what the user is ordering.
By making model parameters a function of the input, Mamba makes it possible to “focus” on the parts of the input that are more important for the task at hand.</p>

<p>However, selectivity presents us with a problem.
Let’s think back to the convolutional kernel \(\mathbf{\bar{K}}\) that we calculated earlier.</p>

<p>\[\mathbf{\bar{K}}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{C\bar{B}} &amp; \mathbf{C\bar{A}\bar{B}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{C\bar{A}^k\bar{B}}\end{pmatrix}\]</p>

<p>In S4, we could precompute this kernel, save it, and multiply it with the input \(x\).
And this was fine, because \(\mathbf{\bar{A}}\), \(\mathbf{\bar{B}}\), and \(\mathbf{C}\) were constant.
But again, in Mamba, these matrices change depending on the input!
As a result, we can’t precompute \(\mathbf{\bar{K}}\), and we can’t use CNN mode to train our model.
If we want selectivity, we’ll need to train with RNN mode.
We can cross out equation 3b for dramatic effect.</p>

<p>\[\xcancel{y=\mathbf{\bar{K}} * x}\]</p>

<p>This posed a problem for Mamba’s authors: training in RNN mode is <em>really</em> slow.
Imagine we’re training our model on a sequence with 1,000 tokens.
A CNN would essentially compute a dot product between its kernel and the input vector, and it can do these computations in parallel.
By comparison, an RNN would need to update its hidden state 1,000 times in sequence.
This slow training time of RNNs is more or less what has prevented them from ever really taking off, and it led Mamba’s authors to their second big idea.</p>

<h2 id="idea-2-fast-training-without-convolutions">Idea #2: Fast training without convolutions</h2>

<p>The second major idea of Mamba involves training in RNN mode very, very quickly.
At some point, Gu and Dao realized that their recurrence was very similar to a <em>scan algorithm</em>, also known as a prefix sum.
To compute a prefix sum, we need to take an input array \([x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots, x_n]\) and return an output array where each element is the sum of that item and the items that came before it.
In other words, the first element of the output will be \(x_1\), the second element will be \(x_1+x_2\), the third \(x_1+x_2+x_3\), and so on.
An example is shown below.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/prefix-sum.svg">
</figure>

<p>Now let’s draw out the process for updating Mamba’s hidden state in RNN mode.
Wait a minute…</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/prefix-sum-rnn.svg">
</figure>

<p>Let’s think about this.
If we had to formalize a prefix sum, we could write it out as the following equation:</p>

<p>\[h_t=h_{t-1}+x_t\]</p>

<p>This equation forms a recurrence: at each step, we compute the new value by adding the previous stored value to the current input.
Now, let’s look again at the recurrence for updating Mamba’s hidden state.</p>

<p>\[h_t=\mathbf{\bar{A}}h_{t-1}+\mathbf{\bar{B}}x_t\]</p>

<p>These are really, really similar!<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>
And here’s the cool part: while computing a prefix sum may seem inherently sequential in nature, we actually have efficient parallel algorithms for this task!
In the diagram below, we can see a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum#Algorithm_2:_Work-efficient" target="\_blank">parallel prefix sum</a> algorithm in action, where each vertical line represents one item in our array.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/parallel-prefix-sum.svg">
<figcaption>Credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14985743" target="_blank">David Eppstein</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Take a second to convince yourself that this algorithm works: choose any vertical line, start at the top, and work your way down, tracing each addition back to the array’s first few items.
By the time you reach the bottom, you should have the sum of all items to the left of your line.
For example, you can see that the array’s third element receives the added value of the second element at the end, after the first element is added to the second element at the beginning.
As a result, the third element contains the sum of the first, second, and third elements by the time the parallel scan is finished.</p>

<p>If we were running this algorithm in a single thread, with no parallelism, it would take longer than if we were just adding the values together in sequence.
But GPUs have lots of processors, allowing for highly parallel computation.
As a result, we can compute this prefix sum (or scan) operation in roughly \(O(\log n)\) time!</p>

<p>So Mamba’s authors realized that if they wanted to train efficiently in RNN mode, they could probably use a parallel scan.
Since PyTorch <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/50688" target="\_blank">does not currently have</a> a scan implementation, Mamba’s authors wrote one themselves, and the results weren’t great.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/scan-perf-no-pytorch.png">
<figcaption>Credit: Gu and Dao, 2023</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the figure above, you can see that their PyTorch-based scan implementation (green) is always slower than <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691" target="\_blank">FlashAttention-2</a> (blue), the fastest available “exact Attention” implementation.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
At a sequence length of 128,000 tokens, where the scan almost seems to catch up in runtime, it runs out of memory.
In order for Mamba to be practical, it needed to be faster.
This brought Mamba’s authors to Dao’s prior work on FlashAttention.</p>

<h2 id="review-flashattention">Review: FlashAttention</h2>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135" target="\_blank">FlashAttention</a> is a very fast implementation of Attention.
When published, FlashAttention trained BERT-large 15% faster than the previous fastest training time, and it was 3 times faster than the widely-used HuggingFace implementation of GPT-2.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, FlashAttention’s key insight has to do with the speeds at which different operations run on your GPU.
They realized that some GPU operations are <em>compute-bound</em>, meaning they are limited by the speed at which your GPU performs computations.
However, other operations are <em>memory-bound</em>, meaning they are limited by the speed at which your GPU is able to transfer data.</p>

<p>Imagine you and a friend are playing a game: your friend has to run 50 meters to deliver two numbers to you, which you then need to multiply by hand.
A timer starts when your friend begins running, and ends when you get the answer.
Let’s say the numbers you need to multiply are 439,145,208 and 142,426,265.
It would take you awhile to multiply these by hand.
Your friend might take 5 seconds to deliver the numbers, but you might take 60 seconds to perform the multiplication.
As a result, you are both compute-bound, since most of your time is spent on computation.
Now, imagine the numbers you need to multiply are 4 and 3.
While your friend still takes 5 seconds to run 50 meters, you can compute this result instantly.
Now, you are both memory-bound, since most of your time is spent transferring data.</p>

<p>In this analogy, your GPU is essentially racing to move data into the right places to perform its computations.
For example, let’s consider a masking operation.
To compute a masked vector, your GPU simply needs to erase data values whenever the mask is equal to zero (and keep them the same whenever it is equal to one).
If we used \(\boldsymbol{\oslash}\) to denote a masking operation, an example of this would be as follows, where the mask forces us to set the last three data elements to zero:</p>

<p>\[
\begin{pmatrix}
4 &amp; 9 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 7
\end{pmatrix} \hspace{0.1cm}\boldsymbol{\oslash}\hspace{0.1cm} \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}=\boxed{\begin{pmatrix}
4 &amp; 9 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}}
\]</p>

<p>Since this is extremely easy to compute, your GPU ends up spending most of its time transferring memory, to move the data and mask matrices into the right places for computation.
This means that masking is memory-bound.
On the other hand, matrix multiplication involves lots and lots of additions and multiplications.
Because so much more time is spent on computation than memory transfers, matrix multiplication is compute-bound.
With this in mind, let’s look at a breakdown of the computations performed during Attention (matmul = matrix multiplication).</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/flashattention-breakdown.png">
<figcaption>Credit: Dao et al., 2022</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It turns out that dropout, softmax, and masking, which make up the bulk of Attention’s runtime, are all <em>memory-bound</em>.
This means that most of the time we spend computing Attention is simply spent waiting for your GPU to move around data.
With this in mind, I assume FlashAttention’s authors wondered, how can we speed up operations that are bounded by the speed of memory transfers?</p>

<p>This led FlashAttention’s authors to another key realization: GPU memory has two major regions.
One of these, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), is really big, but really slow.
The other one, static random-access memory (SRAM), is really small, but really fast.
Let’s break down the differences between these regions on an A100 GPU:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/memory-hierarchy.png">
<figcaption>Credit: Dao et al., 2022</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>FlashAttention’s authors realized that you can compute memory-bound operations more efficiently if you’re extra careful about how you use these regions of GPU memory.
They use an approach called tiling, in which small portions of your data are moved from HBM (slower) to SRAM (faster), computed in SRAM, and then moved back from SRAM to HBM.
This makes FlashAttention really, really fast, while still being numerically equivalent to Attention.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/flashattention-computation.png">
<figcaption>Credit: Dao et al., 2022</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The details of how this works are fascinating, and I encourage you to check out the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135" target="\_blank">FlashAttention paper</a> to learn more.
However, for the purpose of understanding Mamba, this is basically all you need to know.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-mamba">Back to Mamba</h2>

<p>Remember that before we started this tangent on FlashAttention, we were trying to speed up our parallel scan implementation.
Here is the same graph from earlier, where we can see that the scan implementation in PyTorch (green) is always slower than FlashAttention, the fastest “exact” Transformer (blue).<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/scan-perf-no-pytorch.png">
<figcaption>Credit: Gu and Dao, 2023</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It turns out that if you take this same memory-aware tiling approach when computing a scan, you can speed things up a lot.
With this optimization in place, Mamba (red) is now faster than FlashAttention-2 (blue) at all sequence lengths.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/scan-perf.png">
<figcaption>Credit: Gu and Dao, 2023</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These results show that as far as speed goes, Mamba is practical, operating at a faster speed than the fastest exact Transformers.
But is it any good at language modeling?</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Gu and Dao evaluate Mamba on a number of sequence modeling tasks involving language, genomics, and audio.
I’m not as familiar with the latter two domains, but the results look cool: Mamba establishes state-of-the-art performance when modeling DNA from the Human Genome project, and audio from a piano music dataset.
However, it’s the language results that have gotten many people excited.
A lot of the online discourse about Mamba has focused on Figure 4, which I’ve included below.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/mamba/the-pile-8192.png">
<figcaption>Credit: Gu and Dao, 2023</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this graph, model size increases to the right, and language modeling performance improves as you go further down.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>
This means that the best models should be down and to the left: small (and therefore fast), and also very good at modeling language.
Since Gu and Dao are academics, they don’t have thousands of GPUs available to train a GPT-4-sized model, so they made this comparison by training a bunch of smaller models, around 125M to 1.3B parameters.
As the graph above shows, the results look really promising.
When compared to other models of similar sizes, Mamba appears to be the best at modeling language.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed writing this blogpost, as I think Mamba innovates on language modeling in a pretty unique and interesting way!
Unfortunately, a few reviewers didn’t agree: Gu and Dao planned to present Mamba at ICLR in May, but their paper was <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=AL1fq05o7H&amp;noteId=fSWIfBSjdu" target="\_blank">rejected</a> a couple weeks ago, causing some bewildered reactions online.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Mamba apparently was rejected !? (<a href="https://t.co/bjtmZimFsS">https://t.co/bjtmZimFsS</a>)</p><p>Honestly I don't even understand. If this gets rejected, what chance do us 🤡 s have.</p></div>— Sasha Rush (@srush_nlp) <a href="https://twitter.com/srush_nlp/status/1750526956452577486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2024</a></blockquote>


<p>I would guess Gu and Dao are working now on the next version of the paper, and I would also imagine some companies with more GPUs than they know what to do with are currently trying to figure out whether Mamba’s performance holds up at larger model sizes.
As we continue to want models that can process more and more tokens at once, linear-time models such as Mamba might someday provide an answer if they can demonstrate good performance.
Until then, we can keep hacking away on our lame, old-school Transformers.</p>


<p><sup id="fn1">1. Faster Transformers such as <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/02/gemini-15-available-for-private-preview-in-google-ai-studio.html" target="_blank">Gemini 1.5</a> are almost certainly using Attention modifications, e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01889" target="_blank">RingAttention</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453" target="_blank">StreamingLLM</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16236" target="_blank">Linear Attention</a>. <a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<sup id="fn2">2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)#Convolution" target="_blank">CNNs flip the kernel</a> to perform convolution, which is why \(\mathbf{\bar{K}}\) looks backwards compared to the left-hand vector from our derivation of \(y_3\). <a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<sup id="fn3">3. In this table, \(\boldsymbol{L}\) denotes sequence length, \(\boldsymbol{B}\) denotes batch size, \(\boldsymbol{H}\) denotes the model’s hidden size, and tildes denote log factors. Don’t worry about the math too much for the purpose of this blogpost. <a href="#ref3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<sup id="fn4">4. In reality it’s <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2022-01-14-s4-3" target="_blank">a little more complicated</a> than this: the continuous \(\mathbf{A}\) is constant, while our discretization parameter \(\Delta\) is input-dependent. \(\mathbf{\bar{A}}\) is therefore input-dependent as a result of discretization. <a href="#ref4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<sup id="fn5">5. Mamba’s recurrence and the prefix sum are “similar” because importantly, Mamba’s recurrence is a linear transformation of its inputs. This is not true of RNNs, which is why we can’t use a parallel scan to train RNNs. <a href="#ref5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<sup id="fn6">6. If you read footnote 1, note that FlashAttention/FlashAttention-2 is a different type of Attention modification because unlike those examples, FlashAttention is <em>numerically equivalent</em> to standard Attention. It’s faster, but it yields the exact same outputs. FlashAttention’s authors refer to this as computing “exact Attention.” <a href="#ref6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<sup id="fn7">7. See footnote 6. <a href="#ref7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<sup id="fn8">8. Perplexity, shown on the y axis, is a common measure of language modeling performance. If you’re given the first part of a sentence and asked to predict the next word, you can think of perplexity as a value indicating how “perplexed” you are when you are shown the right answer. For example, if you are given the sequence “I went for a walk outside”, you shouldn’t be too surprised when the next word is “today.” Lower values indicate you are less perplexed, and therefore have a better understanding of how language works. <a href="#ref8" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text.">↩</a></sup>

<p><span>Many years ago, Loren Pankratz </span>got a call from a rare book dealer. The man was at the end of his career, he told Pankratz, and had a special book to sell. It had been passed down from his grandfather, and perhaps only three other copies existed in the world. He thought Pankratz, a former professor of psychology in Oregon who collects books on cons and frauds, might be interested. Pankratz bought the book, which was in German, and it sat on his shelf for years, unread. Then, years later, he met a translator who helped him understand the gem he was holding onto.</p>
<p>The book was a guide for Germans planning to immigrate to America in the early 20th century. Part guide, part warning, it outlined dozens of scams that a newcomer to the United States might find when they stepped off the boat.</p>
<p>Written by inventor-turned-journalist William Lange and published in 1912, it was called <em>Modern Swindles: A romp through early 20th century con-games, frauds, and fallacies. </em>Pankratz published it for the first time in English in 2022.</p>
<p>The chapter titled “The Con of the Matchmaker” describes how American con artists published their own newspapers, filled with ads for women looking for husbands. Anyone who answered such an ad would have their finances scrutinized and then wrested from them by a so-called marriage broker, with no actual wife at the end of the ordeal. A few pages later, Lange warns readers of the shifty sort who sells a fine watch and then swaps it for an older, less expensive one at the end of a transaction.</p>

<p>German immigration to the United States peaked in the 1880s, and by the 1910s, some 2.3 million German-born immigrants were living in cities across America. Like many new arrivals from abroad in this period, many Germans were coming from farms and industrial areas, directly into big cities such as St. Louis and Cincinnati. Where they came from, most people stayed close to home, where they largely knew the people around them and there were few surprises. Lange, working in cities throughout the Midwest, likely collected his stories of American cons from his fellow newspaper reporters.</p>
<p>“They weren’t ready for the con games that would be available in America,” says Pankratz. “In America you could dress up like anybody. You could be a lowlife, put on fancy clothes, and pretend to be someone else. You couldn’t do that in Germany. Everyone knew who you were and what status you were. The immigrant faced a whole new challenge of identifying and understanding who was in front of you, and that person could be there to take your money.”</p>
<p>Lange’s advice isn’t predicated on religious morals or fear mongering—each chapter is a lesson on being thoughtful. If something sounds too good for it to be true—a good deal on an expensive watch or a wife eager to please—it likely is.</p>

<p>Pankratz began collecting books on cons nearly 50 years ago, and now has more than 800 in his library. But the dealer who sold him this book had been right—he has never come across another guide of this kind, specifically written for immigrants arriving in America. Such books would have been widely useful. At the time, Italian immigrants were particularly targeted by scammers, including one of their own: Charles Ponzi, a schemer who stole millions with his eponymous investment fraud.</p>
<p>In America, an endless stream of books were published on the subject, though not targeted to specific immigrant groups. Written by police detectives, preachers, and reformers, they warned of the sins of New York City in particular: prostitution, elaborate cons, gambling cheats. Some would be applicable across the country, others were oddly specific. One was geared not at city dwellers but rural farmers, warning them of scams such as door-to-door salesmen offering seeds that don’t germinate and chickens that never arrive.</p>
<p>More than a century after <em>Modern Swindles</em>, there is no shortage of books attempting to help us avoid the latest con. In the recent <em>Nobody’s Fool: Why We Get Taken in and What We Can Do About It</em>, two cognitive scientists, Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, take a hard look at how our brains are primed to believe. From targeted advertising to misleading scientific studies, we often absorb what’s in front of us without questioning what information is left out. Take, for example, an advertisement for a financial adviser who brags about picking Amazon and Tesla before they were well known. Few would think to probe deeper: What bad stocks did he invest in? And what good stocks did he miss?</p>

<p>Our weakness is our otherwise-helpful ability to focus intently on what’s presented to us, argue Simons and Chabris in the opening chapter. “This downside of focus creates one of the oldest and easiest ways for frauds, hucksters, and marketers to fool us into making bad choices,” they write. “They don’t have to hide critical information from us—they only need to omit it, and count on us not to think about it ourselves.”</p>
<p>As a society, we hold a certain admiration for the inventiveness of such schemes and schemers—think about the exploits of con artists that have made their way to film, from <em>The Music Man</em> and <em>The Hustler</em> to <em>Catch Me If You Can</em> and <em>Inventing Anna</em>. And, like the scams themselves, that’s nothing new. In the 1896 <em>Frauds of America: How they are worked and how to foil them</em>, author E.G. Redmond writes, “The country is filled with adventurers, rascals great and small, with men so industrious in uncanny lines as to cause one to admire the persistent pluck with which they energetically go ahead to their own ruin, employing faculties for their own destruction which rightfully utilized might make them not only solid and respectable citizens, but brilliant and impressive.”</p>
<p>Today, our scams span far wider than authors could have imagined at the turn of the 20th century—thank the internet for that. But <em>Modern Swindles</em> still lives up to its name. Even if the precise cons are longer applicable, their trademarks are the same—an offer too good to be true, a bait-and-switch, a cut-rate deal. The warnings are as relevant to a modern suburban family in Phoenix as they were to an early 20th-century immigrant from Schleswig-Holstein.</p>

<p>In Lange’s chapter on matchmaker cons, Pankratz makes this point via a footnote in the translation. In 2019, there were 25,000 reports of romantic cons filed with the Federal Trade Commission, for a total loss of $200 million. By 2022, that realm had skyrocketed to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/new-ftc-data-reveals-top-lies-told-romance-scammers">70,000 people scammed out of $1.3 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The human brain is more apt to believe than to doubt, says Pankratz, who has spent decades studying the psychology of deception. “The mind automatically goes into belief mode and you have to pause to monitor what’s going on and see that there are things that don’t quite make sense,” he adds. “You have to ask, ‘Why is it this way?’”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Dogs regularly make top-10 lists of the world’s smartest animals. As any pet owner has likely noticed, though, some dogs—like some people—are sharper than others. And a few might even be, in canine terms, geniuses. As researchers describe today in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, certain dogs are capable of learning the names for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47864-5">more than 100 different toys</a>. Remarkably, most of the dogs in the study seemed to do this spontaneously, without any special training from humans.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“Owners just notice one day that their dog knows the name of toys,” says the paper’s lead author Shany Dror, a doctoral candidate in ethology at Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary. “Someone says, ‘Pizza,’ and their dog suddenly comes with the pizza toy.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Language is integral to how human beings think, communicate and collectively function, yet questions abound about the evolutionary origins of this behavior. Comparing and contrasting other species’ abilities to comprehend words and phrases can be a useful method for learning more about how human language came to be. Most of these studies to date have focused on apes or dolphins, but results can be complicated by the fact that such investigations have often involved animals in captivity instead of in the wild.</p><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>.

Only a few researchers have tried to explore the origin of that difference. In 2004 scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, reported that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15192233/">a border collie named Rico</a> knew the words for more than 200 different items. In the nearly 20 years since the paper on Rico was published, however, researchers outside of Dror’s group have only found six dogs that demonstrated similar abilities, which has limited the scope of studies that have been performed.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Dror, who is also a professional dog trainer, wanted to expand the field by finding more dogs with an aptitude for language. First, she tried to train 34 dogs from typical households to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93581-2">learn a set of vocabulary words</a>. “That was a miserable failure,” she says. “We all worked really hard, but after three months, they didn’t even know the names of two toys.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">So rather than trying to teach dogs, she decided to <a href="https://geniusdogchallenge.com/how-to-apply/">put out a call for owners</a> of particularly astute canines to come forward. She and her colleagues also launched the “<a href="https://geniusdogchallenge.com/the-challenge/">Genius Dog Challenge</a>,” a live YouTube-broadcasted game that pits smart dogs against one another to see which possesses the greatest linguistic prowess. After five years, the researchers identified 41 “gifted word learner dogs,” or ones that knew the names of at least five toys. The dogs came from nine different countries on three continents and included a range of breeds. More than half were border collies, but the team also documented language abilities in a few mixed-breed and purebred dogs, including three Labradors, two Pomeranians, and a Pekingese, Shih Tzu, corgi, toy poodle, German shepherd, and cross between an Australian cattle dog and a miniature Australian shepherd.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">When Dror first gathered the data, which were validated on video calls online, the 41 dogs knew an average of 29 words for toys, and the top performer among them knew 86. From that baseline, the dogs demonstrated an “amazing” learning speed, Dror says, with owners reporting that dogs needed only five minutes or so to learn a new toy. Proving that old dogs—or at least older dogs—<em>can</em> learn new tricks, the canines continued to expand their vocabulary over the years. By the time the researchers were finalizing their new paper, 16 owners reported that their dogs now knew the names of more than 100 toys.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The new research represents “a very exciting step forward” for the field, says Heidi Lyn, a comparative psychologist at the University of South Alabama, who was not involved in the work. “Overall, I think this study is a great example of the next wave of potential for citizen science and for understanding our canine companions and their ability to understand us.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Dror and her colleagues do not know what differentiates canine wordsmiths from average dogs. The animals in the study were very motivated to play with toys and also paid close attention when their owners spoke. But as Dror points out, these are hardly unique traits among dogs. She suspects that dogs’ early rearing environment, combined with some form of natural talent, plays a role in whether they become gifted word learners, but “we still do not know the elements that compose each of these factors and how the two interact,” she says.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Irene Pepperberg, a comparative psychologist at Boston University, who was not involved in the research, says that it’s interesting to see in the study that not all working dogs—or those bred to be herders, hunters or trackers—can become gifted word learners. Yet almost all gifted word learners are working breeds. Those include the obvious breeds such as shepherds and labs but also less obvious ones such as poodles, which were used in militaries in the 17th century through World War II, and Pomeranians, which were originally bred as watchdogs. “At least until recently, when beauty standards have evolved and probably affected the gene pool, breeds were carefully selected to learn and respond to aspects of human speech over thousands of years,” Pepperberg says.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Dror and her colleagues hope to pursue follow-up studies that delve into the factors that contribute to certain dogs’ talent for language and examine how the animals’ approach to learning is similar or different to that of human children. The team wants to expand its sample size, too, so Dror encourages owners who think their dog may be a genius to reach out. “We’re always interested in meeting new dog owners and meeting their dogs,” she says.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I got access to Gemini Pro 1.5 this week, a new private beta LLM from Google that is significantly better than previous models the company has released. (This is not the same as the publicly available version of Gemini that made headlines for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079371/google-ai-gemini-generative-inaccurate-historical" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refusing to create pictures of white people</a>. That will be forgotten in a week; this will be relevant for months and years to come.)</p><p>Gemini 1.5 Pro read an entire novel and told me in detail about a scene hidden in the middle of it. It read a whole codebase and suggested a place to insert a new feature—with sample code. It even read through all of my highlights on reading app Readwise and selected one for an essay I’m writing.</p><p>Somehow, Google figured out how to build an AI model that can comfortably accept up to <em>1 million tokens</em> with each prompt. For context, you could fit all of Eliezer Yudkowsky’s 1,967-page opus <em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality </em>into <em>every message</em> you send to Gemini. (Why would you want to do this, you ask? For science, of course.)</p><p>Gemini Pro 1.5 is a serious achievement for two reasons:&nbsp;</p><p>1) <strong>Gemini Pro 1.5’s context window is far bigger than the next closest models. </strong>While Gemini Pro 1.5 is comfortably consuming entire works of rationalist doomer fanfiction, GPT-4 Turbo can only accept 128,000 tokens. This is about enough to accept Peter Singer’s comparatively slim 354-page volume <em>Animal Liberation, </em>one of the founding texts of the effective altruism movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Last week GPT-4’s context window seemed big; this week—after using Gemini Pro 1.5—it seems like an amount that would curl Derek Zoolander’s hair:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_SKrl7Ap8_CshyMPZzU6g5BYJQiO4qovUOxHxtEwsnMKgt3hyE62jLlphOGOnymq3IWijCRw52Qa2CHLCV0P2ayN_vW0Ty3vKQCvEHUJjyMTwFDwOlRTmvu3vzELxeBX3KmMyk0rEGD3-OJbprsbWClo.jpeg?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_SKrl7Ap8_CshyMPZzU6g5BYJQiO4qovUOxHxtEwsnMKgt3hyE62jLlphOGOnymq3IWijCRw52Qa2CHLCV0P2ayN_vW0Ty3vKQCvEHUJjyMTwFDwOlRTmvu3vzELxeBX3KmMyk0rEGD3-OJbprsbWClo.jpeg"></a></p><p>﻿2) <strong>Gemini Pro 1.5 can use the whole context window. </strong>In my testing, Gemini Pro 1.5 handled huge prompts wonderfully. It’s a big leap forward from current models, whose performance degrades significantly as prompts get bigger. Even though their context windows are smaller, they don’t perform well as prompts approach their size limits. They tend to forget what you said at the beginning of the prompt or miss key information located in the middle. This doesn’t happen with Gemini.</p><p>These context window improvements are so important because they make the model smarter and easier to work with out of the box. It might be possible to get the same performance from GPT-4, but you’d have to write a lot of extra code in order to do so. I’ll explain why in a moment, but for now you should know: Gemini means you don’t need any of that infrastructure. It just works.</p><p>Let’s walk through an example, and then talk about the new use cases that Gemini Pro 1.5 enables.&nbsp;</p><div>

<h2>Why size matters (when it comes to a context window)</h2><p>I’ve been reading Chaim Potok’s 1967 novel, <em>The Chosen. </em>It features a classic enemies-to-lovers storyline about two Brooklyn Jews who find friendship and personal growth in the midst of a horrible softball accident. (As a Jew, let me say that yes, “horrible softball accident” is the most Jewish inciting incident in a book since Moses parted the Red Sea.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the book, Reuven Malter and his Orthodox yeshiva softball team are playing against a Hasidic team led by Danny Saunders, the son of the rebbe. In a pivotal early scene, Danny is at bat and full of rage. He hits a line drive toward Reuven, who catches the ball with his face. It smashes his glasses, spraying shards of glass into his eye and nearly blinding him. Despite his injury, Reuven catches the ball. The first thing his teammates care about is not his eye or the traumatic head injury he just suffered—it’s that he made the catch.</p><p>If you’re a writer like me and you’re typing an anecdote like the one I just wrote, you might want to put into your article the quote from one of Reuven’s teammates right after he caught the ball to make it come alive.</p><p>If you go to ChatGPT for help, it’s not going to do a good job initially: </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_5m9XaeCjJatECMsZPWfHiETRxcnEuqNzAsS-7tLNXfldqs5t4B5cFb69KayzRsHqDp7ILGdT7_Bm4e2r47Rk2l157vTp-upj0hxz4Uv25qGIRbQW5CJgaxsqIqNcITFUT4IcVxRaY8UF8yAK2Yz7nUg.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_5m9XaeCjJatECMsZPWfHiETRxcnEuqNzAsS-7tLNXfldqs5t4B5cFb69KayzRsHqDp7ILGdT7_Bm4e2r47Rk2l157vTp-upj0hxz4Uv25qGIRbQW5CJgaxsqIqNcITFUT4IcVxRaY8UF8yAK2Yz7nUg.png"></a></p><p>This is wrong. Because, as I said, Sydney Goldberg did not care about Reuven’s injury—he cared about the game! But all is not lost. If you give ChatGPT a plain text version of <em>The Chosen</em> and ask the same question, it’ll return a great answer:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_RzVSwQXYEzkc1-jRgMbJI0w_MORMnpOxiUxuFsor9W8aQc89Kg2rNQwUbISr2tZYhoMoY3ytH3PzyChjzWCAeosSW-gSs3-cQ7eWVmKGoOVJWBYajK2sq_pSAY7-VWKT5nEYvCc7AhirdVZo8tkDOV4.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_RzVSwQXYEzkc1-jRgMbJI0w_MORMnpOxiUxuFsor9W8aQc89Kg2rNQwUbISr2tZYhoMoY3ytH3PzyChjzWCAeosSW-gSs3-cQ7eWVmKGoOVJWBYajK2sq_pSAY7-VWKT5nEYvCc7AhirdVZo8tkDOV4.png"></a></p><p>This is correct! (It also confirms for us that Sydney Goldberg has his priorities straight.) So what happened?</p><p>ChatGPT behaved as if I’d given it an open-book test. We can improve ChatGPT’s responses by, when asking it a question, giving it a little notecard with some extra information that it might use to answer it.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case we gave it an entire book to read through. But you’ll notice a problem: The entire book can’t fit into ChatGPT’s context window. So how does it work?</p><p>In order to answer my question, there’s a lot of code in ChatGPT that performs <strong>retrieval</strong>: It divides <em>The Chosen</em> up into small chunks through which it searches to find ones that seem relevant to the query. The retrieval code passes the original question, “What’s the first thing that Sydney Goldberg says to Reuven after he gets hit in the eye by the baseball?” <em>and</em> the most relevant sections of text it can find in the book to GPT-4, which produces an answer. (For a more detailed explanation, <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/how-to-build-a-chatbot-with-gpt-3?sid=35036" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read this piece</a>.)</p><p>Again, we have to pass GPT-4 <em>chunks</em> of text—not the whole book—because GPT-4 can only fit so much text into its context window. If you’re paying attention, you’ll see the problem: Because the context window is so small, the performance of our model for answering certain kinds of queries is bottle-necked by how good we are at searching for relevant pieces of information to give to the model. (I wrote about this phenomenon about a year ago <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-4-is-a-reasoning-engine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in this piece</a>.)</p><p>If our search functionality doesn’t turn up relevant text chunks, well, GPT-4’s answer won’t be good. It doesn’t matter how smart GPT-4 is—it’s only as good as the chunks we turn up.</p><p>Let’s say we’re picking up <em>The Chosen</em> after a few weeks. We’ve read the first two sections, and before we begin the third we want to get a summary of what’s already happened in the book. We upload it to ChatGPT and ask it to summarize:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_aiJO3PEKKuKHmxH_2-kkiz_dU--g3ziZiYLtVKnEdo0_DEW-cSQpAGanVh6zXG3hKbG9p-h0DTj7WPxBFw0xmg95Db1R0NbQcSjCJWES8ZLacB7zzJfcwK0uqP7Swn69urVtlj2Bv5mIaywHiRq1e58.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_aiJO3PEKKuKHmxH_2-kkiz_dU--g3ziZiYLtVKnEdo0_DEW-cSQpAGanVh6zXG3hKbG9p-h0DTj7WPxBFw0xmg95Db1R0NbQcSjCJWES8ZLacB7zzJfcwK0uqP7Swn69urVtlj2Bv5mIaywHiRq1e58.png"></a></p><p>ChatGPT gives us a vague answer that’s correct, but it’s not very detailed because it can’t fit enough of the book into its context window to output a great one.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s see what happens when we don’t have to divide the book up into chunks.&nbsp; Instead, we use Gemini, which can read through the entire book at once:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_5ndXV70ZOkhbkKS_SwjPvGjuGthtO8PtByUrwwegnG6mowFMMaL7gPszZywK2evsc0dbcDcT3SGzDlRfHsC-KSJg0CgNDjMXuSZSfD-gYkcH17guW3WCsCw5VxDhbumEuRjgpgUwDiBPs1dhP5W_v2s.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_5ndXV70ZOkhbkKS_SwjPvGjuGthtO8PtByUrwwegnG6mowFMMaL7gPszZywK2evsc0dbcDcT3SGzDlRfHsC-KSJg0CgNDjMXuSZSfD-gYkcH17guW3WCsCw5VxDhbumEuRjgpgUwDiBPs1dhP5W_v2s.png"></a></p><p>You’ll notice that Gemini’s answer is significantly more detailed and provides key plot points from the book that ChatGPT can’t give. (Technically, we could probably get a similar summary out of GPT-4 if we devised a clever system for chunking and summarizing it, but it would take a lot of work, and Gemini makes that work unnecessary.)</p><p>Gemini’s use cases aren’t limited to reading novels of self-discovery through softball accidents. There are hundreds of others that it unlocks that were previously difficult to do with ChatGPT, or with a custom solution.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, at Every, we’re incubating a software product that can help <a href="https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1735398395752198442" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">you organize your files with AI</a>. I wrote the original code for the file organizer, and our lead engineer, Avishek, wrote a GPT-4 integration. He wanted to know where to hook the GPT-4 integration into the existing codebase. So we uploaded it to Gemini and asked:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_XR6ONC4CxNAXqwkjLonwUfQ6JM7Z5TfgaxIuxg9Vty2U9lTW3In_mYypbLbW4j6Uz_hROYJMCKvw6Dn_VYEmycnQzI0WknHp98cC1qaWJVd8mFamw8F0GRbSEPCwjeemoc-9J_qEdvD69bKpV60A-0A.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_XR6ONC4CxNAXqwkjLonwUfQ6JM7Z5TfgaxIuxg9Vty2U9lTW3In_mYypbLbW4j6Uz_hROYJMCKvw6Dn_VYEmycnQzI0WknHp98cC1qaWJVd8mFamw8F0GRbSEPCwjeemoc-9J_qEdvD69bKpV60A-0A.png"></a></p><p>It found the right place in the code and wrote the code Avishek needed in order to complete the integration. This is something just short of magic, dramatically accelerating developer productivity, especially on larger projects.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there, either. I’ve been writing for a long time about how transformer models might become <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-4-a-copilot-for-the-mind?sid=35073" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">copilots for the mind</a>—and <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/the-end-of-organizing?sid=35074" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">end our need to organize our notes</a> forever. Gemini Pro 1.5 is a step in that direction. For example, recently I was writing a piece about an effect I’ve noticed that I’m calling “I can do it myself” syndrome, where people tend to not use ChatGPT and similar tools because they feel like they can get the same task done more quickly, at better quality, if they do it themselves. It’s like inexperienced managers who micromanage their reports to the point of doing most of the work themselves, guaranteeing it’s done the way they want it to, but sacrificing a lot of leverage in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted an anecdote to open the essay with, so I asked Gemini to find one in my reading highlights. It came up with something perfect:﻿</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_2guBdWnLlBm7smAIdqUFYI_wGMqFBIq_Qpg04ujMgd7kl0P12I1pybXHe80ayLjaeG-2MF7AdGx74i0EcRGOqEG9tTioDP_J5BvF9QdTn-4aUG-gdIygvJQoYRZaOSfK8PCRbXlN04r8C320o3eO4vk.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2987/optimized_2guBdWnLlBm7smAIdqUFYI_wGMqFBIq_Qpg04ujMgd7kl0P12I1pybXHe80ayLjaeG-2MF7AdGx74i0EcRGOqEG9tTioDP_J5BvF9QdTn-4aUG-gdIygvJQoYRZaOSfK8PCRbXlN04r8C320o3eO4vk.png"></a></p><p>I could not have found a better anecdote, and it’s not a generic one—it’s from my own reading history and taste.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Except, </em></strong>I later learned that<strong> </strong>the anecdote is made up. The general thrust of the idea is true—Luce did run both the editorial and business sides of Time—so it is pointing me in the right direction. But after I reviewed my Readwise highlights I couldn't find the exact quote Gemini came up with. (I only figured this out after Gwen and other savvy Hacker News commenters pointed it out in a previous version of this article.)</p><p>So, Gemini is not perfect. You do need to check its work. But if you're careful it's a powerful tool.</p><p>Again, all of this comes back to the context window. This kind of performance is only possible because with Gemini we don’t need to search for or sort relevant pieces of information before we hand it to the model. We just feed it everything we have and let the model do the rest.</p><p>It’s much easier to work with large context windows, and they can deliver far more consistent and powerful results without extra retrieval code. The question is: What’s next?</p><h2>The future of large context models</h2><p>About a year ago <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-4-is-a-reasoning-engine?sid=35075" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I wrote</a>:</p><p>“People have been saying that data is the new oil for a long time. But I do think, in this case, if you’ve spent a lot of time collecting and curating your own personal set of notes, articles, books, and highlights it’ll be the equivalent of having a topped-off oil drum in your bedroom during an OPEC crisis.”</p><p>Gemini is the perfect example of why this is true. With its large context window, all of the personal data you’ve been collecting is at the tip of your fingers ready to be deployed at the right place and the right time, in whatever task you need it for. The more personal data you have—even if it’s disorganized—the better.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few important caveats to note, though:</p><p>First, this is a private beta that I can use for free. These models often perform differently (read: worse) when they are released publicly, and we don’t know how Gemini will perform when it’s tasked with operating at Google scale. There’s also no telling how much pumping 1 million tokens is going to cost into Gemini when it’s live. Over time the cost of using it will likely significantly decrease, but it will take a while.</p><p>Second, Gemini is pretty slow. Many requests took a minute or more to return, so it’s not a drop-in replacement for every LLM use case. It’s for the heavy lifting that you can’t get done with ChatGPT, which you probably don’t need to do on a regular basis. I would expect speed to increase significantly over time as well, but it’s still not there yet.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI has some catching up to do, and I’ll be watching to see how they respond. But the other players on my mind—companies like Langchain, LlamaIndex (where I’m an investor), Pinecone, and Weaviate—are to some degree betting on <em>retrieval</em> being an important component of LLM usage. They either provide the library that does the chunking and searching for information to pass to the LLM, or the datastore that keeps the information searchable and safe. As I mentioned earlier, retrieval is less relevant when you have a large context window, because you can input&nbsp; all of your information into each request.</p><p>You might think those companies are in trouble. Gemini’s huge context window <em>does</em> make some of what they’re building less important for basic queries. But I think retrieval will still be important long-term.&nbsp;</p><p>If there’s one thing we know about humanity, it’s that our ambition scales with the tools we have available to satisfy it. If 1 million token context models become the norm, we’ll learn to fill them. Every chat prompt will include all of our emails, and all of our journal entries, and maybe a book or two for good measure. Retrieval will still be used to figure out which 1 million tokens are the most relevant, rather than what it’s used for now: to find which 1,000 tokens are the most relevant.</p><p>It’s an exciting time. Expect more experiments from me in the weeks to come!</p><hr><p><strong><em>Dan Shipper</em></strong><em> is the co-founder and CEO of Every, where he writes the </em><a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Chain of Thought</em></a><em> column and hosts the podcast </em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5qX1nRTaFsfWdmdj5JWO1G" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How Do You Use ChatGPT?</a><em> You can follow him on X at </em><a href="https://twitter.com/danshipper" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>@danshipper</em></a><em> and on </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danshipper/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>, and Every on X at </em><a href="https://twitter.com/every" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>@every</em></a><em> and on </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/everyinc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Correction: </strong>An earlier version of this article did not note that the Henry Luce quote was hallucinated.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/google/gemma.cpp">https://github.com/google/gemma.cpp</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39481554">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">gemma.cpp</h2>
<p dir="auto">gemma.cpp is a lightweight, standalone C++ inference engine for the Gemma
foundation models from Google.</p>
<p dir="auto">For additional information about Gemma, see
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma" rel="nofollow">ai.google.dev/gemma</a>. Model weights, including gemma.cpp
specific artifacts, are <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma" rel="nofollow">available on
kaggle</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who is this project for?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Modern LLM inference engines are sophisticated systems, often with bespoke
capabilities extending beyond traditional neural network runtimes. With this
comes opportunities for research and innovation through co-design of high level
algorithms and low-level computation. However, there is a gap between
deployment-oriented C++ inference runtimes, which are not designed for
experimentation, and Python-centric ML research frameworks, which abstract away
low-level computation through compilation.</p>
<p dir="auto">gemma.cpp provides a minimalist implementation of Gemma 2B and 7B models,
focusing on simplicity and directness rather than full generality. This is
inspired by vertically-integrated model implementations such as
<a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml">ggml</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c">llama.c</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/srush/llama2.rs">llama.rs</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">gemma.cpp targets experimentation and research use cases. It is intended to be
straightforward to embed in other projects with minimal dependencies and also
easily modifiable with a small ~2K LoC core implementation (along with ~4K LoC
of supporting utilities). We use the <a href="https://github.com/google/highway">Google
Highway</a> Library to take advantage of
portable SIMD for CPU inference.</p>
<p dir="auto">For production-oriented edge deployments we recommend standard deployment
pathways using Python frameworks like JAX, Keras, PyTorch, and Transformers
(<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma" rel="nofollow">all model variations here</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Community contributions large and small are welcome. This project follows
<a href="https://opensource.google.com/conduct/" rel="nofollow">Google's Open Source Community
Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Active development is currently done on the <code>dev</code> branch. Please open pull
requests targeting <code>dev</code> branch instead of <code>main</code>, which is intended to be more
stable.</em></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quick Start</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">System requirements</h3>
<p dir="auto">Before starting, you should have installed:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://cmake.org/" rel="nofollow">CMake</a></li>
<li><a href="https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html" rel="nofollow">Clang C++ compiler</a>, supporting at
least C++17.</li>
<li><code>tar</code> for extracting archives from Kaggle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 1: Obtain model weights and tokenizer from Kaggle</h3>
<p dir="auto">Visit <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma" rel="nofollow">the Gemma model page on
Kaggle</a> and select <code>Model Variations |&gt; Gemma C++</code>. On this tab, the <code>Variation</code> dropdown includes the options below.
Note bfloat16 weights are higher fidelity, while 8-bit switched floating point
weights enable faster inference.</p>
<p dir="auto">2B instruction-tuned (<code>it</code>) and pre-trained (<code>pt</code>) models:</p>

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">We <em>recommend starting with <code>2b-it-sfp</code></em> to get up and running.</p>
</div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 2: Extract Files</h3>
<p dir="auto">After filling out the consent form, the download should proceed to retrieve a
tar archive file <code>archive.tar.gz</code>. Extract files from <code>archive.tar.gz</code> (this can
take a few minutes):</p>

<p dir="auto">This should produce a file containing model weights such as <code>2b-it-sfp.sbs</code> and
a tokenizer file (<code>tokenizer.spm</code>). You may want to move these files to a
convenient directory location (e.g. the <code>build/</code> directory in this repo).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 3: Build</h3>
<p dir="auto">The build system uses <a href="https://cmake.org/" rel="nofollow">CMake</a>. To build the gemma inference
runtime, create a build directory and generate the build files using <code>cmake</code>
from the top-level project directory:</p>

<p dir="auto">Then run <code>make</code> to build the <code>./gemma</code> executable:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd build
make -j [number of parallel threads to use] gemma"><pre><span>cd</span> build
make -j [number of parallel threads to use] gemma</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For example, <code>make -j 8 gemma</code>. If this is successful, you should now have a
<code>gemma</code> executable in the <code>build/</code> directory.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">On Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) users should set the number of
parallel threads to 1. Using a larger number may result in errors.</p>
</div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 4: Run</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can now run <code>gemma</code> from inside the <code>build/</code> directory.</p>

The code defines two C++ structs, `ConfigGemma7B` and `ConfigGemma2B`, which are used for configuring a deep learning model.

**ConfigGemma7B**:

* `seq_len`: Stores the length of the sequence to be processed. It's set to 7168.
* `vocab_size`: Stores the size of the vocabulary, which is 256128.
* `n_layers`: Number of layers in the deep learning model. It's set to 28.
* `dim_model`: Dimension of the model's internal representation. It's set to 3072.
* `dim_ffw_hidden`: Dimension of the feedforward and recurrent layers' hidden representations. It's set to 16 * 3072 / 2.

**ConfigGemma2B**:

* `seq_len`: Stores the length of the sequence to be processed. It's also set to 7168.
* `vocab_size`: Size of the vocabulary, which is 256128.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Nach langer politischer Auseinandersetzung hat der Bundestag am <strong>Freitag, 23. Februar 2024,</strong> den Gesetzentwurf der Bundesregierung „<strong>zum kontrollierten Umgang mit Cannabis“</strong> (<a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/8704 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/087/2008704.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/8704</a>, <a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/8763 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/087/2008763.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/8763</a>) gebilligt. Mit dem Gesetz soll Erwachsenen künftig der Besitz von bis zu 50 Gramm Cannabis für den Eigenkonsum im privaten Raum erlaubt werden. Im öffentlichen Raum soll die Höchstgrenze bei 25 Gramm liegen. In namentlicher Abstimmung votierten 407 Abgeordnete für das Gesetz, 226 stimmten dagegen und vier enthielten sich ihrer Stimme.</p><p>Zur Abstimmung hatten der Gesundheitsausschuss eine Beschlussempfehlung (<a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/10426 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/104/2010426.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/10426</a>) und der Haushaltsausschuss einen Bericht nach Paragraf 96 der Geschäftsordnung (<a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/10427 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/104/2010427.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/10427</a>) vorgelegt. Der Gesundheitsausschuss hatte in einer teils turbulenten und emotionalen Sitzung am Mittwoch, 21. Februar, noch einige Änderungen am Ursprungsentwurf beschlossen.</p><p>Anträge der CDU/CSU (<a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/8735 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/087/2008735.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/8735</a>) und der AfD (<a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/8869 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/088/2008869.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/8869</a>), die beide den Stopp der geplanten Legalisierung forderten, fanden beide keine Mehrheit. Gegen den Antrag der AfD stimmten alle übrigen Fraktionen des Hauses, für den Antrag der Union stimmte auch die AfD. Auch zu diesen Vorlagen hatte der Gesundheitsausschuss Beschlussempfehlungen abgegeben (<a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/10426 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/104/2010426.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/10426</a>).</p><h4>Gesetzentwurf der Bundesregierung</h4><p>Das Gesetz sieht den legalen Besitz und Konsum von Cannabis für Erwachsene vor. Ermöglicht wird nun der private Eigenanbau, der gemeinschaftliche nichtgewerbliche Eigenanbau und die kontrollierte Weitergabe von Cannabis durch Anbauvereinigungen. Mit dem Gesetz werde ein verantwortungsvoller Umgang mit Cannabis erleichtert, heißt es in der Begründung der Bundesregierung.</p><p>Das Gesetz zielt den Angaben zufolge darauf ab, zu einem verbesserten Gesundheitsschutz beizutragen, Aufklärung und Prävention zu stärken, den illegalen Markt für Cannabis einzudämmen sowie den Kinder- und Jugendschutz zu verbessern. Die aktuelle Entwicklung zeige, dass der Konsum von Cannabis trotz der bestehenden Verbotsregelungen weiter ansteige. Das vom Schwarzmarkt bezogene Cannabis sei oft mit einem erhöhten Gesundheitsrisiko verbunden, da der Gehalt des Wirkstoffs Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) unbekannt sei und giftige Beimengungen, Verunreinigungen sowie synthetische Cannabinoide enthalten sein könnten.</p><h4>Privater Cannabis-Anbau</h4><p>Künftig möglich sein soll zudem der private Eigenanbau von bis zu drei Cannabispflanzen zum Eigenkonsum. Privat angebautes Cannabis muss jedoch vor dem Zugriff durch Kinder und Jugendliche geschützt werden. Außerdem dürfen nichtgewerbliche Anbauvereinigungen Cannabis künftig anbauen und an ihre Mitglieder zum Eigenkonsum weitergeben.</p><p>Dafür gelten strenge Vorschriften. So werden für die Anbauvereinigungen maximal 500 Mitglieder zugelassen, die ihren Wohnsitz oder gewöhnlichen Aufenthalt in Deutschland haben müssen. Zulässig ist nur die Mitgliedschaft in einer Anbauvereinigung. In den Anbauvereinigungen darf Cannabis nur in begrenztem Umfang an Mitglieder weitergegeben werden, wobei die Mitgliedschaft und das Alter zu überprüfen sind.</p><h4>Begrenzte Ausgabe von Cannabis</h4><p>An Mitglieder weitergegeben werden dürfen maximal 25 Gramm pro Tag oder 50 Gramm pro Monat. Die Ausgabe von Cannabis an Heranwachsende zwischen 18 und 21 Jahren ist auf 30 Gramm pro Monat mit einer Begrenzung des THC-Gehalts auf zehn Prozent zulässig. Konsumcannabis darf als Haschisch oder Marihuana nur in kontrollierter Qualität und in Reinform weitergegeben werden. In einer Schutzzone von 100 Metern um Anbauvereinigungen sowie Schulen, Kinder- und Jugendeinrichtungen, Kinderspielplätzen und öffentlich zugängliche Sportstätten wird der Konsum von Cannabis verboten.</p><p>Um vor allem Kinder und Jugendliche vor der Droge zu schützen, gilt ein allgemeines Werbe- und Sponsoringverbot für Konsumcannabis und Anbauvereinigungen. Geplant ist außerdem eine Stärkung der Prävention durch eine Aufklärungskampagne der Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung (BZgA) über die Wirkung und Risiken von Cannabis. Die Novelle soll nach vier Jahren auf ihre gesellschaftlichen Auswirkungen hin evaluiert werden. Es bleibt bei der Verschreibungspflicht für Medizinalcannabis.</p><p>Geplant ist ein gestuftes Inkrafttreten der Reform. So soll das Gesetz insgesamt am 1. April 2024 in Kraft treten. Die Vorschriften für den gemeinschaftlichen Eigenanbau in den sogenannten Anbauvereinigungen soll jedoch am 1. Juli 2024 in Kraft treten.&nbsp;</p><h4>Stellungnahme des Bundesrates</h4><p>In einer Stellungnahme hatte zuvor der Bundesrat seine Befürchtung vor hohen finanziellen Folgebelastungen der Länder durch Kontroll- und Vollzugs- sowie Präventions- und Interventionsaufgaben zum Ausdruck gebracht (<a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/8704 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/087/2008704.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/8704</a>). Als Beispiel angeführt wurde die Kontrolle der Anbauvereinigungen. Der Bundesrat bezweifelte auch die wirksame Kontrolle des zulässigen Höchstwertes von THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) und hält neue, hochpotente Cannabis-Sorten für möglich.</p><p>Die praktische Umsetzung der geplanten Jugendschutzzonen im öffentlichen Raum und Schutzvorkehrungen im privaten Raum war nach Einschätzung der Länderkammer ebenfalls kritisch zu hinterfragen. Hier deute sich ein strukturelles Vollzugsdefizit an. Schließlich wies der Bundesrat auf die Notwendigkeit hin, zulässige Grenzwerte für THC im Straßenverkehr festzulegen.</p><h4>Gegenäußerung der Bundesregierung</h4><p>Die Bundesregierung teilte die Bedenken des Bundesrates zum Vollzugsaufwand nicht, wie aus der entsprechenden Unterrichtung (<a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/8763 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/087/2008763.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/8763</a>) hervorgeht. So sei voraussichtlich erst nach fünf Jahren die geschätzte Gesamtzahl von 3.000 Anbauvereinigungen erreicht. Die Länder könnten die Personal- und Sachmittelkapazitäten sukzessive anpassen. Zudem erwartet der Bund mit der Entkriminalisierung hohe Einsparungen der Länder durch weniger Strafanzeigen und weniger Strafverfahren. Die eingesparten Mittel könnten für die Überwachung der Anbauvereinigungen sowie für die Suchtprävention eingesetzt werden.</p><p>Aufklärung und Prävention sowie gesetzliche Vorgaben für die Anbauvereinigungen trügen zu einem umfassenden Gesundheits- und Jugendschutz bei, heißt es in der Unterrichtung weiter. Was den zulässigen THC-Wert im Straßenverkehr betrifft, habe eine interdisziplinäre Expertengruppe des Bundesverkehrsministeriums das Ziel, Grenzwerte zu ermitteln. Nach Auffassung der Bundesregierung sei der THC-Grenzwert so zu bemessen, dass die Straßenverkehrssicherheit ausreichend gewahrt bleibe.</p><h4>Antrag der Union</h4><p>Die Unionsfraktion forderte, die geplante Cannabislegalisierung zu stoppen und die Bevölkerung über die Risiken der Droge aufzuklären. Der Entwurf des Cannabisgesetzes, der im August 2023 vom Kabinett beschlossen wurde, sei unverantwortlich und führe in die falsche Richtung, hieß es in dem Antrag (<a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/8735 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/087/2008735.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/8735</a>) der Fraktion. Insbesondere junge Menschen bis 25 Jahre seien durch den Konsum von Cannabis gefährdet, da bei ihnen die Entwicklung des Gehirns noch nicht abgeschlossen ist. Die klinische Forschung belege ungünstige Einflüsse intensiven Cannabiskonsums auf Gedächtnis-, Lern- und Erinnerungsleistungen, Aufmerksamkeit, Problemlösen, Denkleistung und Intelligenz. Bei vulnerablen Personen bestehe ferner ein dosisabhängiger Zusammenhang mit depressiven Störungen, Suizidalität, bipolaren Störungen, Angsterkrankungen sowie zusätzlichem Missbrauch von Alkohol und illegalen Drogen. Cannabiskonsum könne bei vulnerablen Personen Psychosen auslösen und den Verlauf schizophrener Psychosen verschlechtern.</p><p>Eine Legalisierung von privatem Anbau, Besitz und Konsum für alle Erwachsenen werde zu einer Ausweitung des Cannabiskonsums führen. Auch eine Entlastung der Justiz oder ein Zurückdrängen des Schwarzmarktes werde mit dem Gesetz nicht erreicht. Zu erwarten sei ein immenser Vollzugs- und Überwachungsaufwand. Vorgaben für den privaten Eigenanbau oder die Einhaltung von Konsumverbotszonen dürften kaum kontrollierbar sein. Die Abgeordneten forderten, das Vorhaben zur Legalisierung von Cannabis zu beenden. Dafür sollte eine geeignete Institution, wie etwa die Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung, mit einer langfristig angelegten Präventionskampagne beauftragt werden, um auf die Risiken beim Konsum von Cannabis aufmerksam zu machen. Ferner sollte die Forschung intensiviert werden, die sich mit den gesundheitlichen Folgen von nichtmedizinischem Cannabisgebrauch befasst. Unterstützt werden sollte zudem die Erforschung des medizinischen Nutzens und der Nebenwirkungen von Cannabisarzneimitteln.</p><h4>Antrag der AfD</h4><p>Die geplante Legalisierung von Cannabis zu Genusszwecken sollte nach Ansicht der AfD-Fraktion aufgegeben werden. Zugleich sollte für das Medizinalcannabis eine wissenschaftliche Nutzenbewertung eingeleitet werden, hieß es in dem Antrag der Fraktion (<a title="Die PDF-Datei Drucksache 20/8869 öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster" href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/088/2008869.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i></i>20/8869</a>). Bei der geplanten Legalisierung von Cannabis werde die Gefahr, die für Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene unter 25 Jahren ausgehe, unterschätzt. Die Adoleszenz stelle eine entscheidende Phase in der Entwicklung des Gehirns dar. Untersuchungen deuteten darauf hin, dass sich der Konsum von Cannabis nachteilig auf die Reifung von Nervenzellen und Nervenverbindungen auswirken könne.</p><p>Insbesondere bei regelmäßigem Cannabiskonsum in der Jugend bestehe das Risiko einer Beeinträchtigung der kognitiven Fähigkeiten bis hin zu einem erhöhten Risiko für Depressionen oder Suizidgedanken. Medizinalcannabis genieße in der Bevölkerung einen guten Ruf, es sei aber kein Wundermittel. Ein Verfahren nach dem Arzneimittelmarktneuordnungsgesetz (AMNOG) würde das Medizinalcannabis entmystifizieren, indem es ergebnisoffen Nutzen sowie Risiken objektiviere und den Erstattungspreis senke. Die Abgeordneten forderten in ihrem Antrag, die Pläne zur Legalisierung von Cannabis zu Genusszwecken vollständig aufzugeben und Medizinalcannabis dem AMNOG-Verfahren zur Nutzenbewertung und Preisfindung von Arzneimitteln zu unterziehen.

        		<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Despite otherwise seeming to work correctly, I can’t monitor a Back-UPS BX1600MI in Linux without seeing a constant stream of spurious battery detach/reattach and power fail/restore events that last less than 2 seconds each. I’ve tried multiple computers and multiple UPSes of that model. It doesn’t happen in their own proprietary Windows software, so I think they’ve changed the protocol.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apart from nearly two decades ago when I was given one for free, I’ve never bothered with a UPS at home. Our power grid is very reliable. Looking at availability information from “<a href="https://github.com/rpodgorny/uptimed">uptimed</a>“, my home file server has been powered on for 99.97% of the time in the last 14 years. That includes time spent moving house and a day when the house power was off for several hours while the kitchen was refitted!</p>
<p>However, in December 2023 a fault with our electric oven popped the breaker for the sockets causing everything to be harshly powered off. My fileserver took it badly and one drive died. That wasn’t a huge issue as it has a redundant filesystem, but I didn’t like it.</p>
<p>I decided I could afford to treat myself to a relatively cheap UPS.</p>
<p>I did some research and read some reviews of the <a href="https://www.apc.com/uk/en/product/BX1600MI/apc-backups-1600va-tower-230v-6x-iec-c13-outlets-avr/?%3Frange=61883-backups&amp;selectedNodeId=27590290410">APC Back-UPS range</a>, their cheapest offering. Many people were dismissive calling them cheap pieces of crap with flimsy plastic construction and batteries that are not regarded as user-replaceable. But there was no indication that such a model would not work, and I felt it hard to justify paying  a lot here.</p>
<p>I found YouTube videos of the procedure that a technician would go through to replace the battery in 3 to 5 years. To do it yourself voids your warranty, but your warranty is done after 3 years anyway. It looked pretty doable even for a hardware-avoidant person like myself.</p>
<p>It’s important to me that the UPS can be monitored by a Linux computer. The entire point here is that the computer detects when the battery is near to exhausted and gracefully powers itself down. There are two main options on Linux for this: <a href="http://www.apcupsd.org/"><strong>apcupsd</strong></a> and <a href="https://networkupstools.org/index.html">Network UPS Tools</a> (“<strong>nut</strong>“).</p>
<p>Looking at the Back-UPS BX1600MI model, it has a USB port for monitoring and says it can be monitored with APC’s own Powerchute Serial Shutdown Windows software. There’s an entry in <strong>nut</strong>‘s hardware compatibility list for “Back-UPS (USB)” of “supported, based on publicly available protocol”. I made the order.</p>
<p>The UPS worked as expected in terms of being an uninterruptible power supply. It was hopeless trying to talk to it with <strong>nut</strong> though. <strong>nut</strong> just kept saying it was losing communications.</p>
<p>I tried <strong>apcupsd</strong> instead. This stayed connected, but it showed a continuous stream of battery detach/reattach and power fail/restore events each lasting less than 2 seconds. Normally on a power fail you’d expect a visual and audible alert on the UPS itself and I wasn’t getting any of that, but I don’t know if that’s because they were real events that were just too brief.</p>
<p>I contacted APC support but they were very quick to tell me that they did not support any other software but their own Windows-only Powerchute Serial Shutdown (PCSS).</p>
<p>I then asked about this on the <strong>apcupsd</strong> mailing list. The first response:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Something’s wrong with your UPS, most likely the battery is bad, but since you say the UPS is brand new, just get it replaced.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As this thing was brand new I wasn’t going to go through a warranty claim with APC. I just contacted the vendor and told them I thought it was faulty and I wanted to return it. They actually offered to send me another one in advance and me send back the one I had, so I went for that.</p>
<p>In the mean time I found time to install Windows 10 in a virtual machine and pass through USB to it. Guess what? No spurious events in PCSS on Windows. It detected expected events when I yanked the power etc. I had no evidence that the UPS was in any way faulty. You can probably see what is coming.</p>
<p>The replacement UPS (of the same model) behaved exactly the same: spurious events. This just seems to be what the APC Back-UPS does on non-Windows.</p>
<p>Returning to my thread on the <strong>apcupsd</strong> mailing list, I asked again if there was actually anyone out there who had one of these working with non-Windows. The only substantive response I’ve got so far is:</p>
<blockquote><p>“BX are the El Cheapo plastic craps, worst of all, not even the BExx0 family is such a crap – Schneider’s direct response to all the chinese craps flooding the markets […] no sane person would buy these things, but, well, here we are.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So as far as I am aware, the Back-UPS models cannot currently be monitored from non-Windows. That will have to be my working theory unless someone who has it working with non-Windows contacts me to let me know I am wrong, which I would be interested to know about. I feel like I’ve done all that I can to find such people, by asking on the mailing list for the software that is meant for monitoring APC UPSes on Unix.</p>
<p>After talking all this over with the vendor they’ve recommended a <a href="https://www.riello-ups.co.uk/products/1-ups/63-net-power">Riello NPW 1.5kVA</a> which is <a href="https://networkupstools.org/stable-hcl.html?manufacturer=Riello&amp;model=NPW%20600/800/1000/1500/2000">listed as fully supported by <strong>nut</strong></a>. They are taking the APC units back for a full refund; the Riello is about £30 more expensive.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many years ago, as a senior computer science student, I spent my days browsing through various job postings online, hoping to find a suitable internship position as a programmer.</p>
<p>In addition to intern positions, I would occasionally click on the ads for "senior engineer" positions. Looking back on those ads now, what struck me most, besides the dazzling technical jargon, was the often first-line requirement for years of experience: "This position requires <strong>5+ years of experience</strong>".</p>
<p>As a complete novice who had never worked a day in the field, these experience requirements seemed excessive. But while I was feeling a bit discouraged, I couldn't help but fantasize, "A programmer with five years of experience must be really impressive, right? Is writing code as easy as eating cookies for them?"</p>
<p>Time flies, more than a decade has passed in the blink of an eye. Looking back now, I find myself a proud programmer with 14 years of experience. After years of fighting through the trenches of the software development industry, I've come to realize that many aspects are quite different from what I imagined during my senior year of college, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming doesn't get much easier with experience, the idea that it's "as easy as eating cookies" only happens in dreams.</li>
<li>Writing code for many "big projects" is not only uninteresting, it's dangerous, much less fun than solving an algorithmic problem on LeetCode.</li>
<li>Thinking only from a technical perspective doesn't make you a good programmer, some things are much more important than technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon reflection, there are many more such insights about programming. I've summarized eight of them in this article. If any of them resonate with you, I would be very pleased.</p>
<h3 id="1-writing-code-is-easy-but-writing-good-code-is-hard">1. Writing code is easy, but writing good code is hard</h3>
<p>Programming used to be a highly specialized skill with a high barrier to entry. In the past, if an average person wanted to learn programming, the most common approach was to read books and documentation. However, most programming books were quite abstruse and unfriendly to beginners, causing many to give up before they could ever enjoy the fun of programming.</p>
<p>But now, learning to code is becoming more accessible. Learning no longer means plowing through textbooks, instead, there are many new ways to learn. Watching tutorial videos, taking interactive courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, or even playing coding games on <a href="https://codecombat.com/">CodeCombat</a> - everyone can find a learning method that suits them.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2023/02/prog_hard_codecombat.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>"Mom, I'm not just playing games, I'm learning to code! Look at the right side of the screen!"</p>

<p>Programming languages are also becoming more user-friendly. Classic languages like C and Java are no longer the first choice for most beginners, and many simpler, more accessible dynamic languages are now popular. The IDEs and other tools have also improved. Together, these factors lower the learning curve for programming.</p>
<p>In short, programming has shed its mystical aura, transforming from an arcane skill mastered by a select few to a craft that anyone can learn.</p>
<p>But a lower barrier to entry and friendlier programming languages don't mean that anyone can write good code. If you have been involved in any "enterprise" software projects, let me ask you a question: "What is the quality of the code in the projects you work on every day? Is there more good code or more bad code?"</p>
<p>I'm not sure what your answer is, but let me share mine.</p>
<h4 id="good-code-is-still-rare">Good code is still rare</h4>
<p>In 2010, I changed jobs to work for a large Internet company.</p>
<p>Before joining this company, I had only worked in start-ups with about ten people, so I had high expectations from my new employer, especially in terms of software quality. I thought to myself, "Considering this is a 'big' project supporting products used by millions of users, the code quality has to be much better than what I've seen before!"</p>
<p>It took me only a week at the new company to realize how far off the mark I was. The code quality of the so-called "big" project was far from what I had expected. When I opened the IDE, functions consisted of hundreds of lines of code and mysterious numeric literals were everywhere, making the development of even the smallest feature seem Herculean.</p>
<p>After that, as I worked in more companies and saw more software projects, I came to understand a truth: <strong>No matter how big the company or how impressive the project, encountering good code in practice is still a rare event.</strong></p>
<h4 id="what-is-good-code">What is good code?</h4>
<p>Let's go back to the question of what exactly defines good code. A quote from Martin Fowler is often cited in this context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this statement can serve as a starting point for evaluating good code: it must be readable, understandable, and clear. The first principle of writing good code is to put the human reader first.</p>
<p>Beyond readability, there are many other dimensions to consider when evaluating code quality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adherence to the programming language</strong>: Does it use the recommended practices of the current programming language? Are language features and syntactic sugars used appropriately?</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Modification</strong>: Does the code design account for future changes, and is it easy to modify when those changes occur?</li>
<li><strong>Reasonable API Design</strong>: Is the API design reasonable and easy to use? A good API is convenient for simple scenarios and can be extended as needed for advanced use cases.</li>
<li><strong>Adequate Performance</strong>: Does the code performance meet current business needs, with room for improvement in the future?</li>
<li><strong>Avoidance of Overdesign</strong>: Does the code suffer from overdesign or premature optimization?</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, for programmers at any level, good code doesn't come easy. Writing good code requires a delicate balance across multiple dimensions, meticulous design, and continuous refinement.</p>
<p>Given this, is there a shortcut to mastering the craft of coding?</p>
<h4 id="the-shortcut-to-writing-good-code">The shortcut to writing good code</h4>
<p>In many ways, I think programming is a lot like writing. Both involve using text and symbols to convey ideas, albeit in slightly different ways.</p>
<p>When it comes to writing, I like to ask a question about writers: "Have you ever heard of a writer who doesn't read? Have you ever heard of a writer who claims to read only his own work and not the work of others?" My guess is that the answer is probably NO.</p>
<p>if you do some research, you'll find that many professional writers spend their days in a constant cycle of reading and writing. They spend a significant amount of time each day reading a variety of texts and then writing.</p>
<p>As "wordsmiths," programmers often neglect reading. However, reading is an essential part of quickly improving your programming skills. In addition to the projects we encounter in our daily work, we should read more classic software projects to learn about API design, module architecture, and code-writing techniques.</p>
<p>Not only code and technical documents, it's also beneficial to read programming books regularly to maintain the habit of reading. In this regard, I believe Jeff Atwood's article,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/programmers-dont-read-books-but-you-should/">"Programmers Don't Read Books -- But You Should"</a>, written 15 years ago, is still relevant today.</p>
<p>The shortcut to improving programming skills is hidden in the endless cycle of&nbsp;<code>"Reading &lt;-&gt; Programming"</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2024/02/reading-writing.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>"What should a good programmer do?"</p>

<h3 id="2-the-essence-of-programming-is-creating">2. The essence of programming is "creating"</h3>
<p>In the daily work of a programmer, many things can fill you with a sense of accomplishment and even make you involuntarily exclaim, <em>"Programming is the best thing in the world!"</em> For example, fixing an extremely difficult bug, or doubling code performance with a new algorithm. But of all these accomplishments, none can compare to the act of <strong>creating</strong> something with your own hands.</p>
<p>When you're programming, opportunities to create new things are everywhere. Because creating isn't just about releasing a new piece of software. Writing a reusable utility function or designing a clear data model all fall under the category of creating.</p>
<p>For programmers, maintaining a passion for "creating" is crucial because it can help us to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn more efficiently</strong>: The most effective way to learn a new technology is to build a real project with it. Learning through the process of creation yields the best results.</li>
<li><strong>Encounter extraordinary things</strong>: Many world-changing open source software projects were originally started by their authors out of pure interest, such as Linus Torvalds with Linux and Guido van Rossum with Python.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2023/02/prog_hard_guido.png" width="45%"></p>

<p>During the Christmas holiday of 1989, the Dutchman Guido van Rossum typed the first few lines of code for the Python language. Initially expected to be a successor to the ABC language, it is eventually "eating" the whole world.</p>

<p>While there are many benefits to "creating", and programmers have plenty of opportunities to engage in it, many often lack the awareness of being a "creator." This is similar to the widely told story about a philosopher who asked bricklayers what they were doing. Some were clearly aware they were building a cathedral, while others thought they were merely laying bricks. Many programmers are like the latter, seeing only the bricks, not the cathedral.</p>
<p>Once you start seeing yourself as a creator, your perspective on things can change drastically. For example, when adding error messages to an API, creators can escape the mental trap of "just getting the job done" and ask themselves more important questions: "What kind of product experience do I want to <strong>create</strong> for the user? What error messages will best help me achieve that goal?"</p>
<p>Like any useful programming pattern, the "creator mindset" can become an important driving force in your career. So now ask yourself: "What will my next creation be?</p>
<h3 id="3-creating-an-efficient-trial-and-error-environment-is-crucial">3. Creating an efficient trial-and-error environment is crucial</h3>
<p>I was once involved in the development of an Internet product that was beautifully designed, feature-rich, and used by a massive number of users every day.</p>
<p>But despite its market success, the quality of the engineering was terrible. If you were to dive into its backend repository and check every directory, you wouldn't find a single line of unit test code, not to mention that other automated testing processes were out of the question. The business logic was extremely complex, resulting in a tangle of unexpected code dependencies. Developing a new feature often risked breaking existing functionalities.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2023/02/prog_hard_fix_fix_fix.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>"What are you working on?"</p>

<p>As a result, both the developers and the product team had to be on high alert every time the project was released, creating a tense atmosphere. The release process was thrilling, and emergency rollbacks were common. Working in such an environment, one might not necessarily grow technically, but their psychological resilience would surely be tested.</p>
<p>Programming is supposed to be fun, but coding for such a project, the joy was nowhere to be found. What exactly takes the fun out of programming?</p>
<h4 id="the-ideal-programming-experience-solving-leetcode-problems">The ideal programming experience ≈ "solving LeetCode problems"</h4>
<p><a href="https://leetcode.cn/">LeetCode</a> is a well-known programming learning website that offers a lot of programming problems covering various levels of difficulty, most of which are algorithm-related. Users can select an interesting problem and code directly in the browser (supporting multiple programming languages) and execute it. If all test cases are passed, the solution is considered successful.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2024/02/leetcode-en.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Solving problems on LeetCode</p>

<p>Solving problems on LeetCode is similar to playing a game—challenging and fun. The entire process perfectly exemplifies an idealized programming experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Separation of concerns</strong>: Each problem is an independent entity, allowing developers to immerse themselves in one problem at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Fast and accurate feedback</strong>: After each code adjustment, developers can quickly get feedback from automated tests.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-cost trial and error</strong>: There are no negative consequences if the code has syntax errors or logical flaws, reducing mental load.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you in front of the screen might think I'm stating the obvious.</p>
<p><em>"So what? Isn't that how you solve LeetCode problems and write scripts? What's so special about that?"</em> You might add, <em>"Do you know how complex our company's projects are? They're huge in scale, with countless modules. Do you understand what I'm saying? Serving millions of users every day, with several databases and three types of message queues, of course, development is a bit more troublesome!"</em></p>
<p>Indeed, software development varies greatly and can't always be as straightforward and pleasant as solving problems on LeetCode. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to improve the programming environment we're in, even if only a little bit.</p>
<p>To improve the programming experience by improving the environment, the concepts and tools available include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modular thinking</strong>: Properly designing each module in the project to reduce coupling and increase orthogonality.</li>
<li><strong>Design principles</strong>: At the micro level, apply classic design principles and patterns such as the "SOLID" principles.</li>
<li><strong>Automated testing</strong>: Write good unit tests, use mocking techniques when appropriate, and cover critical business paths with automated testing.</li>
<li><strong>Shorten feedback loops</strong>: Switch to faster compiling tools, optimize unit test performance, and do everything possible to reduce the "code change to feedback" wait time.</li>
<li><strong>Microservice architecture</strong>: When necessary, break down a large monolith into multiple microservices with distinct responsibilities to disperse complexity.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Focusing on the programming environment and deliberately creating a "coding paradise" that allows for efficient trial and error can make work as enjoyable as solving LeetCode problems. It's one of the best contributions that experienced programmers can make to their teams.</p>
<h3 id="4-avoid-the-trap-of-coding-perfectionism">4. Avoid the trap of coding perfectionism</h3>
<p>Striving for excellence in code quality is commendable, but be careful not to fall into the trap of perfectionism. Coding is not an art form that encourages the endless pursuit of perfection. While a writer may spend years perfecting a timeless masterpiece, programmers who fixate on code to an extreme extent are problematic.</p>
<p>No code is perfect. Most of the time, as long as your code meets current needs and leaves room for future expansion, it's good enough. A few times I have seen candidates label themselves as "clean code advocate " on their resumes. While I can feel their commitment to code quality through the screen, deep down I hope that they have already left the trap of perfectionism far behind.</p>
<h3 id="5-technology-is-important-but-people-may-be-more-important">5. Technology is important, but people may be more important</h3>
<p>In software development, the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a well-known design principle. Its definition is simple and can be summed up in one sentence: "Every software module should have only one reason to change."</p>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2023/02/prog_hard_srp.png" width="55%"></p>

<p>Single Responsibility Principle</p>

<p>To master the SRP, the key is to understand what defines a "reason to change". Clearly, programs are lifeless; they cannot and do not need to change on their own. Any reason to modify a program comes from the people associated with it – they are the true instigators of change.</p>
<p>Let's consider a simple example. Look at the two classes below, which one violates the SRP principle?</p>
<ol>
<li>A dictionary data class that supports two types of operations: storing data and retrieving data;</li>
<li>An employee profile class that supports two types of operations: updating personal information and rendering a user profile card image.</li>
</ol>
<p>To most people, the first example seems fine, but the second one clearly violates the SRP principle. This conclusion can be reached almost intuitively, without any rigorous analysis or proof. However, if we analyze it properly, the issue with the second example becomes apparent when we find two different reasons for modification:</p>
<ol>
<li>Management believes that the "personal phone" field in the profile cannot contain illegal numbers and requires the addition of simple validation logic.</li>
<li>An employee feels that the "name" section on the profile card image is too small and wants to increase the font size.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is people who request changes. And you don’t want to confuse those people, or yourself, by mixing together the code that many different people care about for different reasons." — "The Single Responsibility Principle"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key to understanding the SRP principle is to first understand people and the roles they play in software development.</p>
<p>Here's another example. Microservices architecture has been a hot topic in recent years. However, many discussions about it tend to focus only on the technology itself, overlooking the relationship between microservices architecture and people.</p>
<p>The essence of what differentiates microservices architecture from other concepts lies in the clearer boundaries between different modules after a large monolith is broken down into independent microservices. Compared to a large team of hundreds maintaining a monolithic system, many small organizations each maintaining their own microservices can operate much more efficiently.</p>
<p>Talking about the various technical benefits and the fancy features of microservices without the context of a specific organizational size (i.e., "people") is putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>Technology is undoubtedly important. As technical professionals, beautiful architectural diagrams and creative code naturally grab our attention. But, also make sure not to overlook "people," another critical factor in software development. When necessary, shift your perspective from "technology" to "people"; it can be significantly beneficial for you.</p>
<h3 id="6-studying-is-good-but-learning-method-matters">6. Studying is good, but learning method matters</h3>
<p>Today, everyone is talking about "lifelong learning," and programmers are a profession that especially requires this continuous pursuit of knowledge. Computer technology evolves rapidly, and a framework or programming language that was popular three years ago may very well be outdated just a month ago.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2023/02/prog_hard_all_things_1minute.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>What happens in one minute?</p>

<p>To excel at their jobs, programmers need to learn a huge collection of topics spanning various areas. Taking the backend field, which I am more familiar with, as an example, a competent backend engineer should be proficient in at least the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One or more backend programming languages / Relational databases like MySQL / Common storage components like Redis / Design patterns / User experience / Software engineering / Operating systems / Networking basics / Distributed systems / …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though there's a lot to learn, from my observations, most programmers actually love learning (or at least do not resist it), so mindset is not the issue. However, sometimes, just having an "eagerness to learn" isn't enough; when learning, we need to pay particular attention to the "cost-effectiveness" of our study.</p>
<h4 id="focusing-on-the-cost-effectiveness-of-learning">Focusing on the cost-effectiveness of learning</h4>
<p>The following chart shows the relationship between learning outcomes and the effort invested.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2023/02/prog_hard_learning_curve.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Learning outcomes versus investment graph, with learning efforts on the x-axis and performance on the y-axis</p>

<p>The graph indicates that in the initial stages of learning, returns on relatively small investments grow rapidly. However, once outcomes exceed a certain threshold, the investment required to continue improving grows exponentially.</p>
<p>For this reason, I suggest that whenever you start learning something new, first clarify this question in your mind: <em>“At what point on the graph should I stop?"</em> rather than studying relentlessly.</p>
<p>The ocean of knowledge is limitless. Some things require years of continuous study and refinement, while others require only a touch-and-go to gain sufficient understanding. Accurately assessing and allocating your limited learning energy is sometimes even more important than the act of studying hard itself.</p>
<h4 id="choosing-appropriate-learning-materials">Choosing appropriate learning materials</h4>
<p>Once you have set your learning goals, the next step is to find the right learning materials. I would like to share my own failure in this regard.</p>
<p>At one point, I developed a strong interest in product interaction design and felt that I needed to learn more about it. So, I carefully selected a classic book in the field, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48495224-about-face-4-the-essence-of-interaction-design">“About Face 4: The Essentials of Interaction Design”</a>, and brought it home, confident that my interaction design skills would quickly improve.</p>
<p>However, things didn't go as planned. When I opened that classic, I found that I couldn't even get through the first chapter—there's truth in the saying, “Don't bite off more than you can chew”.</p>
<p>From this failure, I gleaned a piece of advice. When learning something new, it's best to choose materials that are more accessible and suitable for beginners, rather than just aiming for the most classic and authoritative ones.</p>
<p>Reflecting on past experiences, I believe the following books are very suitable for beginners and offer great value for money:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41597.The_Non_Designer_s_Design_Book">“The Non-Designer's Design Book”</a>: Related to design</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited">“Don't Make Me Think, Revisited”</a>: Related to Web user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps everyone wants to be knowledgeable, to know everything. But the time and energy we can allocate are always limited; we can't and don't need to be experts in everything.</p>
<h3 id="7-the-sooner-you-start-writing-unit-tests-the-better">7. The sooner you start writing unit tests, the better.</h3>
<p>I really, really like unit testing. I think that writing unit tests has had a profound impact on my programming career. To put it in a nutshell, if I use “starting to write unit tests” as a milestone, the latter part of my career is much more exciting than the former.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to writing unit tests, such as driving improvements in code design, serving as documentation for the code, and so on. Moreover, comprehensive unit testing is key to creating the <strong>“efficient trial-and-error environment”</strong> mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>I have written several articles about unit testing, so I won't repeat them here. Just one piece of advice: <strong>if you have never tried to write unit tests, or have never taken testing seriously, I suggest you start tomorrow.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2023/02/prog_hard_test_in_prod.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>I don't always test my code</p>

<h3 id="8-what-is-the-biggest-enemy-of-programmers">8. What is the biggest enemy of programmers?</h3>
<p>In most programmer jokes, product managers often appear as the villain. They constantly change project requirements, come up with new ideas every day, and leave the programmers in the lurch.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2023/02/prog_hard_freeze_reqs.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>The client kept changing the requirements</p>

<p>Fueled by these jokes, the image of the ever-changing product manager seems to have become the nemesis of programmers. It's as though if only the product requirements stopped changing, the work environment would instantly transform into a utopia.</p>
<p>While it's fun to occasionally gripe about product managers, I want to set the record straight: product managers are not the enemy.</p>
<p>From a certain perspective, software is inherently designed to be modified (why else would it be called "software"?). This makes developing software fundamentally different from building houses. After all, nobody would say after constructing a building, "Let's knock it down and rebuild it! The same structure but with 30% less steel and concrete!"</p>
<p>Therefore, product managers and unstable requirements are not the enemies of programmers. Moreover, the ability to write code that is easily modified and adapts to change is one of the key indicators of a great programmer versus a good one.</p>
<p>So what is the biggest enemy of programmers?</p>
<h4 id="complexity-is-the-biggest-enemy">Complexity is the biggest enemy</h4>
<p>As stated in "Code Complete", the essence of software development is complexity management. Uncontrolled complexity is a programmer's worst enemy.</p>
<p>Let's look at the factors that lead to ever-increasing project complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constantly adding new features:</strong> More features means more code, and more code usually means more complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Demand for high availability:</strong> To achieve high availability, additional technical components(like message queues) and code are introduced.</li>
<li><strong>Demand for high performance:</strong> To improve performance, caching and related module code are added, and some modules are split and rewritten in faster languages.</li>
<li><strong>Repeatedly postponed refactoring:</strong> Due to tight project schedules, urgent refactoring is continuously postponed, accumulating a growing technical debt.</li>
<li><strong>Neglect of automated testing:</strong> No one writes unit tests or cares about testing.</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, as the project's complexity reaches a certain level, a loud crash echoes through the air. "Boom!" A massive "pitfall" that no one wants to tackle or dares to touch magically appears in everyone's IDE.</p>
<p>Guess who dug this hole?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.piglei.com/static/uploaded/2023/02/prog_hard_reduce_complexity.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>Software projects are more likely to succeed</p>

<h4 id="the-process-of-slowing-complexity-growth">The process of slowing complexity growth</h4>
<p>While complexity will inevitably continue to grow, there are many practices that can slow this process. If everyone could do the following, complexity could be kept within reasonable limits over the long term:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master the current programming language and tools, write clean code</li>
<li>Use appropriate design patterns and programming paradigms</li>
<li>Have zero tolerance for duplicate code, abstract libraries, and frameworks</li>
<li>Apply the principles of Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design properly</li>
<li>Write good documentation and comments</li>
<li>Develop high quality and effective unit tests</li>
<li>Separate what changes from what doesn't</li>

<p>In 2020, I gave a presentation to my team called "10 Insights After a Decade of Programming". After I shared the slides on the company intranet, a colleague saw them and commented that just reading the slides wasn't satisfying enough; she was hoping I could expand it into an article. I replied that I would. Now, 3 years have passed, and I've finally kept my promise.</p>
<p>When I was preparing the presentation, I had finished all the slides and had no idea what to put on the last page. Then, inspired, I went with a plain white background and typed in bold, big letters in the middle: <strong>"A decade is too short to master programming."</strong> Now, as I approach the midpoint of my second decade, I still find programming hard sometimes - I still have a lot to learn, I've got to keep going.</p>

<p>This is the correspondence between myself (Martti Malmi, AKA Sirius) and Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.

I did not feel comfortable sharing private correspondence earlier, but decided to do so for an important trial in the UK in 2024 where I was a witness. Also, a long time has passed now since the emails were sent.

The archive is incomplete and contains only emails from my address @cc.hut.fi. My university email addresses changed to @aalto.fi in early 2011, and I don't have backups of those emails.

There are some passwords and a street address mentioned in the emails, but those are no longer valid or relevant.

Codewise, there's not much that's easy right now.  One thing that's 
needed is an interface for server side scripting languages such as Java, 
Python, PHP, ASP, etc.  Bitcoin would be running on the web server, and 
server side script could call it to do transactions.  It's Windows, so I 
guess OLE/COM is the interface.

One easy thing that really helps is to run a node that can accept

That would be great!  I added you (dmp1ce) as a dev to the sourceforge 
project and gave you access to edit the web space and everything.

&gt; someone who happens to find your key file.

Definitely.  This will be an absolutely essential feature once things 
get going, making it so you can lock your wealth up with strong 
encryption and back it up more securely than any physical safe.  So far 
I've been putting it off in favour of other features because it's not 
crucial yet until bitcoins start to have value.

I plan to work on the escrow feature next, which is needed to make 
actual trades for physical stuff safer and before backing the currency 
with fiat money can begin.


&gt; I'm running a bitcoin node always when my PC is powered on, which means 
&gt; about 24/7. Bitcoin is a great project, and it's really cool to 
&gt; participate!

Thanks!  Right now there are a lot of people on the network who can't 
receive incoming connections, so every node that can really helps. 
Having more helps keep down the "(not accepted)" issue for now until I 
reduce the chances of that happening in v0.1.6.

I guess one answer for the FAQ should be how to set up your firewall to 
forward port 8333 so you can receive incoming connections.  The question 
could be something like "what if I have 0 connections" and that could be 
the answer that it might be because the nodes you can connect with is 
limited if you don't set that up.

Here's a compilation of questions I've answered in forums and e-mail 
that should help you see what questions are frequently asked and some 
answers I've used.  It's not intended to use all or most of the material 
here, just pick and choose.  This is just a dump of everything I've 
answered.

Some issues that we don't have easy answers for are best not to bring 
up.  Casual users seems content to assume that the system works as 
stated (which it does), and getting into the design details just opens a 
can of worms that can't be answered without a deep understanding of the 
system.  The advanced questions I've received have mostly been unique 
per person and best answered individually.



**** QUESTION AND ANSWER DUMP ****

Any questions used for the FAQ should probably be rephrased.

questions:

 &gt; The bottom of the UI shows:
 &gt;
 &gt; Generating        4 connections     4024 blocks     164 transactions
 &gt;
 &gt; I understand "generating"; I assume I am connected to 4 other nodes; and
 &gt; I know I have recorded 164 transactions (including failed generation
 &gt; attempts).  I'm not clear what the "blocks" figure describes.  It's much
 &gt; smaller than the total of all the blocks shown against all my 
transactions.
 &gt;

It's the total number of blocks in the block chain, meaning the 
network's block chain, which everyone has a copy of.  Every Bitcoin node 
displays the same number and it goes up about every 10 minutes whenever 
someone generates a block.  When you haven't had it running for a while, 
once you're connected it spins up rapidly as it downloads what was 
generated while you were gone to catch up.  I'm not sure exactly how to 
describe it (that would fit on the status bar in 1 word, maybe 2 words 
max), any ideas?

The blocks number in the status column next to your transactions is the 
number of blocks that have come after that transaction.  Your 
transaction is essentially "in" that many blocks.

Satoshi




 &gt; My best guess - it
 &gt; is the length of the global chain, and the rapid advance at the start
 &gt; is as the software downloads and verifies the preceding blocks in the
 &gt; chain as being valid.

Right.  I'm trying to think of more clear wording for that, maybe "%d 
network blocks" or "%d block chain".





 &gt; I'm having an unusual run of (block not-accepted) failures, and 
thought I'd let you know in
 &gt; case this was of any significance.

What rate of not-accepted did you see?  I didn't see anything unusual on 
my end.  If you had more than, say, 4 in a row, that would be abnormal 
and probably a loss of network communication.  If it's scattered and 
less than 25%, just random bad luck.  It's normal and harmless to 
randomly get some per cent of not-accepted, and of course randomness can 
sometimes bunch up and look like a pattern.

The idea of an option to View/Hide unaccepted blocks is a good one, as 
well as View/Hide all generated blocks so you can more easily see 
incoming transactions.  Seeing the unaccepted blocks is just annoying 
and frustrating.  Everyone faces the same rate of unaccepted, it's just 
a part of the process.  It would probably be best to default to hide 
unaccepted blocks, so as not to show giving and taking away something 
that never was, and not show new generated blocks at all until they have 
at least one confirmation.  It would only mean finding out you have a 
generated block 15 minutes later than normal, and then you still have 
119 blocks to go before it matures anyway.  This is on the to-do list 
for v0.1.6.

Satoshi

[note: I have some improvements in 0.1.6 to reduce this problem somewhat,
and it'll also improve when the network is larger]







 &gt; For some reason your transfer to me shows up as "From: unknown" even
 &gt; though I added you to my address book.
 &gt;
 &gt; I have a "Generated (not accepted)" line in my transaction list, it
 &gt; seems like an attempt to generate a coin went wrong somehow. Not sure
 &gt; what happened here - presumably my node successfully solved a block
 &gt; but then I went offline before it was sent to the network?

Transactions sent to a bitcoin address will always say "from: unknown". 
  The transaction only tells who it's to.  Sending by bitcoin address 
has a number of problems, but it's so nice having the fallback option to 
be able to send to anyone whether they're online or not.  There are a 
number of ideas to try to improve things later.  For now, if things work 
out like the real world where the vast majority of transactions are with 
merchants, they'll pretty much always make sure to set up to receive by 
IP.  The P2P file sharing networks seem fairly successful at getting a 
large percentage of their users to set up their firewalls to forward a port.

I badly wanted to find some way to include a comment with indirect
transfers, but there just wasn't a way to do it.  Bitcoin uses EC-DSA, which
was essential for making the block chain compact enough to be practical with
today's technology because its signatures are an order of magnitude smaller
than RSA.  But EC-DSA can't encrypt messages like RSA, it can only be used
to verify signatures.

The "Generated (not accepted)" normally happens if two nodes find a 
block at close to the same time, one of them will not be accepted.  It's 
normal and unavoidable.  I plan in v0.1.6 to hide those, since they're 
just confusing and annoying and there's no reason for users to have to 
see them.  While the network is still small like it is now, if you can't 
receive incoming connections you're at more of a disadvantage because 
you can't receive block announcements as directly.




 &gt; ...So far it has two "Generated" messages, however the
 &gt; "Credit" field for those is 0.00 and the balance hasn't changed.  Is
 &gt; this due to the age/maturity requirement for a coin to be valid?

Right, the credit field stays 0.00 until it matures, then it'll be
50.00.  BTW, you can doubleclick on a line for details.





 &gt; ...understand correctly, there is only one (or maybe a few) global
 &gt; chain[s] into which all transactions are hashed. If there is only one
 &gt; chain recording "the story of the economy" so to speak, how does this
 &gt; scale? In an imaginary planet-wide deployment there would be millions
 &gt; of even billions of transactions per hour being hashed into the chain...

 &gt; ...I found the section on incentives hard to follow. In particular, I'm
 &gt; not clear on what triggers the transition from minting new coins as a
 &gt; reason to run a node, to charging transaction fees (isn't the point of
 &gt; BitCoin largely to zero transaction costs anyway?). Presumably there's
 &gt; some human in charge of the system...

 &gt; ...How did you decide on the inflation schedule for v1? Where did 21
 &gt; million coins come from? What denominations are these coins? You
 &gt; mention a way to combine and split value but I'm not clear on how this
 &gt; works. For instance are bitcoins always denominated by an integer or
 &gt; can you have fractional bitcoins?...

 &gt; ...it's rare that I encounter truly
 &gt; revolutionary ideas. The last time I was this excited about a new
 &gt; monetary scheme was when I discovered Ripple. If you have any thoughts
 &gt; on Ripple, I'd also love to hear them.

There is only one global chain.

The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million 
Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much 
larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It 
never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over 
the ways it would cope with extreme size.

By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 
years and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy 
adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of 
transactions.

I don't anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it 
becomes too burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that 
only processes transactions that include a transaction fee.  The owner 
of the node would decide the minimum fee they'll accept.  Right now, 
such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if 
enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they 
include a fee, or slower if they don't.  The fee the market would settle 
on should be minimal.  If a node requires a higher fee, that node would 
be passing up all transactions with lower fees.  It could do more volume 
and probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions 
as it can.  The transition is not controlled by some human in charge of 
the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.

A key aspect of Bitcoin is that the security of the network grows as the 
size of the network and the amount of value that needs to be protected 
grows.  The down side is that it's vulnerable at the beginning when it's 
small, although the value that could be stolen should always be smaller 
than the amount of effort required to steal it.  If someone has other 
motives to prove a point, they'll just be proving a point I already concede.

My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an 
educated guess.  It was a difficult choice, because once the network is 
going it's locked in and we're stuck with it.  I wanted to pick 
something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but 
without knowing the future, that's very hard.  I ended up picking 
something in the middle.  If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it'll be 
worth less per unit than existing currencies.  If you imagine it being 
used for some fraction of world commerce, then there's only going to be 
21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per 
unit.  Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is 
represented internally as 100000000.  There's plenty of granularity if 
typical prices become small.  For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, 
then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, 
so if you had 1 Bitcoin it's now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is 
displayed as 1.

Ripple is interesting in that it's the only other system that does 
something with trust besides concentrate it into a central server.

Satoshi






 &gt; If we assume that 0.1% is a good risk rate, then z=5 thus
 &gt; any transaction must wait a bit less than an hour before being
 &gt; solidified in the chain. As micropayments for things like web content
 &gt; or virtual goods are by definition something that requires low
 &gt; overhead, waiting an hour seems like quite a significant hurdle.

For the actual risk, multiply the 0.1% by the probability that the buyer 
is an attacker with a huge network of computers.

For micropayments, you can safely accept the payment immediately.  The 
size of the payment is too small for the effort to steal it. 
Micropayments are almost always for intellectual property, where there's 
no physical loss to the merchant.  Anyone trying to steal a micropayment 
would probably not be a paying customer anyway, and if they want to 
steal intellectual property they can use the file sharing networks.

Currently, businesses accept a certain chargeoff rate.  I believe the 
risk with 1 or even 0 confirming blocks will be much less than the rate 
of chargebacks on verified credit card transactions.

The usual scam against a merchant that doesn't wait for confirming 
blocks would be to send a payment to a merchant, then quickly try to 
propagate a double-spend to the network before the merchant's copy. What 
the merchant can do is broadcast his transaction and then monitor the 
network for any double-spend copies.  The thief would not be able to 
broadcast during the monitoring period or else the merchant's node would 
receive a copy.  The merchant would only have to monitor for a minute or 
two until most of the network nodes have his version and it's too late 
for the thief's version to catch up and reach many nodes.  With just a 
minute or two delay, the chance of getting away without paying could be 
made much too low to scam.  A thief usually needs a high probability of 
getting an item for free to make it worthwhile.  Using a lot of CPU 
power to do the brute force attack discussed in the paper in addition to 
the above scam would not increase the thief's chances very much.

Anything that grants access to something, like something that takes a 
while to download, access to a website, web hosting, a subscription or 
service, can be cancelled a few minutes later if the transaction is 
rejected.


 &gt; How is the required difficulty of each block communicated through the
 &gt; network and agreed upon?

It's not communicated.  The formula is hardcoded in the program and 
every node does the same calculation to know what difficulty is required 
for the next block.  If someone diverged from the formula, their block 
would not be accepted by the majority.





 &gt; Is the code free/open source or just open source?

It's free open source.  It's the MIT license, which just requires some 
disclaimer text be kept with the source code, other than that you can do 
just about anything you want with it.  The source is included in the 
main download.

 &gt; Is there a way to be told of new versions? Does the app auto update
 &gt; itself?  Some kind of mailing list would be excellent.

The list is:

notification of new versions, is definitely on the list.





[this inflation discussion was before the transaction fee mechanism and 
fixed plan of 21 million coins was posted, so it may not be as 
applicable anymore]

 &gt; Since they can be created for free (or at the cost
 &gt; of computer power people have anyway for other reasons),
 &gt; monetizing them means simply giving away money.

You're still thinking as if the difficulty level will be so easy that 
people will be able to generate all the bitcoins they want.

Imagine you have to run your computer 24/7 for a month to generate 1 
cent.  After a year, you could generate 12 cents.  That's not going to 
make it so people can just generate all the bitcoin they want for spending.

The value of bitcoins would be relative to the electricity consumed to 
produce them.  All modern CPUs save power when they're idle.  If you run 
a computational task 24/7, not letting it idle, it uses significantly 
more power, and you'll notice it generates more heat.  The extra wattage 
consumed goes straight to your power bill, and the value of the bitcoins 
you produce would be something less than that.


 &gt; Why would they, when they make money by generating
 &gt; new ones

No, they can't make money that way.  It would cost them more in 
electricity than they'd be selling the bitcoins for.






Historically, people have taken up scarce commodities as money, if 
necessary taking up whatever is at hand, such as shells or stones.  Each 
has a kernel of usefulness that helped bootstrap the process, but the 
monetary value ends up being much more than the functional value alone. 
  Most of the value comes from the value that others place in it.  Gold, 
for instance, is pretty, non-corrosive and easily malleable, but most of 
its value is clearly not from that.  Brass is shiny and similar in 
colour.  The vast majority of gold sits unused in vaults, owned by 
governments that could care less about its prettiness.

Until now, no scarce commodity that can be traded over a communications 
channel without a trusted third party has been available.  If there is a 
desire to take up a form of money that can be traded over the Internet 
without a TTP, then now that is possible.

 &gt; As more capable
 &gt; computer hardware comes out, the natural supply per user
 &gt; doubles at every cycle of Moore's law.

Actually, that is handled.  There's a moving average that compensates 
for the total effort being expended so that the total production is a 
constant.  As computers get more powerful, the difficulty increases to 
compensate.


 &gt; I do not recall any economic history of a commodity subject
 &gt; to natural inflation ever being used as money

There's gold for one.  The supply of gold increases by about 2%-3% per 
year.  Any fiat currency typically averages more inflation than that.



 &gt; Won't there be massive inflation as computers get faster and are able 
to solve the proof-of-work problem faster?

The difficulty is controlled by a moving average that compensates for 
the total effort being expended to keep the total production constant. 
As computers get more powerful, the difficulty increases to compensate.






 &gt; If someone double spends, then the transaction record
 &gt; can be unblinded revealing the identity of the cheater?

Identities are not used, and there's no reliance on recourse.  It's all 
prevention.





 &gt; ...You're saying
 &gt; there's no effort to identify and exclude nodes that don't
 &gt; cooperate? I suspect this will lead to trouble and possible DOS
 &gt; attacks.

There is no reliance on identifying anyone.  As you've said, it's
futile and can be trivially defeated with sock puppets.

The credential that establishes someone as real is the ability to
supply CPU power.






 &gt; But in the absence of identity, there's no downside to them
 &gt; if spends become invalid, if they've already received the
 &gt; goods they double-spent for (access to website, download,
 &gt; whatever). The merchants are left holding the bag with
 &gt; "invalid" coins, unless they wait that magical "few blocks"
 &gt; (and how can they know how many?) before treating the spender
 &gt; as having paid.
 &gt;
 &gt; The consumers won't do this if they spend their coin and it takes
 &gt; an hour to clear before they can do what they spent their coin on.
 &gt; The merchants won't do it if there's no way to charge back a
 &gt; customer when they find the that their coin is invalid because
 &gt; the customer has doublespent.

This is a version 2 problem that I believe can be solved fairly
satisfactorily for most applications.

The race is to spread your transaction on the network first.  Think 6
degrees of freedom -- it spreads exponentially.  It would only take
something like 2 minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough
that a competitor starting late would have little chance of grabbing
very many nodes before the first one is overtaking the whole network.
During those 2 minutes, the merchant's nodes can be watching for a
double-spent transaction.  The double-spender would not be able to
blast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant
getting it, so he has to wait before starting.

If the real transaction reaches 90% and the double-spent tx reaches
10%, the double-spender only gets a 10% chance of not paying, and 90%
chance his money gets spent.  For almost any type of goods, that's
not going to be worth it for the scammer.

Information based goods like access to website or downloads are
non-fencible.  Nobody is going to be able to make a living off
stealing access to websites or downloads.  They can go to the file
sharing networks to steal that.  Most instant-access products aren't
going to have a huge incentive to steal.

If a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they can make the
customer wait 2 minutes, or wait for something in e-mail, which many
already do.  If they really want to optimize, and it's a large
download, they could cancel the download in the middle if the
transaction comes back double-spent.  If it's website access,
typically it wouldn't be a big deal to let the customer have access
for 5 minutes and then cut off access if it's rejected.  Many such
sites have a free trial anyway.

[in response to a question about scale]

100,000 block generating nodes is a good ballpark large-scale size
to think about.  Propagating a transaction across the whole network
twice would consume a total of US$ 0.02 of bandwidth at today's
prices.  In practice, many would be burning off excess allocated
bandwidth or unlimited plans with one of the cheaper backbones.
There could be millions of SPV clients.  They only matter in how
many transactions they generate.  If they pay 1 or 2 cents
transaction fees, they pay for themselves.  I've coded it so you
can pay any optional amount of transaction fees you want.  When the
incentive subsidy eventually tapers off, it may be necessary to put
a market-determined transaction fee on your transactions to make
sure nodes process them promptly.

To think about what a really huge transaction load would look like,
I look at the existing credit card network.  I found some more
estimates about how many transactions are online purchases.  It's
about 15 million tx per day for the entire e-commerce load of the
Internet worldwide.  At 1KB per transaction, that would be 15GB of
bandwidth for each block generating node per day, or about two DVD
movies worth.  Seems do-able even with today's technology.

Important to remember, even if Bitcoin caught on at dot-com rates
of growth, it would still take years to become any substantial
fraction of all transactions.  I believe hardware has already
recently become strong enough to handle large scale, but if there's
any doubt about that, bandwidth speeds, prices, disk space and
computing power will be much greater by the time it's needed.

Satoshi






 &gt; One other question I had... What prevents the single node with the most
 &gt; CPU power from generating and retaining the majority of the BitCoins?
 &gt; If every node is working independently of all others, if one is
 &gt; significantly more powerful than the others, isn't it probable that this
 &gt; node will reach the proper conclusion before other nodes? An
 &gt; underpowered node may get lucky once in a while, but if they are at a
 &gt; significant horsepower advantage I would expect the majority of BitCoins
 &gt; to be generated by the most powerful node.

It's not like a race where if one car is twice as fast, it'll always
win.  It's an SHA-256 that takes less than a microsecond, and each guess
has an independent chance of success.  Each computer's chance of finding
a hash collision is linearly proportional to it's CPU power.  A computer
that's half as fast would get half as many coins.






[question about what to backup]

The files are in "%appdata%\Bitcoin", that's the directory to
backup.

%appdata% is per-user access privilege.  Most new programs like
Firefox store their settings files there, despite the headwind of
Microsoft changing the directory name with every Windows release
and being full of spaces and so long it runs off the screen.





[question about what to backup]

The directory is "%appdata%\Bitcoin"
It has spaces in it so you need the quotes
cd "%appdata%\bitcoin"

On XP it would typically be:
C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Bitcoin

Backup that whole directory.  All data files are in that
directory.  There are no temporary files.





[question about what to backup]

The crucial file to backup is wallet.dat.  If bitcoin is running
then you have to backup the whole %appdata%\bitcoin directory
including the database subdirectory, but even if it's not running
it certainly feels safer to always backup the whole directory.

The database unfortunately names its files "log.0000000001".  To
the rest of the world, "log" means delete-at-will, but to database
people it means delete-and-lose-everything-in-your-other-files.  I
tried to put them out of harm's way by putting them in the
database subdirectory.  Later I'll write code to flush the logs
after every wallet change so wallet.dat will be standalone safe
almost all the time.







 &gt; &gt; You know, I think there were a lot more people interested in the 90's,
 &gt; &gt; but after more than a decade of failed Trusted Third Party based 
systems
 &gt; &gt; (Digicash, etc), they see it as a lost cause. I hope they can make the
 &gt; &gt; distinction that this is the first time I know of that we're trying a
 &gt; &gt; non-trust-based system.
 &gt;
 &gt; Yea, that was the primary feature that caught my eye. The real trick
 &gt; will be to get people to actually value the Bitcoins so that they become
 &gt; currency.

Hal sort of alluded to the possibility that it could be seen as a
long-odds investment.  I would be surprised if 10 years from now
we're not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know
a way to do it that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the
trusted third party gets cold feet.

Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you
could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping
coins in a vending machine.

[this next bit turned out to be very controversial.  there is extreme
prejudice against spam solutions, especially proof-of-work.]

It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website.  "Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally."

Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.




[again, I don't know why I'm including this, as it's best to stay
away from claims about spam.  people automatically react violently
against any suggestion of a spam solution.]

 &gt; Spammer botnets could burn through pay-per-send email filters
 &gt; trivially (as usual, the costs would fall on people other than the
 &gt; botnet herders &amp; spammers).

Then you could earn a nice profit by setting up pay-per-send
e-mail addresses and collecting all the spam money.  You could
sell it back to spammers who don't have big enough botnets to
generate their own, helping bootstrap the currency's value.  As
more people catch on, they'll set up more and more phony addresses
to harvest it.  By the time the book "How I got rich exploiting
spammers and you can too" is coming out, there'll be too many fake
addresses and the spammers will have to give up.




 &gt; &gt; * Spammer botnets could burn through pay-per-send email filters
 &gt; &gt;   trivially
 &gt; If POW tokens do become useful, and especially if they become money,
 &gt; machines will no longer sit idle. Users will expect their computers to
 &gt; be earning them money (assuming the reward is greater than the cost to
 &gt; operate). A computer whose earnings are being stolen by a botnet will
 &gt; be more noticeable to its owner than is the case today, hence we might
 &gt; expect that in that world, users will work harder to maintain their
 &gt; computers and clean them of botnet infestations.

One more factor that would mitigate spam if POW tokens have value:
there would be a profit motive for people to set up massive
quantities of fake e-mail accounts to harvest POW tokens from
spam.  They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with
automated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the
message.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become
too high for spam to be cost effective.

The process has the potential to establish the POW token's value
in the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could
buy tokens from harvesters.  While the buying back would
temporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the
self-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the
spammers.

Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of
spam called "dusting".  Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust
in order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.
  If the system let users configure the minimum payment they're
willing to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a
message with it, users could set how much they're willing to get
paid to receive spam.





 &gt; The last thing we need is to deploy a system designed to burn all
 &gt; available cycles, consuming electricity and generating carbon dioxide,
 &gt; all over the Internet, in order to produce small amounts of bitbux to
 &gt; get emails or spams through.
 &gt;
 &gt; Can't we just convert actual money in a bank account into bitbux --
 &gt; cheaply and without a carbon tax?  Please?

Ironic if we end up having to choose between economic liberty and
conservation.

Unfortunately, proof of work is the only solution I've found to
make p2p e-cash work without a trusted third party.  Even if I
wasn't using it secondarily as a way to allocate the initial
distribution of currency, PoW is fundamental to coordinating the
network and preventing double-spending.

If it did grow to consume significant energy, I think it would
still be less wasteful than the labour and resource intensive
conventional banking activity it would replace.  The cost would be
an order of magnitude less than the billions in banking fees that
pay for all those brick and mortar buildings, skyscrapers and junk
mail credit card offers.

 &gt; BTW I don't remember if we talked about this, but the other day some
 &gt; people were mentioning secure timestamping. You want to be able to
 &gt; prove that a certain document existed at a certain time in the past.
 &gt; Seems to me that bitcoin's stack of blocks would be perfect for this.

Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for
transactions.  A few lines of code could create a transaction with
an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.
I should add a command to timestamp a file that way.






 From a thread on p2presearch which starts with my rant about trust 
being the root weakness of all conventional financial systems.
http://listcultures.org/pipermail/p2presearch_listcultures.org/2009-February/thread.html

I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin.  It's
completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties,
because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust.  Give it a
try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:

Download Bitcoin v0.1 at http://www.bitcoin.org

The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's
required to make it work.  The central bank must be trusted not to
debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of
breaches of that trust.  Banks must be trusted to hold our money and
transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit
bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.  We have to trust them with
our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.
Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar
problem.  Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password
protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system
administrator to keep their information private.  Privacy could always
be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the
principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his
superiors.  Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and
trust was no longer required.  Data could be secured in a way that was
physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason,
no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.

It's time we had the same thing for money.  With e-currency based on
cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman,
money can be secure and transactions effortless.

One of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital
signatures.  A digital coin contains the public key of its owner.  To
transfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of
the next owner.  Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of
ownership.  It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big
problem unsolved: double-spending.  Any owner could try to re-spend an
already spent coin by signing it again to another owner.  The usual
solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for
double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model.  In its
central position, the company can override the users, and the fees
needed to support the company make micropayments impractical.

Bitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for
double-spending.  In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed
timestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin.  It
takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but
hard to stifle.  For details on how it works, see the design paper at
http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

The result is a distributed system with no single point of failure.
Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with
each other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.

Very interesting. Is this akin to David Chaum's anonymous digital
money? His concept makes sure money is anonymous unless it is
compromised, i.e. the same money spent more than once. As soon as it's
compromised, the ‘counterfeiter’ is immediately publicly exposed.

Also, in bitcoin, is there a limited supply of money (that must be
managed)? Or is money created exaclty at the moment of transaction?

Succes en plezier,

Martien.

It's similar in that it uses digital signatures for coins, but different
in the approach to privacy and preventing double-spending.  The
recipient of a Bitcoin payment is able to check whether it is the first
spend or not, and second-spends are not accepted.  There isn't an
off-line mode where double-spenders are caught and shamed after the
fact, because that would require participants to have identities.

To protect privacy, key pairs are used only once, with a new one for
every transaction.  The owner of a coin is just whoever has its private key.

Of course, the biggest difference is the lack of a central server.  That
was the Achilles heel of Chaumian systems; when the central company shut
down, so did the currency.

 &gt; Also, in bitcoin, is there a limited supply of money (that must be
 &gt; managed)? Or is money created exaclty at the moment of transaction?

There is a limited supply of money.  Circulation will be 21,000,000
coins.  Transactions only transfer ownership.

Thank you for your questions,

Indeed, it is much like Pekunio in the concept of spraying redundant
copies of every transaction to a number of peers on the network, but the
implementation is not a reputation network like Wizard Rabbit Treasurer.
   In fact, Bitcoin does not use reputation at all.  It sees the network
as just a big crowd and doesn't much care who it talks to or who tells
it something, as long as at least one of them relays the information
being broadcast around the network.  It doesn't care because there's no
way to lie to it.  Either you tell it crypto proof of something, or it
ignores you.

As trust systems go, Ripple is unique in spreading trust around rather
than concentrating it.

what I've done so far:

**** Bitcoin FAQ ****

General Questions

1 What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital
currency. Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is no central
authority to issue new money or to keep track of the
transactions. Instead, those tasks are managed collectively by
the nodes of the network. Anonymity means that the real world
identity of the parties of a transaction can be kept hidden from
the public or even from the parties themselves.

2 How does bitcoin work?

Bitcoin utilizes public/private key cryptography. When a coin is
transfered from user A to user B, A adds B's public key to the
coin and signs it with his own private key. Now B owns the coin
and can transfer it further. To prevent A from transfering the
already used coin to another user C, a public list of all the
previous transactions is collectively maintained by the network
of bitcoin nodes, and before each transaction the coin's
unusedness will be checked.

For details, see chapter Advanced Questions.

3 What is bitcoin's value backed by?

Bitcoin is valued for the things it can be exchanged to, just
like all the traditional paper currencies are.

When the first user publicly announces that he will make a pizza
for anyone who gives him a hundred bitcoins, then he can use
bitcoins as payment to some extent - as much as people want pizza
and trust his announcement. A pizza-eating hairdresser who trusts
him as a friend might then announce that she starts accepting
bitcoins as payment for fancy haircuts, and the value of the
bitcoin would be higher - now you could buy pizzas and haircuts
with them. When bitcoins have become accepted widely enough, he
could retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his
bitcoin-savings.

4 How are new bitcoins created?

New coins are generated by a network node each time it finds the
solution to a certain calculational problem. In the first 4 years
of the bitcoin network, amount X of coins will be created. The
amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be X/2 after 4 years,
X/4 after 8 years and so on. Thus the total number of coins will
approach 2X.

5 Is bitcoin safe?

Yes, as long as you make backups of your coin keys, protect them
with strong passwords and keep keyloggers away from your
computer. If you lose your key or if some unknown attacker
manages to unlock it, there's no way to get your coins back. If
you have a large amount of coins, it is recommended to distribute
them under several keys. You propably wouldn't either keep all
your dollars or euros as paper in a single wallet and leave it
unguarded.

6 Why should I use bitcoin?

• Transfer money easily through the internet, without having to
   trust third parties.

• Third parties can't prevent or control your transactions.

• Be safe from the unfair monetary policies of the monopolistic
   central banks and the other risks of centralized power over a
   money supply. The limited inflation of the bitcoin system's
   money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout
   the network, not monopolized to a banking elite.

• Bitcoin's value is likely to increase as the growth of the
   bitcoin economy exceeds the inflation rate - consider bitcoin
   an investment and start running a node today!

7 Where can I get bitcoins?

Find a bitcoin owner and sell her something - MMORPG equipement,
IT support, lawn mowing, dollars or whatever you can trade with
her. You can also generate new bitcoins for yourself by running a
bitcoin network node.

      </div>
    <div id="email-5">
        <pre>Oh crap, I got your sourceforge usernames mixed up, sorry about that.  I 
clicked on the wrong e-mail when I was looking for your username.  You 
now have access.

Your FAQ looks good so far!

You can create whatever you want on bitcoin.sourceforge.net.  Something 
to get new users up to speed on what Bitcoin is and how to use it and 
why, and clean and professional looking would help make it look well 
established.  The site at bitcoin.org was designed in a more 
professorial style when I was presenting the design paper on the 
Cryptography list, but we're moving on from that phase.

You should probably change the part about "distribute them under several 
keys".  When the paper says that it means for the software to do it, and 
it does.  For privacy reasons, the software already uses a different key 
for every transaction, so every piece of money in your wallet is already 
on a different key.  The exception is when using a bitcoin address, 
everything sent to the same bitcoin address is on the same key, which is 
a privacy risk if you're trying to be anonymous.  The EC-DSA key size is 
very strong (sized for the future), we don't practically have to worry 
about a key getting broken, but if we did there's the advantage that 
someone expending the massive computing resources would only break one 
single transaction's worth of money, not someone's whole account.  The 
details about how to backup your wallet files is in the Q&amp;A dump and 
also it's explained in readme.txt and definitely belongs in the FAQ.

Oh I see, you're trying to address byronm's concern on freedomainradio. 
  I see what you mean about the password feature being useful to address 
that argument.  Banks let anyone who has your name and account number 
drain your account, and you're not going to get it back from Nigeria. 
If someone installs a keylogger on your computer, they could just as 
easily get your bank password and transfer money out of your account. 
Once we password encrypt the wallet, we'll be able to make a clearer 
case that we're much more secure than banks.  We use strong encryption, 
while banks still let anyone who has your account info draw money from 
your account.

&gt; You can create whatever you want on bitcoin.sourceforge.net.  Something
&gt; to get new users up to speed on what Bitcoin is and how to use it and
&gt; why, and clean and professional looking would help make it look well
&gt; established.  The site at bitcoin.org was designed in a more
&gt; professorial style when I was presenting the design paper on the
&gt; Cryptography list, but we're moving on from that phase.

Ok. Could you set the project MySQL database passwords so that I can  
set up a CMS on the site? I was thinking about WordPress, as it seems  
simple and well maintained. I need a password for the read/write  
account and one database (or the database admin pass to create it  
myself). This can be done somewhere in the project admin pages, I think.

&gt; You should probably change the part about "distribute them under
&gt; several keys".  When the paper says that it means for the software to
&gt; do it, and it does.  For privacy reasons, the software already uses a
&gt; different key for every transaction, so every piece of money in your
&gt; wallet is already on a different key.  The exception is when using a
&gt; bitcoin address, everything sent to the same bitcoin address is on the
&gt; same key, which is a privacy risk if you're trying to be anonymous.
&gt; The EC-DSA key size is very strong (sized for the future), we don't
&gt; practically have to worry about a key getting broken, but if we did
&gt; there's the advantage that someone expending the massive computing
&gt; resources would only break one single transaction's worth of money, not
&gt; someone's whole account.  The details about how to backup your wallet
&gt; files is in the Q&amp;A dump and also it's explained in readme.txt and
&gt; definitely belongs in the FAQ.

Ok, that's good to know.

&gt; Oh I see, you're trying to address byronm's concern on freedomainradio.
&gt;  I see what you mean about the password feature being useful to address
&gt; that argument.  Banks let anyone who has your name and account number
&gt; drain your account, and you're not going to get it back from Nigeria.
&gt; If someone installs a keylogger on your computer, they could just as
&gt; easily get your bank password and transfer money out of your account.
&gt; Once we password encrypt the wallet, we'll be able to make a clearer
&gt; case that we're much more secure than banks.  We use strong encryption,
&gt; while banks still let anyone who has your account info draw money from
&gt; your account.

Well, I guess that's true after all.

They have Wordpress built in, you might not need to set up any database 
stuff manually.  I enabled the Wordpress feature and added you as an 
admin, account sirius-m, e-mail sirius-m@users.sourceforge.net.  I'm not 
sure how it works out the password for access, maybe it's just based on 
being logged in to sourceforge.

https://apps.sourceforge.net/wordpress/bitcoin/wp-admin/

They also have support for MediaWiki if you want it.

In case you still need it, here's the accounts and passwords for mysql.

That's true.

We shouldn't try to use security against identity theft as a selling 
point, since it leads into these counter arguments.  The current banking 
model is already tested and the actual loss percentage is known.  Even 
if ours is probably better, it's an unknown, so people can imagine 
anything.  The uncertainty about what the average loss percentage will 
be is greater than the likely loss percentage itself.

The user group privileges seemingly can't be changed without changing  
the wiki source files, which can only be done by the SF admins as a  
hosted app is concerned. The hosted apps are also otherwise quite  
inflexible: you can only login with a SF account, you can't change

I think that replacing the current Wordpress installation at  
bitcoin.sourceforge.net with TikiWiki could be a great solution.  
TikiWiki supports CMS features, forums, wikis, bug trackers, and many  
other features also if needed. Perhaps the best looking example of a  
TikiWiki installation is at http://support.mozilla.com/.

I'll take backup of the current site and see if TikiWiki can be  
installed at SF. If it doesn't work, I'll see how wiki/forum features  
can be integrated with Wordpress or think of something else.

There are a lot of things you can say on the sourceforge site that I

saying "consider it an investment".  That's a dangerous thing to say and 
you should delete that bullet point.  It's OK if they come to that

A few details: the FAQ says "see section 2.3", but the sections aren't

planned to be hidden in v0.1.6, since they're just confusing and 
annoying and there's no reason for users to have to see them." -- that's 
not really something I meant to say publicly.

The links to sites to help set up 8333 port forwarding is great. 
favicon is a nice touch.

Someone came up with the word "cryptocurrency"... maybe it's a word we 
should use when describing Bitcoin, do you like it?

Sourceforge is so slow right now I can't even get the login page to 
load.  Maybe due to the site reorg they just did.  I'll keep trying and 
try to get you that logo stats thing.

It sounds good. "The P2P Cryptocurrency" could be considered as the

Oh, that sounds tough. Take your time.

&gt; It would help if there was something for people to use it for.  We need

I've been thinking about a currency exchange service that sells and
buys bitcoins for euros and other currencies. Direct exchangeability
to an existing currency would give bitcoin the best possible initial
liquidity and thus the best adoptability for new users. Everyone
accepts payment in coins that are easily exchangeable for common
money, but not everyone accepts payment in coins that are only
guaranteed to buy a specific kind of a product.

The instructional formula for stable pricing in euros would be something like:

(The amount of euros that you're ready to trade for bc + the
euro-value of goods that other people are selling for bc) /
(Total number of bc in circulation - own bc assets).

So if there's a total of 1M bitcoins of which you own 100K, you have
1000 eur and no one else trades with bitcoin yet, you can safely offer the
exchange rate of 1 eur / 900 bc, without having to devaluate
even if everyone sold their coins to you. This could be guaranteed as
the minimal exchange rate, but the rate could be also higher when
demand is high.

Initially, when others aren't yet offering anything for bitcoins, you
can increase your bitcoin assets cheaply - for the minimum price that
people bother to do the transaction for. If you had all the existing
coins for yourself, you could set the price to whatever you want,
because you wouldn't face the risk of having to buy even a single coin
with that price (not counting the new money created by others). So
it's best to get as much coins as possible before backing bitcoin with
all your available euros.

Profit can be gained, as usually in trading, by having a margin
between the buying and selling prices. Making Bitcoin as usable as
possible will make the business run better, as people do not only want
to sell all their coins to you, but also want to buy them and use them
as a medium of exchange.

At its simplest this exchange service could be a website where
traders, who can be individual persons, can post their rates, and
random users can leave trade requests. Some kind of an average rate
estimate could be shown on the site. Small-scale trading by
individuals would be outside legal hassle in most countries, and
putting all the eggs in the same basket would be avoided.

Another idea, which could be additional to the previous one, would be
an automated exchange service. The service would automatically
calculate the exchange rate and perform the transactions. This would
be nicer to the user: completion of the transaction request would be
certain and instantaneous. Making this service might actually be quite
easy if there was a command line interface to Bitcoin: just take any
web application framework and use PayPal back-end integration to
automatically send euros when Bitcoins are received, and vice versa.
This kind of business would also work great on larger scale if you set
up a company and take care of all the bureaucracy needed to practice
currency exchange. (I actually have a registered company that I've
used for billing of some IT work, I could use that as a base.)

This exchange business thing is something that I'd be interested in
doing, and I also have the sufficient technical skills to do it.
Although, before this can be done, there should be a non-alpha version
of Bitcoin (and the command line interface / API).

&gt; There are donors I can tap if we come up with something that needs
&gt; funding, but they want to be anonymous, which makes it hard to actually
&gt; do anything with it.

If this gets started, donors / high-risk investors would be very
welcome to bring capital for the currency's backup.

So, what do you think about the idea? Note that this is not something
that I'm asking you to do (unless you want to) if you're busy with
other things. I can do it myself, if I get positive reviews about the
plan.

        <pre>That's a good point that since you know how many coins exist and how 
fast new ones are created, you could set a support price based on the 
amount of legacy currency you have and be sure you'll have enough to 
meet all demands.  I had imagined an auction, but it would be far 
simpler and more confidence inspiring to back it at a specific exchange 
rate.

Offering currency to back bitcoins would attract freebie seekers, with 
the benefit of attracting a lot of publicity.  At first it would mostly 
be seen as a way to get free money for your computer's idle time.  Maybe 
pitched like help support the future of e-commerce and get a little 
money for your computer's spare cycles.  As people cash in and actually 
get paid, word would spread exponentially.

It might help to keep the minimum transaction size above an amount which 
a typical user would be able to accumulate with one computer, so that 
users have to trade with each other for someone to collect enough to 
cash in.  Aggregators would set up shop to buy bitcoins in smaller 
increments, which would add confidence in users ability to sell bitcoins 
if there are more available buyers than just you.

People would obviously be sceptical at first that the backing will hold 
up against an onslaught of people trying to get the free money, but as 
the competition raises the proof-of-work difficulty, it should become 
clear that bitcoins stay scarce.  People will see that they can't just 
get all the bitcoins they want.  It would establish a minimum value 
under bitcoins enabling them to be used for other purposes if, 
hopefully, other purposes are waiting for something to use.

&gt;&gt; It would help if there was something for people to use it for.  We need
&gt;&gt; an application to bootstrap it.  Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; I've been thinking about a currency exchange service that sells and
&gt; buys bitcoins for euros and other currencies. Direct exchangeability
&gt; to an existing currency would give bitcoin the best possible initial
&gt; liquidity and thus the best adoptability for new users. Everyone
&gt; accepts payment in coins that are easily exchangeable for common
&gt; money, but not everyone accepts payment in coins that are only
&gt; guaranteed to buy a specific kind of a product.

That would be more powerful if there was also some narrow product market 
to use it for.  Some virtual currencies like Tencent's Q coin have made 
headway with virtual goods.  It would be sweet if there was some way to 
horn in on a market like that as the official virtual currency gets 
clamped down on with limitations.  Not saying it can't work without 
something, but a ready specific transaction need that it fills would 
increase the certainty of success.

&gt; At its simplest this exchange service could be a website where
&gt; traders, who can be individual persons, can post their rates, and
&gt; random users can leave trade requests. Some kind of an average rate
&gt; estimate could be shown on the site. Small-scale trading by
&gt; individuals would be outside legal hassle in most countries, and
&gt; putting all the eggs in the same basket would be avoided.

Basically like an eBay site with user reviews to try to establish which 
sellers can be trusted.  The escrow feature will help but not solve 
everything.  It would be far more work to set up such a site than just 
to set up a single exchange site of your own, and there won't be enough 
users to make it go until later.  I'm thinking it wouldn't make sense to 
make an eBay type site until later.

&gt; Another idea, which could be additional to the previous one, would be
&gt; an automated exchange service. The service would automatically
&gt; calculate the exchange rate and perform the transactions. This would
&gt; be nicer to the user: completion of the transaction request would be

&gt; up a company and take care of all the bureaucracy needed to practice
&gt; currency exchange. (I actually have a registered company that I've
&gt; used for billing of some IT work, I could use that as a base.)

Even if you had automation, you'd probably want to review orders 
manually before processing them anyway.  It wouldn't be hard to process 
orders by hand, especially at first.  You could always set a minimum 
order size to keep orders more infrequent.

&gt; This exchange business thing is something that I'd be interested in
&gt; doing, and I also have the sufficient technical skills to do it.
&gt; Although, before this can be done, there should be a non-alpha version
&gt; of Bitcoin (and the command line interface / API).

&gt; that I'm asking you to do (unless you want to) if you're busy with
&gt; other things. I can do it myself, if I get positive reviews about the
&gt; plan.

That's great, I could probably get a donor to send currency to you which 
you convert to euros and pay out through methods that are convenient for 
users.  I don't want to do an exchange business myself, but it can be 
done independently of me.  Like you say, there is more software 
development to be done first, and also I'd like to keep trying for a 
while to think of a bootstrap application to use bitcoins for.  I've had 
some ideas that could only be done before an exchange exists.

BTW, I tried to buy bitcoin.com before I started but there was no 
chance, it's owned by a professional domain speculator.  It's normal for 
open source projects to have .org so it's not so bad.

        <pre>Glad that worked, it's a pain that the dependencies are so big and hard 
to build.  Some of them give little attention to the Windows build. 
Next time I update to the latest versions, maybe I'll lay everything out 
in one directory tree and bundle the whole thing up into a giant archive.

I'm not sure they had wxPack before.  I'm glad they got that so everyone 
doesn't have to build wxWidgets themselves.  OpenSSL is the harder one 
to build.

I reduced the EXE size by running strip.exe on it to take out the debug 
symbols.  That's with mingw.  That's the better compiler, I only used VC 
  for debugging.

Bitcoin could be promoted to the users of virtual communities like  
World of Warcraft and Second Life, which both have millions of users.  
It would be great if not only peer-to-peer item traders, but also  
providers of some existing virtual services that already have a lot of  
customers, were to adopt the currency early on.

A programming question: What do you think about using the Boost's  
program_options to write settings like the transaction fee into a file  
bitcoin.config? Or is it better to save them in the database as it is  
now? Having a config file would make it easier to change the settings  
when running the program on a remote server with a console access only.

&gt; would stay higher. 

Now that I think about it, you've put your finger on the most important 
missing feature right now that would make an order of magnitude 
difference in the number of nodes.  Without auto-run, we'll almost never 
retain nodes after an initial tryout interest.  Auto-running as a 
minimized tray icon by default was the key to success for the early file 
sharing networks.  It wouldn't have been appropriate for v0.1.0 when 
stability wasn't a given yet, but now it's good and stable.  This is a 
must-have feature for the next release so any users that come back to 
try the new version we hopefully retain this time.

I think the most user friendly way of doing auto-run is putting an icon 
in the Startup folder.  I see OpenOffice.org and a number of other 
things on my computer do it that way.  The other way, creating a runas 
registry entry, is not easily visible or editable by users, I've never 
liked that much.  I guess what we want is an auto-run option that's on 
by default, if the option is changed then it creates or deletes the 
startup icon.

While it's tempting to do a Linux port, once we do it we have that extra 
work with every release from then on.  I'd rather put it off a while 
longer.  Auto-run might give us 300% more nodes while Linux might give 
us 3% more.  Linux would help server farms, but actually we'd like to 
favour individual users.  Someone reported that it works fine in WinE.

feedback I've received that'll reduce confusion.  I'll probably enable 
multi-proc generating support, and hopefully make it safe to just backup 
wallet.dat to backup your money.  It's good to be coding again!

I'm going to hide the transaction fee setting, which is completely not 
needed and only serves to confuse people.  It was only there for testing 
and demonstration of a technical detail that can only be needed in the 
far away future, if ever, but was necessary to implement at the 
beginning to make it possible later.

What was the problem with the shortcut in the startup folder?  If you 
could send me the code, I'd like to take another look and see if I can 
see what the problem was.  The first strcat in the registry code should 
be strcpy, otherwise it would fail intermittently.  If the same code was 
in the shortcut one, maybe that was the problem.

It's encouraging to see more people taking an interest such as that 
NewLibertyStandard site.  I like his approach to estimating the value 
based on electricity.  It's educational to see what explanations people 
adopt.  They may help discover a simplified way of understanding it that 
makes it more accessible to the masses.  Many complex concepts in the 
world have a simplistic explanation that satisfies 80% of people, and a 
complete explanation that satisfies the other 20% who see the flaws in 
the simplistic explanation.

        <pre>Yeah, I put back your startup folder shortcut code and it started fine 
for me too on XP and Vista.  For good measure, I changed it to make the 
shortcut settings look identical to one I manually created.  I set the 
working directory to where the EXE is since that's where debug.log is 
created, otherwise windows puts it in some weird directory.  I didn't 
change the setup script yet.

I checked everything in to SVN (thanks for setting that up)
- multi-proc generate
- flush wallet.dat after every change so the DB doesn't leave that stuff 
in the transaction logs
- view menu checkbox to hide all generated coins so you can see just 
your payment transactions
- disabled transaction fee option
- made the minimize to tray options similar to Firefox's MinimizeToTray
- bunch of other misc changes since the 0.1.5 release

I made it not show non-accepted generated coins.  It won't show 
generated coins until they have at least one confirmation (one block 
linked after it), so usually they'll just never be seen.  Occasionally a 
generated coin that was displayed might disappear because it became not 
accepted later.  I don't think anyone would notice the occasional 
non-accepteds if we didn't point them out in the UI.  People have told 
me they find it annoying to have to look at them, as they're permanently 
displayed in the transaction record.

I still have more testing to do.  I guess we gotta test Windows 7 now.

&gt;&gt; debug.log should tell something if that was the case.  What OS are you

&gt;&gt; Stuff that requires Admin can't start on startup on Vista.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm using XP. I recompiled the older revision and this time the startup 
&gt; shortcut works. It also works when testing on Vista (non-admin). Maybe I 
&gt; just missed something the previous time.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Program shortcuts have multiple tabs of settings with lots of little
&gt;&gt; details.  I'll try the startup folder code and see if I can reproduce
&gt;&gt; the problem.  Every other systray icon on my computer is in the startup
&gt;&gt; folder, and it makes it easy for users to manage all their autoruns in
&gt;&gt; one place.  The things in the registry key tend to be devious hidden
&gt;&gt; bloatware.
&gt; 
&gt; Here it's the other way around, I have all my startup programs in the 
&gt; registry. But maybe the shortcut method is nicer for the user, if it 
&gt; works just as well

&gt;  Do you Windows users experience occasional Bitcoin crashes?
&gt; Lately Bitcoin running in wine-1.0.1 has been crashing frequently. I was
&gt; just wondering whether this is a Wine issue or a Bitcoin issue. 

I haven't had any reports of crashes in v0.1.5.  It's been rock solid 
for me on Windows.  I think it must be Wine related.  If you get another 
crash in Wine and it prints anything on the terminal, e-mail me and I 
may be able to figure out what happened, maybe something I can work 
around.  Martti and I have been working on a new version to release soon 
and it would be nice to get any Wine fixes in there.

&gt; The following four lines print from the terminal when I start Bitcoin.
&gt; fixme:toolhelp:CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Unimplemented: heap list snapshot
&gt; fixme:toolhelp:Heap32ListFirst : stub
&gt; fixme:toolhelp:CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Unimplemented: heap list snapshot
&gt; fixme:toolhelp:Heap32ListFirst : stub

Those don't look like anything to worry about.  Probably functions 
unimplemented by Wine that are harmlessly stubbed out.

&gt; I previously wasn't starting Bitcoin from the terminal, so I don't know what
&gt; gets printed out when it crashes, but I'll reply with the results the next
&gt; time it crashes.
&gt; 
&gt; While Bitcoin first downloads previously completed blocks, the file
&gt; debug.log grows grows to 17.4 MB and then stops growing. I imagine it will
&gt; continue to grow as more bitcoins are completed.

You can delete debug.log occasionally if you don't want to take the disk 
space.  It's just status messages that help with debugging.

bitcoin.sourceforge.net looks fine now.  Maybe sourceforge was doing 
some maintenance.

Getting antsy to port to Linux?  It's not a decision to be taken lightly

Although I am worried about Liberty's Wine crashes.

I've tried to be as portable as possible and use standard C stuff 
instead of Windows calls.  The threading is _beginthread which is part 
of the standard C library.  wxWidgets has wxCriticalSection stuff we can 
use.  The sockets code is send/recv stuff which I think is the same as 
unix because Microsoft ported sockets from BSD.  We need direct control 
over sockets, it wouldn't be a good idea to get behind an abstraction 
layer.  wxWidgets is a good place to look for cross-platform support 
functions.  I want to avoid #ifdefing up the code if we can.  Anything 
that's used more than once probably becomes a function in util.cpp that 
has the #ifdef in it.

BTW, I have a lot of uncommitted changes right now because it includes 
some crucial protocol transitions that can't be unleashed on the network 
until I've tested the heck out of it.  It shouldn't be too much longer.

Can you make the setup uninstall the Startup folder icon?  I figure it 
should install and uninstall an icon in a regular program group, and 
just uninstall the Startup folder one.  I guess it doesn't matter that 
much whether it installs and uninstalls the Startup folder icon or just 
uninstalls it.

It's not possible with the current version of Bitweaver. Bitweaver's  
wiki and forum packages aren't so very highly advanced. SF hosting  
also has its disadvantages, like the occasional slowness and lack of  
e-mailer and user IP retrieving. I've been considering to buy web  
hosting from prq.se (the host of Wikileaks and Pirate Bay, among  
others) to be used later for the exchange service. I could maybe host  
the project site there as well, under a separate user account for  
better security. There I could set up Drupal or TikiWiki, which are  
more advanced and have quite a lot bigger and more active  
developer/user communities than Bitweaver.

I checked in all my backlog of changes to SVN, including the overhaul of 
CCriticalSection in util.h and OpenSSL's mutex callback in util.cpp to 
do everything with wxWidgets when not on Windows.

If we get it working on Linux, I'll run my test suite against it here 
off-network first, then we can give an unreleased build to 
LibertyStandard to test for a while before going public.

        <pre>Great, I've been looking forward to working on the Linux build.

If you connect to Freenode's hidden service, then they tell you they've 
also banned TOR from that due to abuse and it kicks you off.  There's a 
several step procedure you can do to run a password utility on unix and 
e-mail request an account that you could login with, but that's getting 
pretty complicated.  I wonder if we could get away with applying for one 
account and then everyone use the same account?  I suppose the IRC 
server probably limits accounts to one login, or some admin might not 
like to see a dozen logins on the same account.

Besides the IRC part, how did your test of proxy go?  Since you've been 
connected before, your addr.dat contains known node addresses, but 
without IRC to know which ones are online, it takes a long time to find 
them.  There are normally 1 to 3 other nodes besides you that can accept 
incoming connections, and existing nodes that already know you would 
eventually connect to you.  How many connections did you get, and how 
long did it take?  I guess to know whether it successfully connected 
outbound through TOR you'd need to search debug.log for "connected".

To originally connect with TOR without connecting normally once to get 
seeded, you'd have to know the address of an existing node that can 
accept incoming connections and seed it like this:
bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=&lt;ip of a node&gt;

If some nodes that accept incoming connects were willing to have their 
IP coded into the program, it could seed automatically.  Or some IP seed 
addresses posted on a Wiki page with the instructions.

Another option is to search the world again for an IRC server that 
doesn't ban TOR nodes.  Or if we could get someone to set one up.  IRC 
servers ban TOR because they have actual text chat on them... if there 
was one with just bots and junk then it wouldn't care.  Probably should 
post a question on the forum or the mailing list and see if anyone knows 
one.

Another problem is that TOR users can't accept incoming connections, and 
we have so few that can.  If everyone goes to TOR, there won't be any 
nodes to connect to.

We have a shortage of nodes that can accept incoming connections.  It 
generally ranges from 2 to 4 lately.  We need to emphasize the 
importance to people of setting up port forwarding on their router. 
Every P2P file sharing program has instructions how to do it.  We should 
have a paragraph on the bitcoin.sourceforge.net homepage urging people 
to set up port forwarding to accept incoming connections, and a link to 
a site that describes how to do it for each router.

        <pre>It was almost there.  I fixed a few things and got it to finish 
compiling but I don't know the system libraries to link to so there's 
undefined references galore.

I changed the makefile to look for things under /usr/local and in their 
default "make install" locations.  I wrote what I did and switches I 
used in build-unix.txt.  I'm currently using wxWidgets 2.8.9 for now 
because it's the same version as on Windows and I don't want to wonder 
if there's version change issues at the same time as platform change. 
2.8.10 or 2.9.0 are probably fine though.  I went with the 
single-library compile of wxWidgets since we're linking to almost every 
library anyway.

I added xpm files, which is what they use everywhere else but Windows 
instead of RC files.  They're clever C files that define graphics in 
static arrays.  The bitcoin icon has 5 different versions but I couldn't 
figure out how that works in xpm so I only put the biggest one.  Maybe 
on GTK it scales it for you.  I don't know if these are right or what, 
but they compile.

There are debian packages available for some of the dependencies instead 
of having to compile them ourselves:
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
apt-get install libssl-dev

I need to see if Berkeley DB or Boost have packages.

We'll shared-link OpenSSL, I'm pretty sure it's always preinstalled on

        <pre>&gt; Besides the IRC part, how did your test of proxy go?  Since you've been
&gt; connected before, your addr.dat contains known node addresses, but
&gt; without IRC to know which ones are online, it takes a long time to find
&gt; them.  There are normally 1 to 3 other nodes besides you that can
&gt; accept incoming connections, and existing nodes that already know you
&gt; would eventually connect to you.  How many connections did you get, and
&gt; how long did it take?  I guess to know whether it successfully
&gt; connected outbound through TOR you'd need to search debug.log for
&gt; "connected".

Enabling the proxy setting and restarting Bitcoin I got the first  
connections in less than a minute and ultimately even 8 connections. I  
wonder if they're all really through TOR. Netstat shows only 2  
connections to localhost:9050 and 7 connections from local port 8333  
to elsewhere. (Some of the shown connections may be already  
disconnected ones.) For some reason there's no debug.log in the folder  
where I'm running it.

&gt; If some nodes that accept incoming connects were willing to have their
&gt; IP coded into the program, it could seed automatically.  Or some IP
&gt; seed addresses posted on a Wiki page with the instructions.

The wiki page sounds like a good and quickly applicable solution. I  
could keep my ip updated there and we could ask others to do the same.  
When the Linux build works, it's easier to set up nodes on servers  
that are online most of the time and have a static IP. A static ip  
list shipped with Bitcoin and a peer exchange protocol would be cool.  
That way there'd be no need for an IRC server.

7 inbound and 2 outbound sounds about as expected.

My last SVN commit included an overhaul of the code that selects the 
order of addresses to connect to, trying them in the order of most 
recently seen online, so it should get connected in a more reasonable 
amount of time if IRC is unavailable.  IRC is really only needed to seed 
the first connection, but we've been using it as a crutch to get 
connected faster.

That would be great.  It's only TOR users that need it, so in the 
instructions saying "bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=&lt;someip&gt;", 
someip could be an actual static IP, with the wiki free-for-all 
add-your-ip list nearby or a link to it.  There should be a link to that optional step, add your IP to this list now that you can accept incoming 
if you're static.

Do you think anonymous people are looking to be completely stealth, as 
in never connect once without TOR so nobody knows they use bitcoin, or 
just want to switch to TOR before doing any transactions?  It's just if 
you want to be completely stealth that you'd have to go through the 
-proxy -addnode manual seeding.  It would be very easy to fumble that 
up; if you run bitcoin normally to begin with it immediately 
automatically starts connecting.

        <pre>It works reliably on Linux now, except if it uses wxMessageBox() outside 
the GUI thread, it'll crash because non-GUI threads can't open a window 
on Linux.  I haven't got to fixing that yet.  I've been running my 
stress test on it and it's functioning normally.

Most of wxWidgets is not thread-safe to use in threads other than the UI 
thread, but as a rule of thumb on Windows anything not UI related is OK. 
  It turns out its more thread-unsafe on GTK.  I replaced a bunch of 
stuff at once so I don't know if it was just one thing (probably 
Repaint), but I have to assume even any wx function that uses wxString 
is not safe to use outside the UI thread.  So dang, there goes all the 
nice wxWidgets portability support functions.  I left a few simple 
things like wxThread::GetCPUCount() that I checked the source and it's 
all numerical, and wxMutex has to be safe or it'd be useless.

There's an issue that if you exit and run it again right away, it can't 
bind port 8333.  The port frees up after about a minute.  Unless I'm 
missing something, I am closing the socket before exit, so I don't know 
what else I can do.  Maybe this is just something about Linux that it 
takes a minute to free up a port you had bound.  Possibly a security 
feature so some trojan doesn't kill the web server and quickly jump into 
its place and pick up all the client retries.

Still gotta figure out how to do the xpm version of the icon correctly.

I wonder if the database dat files are interchangeable with Windows.

One option would be ning.com. Ning.com is a popular community site and  
many users who already have an account wouldn't need to register a new  
account. Example: http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/. This seems to  
support SSL.

Another option would be to relocate the whole site to some place where  
we can run Drupal or TikiWiki. I've been thinking of buying virtual  
server or web hosting for the exchange service sometime soon, and if  
the platform allows for two separate accounts, we could run the site  
there too. The CMS and its database can be always copied and relocated  
to a new web host if needed.

then begins uploading the list of blocks requested.  It doesn't receive 
the blocks, but it didn't run long enough for me to be sure it would

How long did you run it?  It could take a few minutes to start 
downloading the blocks.  Especially if you're on a cable modem, the 
uplink can be much lower bandwidth so it would take some time to upload 
the block request list.

If you run it again and it still doesn't download blocks, keep it 
running for several hours at least and then send me the debug.log.  That 
should give it time for my node to connect to you and I could see what 
it says on my side and correlate it with your debug.log.

You're right about the minimize on close option, there's no reason that 
can't be separate.  Martti originally had it separate and I made it a 
sub-option, my bad.  I'll change it back.

&gt; 
&gt; I generally set application preferences to not minimize to the tray, but

&gt; open windows as sub-menu items.) Then if the tray icon disappears, I go 
&gt; into the settings disable and re-enable the tray icon setting to get it

It already uses SO_REUSEADDR so it can bind to the port if it's in 
TIME_WAIT state after being closed.  The only time it should fail to 
bind is when the program really is already running.  It's important that 
two copies of Bitcoin not run on the same machine at once because they 
would be modifying the database at the same time.  There is never any 
need to run two on one machine as coin generation will now use multiple 
processors automatically.

I'm not sure what those lib errors are, I'll do some searching.

        <pre>Thanks for that, I see what happened.  Because the first one was slow, 
it ended up requesting the blocks from everybody else, which only bogged 
everything down.  I can fix this, I just need to think a while about the 
right way.

There's no risk in shutting down while there are unconfirmed.  When you 
make a transaction or new block, it immediately broadcasts it to the 
network.  After that, the increasing #/confirmed number is just 
monitoring the outcome.  There's nothing your node does during that time 
to promote the acceptance.

Now that I think about it, when you close Bitcoin, it closes the main 
window immediately but in the background continues running to finish an 
orderly flush and shutdown of the database.  Before I implemented that, 
it was annoying having a dead hung unresponsive window hanging around. 
Until it finishes the orderly shutdown in the background, the port would 
be locked, and this is an important protection to make sure another copy 
can't touch the database until it's done.  I haven't seen the shutdown 
take more than a few seconds.

In Wine, there's no way for the Windows version to do SO_REUSEADDR, so 
that would add 60 seconds (on my system) of TIME_WAIT after the port is 
closed.

If you need to transfer between two copies, you could send it to the 
other's bitcoin address.  The receiving copy doesn't have to be online 
at the time.

The command line to use a different data directory is
bitcoin -datadir=&lt;directory&gt;

For example, on Linux, the default directory is (don't use ~)
bitcoin -datadir=/home/yourusername/.bitcoin

You shouldn't normally have any need to use this switch.  It still won't 
let you run two instances at once.

&gt;            When I launch bitcoin and the bitcoin port is not available,
&gt;         I get
&gt;            the following messages to the command line. I don't get those
&gt;            messages when the bitcoin port is available. Would it be possible
&gt;            for bitcoin to pick another port if the default port is
&gt;         taken? The
&gt;            same think sometimes happens to me with my BitTorrent client.
&gt;         When I
&gt;            restart it, my previously open port is closed. All I have to
&gt;         do is
&gt;            change the port and it starts working again.
&gt; 
&gt;            /usr/lib/gio/modules/libgvfsdbus.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64

&gt; 
&gt;     It already uses SO_REUSEADDR so it can bind to the port if it's in
&gt;     TIME_WAIT state after being closed.  The only time it should fail to
&gt;     bind is when the program really is already running.  It's important
&gt;     that two copies of Bitcoin not run on the same machine at once
&gt;     because they would be modifying the database at the same time.
&gt;      There is never any need to run two on one machine as coin
&gt;     generation will now use multiple processors automatically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I run two instances at the same time is to transfer bitcoins 
&gt; from one bitcoin instance to another. They of course would need to be 
&gt; accessing different data directories. Perhaps that could be specified as 
&gt; a command line argument. I currently have to move my bitcoin data folder 
&gt; to a virtual machine to do this. Shutting down bitcoin and restarting it 
&gt; with a different data directory is a poor solution because shutting down 
&gt; bitcoin while there are unconfirmed bitcoins risks losing those bitcoins.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin was definitely not running when i get the busy port error. The 
&gt; process closes quickly and reliably from my experience, but it takes 
&gt; anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes (estimation from memory) for the 
&gt; port to become available again. It occurred while switching from bitcoin 
&gt; 0.1.5 in Wine to the Linux build and again while switching from the 
&gt; Linux build to bitcoin 0.1.5 in Wine.
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing that I noticed is that the about dialog text does not fit 
&gt; correctly and it cannot be resized. 
&gt; 
&gt;     I'm not sure what those lib errors are, I'll do some searching.

        <pre>&gt; Martti, how long did it take to start downloading blocks when you ran

Started very quickly when I got connected and downloaded quicker than  
my Windows PC, which has a slower CPU.

I'll have to focus on a school project (coincidentally C++ coding) for

        <pre>You really don't want to keep running in Wine, you're getting database 
errors (db.log).  You probably developed these rituals of transferring 
to a fresh install to cope with database corruption.  If there is a way 
to lose unconfirmed blocks, it would have to be the database errors. 
Any problems you find in the Linux build can be fixed.  The Wine 
incompatibility deep inside Berkeley DB is unfixable.

I think GCC 4.3.3 on the Linux build optimized the SHA-256 code better 
than the old GCC 3.4.5 on Windows.  When I was looking for the best 
SHA-256 code, there was a lot of hand tuned highly optimized SHA1 code 
available, but not so much for SHA-256 yet.  I should see if I can 
upgrade MinGW to 4.3.x to get them on a level playing field.

        <pre>I see what happened.  All your sockets went dead somehow.  You had no 
communication with the network, but because you had 8 zombie 
connections, it thought it was still online and kept generating blocks. 
  You can tell this is happening when your blocks are numbered 
sequentially, without other people's blocks interspersed, like:
2/unconfirmed
3/unconfirmed
4/unconfirmed
5/unconfirmed
6 blocks
7 blocks

It's implausible that you would be the only one to find blocks for 6 
blocks in a row like that.

When you exited and restarted, it connected and downloaded 45 blocks 
that the network found in your absence.  Since your blocks were not 
broadcast to the network immediately, the network went on without them.

It sounds like you had exactly the same problem on Wine.  There's 
clearly something about socket handling on Linux that's effecting it 
either way.

I'll start researching this.  Ultimately if I can't find the root of the 
problem, I'll have to make some kind of mechanism to watch for an 
absence of messages and disconnect.  The only workaround for you right 
now would be to exit and restart more often.

All but one of your node connections went dead at the same time, one 
shortly after.  IRC was still working, so it wasn't that you were 
offline from the internet.

I wonder if the status of blocks should say "#/unconfirmed" all the way 
up to maturity (119/unconfirmed then 120 blocks) instead.  The meaning 
of the number isn't as strong for blocks as for transactions.

I think it would be an improvement not to count one's own blocks as 
confirmations.  A drawback would be that the status numbers shown by 
different nodes would not match.  The status number would no longer be 
coordinated with the maturity countdown on blocks either.  A lighter 
option would be a special case only if all confirmations are your own.

You should run with the "-debug" switch to get some additional debug.log

        <pre>Right now (04:50 GMT) my node is connecting to yours and getting zombie 
connections each time.  The socket isn't returning an error, just zombie 
without notice.  If you're running the linux build right now, it would 
be interesting to see what the log says on your side.

test3:

I've added specific code to detect zombie sockets.  It'll detect if the 
socket hasn't sent or received any data within 60 seconds of connecting, 
and detect if data is queued to send and hasn't sent for 3 minutes.

I think I may have weakened the reconnect speed in test2.  In test3 I'm 
making it more determined to reconnect quickly.

I added checking to track whether other nodes received your generated 
blocks.  If none did, it'll warn you in the description:
"Generated - Warning: This block was not received by any other nodes and 
will probably not be accepted!"

The status can go to "#/offline?" for blocks or transactions you create 
if they don't get out to any other nodes.

With all this, it should be impossible not to notice as soon as it 
screws up.  It should hopefully disconnect all the zombie sockets. 
After that, whether it's able to make some good connections, or sockets 
is completely hosed and it stays at 0 connections, I don't know.

If this doesn't work, I guess I'll look at the sourcecode of some other 
P2P apps like BitTorrent and see how they deal with this stuff.  Maybe 
there's some magic flag or procedure to bash the sockets system back to 
life.

        <pre>test 5:

I added MSG_DONTWAIT to the send and recv calls in case they forgot the 
socket is non-blocking.  If that doesn't work, there's now the catch-all 
solution: another thread monitors the send/recv thread and terminates 
and restarts it if it stops.  It prints "*** Restarting 
ThreadSocketHandler ***" in debug.log, and an error message displays on 
the status bar for a while.

Before terminating, it tries closing the socket that's hung.  If that 
works, it doesn't have to resort to terminating.

I ran a test where it terminated the thread about 1000 times without 
trouble, so it should be safe.  The terminate on linux is 
pthread_cancel, which throws it into C++'s exception handler.

The thread calls we were using didn't have terminate, so I created our 
own wrappers in util.h to use CreateThread on windows and pthread_create 
on linux, instead of:
   _beginthread is windows only and lacks terminate
   boost::thread is really attractive, but lacks terminate
   wxThread requires you to create a class for every function you might 
call (yuck)

        <pre>I created a forum on Zetaboards, InvisionFree's new site that they're 
migrating to.

http://s1.zetaboards.com/Bitcoin/index/

I made an admin account you can use to upgrade your own account to admin:
u: admin
pw: B98VzUUA

BTW, the admin pages have a huge blank space at the top, you have to 
scroll down.

It doesn't support SSL, but none of them do.  I replaced the ugly 
default orange and blue theme with the Frostee theme, which was the only 
decent looking theme I could find after extensive searching.  Searching 
for themes is futile, there are thousands of rubbish themes.  It turns 
out the solution is to look at button sets instead 
(http://resources.zetaboards.com/forum/1000328/)

I only created two subforums to begin with.  I'll create new ones as the 
need arises.  I like to start with a flat namespace until there's enough 
items to justify subsections.  Technical Support makes sense as a 
separate section to get that stuff out of the main spotlight so our 
dirty laundry isn't in everyone's face, and to make people feel more 
free to report bugs there.  Mostly only devs and people checking on a 
bug need read the Technical Support section.

        <pre>linux-0.1.6-test5 solved Liberty's zombie socket problem.  The 
MSG_DONTWAIT fixed the root cause, it's not having to terminate and 
restart the thread.  The sockets are marked non-blocking already, so I 
don't understand why.  Maybe it forgot.  I suppose if a socket fails and 
the OS closes it then there's nothing left to remember it was 
non-blocking, but then accessing a closed handle should return 
immediately with an error.  There's no MSG_DONTWAIT on Windows, marking 
the socket as nonblocking is the only way, so if anyone runs the Windows 
version in Wine it will have to rely on terminating the thread.

The only problem now is the DB exceptions he's getting.

He has Ubuntu 64-bit and I have 32-bit, so I'm assuming that's the

What do you see as the benefits of switching the wiki?
Some I can think of:
  SSL
  get away from sourceforge's unreliable hosting
  everything not logged by sourceforge

The forum feature is about as weak as bitweaver.  We need a full blown 
forum software for that.

My priority right now is to get a forum going, either phpBB or similar. 
  What do you think of the zetaboards option?  Should we go ahead with that?

I think the biggest advantage is having a single site so you don't

Also being ad-free is a plus.

        <pre>That's a good idea to go in a more web-publishing CMS type direction 
like Drupal.  That's a better fit and can produce a better looking 
website than a wiki.  I think I was wrong about wiki.  Only a few 
specific people will do any website design work and those people can go 
ahead and have a separate login.  In that case, login integration with 
the forum doesn't matter much.  For security, I'd almost rather have a 
different login than be constantly checking the forum with the same 
login that could pwn the website.

Drupal's forum is less bad than the wikis, but still a long way from 
something I would want to use.

zetaboards pros and cons:

pros:
- we don't have to worry about bandwidth
- they handle the backend management and security patches

con:
- lack of SSL
- lack of privacy, everything is logged
- lack of control over the php code for customization
- no CAPTCHA, and if they add one later it might be unacceptable flash
- ads (could pay to get rid of them later if we care enough)
- there's always the risk they abruptly cancel the site for some petty 
reason

        <pre>test 7:

Backup your data directory before running this, just in case.

Workaround for the Db::open/Db::close "Bad file descriptor" exception. 
Might also make the initial block download faster.  The workaround is to 
open the database handles and keep them open for the duration of the 
program, which is actually the more common thing to do anyway.  If we're 
not closing and opening all the time, the error shouldn't get a chance 
to happen.

The one exception is wallet.dat, which I still close after writing is 
finished so I can flush the transaction logs into the dat file, making 
the dat file standalone.  That way if someone does a backup while 
Bitcoin is running, they'll get a wallet.dat that is valid by itself 
without the database transaction logs.

This is a restructuring of the database handling, so we might find some 
new deadlocks.  Usually if it deadlocks, either the UI will stop 
repainting, or it'll stop using CPU even though it still says Generating.

Another issue I thought of with zetaboards: most free forum sites won't 
let you export the user account database if you want to move.  I don't 
know why I don't see any other software projects using a free forum, but 
I have to assume there might be a reason we would discover later.

If you can install phpBB3 on your VPS, that's probably the better option.

 From what I've seen on other forums, if the cost of bandwidth becomes 
an issue, a small Google Adwords (text links) at the top generates more 
than the cost of bandwidth even for very low value traffic like gaming. 
  This would be much higher value traffic well targeted for high paying 
gold merchant keywords and VPN hosts.  It could eventually be a valuable 
revenue stream you wouldn't want to give away to some free site.

I want to pre-announce some of the features in version 0.2 on the forum 
and try to get some anticipation going.  Even if hardly anyone else is 
posting, I have seen project forums where most of the posts are the 
author announcing what's going on with the latest changes.  Users can 
see progress going on, see that it's improving and supported and not 
abandonware.  It's a little like a blog in that case, but easier for 
users to use it as a searchable FAQ and better organized.  Whenever I 
google search software questions, most of the hits are forum posts.

        <pre>Finally an easy one.  I see a way that could happen on a long operation 
such as the initial download.  The TryLock bug is unrelated to the db 
stuff.  Fix will be in test8.

I've been able to reproduce the db::open/close exception 3 times now on 
32-bit linux by hitting it with a continuous flood of non-stop requests. 
  It looks like even periodically closing the wallet.dat database to 
flush it gets the db::close exceptions.  I'm disabling the wallet flush 
feature on Linux.  On Linux we'll never close a database handle until 
we're ready to exit.  So far with this disabled, no exceptions.

I'm also implementing the orderly initial block download.  Instead of 
naively requesting all the blocks at once, it'll request batches of 500 
at a time.  This way, it'll receive the blocks before the retry timeout, 
so it shouldn't go requesting it from other nodes unless it actually 
doesn't receive them or it's too slow.  The change is in the requestee's 
side, so this functionality won't be visible until your initial block 
download is coming from a node that has the new version.

I'm going to test this some more before sending test8.

&gt;     exception. Might also make the initial block download faster.  The
&gt;     workaround is to open the database handles and keep them open for
&gt;     the duration of the program, which is actually the more common thing
&gt;     to do anyway.  If we're not closing and opening all the time, the
&gt;     error shouldn't get a chance to happen.
&gt; 
&gt;     The one exception is wallet.dat, which I still close after writing
&gt;     is finished so I can flush the transaction logs into the dat file,
&gt;     making the dat file standalone.  That way if someone does a backup
&gt;     while Bitcoin is running, they'll get a wallet.dat that is valid by
&gt;     itself without the database transaction logs.
&gt; 
&gt;     This is a restructuring of the database handling, so we might find
&gt;     some new deadlocks.  Usually if it deadlocks, either the UI will
&gt;     stop repainting, or it'll stop using CPU even though it still says
&gt;     Generating.

DNS entry.

I'm thinking of merging the bitcoin.org information with your site 
content so I can switch the whole bitcoin.org domain over.  We need to 
replace the current bitcoin.org site with a user-oriented site before 
the release.

If the website and forum switch at the same time, then forum.bitcoin.org 
isn't necessary unless we want it that way for looks.

Have you decided on the CMS to use?  I should research Drupal and other 
CMSes and see what's the most popular.

The linux version, setup exe, tor option and better website/forum will 
all increase the percentage of visitors who can use it, and the 
autostart and minimize to tray will increase how many keep running it. 
All those factors multiply together.

&gt; NewLibertyStandard should perhaps change his pricing to the market price 
&gt; (i.e. what people are willing to buy and sell for) so that he doesn't

It's good to start low and only have the price go up.

I really like that he explains the concept that the cost of electricity 
is a minimum floor under the price.  At a minimum you either have to pay 
the cost in electricity or pay someone the cost of production to make 
them for you.

        <pre>I'll go ahead with setting up Drupal then.

I don't think we should make the site https by default.  It's still very 
unusual for the public part of sites to be https, probably because it 
introduces potential technical complications, delays and greater server 
load.  As a user I'm a little annoyed when it takes time to verify the 
identity of some no-name site I casually came across.  For me it seems 
like https sites fail to load a lot more often.

The important thing is to have SSL available for those who need it. 
Those who need SSL I think know to try inserting an "s" after http and 
see if it works.  SMF has code that changes all the links to https if 
the URL handed in is https.

We could add a note on the registration page that if you want SSL, you 
can change http to https at any time and approve the self-signed 
certificate, or a link that does it, and the TOR page can mention it too.

We can look into getting a certificate later when things have settled 
down.  With Class 1, no changes are allowed for a year, which is a risk 
if we find issues with the current host and have to change IP.

The logo's a little too Disco/web-1990's.  I still like your bitweaver 
one better, I recreated it with text as a placeholder for now.  When the 
theme is more settled, I'll think about a matching logo.

Good idea about the Sourceforge tag, we can use all the graphics we can get.

I have more to do before we go live, and we need to give the search 
engines more time.

        <pre>What Windows version/browser doesn't font anti-aliasing work on?  IE 6

There's a transaction fee of 0.01 per KB after the first 1KB for 
oversized transactions.  The first 1KB is free, small transactions are 
typically 250 bytes.  Doubleclick on the transaction.  Think of it like 
postage by weight.

The solution is an extra dialog when sending, something like "This is an 
oversized transaction and requires a transaction fee of 0.20bc.  Is this 
OK?"  (is that text good enough or any improvements?)  I have the code 
already, I'll put it in.

Then we wouldn't have to explain the 10,000.20bc transaction, but may 
still have to explain who the transaction fee goes to.

That's strange, I've seen Firefox 3.5 on XP anti-alias large fonts. 
Well anyway, your way is safer.

I changed it back to text for now though so I can keep tweaking the 
colours.  Drupal puts the &lt;span&gt; tags and junk in the browser title but 
that's fine for testing.

I added some instruction text on the homepage below the screenshots.

&gt; Is there no transaction fee then, if you send the same amount in 
&gt; multiple small packages?

True.  I suppose the dialog could make it worse by giving people a 
chance to experiment with breaking it up.

I'm making some changes.  The largest free transaction will be 60KB, or 
about 27,000bc if made of 50bc inputs.  I hope that's high enough that 
the transaction fee should rarely ever come up.  v0.2 nodes will take 
free transactions until the block size is over 200K, with priority given 
to smaller transactions.

It's best if you don't talk about this transaction fee stuff in public. 
  It's there for flood control.  We don't want to give anyone any ideas.

&gt; Where should it go btw? Here it went to the receiver along with all the 
&gt; other coins. Transaction screenshot attached.

You found an infrequent bug in CreateTransaction.  It wrote the 
transaction for 10000.20 with a fee of 0.22.  If you look at the 
transaction on the sender's side, it'll be a debit 10000.42 with 
transaction fee 0.22.  The bug was that it had to make a rare third pass 
on calculating the fee, and incorrectly added the first pass' fee to the 
amount being sent.  Will fix.

The first time I tried it on Windows, the initial download took a few  
minutes to start, even though it got many connections quickly. I tried  
again twice, and didn't have the same problem again. I don't know  
whether it's related to your latest update or not.

On Ubuntu it worked fine.

Most of the fixes are on the sender's side, so if you were downloading the network upgrades to 0.2.

        <pre>Thanks for creating the maintenance account, it would have been

it.  OK, I changed the password to a 20 character random password.

That's a good domain.  People rarely type domain names anymore, they use 
autocomplete or click links on search engines.

I need to make a way for you to programmatically get new generated 
bitcoin addresses.  Either that or you could have them send to your IP 
address, but then you have to rely on them to put the order number in 
the comment.

When generating the new address, there can be an option to add an entry 
to the address book associated with the address, so the received 
transaction will be labelled.  I kinda hid the labels after early users 
found them confusing, but it would be very helpful for this application. 
  You have to widen up the comment column to see them.

Are you going to manually review and enter orders, at least to begin 
with?  I sure would.

I'm thinking I should move the UI in the direction of having the user 
ask for their bitcoin address when they want one.  "give me a bitcoin to 
receive a payment with".  I suppose next to the send button, there would 
by a receive button, you press it and it says "here's a new address to 
use, here's the button to copy it to the clipboard, do you want to label 
it?" and maybe some explanation about why you shouldn't reuse addresses.

Or maybe just a "New Address" button next to the address box that you 
should hit each time to change it.

I'd also need at least the command line tools to check if coins have  
been received and to send coins. It would require some way to  
communicate with the Bitcoin process running in the background. I  
don't know how that should be done, maybe with something RPC related.

It would also be great if the background process was non-graphical -  
the VPS on the current service level doesn't have enough memory to run  
the X Windowing environment, unless I come up with some ways to free

Yes, at least to begin with, when the customer sells bc's and receives  
dollars. I wouldn't give a script the access to my dollar reserves so  
lightly. The other way around (customer's dollars -&gt; bitcoins) it  
doesn't feel that insecure, and it's certainly nicer for the customer  
to receive his bitcoins immediately.

I had been wondering why everyone keeps harping on no-UI, when already 
you can run it with only a small icon on the tray, which is common for 
server services on Windows.  So I guess this is why.  I had chalked it 
up to unix snobbery if they couldn't abide a tiny little icon on a 
desktop they never see.

Not opening any windows is easy, but it may fail because the gtk 
libraries aren't there.  wxWidgets has __WXBASE__ for "Only wxBase, no 
GUI features".  You could try building for that instead of __WXGTK__ and 
see what happens.  It would be preferable if there's any way to do it as 
a command line switch on the same executable, rather than yet another 
build variation to release.

How much memory do you have to work with?  Bitcoin necessarily takes a 
fair bit of memory; about 75MB on Windows.  Is that a problem?

Command line control is one of the next things on the list.  I want to 
design the API carefully.

Receiving payments is the part that has a lot of design choices to be 
made.  The caller needs to identify the transactions of interest, that's 
where the one-bitcoin-address-per-transaction model helps.  Searching 
the comments text for an order number is another possibility.  There's 
polled, asking what has been received to the given bitcoin address, and 
event driven.  I guess in event driven, bitcoin would be told to run a 
command line when a certain amount is received to a certain bitcoin address.

I'll have to do some studying for a few days now, after which I can  
return to work with the exchange service. Among other things I'll fix  
the pricing so that the price of Bitcoins grows towards infinity when  
my supply of them gets closer to zero. That way I can find the market

        <pre>You could always exchange for Liberty Reserve.  It's an online currency 
similar to e-Bullion, Pecunix or Webmoney that allows exchanges no 
questions asked and with privacy.

LR and the others are hard to buy but easy to cash out.  Hard to buy 
because exchangers are very cautious about getting ripped off by 
reversed payments, so they require more details and holding time. 
Cashing out is very easy.  LR is non-reversible, so there are oodles of 
exchanges eager to turn LR into any kind of payment.

Bitcoin is the reverse, in that it's easy to get Bitcoins just by 
generating them.  It would be easy for customers to go 
bitcoin-&gt;LR-&gt;cash, bitcoin-&gt;LR-&gt;gold, bitcoin-&gt;LR-&gt;paypal or maybe they 
just want to save the money, then just bitcoin-&gt;LR.

There's also the idea BTC2PSC had to sell paysafecards for bitcoins. 
Either online delivery by sending the card number by e-mail, or delivery 
of the unopened physical card in the mails.  There are many variations 
of these cards.  In some countries, they're called Gift Cards, and can 
be used wherever credit cards are accepted.  I think they're used more 
by people who don't have the credit history to get a real credit card, 
so they buy gift cards themselves to pay for things that require a 
credit card.

you wait before contacting any more payment processors.  You may get 
ideas from things other users come up with and try.

Just some random incomplete ideas: There may be a way to position it as 
an intermediate credit for micropayments for some virtual good or 
something.  Or maybe if the payments are only in one direction.  If you 
only buy bitcoins, then you're only sending money out not taking 
people's money, that would still be useful to peg the currency.  That 
might be payment for computer time.

Credit card is only one way.  Don't even talk about the idea of 
returning money to customer's credit cards.  Credit card companies hate 
that.

In any case, any payment processor is going to expect you to be selling 
something real.

It probably needs the gtk libraries, in which case you'll have the same 
problem with the 64-bit version.  I would like to have a single 
executable that can also run on a UI-less system, but I'm not sure how 
on linux to link to things but still be able to run and not use them if 
the library is not present.  Maybe we should statically link the GTK. 
Licensewise, it's LGPL, but since it's only used on unix, that would be 
OK.  (we can't link LGPL stuff on windows because we provide the OpenSSL 
DLL, but on linux OpenSSL comes with the OS)

My 64-bit (debug stripped) executable is attached.  It includes untested 
changes that are not in SVN yet: UI changes and the wallet fSpent flag 
resync stuff.

I've been researching options for interprocess calling.  I want 
something that will be easy for a variety of server side languages to 
call, particularly PHP.  Cross-platform to windows is a plus.

I'm not sure if I want it to be something that can be accessed across 
the network.  That would introduce security issues.  If it can only be 
accessed on the local system, then local security authentication covers 
it, and it is incapable of being hacked remotely.

At surface level, not looking into any details yet, the current front 
runners are:
D-Bus:
    local system only
    used by qt, gnome and skype
    bindings: c, python, java, c++,
          php listed as "in progress"
          .net listed as unmaintained
          not sure how ready it is on windows
XML-RPC:
    widely used, built in libraries on PHP
    it's more for web clients to talk to server, transport is http, so 
its a security question

Is it possible to open a socket that can only be accessed locally?

&gt; Is it possible to open a socket that can only be accessed locally?

Yes, you can use IPC sockets ("Unix domain sockets") which are local  
only. That's done in the wx-api by using a filename in place of a port  
number. I committed an example of how the wxServer-Client  
communication is used, you can revert if you want to. Now there's the  
-blockamount command line option which asks the running instance for  
the block chain length.

I think this command line method could already be used from PHP, but  
it might be lighter if php itself could call the socket server  
directly. The wx's IPC overview mentions wxSocketEvent, wxSocketBase,  
wxSocketClient and wxSocketServer as being "Classes for the low-level  
TCP/IP API", which might be easier to use from php than what I used  
now (wxServer, wxClient, wxConnection). I'll look more into it.

I don't think I want to invent my own RPC protocol, I want to use an

I'm going to start reading on XML-RPC.  It's coming up in searches as

"If wait is true and there are no pending connections to be accepted, it

wxWidgets is pathologically single-threaded.  Not only single-threaded, 
but must-be-the-GUI-thread-ed.  Even for something as non-UI as 
wxStandardPaths I got nailed.  All this is fine for UI code, since this 
is the same constraint placed by Windows anyway, but for UI-less server 
daemon code, wx calls are uncertain.

Status of my research currently:

For PHP, Python, etc to access the server, we need to use regular 
sockets.  I think we can make it local-only by binding to localhost 
only, so it can only be accessed through the loopback.  They say it's 
also watertight to simply check the IP of connections received and 
disconnect anything not 127.0.0.1.  May as well do both.

XML-RPC is a bit fat.  There are 4 libraries for C++ but they're all big 
and hard to build, dependencies, license issues.  Some posters complain 
all the C++ and PHP XML-RPC libraries are buggy.

JSON-RPC is a simpler more elegant standard.  It's simple enough I could 
use a generic JSON parser.

PHP, Python and Java all have good implementations of JSON-RPC.

I'm currently leaning towards JSON-RPC.

        <pre>Liberty Reserve sounds good. I could first make a service that only  
accepts LR, and add more options later. The weakness is that buying LR  
is an extra step of inconvenience when the customer just wants to get  
Bitcoins. But maybe I don't have too much choice here.

&gt; Do you have electronic transfer or paper cheque in your country? (even
&gt; if only within Europe)

Yes, electronic bank transfer is available. During 2010 most European  
countries will become a part of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area),  
which means that all payments within Europe are to be considered  
domestic. Banks will have to apply the same fees and standards to all  
domestic transfers, so they'll probably all be free of charge and  
complete in one bank day. For international transfers there's the  
SWIFT/IBAN system, which usually costs some extra.

A longer term project for my exchange service would be to see what  
kinds of integration options the banks have to offer. Bank transfers  
would reach nearly as many customers as credit cards do.

        <pre>Maybe the current difficulty of buying LR is already the limit of how 
easy it can get in that direction.

Every conventional payment method has refutability as their way to cope 
with their lack of passwords and crypto.  The system is wide open to 
copying plaintext credit card numbers and account numbers, and they deal 
with it by reversing the transaction after the fact.  The system works 
for physical goods that have to be delivered somewhere, and services 
which can't be resold.  It's a problem when it interfaces with precious 
metals and currency conversion.

The first step of being easy in one direction, bitcoin-&gt;LR or anything 
of established value, goes a long way.  Even those who don't use the 
conversion still benefit from knowing that they could.  Trading bitcoin 
becomes an easier way to trade the ability to claim LR, similar to how 
paper money was once the right to claim gold.  Nobody has to ever 
actually claim the LR to get the benefit of having the option that they 
could if they wanted to.

A lot of times you just need a minuscule amount of online currency.  The 
hassle of buying the other online currencies is too much for buying a 
small amount.  The ease of getting a small amount of bitcoin may help 
bootstrap an ecosystem of sellers of micropayment sized online goods 
selling to that market.  If the sellers can get LR for bitcoins, they're 
happy, and that may be subsidized at first by investors who want to buy 
bc in large lots.

The main thing holding online currencies back is the lack of an easy way 
to get a small amount of currency.  Bitcoin opens that up.  It'll be the 
only online currency that's both easy to cash out and easy to get a 
small amount.  It'll just be the usual harder difficulty to buy a large 
amount.

&gt;&gt; Do you have electronic transfer or paper cheque in your country? (even
&gt;&gt; if only within Europe)
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, electronic bank transfer is available. During 2010 most European 
&gt; countries will become a part of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area), which 
&gt; means that all payments within Europe are to be considered domestic. 
&gt; Banks will have to apply the same fees and standards to all domestic 
&gt; transfers, so they'll probably all be free of charge and complete in one 
&gt; bank day. For international transfers there's the SWIFT/IBAN system, 
&gt; which usually costs some extra.
&gt; 
&gt; A longer term project for my exchange service would be to see what kinds 
&gt; of integration options the banks have to offer. Bank transfers would 
&gt; reach nearly as many customers as credit cards do.

You might find it preferable not to translate it into your own language. 
  Often the standard answer about legalities is that it's only intended 
for people in other countries.  Translating it into your home language 
weakens that argument.

waiting to post on the forum when I've had more time to think about the

To enable the RPC server, add the switch -server.  It's not on by default.

Client commands are without any switches, as such:
bitcoin getblockcount
bitcoin getdifficulty
bitcoin getnewaddress somelabel
bitcoin sendtoaddress 1DvqsbZ... 1.00
bitcoin getallpayments 0

Yes, using Python. I didn't test the JSON-RPC yet as I don't have

     CRITICAL_BLOCK(cs)

         if (mi != mapCache.end())
             return (*mi).second;

         // wxWidgets translation
         const char* pszTranslated =

         // We don't cache unknown strings because caller might be 
passing in a
         // dynamic string and we would keep allocating memory for each 
variation.
         if (strcmp(pszEnglish, pszTranslated) == 0)
             return pszEnglish;

         // Add to cache, memory doesn't need to be freed.  We only 
cache because
         // we must pass back a pointer to permanently allocated memory.
         char* pszCached = new char[strlen(pszTranslated)+1];
         strcpy(pszCached, pszTranslated);
         mapCache[pszEnglish] = pszCached;
         return pszCached;
     }
     return NULL;
}

new:
const char* wxGetTranslation(const char* pszEnglish)
{
     // Wrapper of wxGetTranslation returning the same const char* type 
as was passed in
     static CCriticalSection cs;
     CRITICAL_BLOCK(cs)
     {
         // Look in cache
         static map&lt;string, char*&gt; mapCache;
         map&lt;string, char*&gt;::iterator mi = mapCache.find(pszEnglish);
         if (mi != mapCache.end())
             return (*mi).second;

         // wxWidgets translation
         wxString strTranslated = wxGetTranslation(wxString(pszEnglish,

         // We don't cache unknown strings because caller might be

         if (strcmp(pszEnglish, strTranslated.utf8_str()) == 0)

         // Add to cache, memory doesn't need to be freed.  We only 
cache because
         // we must pass back a pointer to permanently allocated memory.
         char* pszCached = new char[strlen(strTranslated.utf8_str())+1];
         strcpy(pszCached, strTranslated.utf8_str());
         mapCache[pszEnglish] = pszCached;
         return pszCached;
     }
     return NULL;
}

If you still suspect this code, for testing you could change it to:
const char* wxGetTranslation(const char* pszEnglish)
{
     return pszEnglish;
}

You could comment out the CreateThreads listed below, then re-enable 
them one at a time until it does it again.  Then we would know which 
thread the problem is in.

net.cpp, under // Start threads
     CreateThread(ThreadIRCSeed, NULL)
     CreateThread(ThreadSocketHandler, NULL, true)
     CreateThread(ThreadOpenConnections, NULL)
     CreateThread(ThreadMessageHandler, NULL)

        <pre>I confirmed that ParseString has this problem, and uploaded the fixed 
util.cpp to SVN.

string::npos == -1

Comparing unsigned int -1 (0xffffffff) with long unsigned int -1 
(0xffffffffffffffff) results in the unsigned int being promoted to 
64-bit, which is 0x00000000ffffffff != 0xffffffffffffffff.

        <pre>Hi!

How are you doing? Haven't seen you around in a while.

I've been at full-time work lately, and will be until the end of June,  
so I haven't had that much time to work with Bitcoin or my exchange  
service. I have a working beta of my service though, and a few weeks  
ago made my first transaction: sold 10,000 btc for 20 euros via EU  
bank transfer. Maybe I can make it public soon.

I divided the forum into 6 boards, which are Bitcoin Discussion,  
Development &amp; Technical Discussion, Technical support, Economics,  
Marketplace and Trading Discussion. Hope this is ok?

I also added a page "Trade" on the bitcoin.org site, where  
btc-accepting services are listed. It's nice to see that there are  
already useful services that accept btc.

The community has been growing nicely. We've had around 10-20 people  
and active discussion at #bitcoin-dev lately.

It would be nice to get the daemon-able binaries to SF.net. We have  
some skilled programmers in the community now, so maybe we can finish  
the JSON API functions if you don't have time to.

Best regards.

        <pre>I've also been busy with other things for the last month and a half.  I 
just now downloaded my e-mail since the beginning of April.  I mostly 
have things sorted and should be back to Bitcoin shortly.  Glad that 
you've been handling things in my absence.  Congrats on your first 
transaction!

As I recall, the code was nearly ready for a 0.3 release.  I think all 
it needed was a little testing time and to install the new icon xpm.

The JSON API functions are complete.  I wanted to take another fresh 
look at them in case I think of any better function names before 
committing.  I ought to write some sample code showing the proper way to 
use them, particularly with polling for received transactions.  When I 
left off, I was thinking about bolting a payment mechanism onto a free 
upload server software as an example.  It would make sense to actually 
build one practical application with the API before releasing it.  You 
don't realise the problems with an API until you actually try to use it.

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; How are you doing? Haven't seen you around in a while.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been at full-time work lately, and will be until the end of June, 
&gt; so I haven't had that much time to work with Bitcoin or my exchange 
&gt; service. I have a working beta of my service though, and a few weeks ago 
&gt; made my first transaction: sold 10,000 btc for 20 euros via EU bank 
&gt; transfer. Maybe I can make it public soon.
&gt; 
&gt; I divided the forum into 6 boards, which are Bitcoin Discussion, 
&gt; Development &amp; Technical Discussion, Technical support, Economics, 
&gt; Marketplace and Trading Discussion. Hope this is ok?
&gt; 
&gt; I also added a page "Trade" on the bitcoin.org site, where btc-accepting 
&gt; services are listed. It's nice to see that there are already useful 
&gt; services that accept btc.
&gt; 
&gt; The community has been growing nicely. We've had around 10-20 people and 
&gt; active discussion at #bitcoin-dev lately.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be nice to get the daemon-able binaries to SF.net. We have some 
&gt; skilled programmers in the community now, so maybe we can finish the 
&gt; JSON API functions if you don't have time to.
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards.

        <pre>I think we should de-emphasize the anonymous angle.  With the popularity 
of bitcoin addresses instead of sending by IP, we can't give the 
impression it's automatically anonymous.  It's possible to be 
pseudonymous, but you have to be careful.  If someone digs through the 
transaction history and starts exposing information people thought was 
anonymous, the backlash will be much worse if we haven't prepared 
expectations by warning in advance that you have to take precautions if 
you really want to make that work.  Like Tor says, "Tor does not 
magically encrypt all of your Internet activities.  Understand what Tor 
does and does not do for you."

Also, anonymous sounds a bit shady.  I think the people who want 
anonymous will still figure it out without us trumpeting it.

I made some changes to the bitcoin.org homepage.  It's not really 
crucial to update the translations.  I tend to keep editing and 
correcting for some time afterwards, so if they want to update, they 
should wait.

I removed the word "anonymous", and the sentence about "anonymity 
means", although you worded it so carefully "...CAN be kept hidden..." 
it was a shame to remove it.

Instead, I added Tor instructions at the bottom, with instructions for 
how to stay anonymous (pseudonymous) directly after the Tor 
instructions: "If you want to remain anonymous (pseudonymous, really), 
be careful not to reveal any information linking your bitcoin addresses 
to your identity, and use a new bitcoin address for each payment you 
receive."

It helps that it can now seed automatically through Tor.

Even though it doesn't say anonymous until the bottom, I think anonymous 
seekers would already suspect it based on all the other attributes like 
no central authority to take your ID info and the way bitcoin addresses 
look.

        <pre>I uploaded 0.3.0 beta to sourceforge and updated the links on 
bitcoin.org.  I still need to post the announcement message on the forum 
and mailing list.  Here's what I've prepared:

Announcing version 0.3 of Bitcoin, the P2P cryptocurrency!  Bitcoin is a 
digital currency using cryptography and a distributed network to replace 
the need for a trusted central server.  Escape the arbitrary inflation 
risk of centrally managed currencies!  Bitcoin's total circulation is 
limited to 21 million coins.  The coins are gradually being released to 
the networks nodes based on the CPU power they contribute.  You can get 
a share of them just by installing the software and contributing your 
idle CPU time.

What's new:
- Command line and JSON-RPC control
- Includes a daemon version without GUI
- Tabs for sent and received transactions
- 20% faster hashing
- Hashmeter performance display
- Mac OS X version (thanks to Laszlo)
- German, Dutch and Italian translations (thanks to DataWraith, Xunie 
and Joozero)

        <pre>Actually, "tabs for sent and received transactions" sounds really

sounds better.

I'm still editing it a little more and then I'll e-mail it to 
bitcoin-list and send it to the cryptography list.

for a while.

http://bitcoin.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?page=FAQ

Probably not an issue anymore, but might be a good idea to delete or update
that wiki page.

&gt; I don't see any 0.1.5 download links on the FAQ.  Do you mean
&gt; bitcoin.org/faq?  Is it on one of the other languages?  Or maybe someone
&gt; else fixed it already.

Hi,

In the FAQ of bitcoin.org &lt;http://bitcoin.org&gt; the backing up of the
wallet had old instructions, right?  Should it just be to back up
wallat.dat instead of the entire folder???  See below.


"How do I backup my wallet?

Your data is stored in the directory ''%appdata%\Bitcoin'', which is
typically:

  Windows XP:
    C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Bitcoin
  Windows Vista:
    C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin

It’s recommended that you stop Bitcoin before backing it up to make sure
the backup will be correct."

        <pre>You did some research when choosing hosting, this was a well chosen one, 
right?  It seems like it would be a tremendous hassle to change, and 
we've had good luck with this one.  Cheaper will usually have some 
offsetting drawback in quality.

I wonder if that extra memory is just disk cache or something.

I take it you haven't received anything from that donor yet?  He seemed 
pretty certain he was going to send it, maybe more.  (if you get 
anything, we need to keep private for him the fact that we got a donation)

        <pre>Yes, we could give accounts to trusted translators. I haven't found a  
way to give them edit permissions to only one page, but they can be  
forced to create a new revision with every page change they make, and  
not be allowed to delete revisions. Xunie would be the first on the  
list I'd give an account. :)

Hi Sirius,

Check out www.citrusdesignstudio.com. You will see through the portfolio that
I am a real business with many clients.

That is my business that I provide managed hosting through.
I also do unmanaged VPSes.

Normally I would charge $15/mo for 512MB.
I will do it for $10/mo for you.

To see my pricing, go to www.linnode.com. I match everything they have except
their great panel -- you have to email or call my people.

I provide VPS services normally for 3/4ths the posted cost on linnode.com.
(Rackspace is even more expensive.)

I will do it for 1/2 of linnode's price for you.

It scales linerally just like linnodes, so for 2048 MB of memory, I would
charge $40, etc.

Later!
-----

That would be worth considering, if they have good datacenters and  
connections. $10 / month is about $20 less than what Rackspace costs.  
On the other hand, Rackspace prices are no problem if the donation is  
to arrive.

&gt;&gt; connections. $10 / month is about $20 less than what Rackspace   
&gt;&gt; costs. On the other hand, Rackspace prices are no problem if the   
&gt;&gt; donation is to arrive.

What do you think of the idea to offer rewards of $100-200 to the

That's great!  I'll let him know it was received and thank him.

It might be a long time before we get another donation like that, we 
should save a lot of it.

Spend what you need on hosting.  Email me a simple accounting when you 
take out money for expenses, like:
    -$60 rackspace monthly
   $2540 balance

$100-200 is chump change if they're a serious company, it would only 
make us sound small.

What they need most is confidence they can convert it to fiat currency. 
  That VOIP company essentially said so in a recent post.  The best 
thing we can do is make sure there's cash available to cash out and 
support and steady the conversion rate.

The money is leveraged better that way too.  Theoretically, imagine 10 
businesses have their eye on a $100 bill being offered for bitcoins, but 
don't actually cash out because they know it's there if they need it. 
That one $100 bill allowed 10 different people to act like their 5000 
bitcoins were equivalent to $100.

I think we should allocate $1000 at this point to your exchange.

Alright, I'll add $1000 dollars to the exchange reserves. That way I  
can offer more stable pricing.

A week ago somebody bought coins with 1000 €. That was probably meant  
as a donation to some extent, since 1000 € would have bought him a lot  
more coins at bitcoinmarket.com than at my service.

About +1000€ (plus the $1000) and -40000 BTC since when I started. I  
should have set the initial BTC price higher, it was only 1€ / 1000  
BTC in the beginning.

I had to build it myself. It had the same problem that has been

`GLIBCXX_3.4.11' not found.

I think our problem may be that we have forum notifications on, like 
e-mail you when you receive a PM, but we don't have e-mail verification 
of new accounts.  Can someone put someone else's e-mail address without 
verifying it, then have stuff sent there?  We need to stop that right 
away before it gets used for something bad.  Either disallow all 
notification, or make sure e-mail addresses are verified.

I'm more inclined to disallow notifications or anything where the forum 
sends you e-mail.  I kinda like not requiring e-mail verification.  But 
if that's the only way to make sure we don't send e-mails to un-verified

If we request to get off of PBL, we'd better make sure we've got the

I changed Registration-&gt;settings-&gt;registration of new members to "Member

"Member Activation
When this option is enabled any members registering to the forum will 
have a activation link emailed to them which they must click before they 
can become full members"

I think that's the only way to make sure the forum can't be used to send

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think our problem may be that we have forum notifications on, like
&gt;&gt;&gt; e-mail you when you receive a PM, but we don't have e-mail verification
&gt;&gt;&gt; of new accounts.  Can someone put someone else's e-mail address without
&gt;&gt;&gt; verifying it, then have stuff sent there?  We need to stop that right
&gt;&gt;&gt; away before it gets used for something bad.  Either disallow all
&gt;&gt;&gt; notification, or make sure e-mail addresses are verified.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm more inclined to disallow notifications or anything where the forum
&gt;&gt;&gt; sends you e-mail.  I kinda like not requiring e-mail verification.  But
&gt;&gt;&gt; if that's the only way to make sure we don't send e-mails to un-verified
&gt;&gt;&gt; addresses, then we could do that.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If we request to get off of PBL, we'd better make sure we've got the
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem secured first.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I changed Registration-&gt;settings-&gt;registration of new members to "Member
&gt;&gt;&gt; Activation".  I assume that means it e-mail verifies.
&gt;&gt;&gt; "Member Activation
&gt;&gt;&gt; When this option is enabled any members registering to the forum will
&gt;&gt;&gt; have a activation link emailed to them which they must click before they
&gt;&gt;&gt; can become full members"
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that's the only way to make sure the forum can't be used to send
&gt;&gt;&gt; to other people's e-mail addresses and potentially use it to spam.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; Are PM notifications still disabled?  (All we really need is disable
&gt;&gt; the forum's access to the mail server)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does it work correctly now? I had made some forum code changes to
&gt;&gt;&gt; disable PM email notification, but just reverted most of them as
&gt;&gt;&gt; unnecessary.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The FAQ says: "The first thing to know is: THE PBL IS NOT A  
&gt;&gt;&gt; BLACKLIST. You are not listed for spamming or for anything you have 
&gt;&gt;&gt;  done. The PBL is simply a list of all of the world's dynamic IP  
&gt;&gt;&gt; space, i.e: IP ranges normally assigned to ISP broadband customers  
&gt;&gt;&gt; (DSL, DHCP, PPP, cable, dialup). It is perfectly normal for dynamic 
&gt;&gt;&gt;  IP addresses to be listed on the PBL. In fact all dynamic IP  
&gt;&gt;&gt; addresses in the world should be on the PBL. Even static IPs which  
&gt;&gt;&gt; do not send mail should be listed in the PBL." So we didn't even  
&gt;&gt;&gt; need to allow spam to be on the list.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's the info about PBL again.

Dear BitCoin.

http://apps.facebook.com/sweepmines/ now accepts BitCoins.

This is single-player computer game based on Windows Minesweeper version.

Would you be so kind to add us to the http://www.bitcoin.org/trade page?

Thank you.

Let me know whenever you do an upgrade so I can make sure all my changes 
survived.

Hopefully the 1.1.x line is mature and updates are infrequent.  We 
shouldn't upgrade to 2.0.  I made a ton of customisations that wouldn't 
be compatible, and I kind of prefer the look of 1.1 over 2.0 anyway.

The captcha url has mycode=4 added to it, and the register page has 
extra hidden mycode=2 through 5 images so any automated thing wouldn't 
know which one to pick.  Everything that uses captcha has to have that 
mycode=4 thing added.  Something in sending personal messages also uses 
captcha.

I don't know what it was. It started working again when I rebooted it.  
Someone suggested it might have been the heavy load from a Reddit post  
about Bitcoin. Inspecting the logs would be useful, but I don't have  
much time now.

I told him to go ahead. I don't do automatic backups atm. We should  
have more server admins soon when I get bitcoinexchange.com to another  
server. I could give the root password to you and somebody else. Xunie  
has volunteered, but we might find somebody even more professional  outage was due to heavy load, he could help us move to lighttpd or  
optimize resources otherwise. Should we make a recruitment thread on  
the forum?

&gt; That seems like asking for trouble, and I think it would violate the
&gt; implicit trust of everybody who's registered for the forums.

I agree, don't let the database out of your hands.  There's private PM 
in there, e-mail addresses, passwords.

BTW, password hashes = passwords.  It's easy to break the hash of short 
passwords people use on forums.
6 chars = 3 difficulty
7 chars = 410 difficulty
8 chars = 25418 difficulty


&gt;&gt; Another option is to
&gt;&gt; &gt; encrypt the backups with pgp and store them in multiple places.
&gt; 
&gt; That seems wiser.  Daily backups copied ... somewhere ... seems like
&gt; the right thing to do.  If they're reasonably small (less than a
&gt; gigabyte), I'd be happy to pay for Amazon S3 storage/bandwidth for
&gt; them.

+1

Even with encryption, a trusted storage place is better.

        <pre>Ok. I'll start backing up to another server I'm using. I'll send you

Great

&gt; Satoshi, I assume you don't want to

True

&gt; We could decline to talk to the press-- Satoshi, I know you've
&gt; expressed concern about bitcoin growing too big too fast, and being
&gt; unable to keep up with traffic/attacks/feature requests/etc.  But I
&gt; don't think ignoring the press will make them go away; they'll just
&gt; talk to somebody else.  I think it is better to give a realistic
&gt; impression of bitcoin (it is cutting-edge, beta software that is still
&gt; being developed, it is not poised to replace PayPal or the Euro
&gt; anytime soon, etc) rather than let somebody over-enthusiastic become
&gt; "the unofficial bitcoin spokesperson."

You're the best person to do it.

EFF is really important.  We want to have a good relationship with them. 
  We're the type of project they like; they've helped the TOR project 
and done a lot to protect P2P file sharing.

Gavin, would you be interested in organizing this?

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I am writing you on behalf of the EPCA Conference because we are   
&gt; interested to learn more about Bitcoin. Possibly Bitcoin is an   
&gt; interesting topic for the upcoming conference 4-6 April in Amsterdam.
&gt;
&gt; At this top rated conference we deal with the key strategic   
&gt; developments in the 'transaction industry' so not limited to   
&gt; payments. The event is truly 'professional for professional', so   
&gt; every presentation is screened on quality and relevance (no sales   
&gt; pitches). See also:   
&gt; www.epcaconference.com&lt;http://www.epcaconference.com&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; Since we discuss the most relevant topics in the industry, I would   
&gt; like to investigate whether the Bitcoin paradigm is interesting for   
&gt; the attendees. This should give the attendees (bankers and other   
&gt; financial professionals) a lot of inspiration for their own   
&gt; business. At the same time it is a good opportunity to position   
&gt; Bitcoin within the international audience, to gain unique strategic   
&gt; insights and to network within the European professional scene.
&gt;
&gt; Can we have contact this week to elaborate this further? Thank you   
&gt; in advance,
&gt;
&gt; Look forward hearing from you,

He pointed out that even Nvidia itself has multiple special-purpose software packages that rely on open-source frameworks for performance reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>"CUDA is&nbsp;a swamp, not a moat," Keller wrote in&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/jimkxa/status/1758943525662769498" data-url="https://twitter.com/jimkxa/status/1758943525662769498">an X post</a>. "x86 was a swamp too. […] CUDA&nbsp;is not beautiful.&nbsp;It was built by piling on one thing at a time."&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, just like x86, CUDA has gradually added functionality while maintaining backward compatibility in software and hardware. This makes Nvidia's platform complete and backward compatible, but it affects performance and makes program development harder. Meanwhile, many open-source software development frameworks can be used more efficiently than CUDA.&nbsp;</p><p>"Basically&nbsp;nobody writes&nbsp;CUDA," wrote Keller in a follow-up post.&nbsp;"If you do write&nbsp;CUDA,&nbsp;it is&nbsp;probably not fast.

            <span>Abstract:</span>While Transformers have enabled tremendous progress in various application settings, such architectures still lag behind traditional symbolic planners for solving complex decision making tasks. In this work, we demonstrate how to train Transformers to solve complex planning tasks and present Searchformer, a Transformer model that optimally solves previously unseen Sokoban puzzles 93.7% of the time, while using up to 26.8% fewer search steps than standard $A^*$ search. Searchformer is an encoder-decoder Transformer model trained to predict the search dynamics of $A^*$. This model is then fine-tuned via expert iterations to perform fewer search steps than $A^*$ search while still generating an optimal plan. In our training method, $A^*$'s search dynamics are expressed as a token sequence outlining when task states are added and removed into the search tree during symbolic planning. In our ablation studies on maze navigation, we find that Searchformer significantly outperforms baselines that predict the optimal plan directly with a 5-10$\times$ smaller model size and a 10$\times$ smaller training dataset. We also demonstrate how Searchformer scales to larger and more complex decision making tasks like Sokoban with improved percentage of solved tasks and shortened search dynamics.

<p>I've been getting a lot of those "your parcel couldn't be delivered" phishing attacks lately and if you're a human with a phone, you probably have been too. Just as a brief reminder, they look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_4658-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1029" height="510" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/IMG_4658-1.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/IMG_4658-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_4658-1.jpg 1029w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_4659.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1026" height="506" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/IMG_4659.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/IMG_4659.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_4659.jpg 1026w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_4660.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1057" height="441" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/IMG_4660.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/IMG_4660.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_4660.jpg 1057w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>These get through all the technical controls that exist at my telco and they land smack bang in my SMS inbox. However, I don't fall for the scams because I look for the warning signs: a sense of urgency, fear of missing out, and strange URLs that look nothing like any parcel delivery service I know of. They have a pretty rough go of convincing me they're from Australia Post by putting "auspost" somewhere or other within each link, but I'm a smart human so I don't fall for this (that's a joke, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/humans-are-bad-at-urls-and-fonts-dont-matter/" rel="noreferrer">read why humans are bad at URLs</a>).</p><p>However... I <em>am</em> expecting a parcel. It's well into the 2020's and post COVID so I'm <em>always</em> expecting a parcel, because that's just how we buy stuff these days. And so, when I received the following SMS earlier this week I was expecting a parcel <em>and</em> I was expecting phishing attacks:</p>

<figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-22-at-12.26.43-unnumbered-1.png"></figure>

<p>So... which is it? Parcel or phish? Let's see what the people say:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Referring to the parent tweet, is this message legit and should I pay the duty and taxes?</p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1759827511402537256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">February 20, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>Whoa - that's an 87% "dodgy AF" vote from over 4,000 respondents so yeah, that's pretty emphatic. Why such an overwhelmingly suspicious crowd? Let's break that message down into 7 "dodgy AF" signs:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-22-at-12.26.43-2.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1286" height="1133" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-22-at-12.26.43-2.jpeg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-22-at-12.26.43-2.jpeg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-22-at-12.26.43-2.jpeg 1286w"></figure><ol><li>Phishers commonly make typos in their messaging and I know "FedEx" always capitalises the "E". And what's with the "-Exp"? Dodgy AF!</li><li>Why does the shipment number look so short? And why is it identical to the requested payment below? Dodgy AF!</li><li>Ah, so it's <em>urgent</em> is it? Urgency is a core tenet of social engineering as it encourages people to act without properly thinking it though. Dodgy AF!</li><li>Why are the "D" and the "T" capitalised? Dodgy AF!</li><li>This is a US-headquartered global delivery parcel service, why aren't they telling me the currency? Or even using a dollar sign? Dodgy AF!</li><li>Does this even need explaining? What's this "bpoint.com.au" service? It's definitely not a FedEx domain nor an Aussie gov one if we're talking duty and taxes. Dodgy AF!</li><li>So... <em>you're</em> going to give me the contact details for any "query" (not "queries", so there's another grammatical red flag), <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/nab-removes-links-in-text-messages/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the very practice we're now moving away from</a> for one simple reason: because it's dodgy AF!</li></ol><p>And so, I was with the 87% of other people. However... I was expecting a package. From FedEx. Coming from outside Australia so it may attract duty and taxes. And I <em>really</em> want to get this package because it's a new 3D printer from Prusa, and they're awesome!</p><p>There's a sage piece of advice that's always relevant in these cases and it's very simple: if in doubt, go the website in question and verify the request yourself. So, I went to the purchase confirmation from Prusa, found the shipping details and followed the link to the FedEx website. Now it was simply a matter of finding the section that talks about tax, except...</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_2736.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1993" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/IMG_2736.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/IMG_2736.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/IMG_2736.jpg 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_2736.jpg 2048w"></figure><p>Dodgy. A. F.</p><p>I went all through that page and couldn't find a single reference to duty, nor for anything tax related. Try as I might, I couldn't establish the authenticity of the SMS by going directly to the (alleged) source. But what I <em>could</em> easily establish is that if you follow that link in the URL, you can change the tracking number, the customer name and the amount <em>to absolutely anything you want!</em></p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-18.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1114" height="866" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/image-18.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/image-18.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-18.png 1114w"></figure><p>This is all done by simply changing the URL parameters; I'm not modifying the browser DoM or intercepting traffic or doing anything fancy, it's literally just query string parameter tampering reflected XSS style. This feels like every phishing site ever, not a payment service run by Australia's largest bank. Seriously, <a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/business/payments/take-online-payments/bpoint-payment-gateway.html?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">BPOINT is provided by the Commonwealth Bank</a> and after the experience above, I'm at the point of reaching out to them and making a disclosure. Except that this is how the system was obviously designed to work and it's a completely parallel issue to phishy FedEx SMSs. Speaking of which, the very next morning I got another one from the same sender:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-19.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="1019" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/image-19.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/image-19.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-19.png 1290w"></figure><p>I don't know if this makes it better or worse 🤦‍♂️ Let's just jump into the highlights, both good and bad:</p><ol><li>My shipping number is now actually in the text of the email - yay!</li><li>The words "duty" and "taxes" are now represented in the correct case - yay!</li><li>The words "PAY NOW" are capitalised which seems... dodgy AF!</li><li>And my favourite bit of all: the "link" isn't actually a link at all because it contains no scheme, no domain and no path, just the query string parameters! Dodgy AF!</li></ol><p>It's quite unbelievable what they've done with the link because it makes the SMS entirely unactionable. It's impossible to click anywhere and pay the money. And while I'm here, why are all the query string parameter names now capitalised? It's like there's a completely different (broken) process somewhere generating these links. Or scammers just aren't consistent...</p><p>Because "dodgy AF" is the prevailing theme, I needed to dig deeper, so I searched for the 1800 number. One of the first results was for <a href="https://www.reverseaustralia.com/lookup/1800111112/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">a Reverse Australia page for that number</a> which upon reading the first 3 comments, perfectly summed up the sentiment so far:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-20.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1254" height="524" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/image-20.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/image-20.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-20.png 1254w"></figure><p>And the more you read both on that site and other top links in the search results, the more people are totally confused about the legitimacy of the messages. There's only one thing to do - call FedEx. Not by the number in the (still potentially phishy) SMS, but rather via the number on their website. So, click the "Support" menu item, down to "Customer Support" and <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-au/customer-support.html?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">we end up here</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-21.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="998" height="536" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/image-21.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-21.png 998w"></figure><p>I'll save you the pain of reading the response that ensued, suffice to say that it only referred to email communications and boiled down to suggesting you read the domain of the sender. But I did manage to pin the system down on a phone number which as you'll see, is completely different to the one in the SMS messages:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="662" height="178" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/image-22.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-22.png 662w"></figure><p>So, I call the number and follow the voice prompts, selecting options via the keypad to route me through to the duty and taxes section. But eventually, several steps deep into the process, the system stops responding to key presses! "1" doesn't work and neither does "2" so without a response, the same message just repeats. But it does offer an alternative and suggestions I call 132610. <em>That's the number I called in the first place to get stuck in this infinite loop!</em></p><p>I try again, this time following a different series of prompts that eventually asks for a tracking number and then proceeds to tell me precisely what the website already does! But it also provides the option to speak to a customer service operator and I'm actually promptly put through. The operator explains that my shipment is valued at US$799 which converts to AU$1,215.97 and it therefore subject to some inbound fees. "Great, but how much and does it match what's in the phishy SMSs I've received?" He promises someone will call be back shortly...</p><p>And then, out of the blue 3 days after the initial phishy SMS arrived, an email landed in my inbox:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-23.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1802" height="2085" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/image-23.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/image-23.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/image-23.png 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/image-23.png 1802w"></figure><p>The dollar figure, the BPOINT address and the messaging all lined up with the SMSs, but that's just merely correlation and if someone had both my phone number and email address they could easily attempt to phish both with the same details. But then, I looked at the attachment to the email and found this:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_2739.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="309" height="198"></figure><p><strong><em>IT'S THE MISSING LINK!!!</em></strong></p><p>My complete Prusa invoice was attached along with the order number, price and shipping details. In other words, 87% of you were wrong 😲</p><p>On a more serious note, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-17/australian-money-losses-to-scams-tops-3b-accc-report-says/102223720?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Aussies alone are losing north of AU$3B annually to scams</a>, and that's obviously only a drop in the ocean compared to the global scale of this problem. Our Australian Communications and Media Authority body (ACMA) <a href="https://www.acma.gov.au/articles/2023-11/336-million-scam-texts-blocked-telcos?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">recently reported 336M blocked scam SMSs</a> and technical controls like these are obviously great, but absent from their reporting was the number of scam messages they <em>didn't</em> block. There's an easy explanation for this omission: they simply don't know how many are sent. But if I were to take a guess, they've merely blocked the tip of the iceberg. This is why in addition to technical controls, we reply on human controls which means helping people identify the patterns of a scam: requests for money, a sense of urgency, grammar and casing that's a bit off, add looking URLs. You know, stuff like this:</p>

<figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-22-at-12.26.43-unnumbered-1.png"></figure>

<p>What makes this situation so ridiculous is that while we're all watching for scammers attempting to imitate legitimate organisations, FedEx is out there imitating scammers! Here we are in the era of burgeoning AI-driven scams that are becoming increasingly hard for humans to identify, and FedEx is like "here, hold my beer" as they one-up the scammers at their own game and do a perfect job of being completely indistinguishable from them.</p><p>Ah well, as I ultimately lament in these situations, it's a good time to be in the industry 😊</p>

<p>By leveraging a technique called Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on canvas-rendered apps, Leo can use an image of a page to extract text in Google Docs and Google Sheets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, Leo can offer insights and suggestions for users working with many different productivity applications, whether at school or at work.</p>

<h2 id="use-cases-for-leos-document-integrations">Use cases for Leo’s document integrations</h2>
<p>With this novel use of the accessibility tree, OCR, and other techniques, Leo can help with several important use cases. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>PDFs</strong>: Leo can extract topics and data deep within PDF documents. This can help with understanding research papers, preparing analysis from reports, finding details in a technical specification document, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Docs</strong>: When you’re editing a Google Doc, Leo can propose relevant terms or writing styles, or even review the document as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Sheets</strong>: Leo can analyze tables and data in a Google Sheet, and even suggest formulas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Slack workspaces</strong>: Leo can highlight key discussion points from a thread in a Slack workspace, extracting the thread’s essential points while saving you the time of reading the entire thread history.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="brave-leo-and-unparalleled-privacy">Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy</h2>
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo—and its document integrations—is no different. This is particularly relevant as work and school documents may contain sensitive information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reverse proxy</strong>: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discarding of responses</strong>: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No login or account required for access</strong>: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unlinkable subscription</strong>: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as Leo utilizes these techniques to preserve your privacy as you chat, it offers the same protections when Leo is helping you analyze documents and other files.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-leo-for-pdfs-and-google-drive-files">How to use Leo for PDFs and Google Drive files</h2>
<p>Leo’s support for PDFs, Google Docs, and Google Sheets is available now for all Brave desktop users on version 1.63 or higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To try it out, simply open a PDF, Google Doc, or Google Sheet in a tab in the Brave browser. Then click the <span title="Ask Leo icon"></span> in the sidebar, and start asking Leo questions about the file.</p>
<p>Don’t have Leo in the sidebar yet? Just click <strong>Settings</strong>, then click <strong>Leo</strong>, and toggle on the <strong>Show Leo icon in the sidebar</strong> option.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next-for-leo-and-document--file-support">What’s next for Leo and document / file support?</h2>
<p>Leo will soon support other documents and file types. For example, Leo will integrate with GitHub, allowing code reviewers to summarize the purpose and impact of pull requests by analyzing code changes without line-by-line inspection. Keep an eye out for announcements about GitHub support, and for even more document and file integrations.</p>
<p>From the beginning, we saw Leo as far more than an AI chatbot (though it can handle real-time, contextual chats with ease). Rather, we saw Leo as a true smart assistant that could help you engage with the applications you use every day, to help you learn, work, and plan more efficiently. By surfacing insights from within PDFs, suggesting text for Google Docs, writing formulas for Google Sheets, summarizing YouTube videos, analyzing code in GitHub (and more), Leo saves you time and makes you more efficient and productive.</p>

</p>

<p>
RAD has become aware of a problem that can cause Oodle Data decompression failures, or crashes in games built with Unreal.
We believe that this is a hardware problem which affects primarily Intel 13900K and 14900K processors, less likely 13700, 14700 and other related processors as well. Only a small fraction of those processors will exhibit this behavior. The problem seems to be caused by a combination of BIOS settings and the high clock rates and power usage of these processors, leading to system instability and unpredictable behavior under heavy load.
</p>
<p>
As far as we can tell, there is not any software bug in Oodle or Unreal that is causing this. Due to what seem to be overly optimistic
BIOS settings, some small percentage of processors go out of their functional range of clock rate and power draw under high load, and
execute instructions incorrectly. This is being seen disproportionately in Oodle Data decompression because unlike most gameplay,
simulation, audio or rendering code, decompression needs to perform extra integrity checks to handle accidentally or maliciously
corrupted data, and is thus likely to spot inconsistencies very soon after they occur. These decode failures then typically result
in an error message.
</p>
<p>
When starting an Unreal Engine-based game, the most common failure is of this type:
</p>
<blockquote>
DecompressShader(): Could not decompress shader (GetShaderCompressionFormat=Oodle)
</blockquote>
<p>
However, this problem does not only affect Oodle, and machines that suffer from this instability will also exhibit failures in standard
benchmark and stress test programs. Any programs which heavily use the processor on many threads may cause crashes or unpredictable behavior.
There have been crashes seen in RealBench, CineBench, Prime95, Handbrake, Visual Studio, and more. This problem can also show up as a GPU error
message, such as spurious "out of video memory" errors, even though it is caused by the CPU.
</p>
<p>
We do not have acccess to diagnostic processor information that would nail down the exact cause and best workaround for this problem.
It seems that many motherboard/BIOS manufacturers are shipping with settings that push the processor outside its safe operating range.
Because this problem appears to affect only a small fraction of processors, some users have had success with returning their processor to the
manufacturer and getting a new one which doesn't exhibit the problem.
</p>
<p>
Other workarounds require using tuning utilities or modifying BIOS settings. Note that doing so incorrectly can cause damage to your system.
The changes we are recommending here are, to the best of our knowledge, completely safe, but you are solely responsible for any damages or loss
caused by changing these settings from their factory defaults. If you are uncomfortable or worried about using tuning utilities (even officially
sanctioned ones) or changing your BIOS settings, and frequent crashes also occur in the benchmark programs mentioned previously, you should be able
to return the CPU or the entire computer to the manufacturer instead.</p>
<p>
A reportedly successful workaround for many people is to use <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/17881/intel-extreme-tuning-utility-intel-xtu.html">Intel XTU</a>
and lower the Performance Core multiplier from x55 to x54 or x53. Apparently, affected titles may then crash one more time during load immediately
after, but will work afterwards (we have not been able to confirm this ourselves). Using XTU is likely
the quickest and easiest way to go and doesn't even require rebooting to try different settings, but you might need to reapply it after every start
if you don't save the profile. (Alternatively, set the P-core multiplier in the BIOS instead.)</p>
<p>In the BIOS, if you have enabled any overclocking, please turn it off; do not use "AI" or "automatic" overclocking. Even if you have not explicitly
enabled any overclocking, many BIOSes are doing some by default, so on affected machines you will have to find those settings and turn them off.
Every BIOS has slightly different names for the settings; we cannot provide exact instructions of which settings to look for all of them.
Some of these settings may be in the Advanced or Overclocking submenu of the BIOS.
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
First look for settings to put the power limits and voltages of the processor into the Intel recommended safe ranges.
You can find the correct limits for your processor at <a href="https://ark.intel.com/">ark.intel.com</a>.
These might be:
</li>
<ul>
<li>"SVID behavior" → "Intel fail safe"</li>
<li>"Long duration power limit" → reduce to 125W if set higher ("Processor Base Power" on ARK)</li>
<li>"Short duration power limit" → reduce to 253W if set higher (for 13900/14900 CPUs, other CPUs have other limits! "Maximum Turbo Power" on ARK)</li>
</ul>
<li>If those don't work, another thing to look for is BIOS "enhanced turbo" or "enhanced multithreading" settings. For example:</li>
<ul>
<li>"ASUS MultiCore Enhancement" → disabled (not Auto)</li>
<li>"ASUS Performance Enhancement 3.0" → disabled</li>
</ul>
<li>There have been reports of users finding stability by turning down the maximum clock rate. This can be done with BIOS settings or with Intel XTU. Some possibilities: </li>
<ul>
<li>Turn down the maximum P core multiplier from 55X to 53X or 54X. (for example)</li>
<li>Turn down maximum turbo boost clock rate</li>
<li>Turn off or turn down "thermal velocity boost"</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
Note that many motherboard/BIOS settings turn on XMP (Extreme Memory Profile) by default with unstable settings that can cause similar symptoms. Instability due to XMP is a
separate issue, but if you have instability problems, you may wish to also disable XMP and see if that helps.

Troubleshooting Update from Intel Corporation - Additional troubleshooting steps for ASUS, Gigabyte and MSI motherboards:
</b>
</p>
<p>
First, install Intel XTU and run the AVX2 test. If the AVX2 test failure is seen, try these options:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
For ASUS:<p>
Ask customer to change BIOS settings: Advanced (F7)- SVID Behavior: Change to "Intel's Fail Safe"
</p><p>
Reboot the OS and run XTU test again and if the AVX2 test can pass.
Run games and see if the issue happens again.
</p></li>
<li>
For Gigabyte:<p>
Solution A):
In BIOS, select "ADVANCED MODE", in the Tweaker tab, locate the CPU Vcore and select "Normal" option, select "Dynamic Vcore(DVID)" option, change it from "Auto" to "+0.005V"
Increase the DVID by +0.005 and reboot OS, until the game crash disappears and the system is running stable.
</p><p>
Solution B):
In BIOS, select "Tweaker", select "Advanced Voltage Settings", select "CPU/VRAM Settings", adjust "CPU Vcore Loadline Calibration", recommend starting from "Low" to "Medium" until system is stable.
</p><p>After implementing solution A or B, run the XTU test again and if the AVX2 test can pass.
Run games and see if the issue happens again.
</p></li>
<li>
For MSI:<p>
Solution A):
In BIOS, select "OC", select "CPU Core Voltage Mode", select "Offset Mode", select "+(By PWM)", adjust the voltage until the system is stable, recommend not to exceed 0.025V for a single increase.
</p><p>
Solution B):
In BIOS, select "OC", select "DigitALL Power", change "CPU Loadline Calibration Control", recommend starting from "Mode 7" to a lower value until system is stable.
</p><p>After implementing solution A or B, run the XTU test again and if the AVX2 test can pass.
Run games and see if the issue happens again.
</p></li>
</ol>
<hr><p>
Note that we cannot directly support end users of games impacted by this problem, please use the official support channels of the game publisher,
as well as the support channels of the processor and motherboard manufacturers.
