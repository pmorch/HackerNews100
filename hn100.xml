      <p>Swift has matured significantly over the past decade — extending from cloud services to Windows applications, browser apps, and microcontrollers. Swift powers apps and services of all kinds, and thanks to its great interoperability, you can share code across platforms.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.swift.org/android-workgroup/">Android workgroup</a> is an open group, free for anyone to join, that aims to expand Swift to Android. Today, we are pleased to announce nightly preview releases of the <a href="https://www.swift.org/install/macos/#swift-sdk-buindles-dev">Swift SDK for Android</a>.</p>

<p>This milestone reflects months of effort by the Android workgroup, building on many years of grassroots community effort. With the SDK, developers can begin developing Android applications in Swift, opening new avenues for cross-platform development and accelerating innovation across the mobile ecosystem.</p>

<p>The Swift SDK for Android is available today, bundled with the <a href="https://www.swift.org/install/windows/">Windows installer</a> or downloadable separately for use on Linux or macOS.</p>



<p>We’ve published a <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-sdk-for-android-getting-started.html">Getting Started guide</a> to help you set up your first native Swift code on an Android device. The <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-android-examples">Swift for Android Examples</a> help demonstrate end‑to‑end application workflows on Android.</p>

<p>With the Swift SDK for Android, you can now start porting your Swift packages to Android. <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/blog/adding-wasm-and-android-compatibility-testing">Over 25% of packages in the Swift Package Index</a> already build for Android, and <a href="https://www.swift.org/packages/showcase.html">the Community Showcase</a> now indicates Android compatibility.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-java">swift-java project</a> enables you to interoperate between Java and Swift. It is both a library and a code generator, enabling you to integrate Swift and Java in both directions by automatically generating safe and performant bindings. To learn about generating bindings to bring your business logic to Android, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96IQAA7Nl8E&amp;t=982s">recent Swift Server Side meetup talk</a> by Mads Odgaard.</p>



<p>This preview release opens many new opportunities to continue improving these tools. We encourage you to share your experiences, ideas, tools and apps on the <a href="https://forums.swift.org/">Swift forums</a>. This post has been published on an <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-the-swift-sdk-for-android/82845">associated thread</a> for discussion, and new posts can be shared in the <a href="https://forums.swift.org/c/platform/android/115">Android category</a>.</p>

<p>The Android workgroup is drafting <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/pull/2946">a vision document</a>, currently under review, for directing future work regarding Swift on Android. This vision will outline priority areas and guide community efforts to maximize impact across the ecosystem. In addition, we maintain a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/swiftlang/projects/17">project board</a> that tracks the status of major efforts, as well as <a href="https://ci.swift.org/job/oss-swift-package-swift-sdk-for-android/">official CI for the Swift SDK for Android</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re as excited as we are, join us and help make this ecosystem even better!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>While the media continues to ignore and even mock Trump’s war on “Antifa” terrorism as legally impossible, the FBI is quietly interrogating protesters.</p><p><span>The Bureau is targeting anti-ICE protesters not charged with any crime, like Chicago-based English professor Elias Cepeda, as I </span><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/no-kings-protest-and-arrests-begin" rel="">recently reported</a><span>. Often people targeted have refused to go public with their experience, fearing retribution. But one protester, fed up with the culture of self-censorship, decided to share his story. His account sheds light on the FBI’s attempts to map out some organized Antifa superstructure — and in doing so, undermining Americans’ freedom of speech and political expression.</span></p><p>Special-needs teacher Miles Serafini, 26, was watching a movie with his roommate when the FBI knocked on his door in suburban Tucson, Arizona last Friday. Two special agents greeted him, introducing themselves only as “James” and “Keith.” They didn’t offer their own last names, but they knew Miles’ — as well as his home address, his social media handles, what car he owns, and, unbeknownst to him, his political activities.</p><p>“We came out here to ask you questions regarding a protest that happened on the the 11th of June,” one of the agents said in an exchange captured on a Ring camera and provided to me by Serafini. “We’ve been just basically going around asking questions for a few people … and your name was brought up.”</p><p>The suggestion that his name “was brought up,” puzzled Serafini, who told me he didn’t know anyone at the protest, which he’d learned about from a post on social media. When he asked the agents how they knew who he was, they wouldn’t say — though one agent, Serafini said, later told him that they knew “way more about me than I’d think.”</p><p>The exact scale of these FBI questionings is unclear, but I’ve heard similar accounts involving protesters in Portland and Chicago. (The FBI declined to comment on Serafini’s account, citing the government shutdown.)</p><p>Serafini attended an anti-ICE protest around an ICE facility in June so he could express his opposition to the deportations, he told me. </p><p>“ICE is impacting our community and people aren’t happy,” Serafini said. “People see people around them being kidnapped and shipped away in cages and they show up to protest — It’s as easy as that.”</p><p><span>The protest involved an estimated 300 people gathering near the ICE field office at East Valencia Road and South Country Club Road in Tucson on June 11. The demonstration started off peacefully but later became rowdy. As the crowd gathered at the ICE office, a smaller group of protesters began </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skcpyzdeoxQ" rel="">throwing objects</a><span> — rocks, paint-balls, fireworks and smoke devices — at what appeared to be  security guards stationed outside the building. The guards responded with crowd-control munitions.</span></p><p>Windows of the ICE facility and adjacent buildings were broken and spray-painted with graffiti. A number of businesses nearby boarded up or posted signs distancing themselves from ICE operations. Tucson Police later announced that three people were taken into custody for charges including unlawful assembly, resisting arrest, obstructing a public thoroughfare and disorderly conduct — and said that their investigation could lead to more arrests.</p><p><span>Serafini said he didn’t engage in any violence and hasn’t been detained or charged with any crime. But last month’s </span><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/trumps-nspm-7-labels-common-beliefs" rel="">presidential directive NSPM-7</a><span> authorizes federal law enforcement to treat “extremism on migration” as an indicator of terrorism. </span></p><p><span>Under the domestic counter-terrorism cases of the Trump administration, no crime needs to be actually committed for authorities to open an investigation. In fact, NSPM-7 explicitly calls for a preemptive approach where law enforcement intervene in things “before they result in violent political acts.” Attorney General Pam Bondi cited NSPM-7 in her own </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1415691/dl" rel="">directive</a><span>, ordering the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies to crack down on anti-ICE “terrorism,” citing protests in front of ICE facilities specifically.</span></p><p>After 9/11, as the FBI reoriented itself to fighting terror groups like al Qaeda, they focused on identifying and locating individuals and then mapping out their networks of family, friends and associates. That’s the Trump administration approach to Antifa, imagining an organization network that encompasses everything from membership cards to elaborate funding.</p><p>This approach was evident to Serafini, who told me: “I could tell by their questioning that they were trying to figure out the shadowy entity behind the protest.”</p><p>He added: “What a waste of their time to go after shit that doesn’t exist.”</p><p>The FBI seemed more interested in who was behind the protest than the protest itself, with the agents repeatedly asking about who had produced the protest signs, he explained.</p><p>“They wanted to know where they were from and who supplied them,” Serafini said. “Nothing about what was actually on them.”</p><p>The signage has become a point of interest to the Trump administration. At a roundtable event on Antifa earlier this month, President Trump pointed to the quality of the signs as evidence that the protests must be funded by unseen benefactors. </p><p>Per Trump: </p><blockquote><p><span> </span><em>“When you see the signs, and they’re all made out of a beautiful, beautiful paper. Beautiful, nice, stiff, very expensive paper with beautiful wood handles all the same. All the same color. They come from very expensive printing machines. These are are people that write out their signs in a basement, that believe in something. These are paid anarchists.”</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi echoed the same sentiment recently. </p><p>“That’s one of the things about Antifa," Bondi said on Fox News earlier this month. “You’re seeing people out there with thousands of signs that all match — pre-bought, pre-put together — they’re organized and someone is funding it.”</p><p>The administration is convinced that these protests aren’t spontaneous, and because of NSPM-7, the FBI has to prioritize collecting intelligence to show that. Serafini said that a particular focus of the FBI agents was whether the violence at the protest had been premeditated; and he when he told them it all seemed spontaneous, they implied he was lying.</p><p>Per Serafini:</p><blockquote><p><em>“They asked me if the violence (rocks, paint balloons) seemed spontaneous or premeditated. I told them it seemed spontaneous once the ICE agents escalated. They brought up that some protestors showed up with riot shields, so they questioned why they would bring shields if violence wasn’t premeditated. And they kept drilling me on the fact that I showed up alone, [that I didn’t] remember where I saw the flyer, and didn’t know anybody there. They told me that’s unusual and pretty suspicious — as if I was holding back information about whoever organized the protest. They kept insinuating that I was lying to them.”</em></p><p><em>“They showed me photos of several protestors … and tried to get information on them. They said ICE officers were badly injured and that these were the real suspects they needed info on. I told them I had no idea who they were. They seemed frustrated by that, but it’s the truth.”</em></p></blockquote><p>According to Serafini, the two FBI agents showed him photos of himself at the protest as well as several other protesters — people he knew nothing about. The agents asked him for his cell phone, but he refused. The questioning lasted about an hour. Serafini said they left him with a chilling message: that they couldn’t guarantee this would be the last time they saw him.</p><p>The agents may not have learned anything from Serafini, but the visit — which took place one day before the No Kings protest — did accomplish one thing: Serafini decided against going to No Kings. He was spooked.</p><p>That is exactly the chilling effect on speech that the FBI investigating political matters risks creating. </p><p>“Worked on me,” he said.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/video-fbi-agents-visit-anti-ice-protester/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/video-fbi-agents-visit-anti-ice-protester/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/video-fbi-agents-visit-anti-ice-protester?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/video-fbi-agents-visit-anti-ice-protester?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>— </span><em>Edited by William M.

        <p>What’s going on, Internet? To the outrage of the Firefox community across the web, Mozilla has started rolling out AI across our beloved browser and has enabled the features by default.</p>
        <p>I’ve found the new Firefox “AI” features, like the pop-ups that appear when highlighting text, to be more distracting than useful. The sidebar chat isn’t something I need either; if I want that experience, I’ll just open ChatGPT in a containerised tab.</p>
        <p>If you’d like to turn these features off, open <code>about:config</code> in the Firefox address bar, search for <code>browser.ml.enable</code>, set it to false, and that should disable everything.</p>
        <p>If you’d rather try some features while disabling others, keep <code>browser.ml.enable</code> set to true and toggle each feature individually.</p>
        <p>I’m giving Smart Tab Groups a try for now, as I’m curious to see how the “AI” handles organising my dozens of open tabs. I’ll let you know how that goes.</p>
        <p>Below is a list of the “AI” features you can disable in <code>about:config</code>, along with a short explanation of what I understand each one does. Enjoy.</p>

            After more than three centuries, a geometry problem that originated with a royal bet has been solved.        </p>

<div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Imagine you’re holding two equal-size dice. Is it possible to bore a tunnel through one die that’s big enough for the other to slide through?</p>
<p>Perhaps your instinct is to say “Surely not!” If so, you’re not alone. In the late 1600s, an unidentified person placed a bet to that effect with Prince Rupert of the Rhine. Rupert — a nephew of Charles I of England who commanded the Royalist forces in the English Civil War — spent his sunset years studying metallurgy and glassmaking in his laboratory at Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>Rupert won the bet. The mathematician John Wallis, recounting the story in 1693, didn’t say whether Rupert wrote a proof or bored a hole through an actual cube. But Wallis himself proved mathematically that, if you drill a straight tunnel in the direction of one of the cube’s inner diagonals, it can be made wide enough to allow another cube through. It’s a tight squeeze: If you make the second cube just 4% larger, it will no longer fit.</p>
<p>It’s natural to wonder which other shapes have this property. “I think of this problem as being quite canonical,” said <a href="http://tom7.org/">Tom Murphy</a>, a software engineer at Google who has explored the question extensively in his free time. It “would have gotten rediscovered and rediscovered — aliens would have come to this one.”</p>

    <p>The full menagerie of shapes is too diverse to get a handle on, so mathematicians tend to focus on convex polyhedra: shapes, like the cube, that have flat sides and no protrusions or indentations. When such a shape is much wider in some directions than others, it’s usually easy to find a straight tunnel that will allow another copy of the shape to pass through. But many famous convex polyhedra — for instance the dodecahedron, or the truncated icosahedron, the shape that forms a soccer ball — are highly symmetric and difficult to analyze. Among these, “for hundreds of years we only knew of the cube,” said Jakob Steininger, a mathematician at Statistics Austria, Austria’s federal statistics organization.</p>
<p>Then, in 1968, Christoph Scriba proved that the <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/relay-station?mr=0497615">tetrahedron and octahedron</a> also have the “Rupert property,” as mathematicians now call it. And in a burst of activity over the past decade, professional mathematicians and hobbyists have found Rupert tunnels through many of the most widely studied convex polyhedra, including the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/math.mag.90.2.87">dodecahedron, icosahedron</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029890.2018.1449505">soccer ball</a>.</p>
<p>The Rupert property appeared to be so widespread that mathematicians conjectured a general rule: Every convex polyhedron <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029890.2018.1449505">will have the Rupert property</a>. No one could find one that didn’t — until now.</p>

    <p>In a paper posted online in August, Steininger and <a href="https://yurkevi.ch/">Sergey Yurkevich</a> — a researcher at A&amp;R Tech, an Austrian transportation systems company — describe a shape with 90 vertices and 152 faces that they’ve named the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18475">Noperthedron</a> (after “Nopert,” a coinage by Murphy that combines “Rupert” and “nope”). Steininger and Yurkevich proved that no matter how you bore a straight tunnel through a Noperthedron, a second Noperthedron cannot fit through.</p>
<p>The proof required a mix of theoretical advances and massive computer calculations, and relies on a delicate property of the Noperthedron’s vertices. “It’s a miracle that it works,” Steininger said.</p>
<h2><strong>Passing Through the Shadows</strong></h2>
<p>To see how one cube can pass through another, imagine holding a cube over a table and examining its shadow (assuming it’s illuminated from above). If you hold the cube in the standard position, the shadow is a square. But if you point one of the corners directly upward, the shadow is a regular hexagon.</p>
<p>In 1693, Wallis showed that the square shadow fits inside the hexagon, leaving a thin margin. That means that if you point a cube’s corner upward, you can bore a vertical tunnel that’s big enough for a second cube to pass through. About a century later, Pieter Nieuwland showed that a different orientation casts an even better shadow — one that can accommodate a cube more than 6% larger than the cube with the tunnel.</p>

    <p>Every subsequent analysis of more complicated shapes has relied on this process of turning the shape in different directions and looking for one shadow that fits inside another. With the aid of computers, mathematicians have found Rupert passages through a wide variety of shapes. Some are incredibly tight fits — for instance, the passage in a “triakis tetrahedron” has a margin that’s only about 0.000002 times the length of the shape’s radius. “The world of mixing computation and discrete geometry has flowered to make these kinds of calculations possible,” said <a href="https://www.smith.edu/people/joseph-orourke">Joseph O’Rourke</a>, an emeritus professor at Smith College.</p>
<p>Researchers who have written algorithms to find Rupert passages have noticed a curious dichotomy: For any given convex polyhedron, the algorithm seems to either find a passage almost immediately, or not find one at all. In the past five years, mathematicians have accumulated a small collection of holdout shapes for which no passage has been found.</p>
<p>“I’ve had my desktop churn for two weeks on trying the rhombicosidodecahedron,” said <a href="https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~grimmer/">Benjamin Grimmer</a>, an applied mathematician at Johns Hopkins University, referring to a solid made of 62 regular triangles, squares and pentagons. “That one just seems to resist any attempt.”</p>

    <p>But such resistance doesn’t prove that a shape is a Nopert. There are infinitely many ways to orient a shape, and a computer can only check finitely many. Researchers don’t know whether the holdouts are true Noperts or just shapes whose Rupert passages are hard to find.</p>
<p>What they do know is that candidate Noperts are incredibly rare. Starting last year, Murphy began to <a href="http://tom7.org/ruperts/ruperts.pdf">construct hundreds of millions of shapes</a>. These include random polyhedra, polyhedra whose vertices lie on a sphere, polyhedra with special symmetries, and polyhedra in which he moved one vertex to intentionally mess up a previous Rupert passage. His algorithm easily found Rupert tunnels for nearly every one.</p>
<p>The contrast between these quick results and the stubbornness of the Nopert holdouts made some mathematicians suspect that true Noperts do exist. But until August, all they had were suspicions.</p>
<h2><strong>No Passage</strong></h2>
<p>Steininger, now 30, and Yurkevich, 29, have been friends since they participated together as teenagers in mathematics Olympiad competitions. Even though both eventually left academia (after a doctorate for Yurkevich and a master’s for Steininger), they have continued to explore unsolved problems together.</p>
<p>“We just had pizza three hours ago, and we talked about math almost the whole time,” Steininger told <em>Quanta</em>. “That’s what we do.”</p>
<p>Five years ago, the pair happened upon a YouTube video of one cube passing through another, and they were instantly smitten. They developed an algorithm to search for Rupert tunnels and soon became convinced that some shapes were Noperts. In a 2021 paper, they conjectured that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13754">the rhombicosidodecahedron is not Rupert</a>. Their work, which preceded Murphy’s and Grimmer’s recent explorations, was, “I think, the first to conjecture that there might be solids that don’t have this property,” Steininger said.</p>
<p>If you want to prove that a shape is a Nopert, you must rule out Rupert tunnels for every possible orientation of the two shapes. Each orientation can be written down as a collection of rotation angles. This collection of angles can then be represented as a point in a higher-dimensional “parameter space.”</p>

    <p>Suppose you choose an orientation for your two shapes, and the computer tells you that the second shadow sticks out past the border of the first shadow. This rules out one point in the parameter space.</p>
<p>But you may be able to rule out much more than a single point. If the second shadow sticks out significantly, it would require a big change to move it inside the first shadow. In other words, you can rule out not just your initial orientation but also “nearby” orientations — an entire block of points in the parameter space. Steininger and Yurkevich came up with a result they called their global theorem, which quantifies precisely how large a block you can rule out in these cases. By testing many different points, you can potentially rule out block after block in the parameter space.</p>
<p>If these blocks cover the entire parameter space, you’ll have proved that your shape is a Nopert. But the size of each block depends on how far the second shadow sticks out beyond the first, and sometimes it doesn’t stick out very far. For instance, suppose you start with the two shapes in exactly the same position, and then you slightly rotate the second shape. Its shadow will at most stick out just a tiny bit past the first shadow, so the global theorem will only rule out a tiny box. These boxes are too small to cover the whole parameter space, leaving the possibility that some point you’ve missed might correspond to a Rupert tunnel.</p>

<p>To deal with these small reorientations, the pair came up with a complement to their global theorem that they called the local theorem. This result deals with cases where you can find three vertices (or corner points) on the boundary of the original shadow that satisfy some special requirements. For instance, if you connect those three vertices to form a triangle, it must contain the shadow’s center point. The researchers showed that if these requirements are met, then any small reorientation of the shape will create a shadow that pushes at least one of the three vertices further outward. So the new shadow can’t lie inside the original shadow, meaning it doesn’t create a Rupert tunnel.</p>
<p>If your shape casts a shadow that lacks three appropriate vertices, the local theorem won’t apply. And all the previously identified Nopert candidates have at least one shadow with this problem. Steininger and Yurkevich sifted through a database of hundreds of the most symmetric and beautiful convex polyhedra, but they couldn’t find any shape whose shadows all worked. So they decided to generate a suitable shape themselves.</p>
<p>They developed an algorithm to construct shapes and test them for the three-vertices property. Eventually, the algorithm produced the Noperthedron, which is made of 150 triangles and two regular 15-sided polygons. It looks like a rotund crystal vase with a wide base and top; one fan of the work has already 3D-printed a copy to use as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fractalkitty.com/post/3lxkvjiqa2c2p">pencil holder</a>.</p>

    <p>Steininger and Yurkevich then divided the parameter space of orientations into approximately 18 million tiny blocks, and tested the center point of each block to see if its corresponding orientation produced a Rupert passage. None of them did. Next, the researchers showed that each block satisfied either the local or global theorem, allowing them to rule out the entire block. Since these blocks fill out the entire parameter space, this meant that there is no Rupert passage through the Noperthedron.</p>
        
        
<p>The “natural conjecture has been proved false,” O’Rourke said.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether mathematicians can use the new method to generate other Noperts, or if they can find a different local theorem that can handle candidates like the rhombicosidodecahedron. But now that mathematicians know that Noperts do exist, “we’re on sound footing to study other shapes,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>Murphy, who like Steininger and Yurkevich has been exploring the question for its own sake, independent of his day job, feels a kinship across the centuries with Prince Rupert. “I like that he chose to use his retirement to do math and science in his castle,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Steininger and Yurkevich are on the lookout for new questions to tackle. “We’re just humble mathematicians — we love working on such problems,” Steininger said. “We’ll keep doing that.”</p>

The Asahi Linux developers involved with working on Linux support for Apple Silicon M-Series devices have put out a new progress report on their development efforts.
</p><p>
Asahi Linux developers have kept working on new kernel patches and some being upstreamed for Linux 6.17 and 6.18 cycles, as previously covered on Phoronix. Notably with Linux 6.18 is <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.18-SoC-DT-Changes">the Device Trees for the Apple M2 Pro / Max / Ultra devices</a> albeit more driver code is still working its way upstream.
</p><p>
Asahi Linux developers are also working on moving toward the Rust programming language with their important m1n1 bootloader for Apple Silicon. They feel going to Rust is important for such a critical piece of software for better maintainability, safety, and ensuring the correct logic.
</p><p>
Asahi Linux developers have also made progress on getting more games working on Apple Silicon devices. Wine is also now working outside of muvm and their graphics driver support continues maturing:
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=asahi_october" alt="Asahi Linux running a game"></p>
<p>With the upstream Linux kernel work around Apple Silicon so far being focused on Apple M1 and M2, you may be wondering about M3 and M4 or the recently announced M5... They still are battling Apple M3 bring-up. Today's progress report comments:
</p><blockquote>"It may be surprising to learn that very basic, low-level support for M3 has existed for quite some time now. m1n1 is capable of initialising the CPU cores, turning on some critical peripheral devices, and booting the Asahi kernel. However, the level of support right now begins and ends with being able to boot to a blinking cursor. Naturally, this level of support is not at all useful for anything but low-level reverse engineering, but we of course plan on rectifying this in due time..."</blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-4eu74nwj=""> <div data-astro-cid-4eu74nwj="">  <p><strong data-astro-cid-4eu74nwj=""> <p data-astro-cid-4eu74nwj="">Typst 0.14 is out now. With accessibility by default, PDFs as images, character-level justification, and more, it has everything you need to move from draft to production.
</p> </strong></p> </div> <p>Typst's origins lie in academia, but over the past year, we've seen it expand to so much more. It's increasingly being used in the industry: For manually written documents, partially automated reports, and in fully automated batch PDF generation pipelines. Across these use cases, it's being used in production for critical documents.</p>
<p>In August, we <a href="https://typst.app/blog/2025/future">launched a new website</a> to reflect Typst's expanding scope, and now, with Typst 0.14, we're shipping crucial features that make Typst even more widely applicable.</p>
<p>If you need to comply with accessibility-related regulations, Typst 0.14 has your back. Typst now generates accessible documents <em>by default,</em> with opt-in support for stricter checks. For those working with complex illustrations, PDFs are now supported as a native image format. In case you're typesetting a book, the new character-level justification will give your layout the final touch. And if you're building a website or blog, many improvements to Typst's HTML export are waiting for you.</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<p>In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at the highlights of this release:</p>

<p>To get started with Typst 0.14…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>…in the web app:</strong> Just open any of your projects! You'll get a prompt offering you to upgrade to the latest version.</li>
<li><strong>…in the command line:</strong> Run <code>typst update</code> in your terminal or, if you haven't installed Typst previously, download the <a href="https://typst.app/open-source/#download">latest version of the CLI</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a comprehensive overview of all changes in the release, visit the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/changelog/0.14.0/">changelog</a>. If you're looking to upgrade your document to Typst 0.14, you can also skip ahead to the <a href="#migrating">Migration section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>Not everyone reads PDF documents the same. Some people read on large screens or print; others use small phones or screen readers to have documents read aloud. To cater to all these uses, a file must contain <em>tags</em> that allow Assistive Technology (AT) like screen readers to learn about the reading order and semantic meaning of each piece of text. Tags allow AT users to learn which text is <code><span>*strongly emphasized*</span></code>, enable navigation of the document by skipping between headings, and more.</p>
<p>Tagging requires no additional work from you: If you are using the built-in markup and elements, Typst will automatically select the right tags! Unlike many other tools, PDF files created with Typst 0.14 are tagged by default, raising the bar for accessibility.</p>
<p>But tags are not enough to make a file accessible: To reach everyone, you need to design for universal accessibility from the start. The new features in Typst 0.14 can help you with that. Consider diagrams created with shapes or packages like cetz—their visual meaning is invisible to assistive technology. The new <code>alt</code> parameter on figures solves this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#</span><span>figure</span><span>(</span>
  <span>stack</span><span>(</span>
    dir<span>:</span> ltr<span>,</span>
    spacing<span>:</span> <span>0.5em</span><span>,</span>
    <span>rect</span><span>[</span>Tagged PDF<span>]</span><span>,</span>
    <span>text</span><span>(</span><span>2em</span><span>,</span> sym<span>.</span>arrow<span>.</span>long<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>rect</span><span>[</span>Accessibility<span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span><span>,</span>
  alt<span>:</span> <span>"Diagram with two rectangles. The first is labelled 'Tagged PDF'. An arrow points to the second, labelled 'Accessibility'"</span><span>,</span>
  caption<span>:</span> <span>[</span>

  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre><p><img src="https://typst.app/assets/docs/pl7jZuMd4U0DyWwVHtHHPwAAAAAAAAAA.png" alt="Preview" width="600" height="123"></p></div>
<p>With this change, AT users hear the alternative description and can grasp the figure's purpose just like sighted users—no information is lost. We have put together a new <a href="https://typst.app/docs/guides/accessibility/">Accessibility Guide</a> that contains more tips on how to create accessible documents, including how to write good alternative descriptions, when to use the figure's vs. the image's <code>alt</code> parameter, and more.</p>
<p>To make sure you got everything right, you can enable the new PDF/UA-1 export. PDF/UA is an international standard that helps to create universally accessible PDF files. When it is enabled, Typst will run additional checks against your document to find accessibility issues and optimize for accessibility rather than compatibility. It will find issues such as missing document titles, wrong heading hierarchies, and missing alternative descriptions.</p>
<p>PDF/UA-1 helps you comply with existing and upcoming international accessibility regulation like the European Accessibility Act (EAA) in the EU and the new Americans with Disabilities Act's (ADA) Title II guidance by the DOJ. The former applies to many businesses active in the European Union since 28 June 2025 while the deadline for the latter is set for April 24, 2026. If you are using Typst in your business for customer- or government-facing documents, you should adopt Typst 0.14 as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="pdf-standards">PDF standards</h2>
<p>Alongside PDF/UA-1 support, we've also generally expanded Typst's support for PDF standards. Instead of just PDF 1.7, you can now choose between the PDF versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, and 2.0. And for PDF/A, we've expanded support from just two specific substandards to all four parts with all their conformance levels. While Typst's defaults are perfectly fine for most use cases, choosing a standard can optimize your document specifically for your use case. Consult the expanded <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/pdf/#pdf-standards">PDF documentation in the reference</a> for guidance on which standards you should pick under which circumstances.</p>
<p><img src="https://typst.app/assets/images/blog/pdf-modal-014.webp" alt="A modal with the title 'PDF export'. It allows changing page range, PDF version, PDF standard, and whether the file is tagged. In the standards category, PDF/UA-1 is enabled, two checkmarks report that the standard is accessible and allows file attachments. Due to the selection, the Tagged PDF checkbox is selected and cannot be unchecked." width="310" height="271"></p><h2 id="pd-fs-as-images">PDFs as images</h2>
<p>Staying with the PDF theme, there are exciting news for authors that have a lot of complex illustrations. Typst now supports PDF as a native image format. What I personally find most exciting about it, is that PDF images are supported <em>across all export targets,</em> and for each export target in the most suitable format. In PDF export, PDFs are naturally directly embedded. Meanwhile, in HTML and SVG export, PDFs are converted to an embedded SVG on-the-fly. And, finally, in PNG export and the web app preview, PDFs are rasterized. All of this PDF processing functionality lives right in the Typst compiler, with no system dependencies. This is only possible thanks to the amazing work of community member <a href="https://github.com/LaurenzV">@LaurenzV</a>, who created a new PDF processing library called <a href="https://github.com/LaurenzV/hayro"><code>hayro</code></a> from scratch. The library is 100% written in the programming language Rust (which is also the language we use for the Typst compiler) and is thus highly portable.</p>

<h2 id="character-level-justification">Character-level justification</h2>
<p>Producing a visually balanced paragraph was once a fine art, when professional typesetters still carefully set paragraphs with movable type. Nowadays, you could hope that optimal paragraph typesetting is a solved problem across all our software. But, alas, it is not!</p>
<p>There are different strategies we can employ to produce a well-justified paragraph. Of course, to justify the paragraph, we need to stretch each line to the width of the measure. There are different ways to do this: Most obviously, we can adjust the spacing between words. This is what most software does. But we can also adjust the spacing between characters. This is now implemented in Typst.</p>
<p>Other methods to do this (which we want to explore in the future) include stretching the width of characters (this is best done with <em>variable fonts</em>) or, for some scripts, inserting special textual elements. For example, in Arabic, there are <em>Kashida,</em> which allow spacing out glyphs in words by extending the connectors between individual glyphs.</p>
<p>But that's just part of the recipe. Arguably, the even more crucial part is how this interplays with <em>which linebreaks</em> we chose to insert. Naively, we can choose our break points based on how much text fits and then perform the stretching. But we can do much better by taking into account each line's potential for stretching with the various mechanisms discussed above! We can then choose the break points that minimize the amount of bad-looking stretching.</p>
<p>I was initially skeptical about supporting character-level justification because I've seen it done poorly in some books. But that's actually not the fault of character-level justification per se; it's just excessive use of it. Tastefully chosen maxima—together with an algorithm that minimizes displeasing typography—make it bring out the best in justification.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about microtypography when people compare Typst with LaTeX. And even though Typst uses the same fundamental algorithm as LaTeX does to optimize paragraphs, it's true that LaTeX has some extra tricks up its sleeve. Now we do too though, as character-level justification is a feature that LaTeX does <em>not</em> support.</p>
<p><img src="https://typst.app/assets/images/blog/character-level-justification.webp" alt="Two renderings of a justified paragraph about the 29 BC Yellow River flood from Wikipedia. The first has the caption 'Without character-level justification'. It has issues with grayness: For example, the 5th line is set very wide. The second has the caption 'With character-level justification'. Compared to the previous example, no line is overly wide or narrow." width="1473" height="800"></p><h2 id="richer-html-export">Richer HTML Export</h2>
<p>In Typst 0.13, we shipped a first, highly experimental version of HTML export. This very minimal version already introduced the primitives for flexible HTML generation. With these primitives, the mapping of Typst elements to HTML can be expressed through show rules, just like the mapping to visual elements is performed in paged export.</p>
<p>What was lacking though were show rules for many built-in elements, including elements like footnotes, outlines, and citations. Typst 0.14 makes good progress in this regard. Most semantic elements (those from the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/"><em>Model</em> category</a>) are now properly mapped to semantic HTML. We've also improved handling of textual content in HTML export. The more visualization- and styling-focused parts of Typst's standard library remain largely unsupported, but we plan to add support for those (to the extent possible) in the future.</p>
<p>Below, you can see an example of a small, but non-trivial Typst document exported to HTML with Typst 0.14.</p>
<pre><code><span>#</span><span>set</span> <span>heading</span><span>(</span>numbering<span>:</span> <span>"1."</span><span>)</span>

</span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>ul</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>section</span><span>&gt;
</span></pre>
<p>Another exciting addition to HTML export is the new <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/html/typed/">typed HTML</a> interface. Typst's <code>html</code> module now includes functions for constructing HTML elements with strongly-typed attributes. This means you can now write</p>
<pre><code><span>#</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>video</span><span>(</span>
  autoplay<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
  width<span>:</span> <span>1280</span><span>,</span>
  height<span>:</span> <span>720</span><span>,</span>
  src<span>:</span> <span>"sunrise.mp4"</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code><span>#</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>elem</span><span>(</span><span>"video"</span><span>,</span> attrs<span>:</span> <span>(</span>
  autoplay<span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span>
  width<span>:</span> <span>"1280"</span><span>,</span>
  height<span>:</span> <span>"720"</span><span>,</span>
  src<span>:</span> <span>"sunrise.mp4"</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, attributes are mapped to idiomatic Typst-native types.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we're happy to announce that HTML export will soon come to the Typst web app. We're still polishing up the implementation, but plan to ship it in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Please note that HTML export remains experimental. To enable it in the CLI, pass <code>--features html</code> or set <code>TYPST_FEATURES=html</code>. In the web app, support for HTML export will also need to be enabled on a per-project basis.</p>
<h2 id="migrating">Migrating to Typst 0.14</h2>
<p>As far as breaking changes and deprecations go, this is a pretty calm release. Most documents should continue to work as before. There are a few minor breaking changes that make certain validations more strict. For instance, labels, link URLs, and font lists may not be empty anymore. To learn about all breaking changes, consult the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/changelog/" title="changelog">changelog</a> and search for "breaking change".</p>
<p>The release also contains a few <a href="https://typst.app/docs/changelog/0.14.0/#deprecations">deprecations</a>. In particular, you'll need to replace any use of <code>pdf.embed</code> with <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/pdf/attach/" title="`pdf.attach`"><code>pdf.attach</code></a>. Moreover, two bibliography styles were renamed and the <code>--make-deps</code> CLI flag was deprecated in favor of the new, more flexible <code>--deps</code> flag with <code>--deps-format make</code>. There are also a few deprecated <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/symbols/">symbols</a>. The compiler will warn you about all use of deprecated functionality.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-web-app">In the web app</h3>
<p>With this release, we're also bringing a better version upgrade experience to the web app. Previously, projects would always use the latest compiler version unless explicitly pinned to a specific version in the settings side panel.</p>
<p>We are now phasing out the "Latest" option. Instead, the web app detects when a new version is available since you've last edited a project, and offers you to upgrade. The upgrade assistant includes an automatic compatibility check that compiles your document with both versions, makes a verdict, and lists new errors and warnings.</p>
<p><img src="https://typst.app/assets/images/blog/migration-modal.webp" alt="Modal with the title 'Upgrade your project'. It contains this text: 'We updated the Typst compiler since you last edited this project. Upgrade this project to benefit from the new features and bug fixes in Typst 0.14.0. You can change the compiler version in the project settings panel at any time.' In a box with a green outline, it says 'Your project is ready to upgrade. Your project compiled without errors on Typst 0.14.0. Note that its appearance may have changed.'" width="491" height="320"></p>
<p>Typst 0.14 is the result of 8 months of hard work by us and the community. We hope you are as excited about it as we are!</p>
<p>Speaking of the community—We're hosting a <a href="https://discord.gg/KCMe6g7gPa?event=1430904365748846632">community call on Discord on Friday, November 7th</a>. Join us to share your experiences with the new version and to chat with the community!</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<p>Debian packagers have a great deal of latitude when it comes to the
configuration of the software they package; they may opt, for example,
to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/973782/">disable default
features</a> in software that they feel are a security
hazard. However, packagers are expected to ensure that their packages
comply with <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">Debian Policy</a>,
regardless of the upstream's preferences. If a packager fails to
comply with the policy, the <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/tech-ctte">Debian Technical
Committee</a> (TC) can step in to override them, which it has
done in the case of a recent systemd change that broke several
programs that depend on a world-writable <tt>/run/lock</tt>
directory.</p>

<p>The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch05s09.html">specifies</a>
that the <tt>/var/lock</tt> directory should be used to store lock
files for devices and other resources shared by multiple
applications. On Debian, <tt>/var/lock</tt> is a symbolic link to
<tt>/run/lock</tt>. The <tt>/run</tt> directory is created as a tmpfs
filesystem specifically for run-time files by <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service.html"><tt>systemd-tmpfiles</tt></a>
during system startup.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Debian Policy still cites the FHS, even though the FHS
has gone unmaintained for more than a decade. The specification was
not so much finished as <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/lsb-discuss@lists.linux-foundation.org/msg00201.html">abandoned</a>
after FHS&nbsp;3.0 was released—though there is a slow-moving
effort to revive and revise the standard as FHS&nbsp;4.0, it has not
yet produced any results. Meanwhile, in the absence of a current
standard, systemd has spun off its <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/file-hierarchy.html"><tt>file-hierarchy</tt></a>
documentation to the <a href="https://uapi-group.org/">Linux Userspace
API (UAPI) Group</a> as a <a href="https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/linux_file_system_hierarchy/">specification</a>. LWN
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1032947/">covered</a> that
development in August, related to Fedora's search for an FHS
successor.</p>

<h4>Locking up <tt>/run/lock</tt></h4>

<p>The <tt>/run/lock</tt> directory was deprecated in <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/releases/tag/v258">Systemd&nbsp;v258</a>;
rather than dropping the directory entirely, though, the project has
changed the default to making <tt>/run/lock</tt> writable only by root, which is stricter than the permissions Debian had shipped with previously
<strike>rather than making it world-writable as in the past</strike>. The plan is to
get rid of <tt>/run/lock</tt> entirely in the v259 release, though
users (or distributions) can still retain the legacy behavior by
adding a configuration file in <tt>/etc/tmpfiles.d</tt> to override
systemd's defaults and create the directory with the desired
permissions.</p>

<p>The Debian project just released a new stable version, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1033474/">Debian&nbsp;13</a>
("trixie"), in August, and work has begun on Debian&nbsp;14
("forky"). The current stable version of Debian shipped with systemd
v257, so users on stable will not be affected by these changes. But
v258 has entered Debian unstable where the change to
<tt>/run/lock</tt> broke other software, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP">Unix-to-Unix Copy</a>
program (UUCP) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cu_%28Unix_utility%29"><tt>cu</tt></a>
utility. Use of the directory is not limited to vintage utilities;
Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/38644#issuecomment-3302769755">objected</a>
to removing <tt>/var/lock</tt> in v259 as it would break <a href="https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#alsa-utils"><tt>alsa-utils</tt></a>
and create additional work for distributions:</p>

<blockquote>
Doing this would this way just creat a foottrap for distributions: if
they notice the change, they'll just create a local override, so we
get a more complicated system in total with zero benefit to anyone. If
they miss it, things will be broken for a while until users report
it. And then they'll add the override.
</blockquote>

<p>On August&nbsp;13, Marco d'Itri—who is listed as a maintainer
of the systemd package—filed a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110981">bug</a>
against the <tt>uucp</tt> package reporting that systemd v258-rc1-1
had broken <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/uucico"><tt>uucico</tt></a>, along
with filing a 
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110980">bug</a>
against the systemd package, which cited the FHS entry for
<tt>/var/lock</tt>. He said that a compromise might be to make the
directory writable by the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SystemGroups#Other_System_Groups:~:text=dialout%3A%20Full%20and%20direct%20access%20to%20serial%20ports">dialout</a>
group rather than world-writable. He also <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110980#10">mentioned</a>
that there was a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734086">previous
effort</a> in 2014 to modernize software that uses UUCP-style locks to
use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/flock.2.html"><tt>flock()</tt></a>
instead, but it stalled out.</p>

<h4>"Dead and severely outdated"</h4>

<p>Rather than temporarily reverting the behavior, systemd maintainer Luca
Boccassi <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110980#27">argued</a>
that a world-writable directory in <tt>/run</tt> is a security risk.
Any process could write as much as it wanted to <tt>/run</tt>, which
could effectively DoS the system by exhausting space or inodes;
filling up <tt>/run</tt> would then cause critical services, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev">udev</a>, to stop
working. The FHS, he said, is "<q>dead and severely outdated</q>".</p>

<p>The issue had already been <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/38563">discussed</a>
by the systemd project; Lennart Poettering had <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/38563#issuecomment-3242736658">responded</a>
that he did not see the point of <tt>/var/lock</tt> "<q>in the modern
world</q>", but distributions were free to do as they see fit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider this more a passing of the baton from upstream systemd to
downstreams: if your distro wants this kind of legacy interface, then
just add this via a distro-specific tmpfiles drop-in. But there's no
point really in forcing anyone who has a more forward-looking view of
the world to still carry that dir.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poettering argued that distributions could make their own choices,
though it made him shudder to think of allowing unprivileged programs
to fill up a directory. Boccassi <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110980#27:~:text=I%20certainly%20won%27t%20try%20to%20stop%20anyone%20wishing%20to%20do%20it">echoed</a> that sentiment in his response
to the Debian systemd bug. Any package could ship a configuration for
<tt>tmpfiles.d</tt> to create the directory and assume responsibility
for it as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I certainly won't try to stop anyone wishing to do it, but also I
do not wish for these old workarounds to ship in this package
either.</p>

<p>There's ~2 years time until Forky ships, and that should be plenty of time
to either add this workaround elsewhere, or fix remaining programs to
use BSD locks, or both, so I'm not going to hold back the new version
from testing for this niche case, sorry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boccassi closed the bug with the "WONTFIX" tag.</p>

<h4>Debian Policy</h4>

<p>On September&nbsp;1, d'Itri <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110980#38">responded</a>
that upstream systemd's opinion was not relevant in this case. Debian
policy requires the directory for lock files of serial devices, though
he had also opened a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1111839">bug</a>
to revisit that, since the practice of using <tt>/var/lock</tt> for
serial-device locks dates back to the 1980s. However,
<tt>/var/lock</tt> is provided by systemd, so he reasoned that it is a
systemd bug unless another package was identified to take ownership of
creating the directory. "<q>But you cannot just decide that the policy
violation does not exist.</q>"</p>

<p>Thorsten Alteholz opened a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1115317">bug</a>
with Debian's Technical Committee on September&nbsp;15. He asked for
advice on how to proceed since the systemd bug had been marked
WONTFIX.</p>

<blockquote>
So what do you recommend how to go on from here? Change Debian policy
(as asked in #1111839), revert the change in systemd, find a Debian
wide solution or let every package maintainer implement their own
solution?
</blockquote>

<p>Bdale Garbee <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1115317#10">weighed
in</a> on the bug as well. He said that he uses <tt>cu</tt> "<q>almost
constantly for interacting with embedded serial consoles on devices a
USB connection away from my laptop</q>". He was frustrated with the
change imposed by systemd "<q>with no warning</q>", and looked forward
to the TC's response.</p>

<p>On September&nbsp;24, Matthew Vernon <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1115317#20">responded</a>
to the bug, with a CC to the systemd maintainer alias. He said that it
seemed that Debian Policy required FHS compliance, "<q>at least until
we come up with a transition plan</q>", and asked if systemd would
please revert the change. There was no response from any of the
systemd maintainers.</p>

<h4>Override</h4>

<p>Vernon <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1115317#30">updated</a>
the bug on September&nbsp;29, and said that the TC had discussed the
situation at its last meeting. The conclusion was that systemd should
comply with policy, and thus FHS. He included a draft ballot text that
the TC would vote on, which noted that the committee was
"<q>sympathetic</q>" to the argument that <tt>flock()</tt> would be a
better solution, but that "<q>an important part of the role of a 
Debian Developer is ensuring that software in Debian complies with 
Debian Policy</q>". A final <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1115317#40">ballot</a>
for the committee to consider was posted on October&nbsp;2.</p>

<p>The ballot contained three options; all three required that the
systemd package provide <tt>/var/lock</tt> "<q>with
relaxed enough permissions that existing Debian software that uses
/var/lock for system-wide locks of serial devices (and similar
purposes) works again</q>". The committee would exercise its power
under the Debian Constitution to override the systemd maintainers.
The options were:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) This change to systemd must persist until a satisfactory migration
of impacted software has occurred and Policy updated accordingly.</p>

<p>2) This change to systemd must persist until Policy has been updated
to allow otherwise.</p>

<p>3) This change to systemd must persist until the TC allows otherwise,
which the TC expects to do once a suitable transition plan has been
agreed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vernon <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1115317#75">replied</a>
on October&nbsp;6 to say that a decision had been reached and that
option one had won.</p>

<h4>Unlocking</h4>

<p>Debian's continued use of UUCP-style locking does seem to be more
than a little bit dated. The FHS&nbsp;3.0 is clearly reaching the end
of its useful life, if not actually expired.</p>

<p>As a comparison, Fedora's <a href="https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/uucp/uucp/"><tt>uucp</tt></a>
package has a <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/uucp/blob/rawhide/f/uucp-1.07-lockdev.patch">patch</a>
to use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/lockdev"><tt>lockdev</tt></a>
instead. The upcoming Fedora&nbsp;43 release includes systemd v258,
and <tt>/run/lock</tt> is not world-writable. It seems like 
Debian could borrow Fedora's approach
for the <tt>uucp</tt> package, though that would not solve the problem
for any other Debian packages affected by the <tt>/run/lock</tt>
change. There is also third-party software to consider, of course.</p>

<p>To date, Boccassi has not responded to the conversation; I emailed
d'Itri to ask why he did not make the change himself, since he was
aware of the bug. He replied on October&nbsp;13 and said that 
"<q>a maintainer cannot force a decision on another maintainer</q>."
Since he and Boccassi disagreed about the change it was left to the TC
to decide. He said that he planned to prepare a merge request to
implement the TC's decision, "<q>as I have already agreed with
Luca</q>", within the week.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>We normally think of interstellar flight in terms of reaching a single target. The usual destination is one of the Alpha Centauri stars, and because we know of a terrestrial-mass planet there, Proxima Centauri emerges as the best candidate. I don’t recall Proxima ever being named as the destination Breakthrough Starshot officially had in mind, but there is such a distance between it (4.2 light years) and the next target, Barnard’s Star at some 5.96 light years, that it seems evident we will give the nod to Proxima. If, that is, we decide to go interstellar.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget, though, that if we build a beaming infrastructure either on Earth or in space that can accelerate a sail to a significant percentage of lightspeed, we can use it again and again. That means many possible targets. I like the idea of exploring other possibilities, which is why Cosimo Bambi’s ideas on black holes interest me. Associated with Fudan University in Shanghai as well as New Uzbekistan University in Tashkent, Bambi has been thinking about the proliferation of black holes in the galaxy, and the nearest one to us. I’ve been pondering his notions ever since reading about them last August.</p>
<p>Black holes are obviously hard to find as we scale down to solar mass objects, and right now the closest one to us is GAIA-BH1, some 1560 light years out. But reading Bambi’s most recent paper, I see that one estimate of the number of stellar mass black holes in our galaxy is 1.4 X 10<sup>9</sup>. Bambi uses this number, but as we might expect, estimates vary widely, from 10 million to 1 billion. These numbers are extrapolated from the population of massive stars and to a very limited extent on clues from observational astronomy.</p>

<p><strong>Image:</strong> The first image of Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. Given how hard it was to achieve this image, can we find ways to locate far smaller solar-mass black holes, and possibly send a mission to one? Credit: Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration.</p>
<p>Bambi calculates a population of 1 black hole and 10 white dwarfs for every 100 stars in the general population. If he’s anywhere close to right, a black hole might well exist within 20 to 25 light years, conceivably detected in future observations by its effects upon the orbital motion of a companion star, assuming we are so lucky as to find a black hole in a binary system. The aforementioned GAIA-BH1 is in such a system, orbiting a companion star.</p>
<p>Most black holes, though, are thought to be isolated. One black hole (OGLE-2011-BLG-0462) has been detected through microlensing, and perhaps LIGO A+, the upgrade to the two LIGO facilities in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana, can help us find more as we increase our skills at detecting gravitational waves. There are other options as well, as Bambi notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Murchikova &amp; Sahu (2025) proposed to use observational facilities like the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), the Atacama Large Millimiter/Submillimiter Array (ALMA), and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Isolated black holes moving through the interstellar medium can accrete from the interstellar medium itself and such an accretion process produces electromagnetic radiation. Murchikova &amp; Sahu (2025) showed that current observational facilities can already detect the radiation from isolated black holes in the warm medium of the Local Interstellar Cloud within 50 pc of Earth, but their identification as accreting black holes is challenging and requires multi-telescope observations.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we do find a black hole out there at, say, 10 light years, we now have a target for future beamed sailcraft that offers an entirely different mission concept. We’re now probing not simply an unknown planet, but an astrophysical object so bizarre that observing its effects on spacetime will be a primary task. Sending two nanocraft, one could observe the other as it approaches the black hole. A signal sent from one to the other will be affected by the spacetime metric – the ‘geometry’ of spacetime – which would give us information about the Kerr solution to the phenomenon. The latter assumes a rotating black hole, whereas other solutions, like that of Schwarzschild, describe a non-rotating black hole.</p>
<p>Also intriguing is Bambi’s notion of testing fundamental constants. Does atomic physics change in gravitational fields this strong? There have been some papers exploring possible variations in fundamental constants over time, but little by way of observation studying gravitational fields much stronger than white dwarf surfaces. Two nanocraft in the vicinity of a black hole may offer a way to emit photons whose energies can probe the nature of the fine structure constant. The latter sets the interactions between elementary charged particles. </p>
<p>For that matter, is a black hole inevitably possessed of an event horizon, or is it best described as an ‘horizonless compact object’ (Bambi’s term)?</p>
<blockquote><p>In the presence of an event horizon, the signal from nanocraft B should be more and more redshifted (formally without disappearing, as an observer should never see a test-particle crossing the event horizon in a finite time, but, in practice, at some point the signal leaves the sensitivity band of the receiver on nanocraft A). If the compact object is a Kerr black hole, we can make clear predictions on the temporal evolution of the signal emitted by nanocraft B. If the compact object is a fuzzball [a bound state without event horizon], the temporal evolution of the signal should be different and presumably stop instantly when nanocraft B is converted into fuzzball degrees of freedom.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are so many things to learn about black holes that it is difficult to know where to begin, and I suspect that if many of our space probes have returned surprising results (think of the remarkable ‘heart’ on Pluto), a mission to a black hole would uncover mysteries and pose questions we have yet to ask. What an intriguing idea, and to my knowledge, no one else has made the point that if we ever reach the level of launching a mission to Proxima Centauri, we should be capable of engineering the same sort of flyby of a nearby black hole.</p>
<p>And on the matter of small black holes, be aware of a just released paper examining the role of dark matter in their formation. This one considers black holes on a much smaller scale, possibly making the chances of finding a nearby one that much greater. Let me quote the abstract (the italics are mine). The citation is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Exoplanets, with their large volumes and low temperatures, are ideal celestial detectors for probing dark matter (DM) interactions. DM particles can lose energy through scattering with the planetary interior and become gravitationally captured if their interaction with the visible sector is sufficiently strong. <em>In the absence of annihilation, the captured DM thermalizes and accumulates at the planet’s center, eventually collapsing into black holes (BHs). Using gaseous exoplanets as an example, we demonstrate that BH formation can occur within an observable timescale for superheavy DM with masses greater than 10<sup>6</sup> GeV and nuclear scattering cross sections. The BHs may either accrete the planetary medium or evaporate via Hawking radiation, depending on the mass of the DM that formed them.</em> We explore the possibility of periodic BH formation within the unconstrained DM parameter space and discuss potential detection methods, including observations of planetary-mass objects, pulsed high-energy cosmic rays, and variations in exoplanet temperatures. Our findings suggest that future extensive exoplanet observations could provide complementary opportunities to terrestrial and cosmological searches for superheavy DM.</p></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Launched in June 2024, <a href="https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/jupytergis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JupyterGIS</a> was introduced as a collaborative, web-based GIS environment built on the JupyterLab framework. Its objective is to bring QGIS-inspired workflows into the browser, enabling real-time collaborative editing, seamless integration with notebooks, and support for core geospatial data formats.</p>
<p>When it was <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/real-time-collaboration-and-collaborative-editing-for-gis-workflows-with-jupyter-and-qgis-d25dbe2832a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first announced earlier this year</a>, JupyterGIS already delivered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time collaborative editing (Google Docs-style)</li>
<li>Visualisation of raster &amp; vector data</li>
<li>Symbology editing and spatio-temporal animations</li>
<li>Programmatic map control via a Python API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to contributions from the community and support from partner organizations, JupyterGIS has advanced significantly and now offers an expanded range of features for analysis, visualization, and collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>Enhanced vector tile capabilities</strong></p>
<p>Support for vector tiles has been strengthened, including full compatibility with the <em>pmtiles</em> format.</p>
<p>Other key updates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em>identify tool</em> that inspects vector tiles to display features and associated properties.</li>
<li>A <em>symbology panel</em> that applies graduated, categorized, and canonical symbology to vector tile layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>These improvements enhance the interpretability and styling of geospatial datasets directly in the browser.</p>

<p><strong>A new processing toolbox</strong></p>
<p>One of the most significant updates is a new browser-based processing toolbox powered by a WebAssembly (WASM) build of the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL).</p>
<p>Available tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Buffer</em>: computes a buffer around geometries of a vector dataset.</li>
<li><em>Convex Hull</em>: calculates the convex hull for each feature of an input layer.</li>
<li><em>Dissolve</em>: combines features of vector layers into new features</li>
<li><em>Bounding Boxes</em>: calculates the bounding box for each feature in an input layer.</li>
<li><em>Centroid</em>: creates a new layer with the centroids of the geometries of an input layer.</li>
<li><em>Concave Hull</em>: computes the concave hull for each feature of an input point layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This toolbox has been designed for extensibility, with a JSON schema that allows additional GDAL operations to be integrated in a straightforward manner.</p>

<figure id="attachment_29262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-29262"><a href="https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-3.png"><img src="https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-3-667x400.png" alt="" width="667" height="400" srcset="https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-3-667x400.png 667w, https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-3-947x568.png 947w, https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-3-768x461.png 768w, https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-3-1536x922.png 1536w, https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-29262">Using the processing tool to compute the convex hulls of geometries.</figcaption></figure>


<p><strong>Symbology enhancements</strong></p>
<p>Visualization of geospatial data has become more flexible and expressive through several enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Viridis</em> is now the default colormap, providing perceptually uniform visualization.</li>
<li><em>Multiband symbology</em> is now available for GeoTIFFs.</li>
<li><em>Canonical symbology</em> defined in GeoJSON files can be applied automatically.</li>
<li><em>Colormaps</em> can now be <em>reversed</em>, allowing greater flexibility for data interpretation and visualization.</li>
<li>In the case of <em>point layers</em>, color and marker size can be styled independently, and bound to different data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Integration with SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)</strong></p>
<p>A SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) browser is now embedded into JupyterGIS, streamlining access to different data collections. Users can select specific platforms and sensors, choose data products and processing levels, and set temporal and spatial constraints.</p>
<p>It is now possible to search across multiple datasets simultaneously. Users can click on any result to add it directly as a layer to their JupyterGIS project. This creates a seamless workflow from data discovery to visualization, making it easier for researchers and analysts to find and integrate relevant satellite imagery and geospatial datasets into their Jupyter notebooks.</p>
<p>Currently, the STAC Browser only supports the Geodes STAC API but support for all STAC catalogs is under way.</p>

<figure id="attachment_29264" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-29264"><a href="https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-5.png"><img src="https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-5-667x400.png" alt="" width="667" height="400" srcset="https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-5-667x400.png 667w, https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-5-947x568.png 947w, https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-5-768x461.png 768w, https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-5.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-29264">Browsing a STAC access catalog from JupyterGIS.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Support for more data types</strong></p>
<p>The range of supported geospatial data formats is now broadened with <em>GeoParquet</em> and <em>PMTiles</em><strong>, </strong>enabling efficient columnar storage and fast analytical queries for GeoParquet, and highly compact, streaming-friendly vector tile delivery for PMTiles.</p>

<p><strong>User experience and interface improvements</strong></p>
<p>The interface has been refined for a smoother workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Integrated control panels</em> (layer list, filters, layer properties, etc.), reducing back and forth between the JupyterLab side-panels and the JupyterGIS UI. It also improves the “single document” scenario, allowing it to interact with JupyterGIS controls when opening a GIS document from the classic Jupyter Notebook UI.</li>
<li>An improved <em>toolbar design</em>, with cleaner icons and better usability.</li>
<li>A new feature to center the map on your <em>current location</em>.</li>
<li><em>Map annotations</em> now link to the map: clicking an annotation automatically re-centers and zooms to the location.</li>
<li><em>Full-screen</em> mode support.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Legends for vector layers</strong></p>
<p>JupyterGIS now automatically generates legends for vector layers, ensuring consistent interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legends are dynamically updated to reflect current symbology.</li>
<li>Customizations such as reversed colormaps are preserved.</li>
</ul>

<p>An extension for JupyterGIS enables the creation of JupyterGIS layers from <em>xarray variables</em> in Jupyter kernels, with support for lazy evaluation, bridging geospatial workflows with powerful array-based computation.</p>
<p>The package, called JupyterGIS-tiler, is available in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis-tiler">here</a> and can be installed from PyPI with <em>pip install jupytergis-tiler</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p>
<p>Development will continue to expand JupyterGIS in several directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extension of the GDAL-based processing toolbox.</li>
<li>Deeper integration with QGIS and a richer Python API for automation.</li>
<li>A Story Maps Editor and Viewer to enable interactive communication of geospatial information through text, imagery, and maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to try JupyterGIS directly in your browser with <a href="https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/lab/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JupyterLite</a>, no installation required.</p>
<p>Opportunities for engagement also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking out <a href="https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> for tutorials and the Python API.</li>
<li>Discussions via the <a href="https://geojupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoJupyter Zulip channel</a> or the bi-weekly GeoJupyter hackathon.</li>
<li>Contributions to the development <a href="https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The JupyterGIS community continues to grow, and active participation from researchers, developers, and educators worldwide is encouraged.</p>

Now, thanks to a recent update from Valve, the latter is in a downward spiral, having lost 25% of its value — or $1.75 billion — overnight.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><p>First, some context. <em>Counter-Strike</em> is a free-to-play multiplayer shooter. As with most other F2P games, it generates revenue from selling cosmetics. They arrive in lootbox-like Cases, which are opened by Keys purchased with real-world currency. They can also be obtained through trading with other players and purchasing from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=730" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Community Market</a>. Beyond Steam, unofficial third-party marketplaces for CS cosmetics have also popped up as channels for buying and selling items.</p>    <p>Because items are obtained at random through opening Cases, rarer items fetch the highest value on the open marketplaces. Items of lower-rarity tiers can also be traded in at volume for an item of a higher tier via trade up contracts. Previously, Knives and Gloves could not be obtained through trade up contracts, exponentially increasing their value as highly sought-after items. Prior to the most recent update, some Knives, like a <a href="https://csfloat.com/item/844203115195532537" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Doppler Ruby Butterfly Knife</a>, could fetch around $20,000 on third-party storefronts like CSFloat.</p>    <p>Following <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662004" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Valve's Oct. 22 update to <em>Counter-Strike</em></a>, the second-highest-tier, Covert (Red), can now be traded up and turned into Knives and Gloves. Essentially, this means that a previously extremely rare and highly sought-after cosmetic is going to be much more obtainable for those who increasingly want it, reducing the value of Knives and Gloves on the open marketplace.</p>    <p>And this is where the market descends into a freefall. Now, that Butterfly Knife mentioned above? It's going for around $12,000, as people are essentially dumping their stock, with 15 sold over the past 16 hours at the time of this writing.</p>    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/market-for-counter-strike-items-falls-1-75-billion-overnight" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reported the market for <em>Counter-Strike</em> cosmetic items dropped 25% overnight from Wednesday evening into Thursday morning. It's lost about $1.84 billion in value, according to <a href="https://x.com/pricempire/status/1981381483764834476" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pricempire</a>, which tracks and analyses the market for CS items. "This completely changes the supply of Counter-Strike’s most sought-after and expensive tier of items," Pricempire marketing manager Ethan MacDonald told Bloomberg.</p>    <p>As sellers attempt to recoup their investments, similar fire sales like the one happening at CSFloat are occurring at other sites. One such site, <a href="https://skinport.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Skin Port</a>, even put us in a waiting room to access it; traffic was overwhelming its servers.</p>    <p>Just like how NFT or cryptocurrency values can drastically shift, <em>Counter-Strike</em> item traders are seeing their stock rapidly change in value, and not for the best. While some items of lower-rarity tiers have gone up in value, and Reds might see a bump now that they can be traded up into Knives and Gloves, that can't make up for the sudden drop at the top of the cosmetics market.</p>    <p>We'll have to wait and see if the market levels out or if it continues to crash. Plenty of players and CS traders must be eagerly awaiting more news: As of this writing, <a href="https://x.com/pricempire/status/1981390097204302098" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pricempire's servers had crashed</a>.</p>    </div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">For releasing packages we are using <a href="https://github.com/changesets/changesets">changesets</a> in combination with the <a href="https://github.com/changesets/action">changeset Github action</a>. The rough idea is:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>create PRs for new features, updates and fixes (with a changeset if relevant for changelog)</li>
<li>merge into main</li>
<li>changset creates a PR that bumps all packages based on the changesets</li>
<li>merge changeset PR if you want to release to Github and npm</li>
