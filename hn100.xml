<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Zusammenfassung</h2><p>We introduce Meta 3D Gen (3DGen), a new state-of-the-art, fast pipeline for text-to-3D asset generation. 3DGen offers 3D asset creation with high prompt fidelity and high-quality 3D shapes
and textures in under a minute. It supports physically-based rendering (PBR), necessary for 3D asset relighting in real-world applications. Additionally, 3DGen supports generative retexturing of previously generated (or artist-created) 3D shapes using additional textual inputs provided by the user. 3DGen integrates key technical components, Meta 3D AssetGen and Meta 3D TextureGen, that we developed for text-to-3D and text-to-texture generation, respectively. By combining their strengths, 3DGen represents 3D objects simultaneously in three ways: in view space, in volumetric space, and in UV (or texture) space. The integration of these two techniques achieves a win rate of
68% with respect to the single-stage model. We compare 3DGen to numerous industry baselines, and show that it outperforms them in terms of prompt fidelity and visual quality for complex textual prompts, while being significantly faster.</p><a role="button" href="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/449707112_509645168082163_2193712134508658234_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=3c67a6&amp;_nc_ohc=5bSbn3KaluAQ7kNvgHdZ399&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;gid=AXBASXz1KO8tg3z1y-Ars0j&amp;oh=00_AYCt-8K376OTlrWw8mqkXdaNoo4nF8ugEL3fZyLp9Kc7oQ&amp;oe=668A1851" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;button&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;button&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;button&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;button&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><p>Download the Paper</p></a></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One memorable encounter occurred while Ligocki was visiting Germany the summer after his sophomore year, when he took a side trip to Berlin to meet up with Marxen. “We got through the language barrier through the medium of busy beavers,” he said. The medium of beer also helped. Ligocki ended up having too many and missed his train back to Hamburg.</p>
<p>The busy beaver bug stuck with Ligocki throughout college, but when he graduated and found a job, life got in the way. He returned to the hunt from time to time, but never for long. In early 2022, he set up an <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss">online discussion group</a> to help researchers stay in touch. Then in May, Stérin discovered the mailing list and sent an invitation to join the Busy Beaver Challenge. Ligocki needed no convincing.</p>

<p>One of his first contributions to the project was reviving a technique invented by Marxen, which they’d discussed in that Berlin pub 16 years earlier. Called the “closed tape language method,” it was a new way to identify patterns on a Turing machine’s tape that indicate it will never halt. This is the basic strategy behind programs that identify loopers and many other species of non-halting machines, but the closed tape language method had the potential to identify a much broader class of patterns using a unified mathematical framework.</p>
<p>Ligocki wrote a <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/06/10/ctl.html">blog post</a> introducing his new collaborators to the technique, but even though the theoretical idea was very general, he didn’t know how to write a program that would cover all the cases. Blanchard figured out how to do that shortly after joining the project in the fall, but his program was relatively slow. Then two other contributors found ways to make it run much faster. Within the span of a few months, the closed tape language technique had gone from a promising idea to one of their <a href="https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/decider-finite-automata-reduction/123">most powerful tools</a>. It could even handle 10 of Georgiev’s 43 holdouts, nicknamed <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/skelet">Skelet machines</a> in his honor.</p>
<p>“This thing would never have existed with any one person contributing,” Ligocki said.</p>
<h2><strong>A Monster Approaches</strong></h2>
<p>As the months passed, new contributors discovered the Busy Beaver Challenge and began chipping away at different parts of the problem. But many machines remained unsolved, and two developed especially fearsome reputations.</p>
<p>The first was <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/1LC1LE_---1LD_1RD0LD_1LA1RE_0LB0RC">Skelet #1</a>, which kept alternating between phases of predictable and chaotic behavior. Then in March 2023, Ligocki and Pavel Kropitz — a Slovakian contributor who doesn’t speak English and communicates with the rest of the team using Google Translate — developed a series of ideas that finally <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2023/03/13/skelet-1-infinite.html">cracked it open</a>. Using a souped-up version of Marxen and Buntrock’s 30-year-old accelerated simulation technique, they discovered that the tug-of-war between order and chaos did end, but only after more than a trillion trillion steps. Then it finally settled into a repeating cycle that was itself unusually long. Practically all infinite loops begin repeating within 1,000 steps; Skelet #1’s was more than 8 billion steps long.</p>
<p>“Who ordered that?” Blanchard said. “Where did that come from? Why is it here?”</p>

<p>The machine’s behavior was so strange, and the proof combined so many different ideas, that for nearly five months Ligocki wasn’t sure of the result. That period of uncertainty was dispelled by a new contributor — a 21-year-old self-taught programmer named <a href="https://github.com/meithecatte">Maja Kądziołka</a>, who mostly goes by the single name mei.</p>
<p>Kądziołka grew up in Poland and attended the University of Warsaw for one semester in fall 2021 before dropping out — the rigidity of the curriculum and the move to remote instruction after a surge of Covid-19 cases didn’t fit well with their learning style. They worked at a software company for a little over a year but increasingly found the work draining, and began looking for something more intellectually stimulating. They found it in Coq, the software designed to encode and certify the validity of mathematical proofs.</p>

<p>The Busy Beaver Challenge contributors were already using computer programs in their proofs, but like paper-and-pencil proofs, computer programs are vulnerable to errors. In Coq proofs, the code won’t run unless every line logically follows from the preceding ones, making errors effectively impossible. To Kądziołka, figuring out how to craft these proofs began to feel like a game. “It’s almost addictive,” they said. “I started at a normal hour, and then it was night. Then it was morning.”</p>
<p>After learning Coq, Kądziołka began looking for an open problem to test it out. That’s when they found the Busy Beaver Challenge. A few weeks later, they’d <a href="https://github.com/meithecatte/busycoq">translated</a> several of the team’s proofs into Coq, including Ligocki and Kropitz’s proof that Skelet #1 never halts — Ligocki could finally be sure about it. Suddenly, an even higher standard of rigor than Stérin’s emphasis on reproducibility seemed possible. And it had all started with someone who had no formal training at all — an amateur mathematician.</p>
<p>“Let’s remember that means a lover of mathematics,” Moore said. “It is not a pejorative term.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Dam Breaks</strong></h2>
<p>Around the same time, a graduate student named <a href="http://chrisxudoesmath.com/">Chris Xu</a> made a breakthrough on the second monstrous machine — <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/1LB---_0RC1LE_0RD1RC_1LA1RB_0LB0LA">Skelet #17</a>. It was usually easy to summarize the behavior of even the most fiendish five-rule Turing machines once you figured out how they worked. “Then you encounter some bullshit like Skelet 17, and you go, ‘Nah, the universe is trolling us,’” Kądziołka said. Understanding Skelet #17 by studying the patterns on its tape was like deciphering a secret message wrapped in four layers of encryption: Cracking one code just revealed another totally unrelated code, and two more below that. Xu had to decipher all of them before he could finally prove that the machine never halted.</p>
<p><a href="http://chrisxudoesmath.com/papers/skelet17.pdf">Xu’s proof</a> was brilliant, but it involved some mathematical intuition that nobody knew how to formalize in the precise terms demanded by Coq. What’s more, the Busy Beaver Challenge’s work wasn’t done: While Skelet #1 and #17 were the two machines that had seemed most formidable, some others remained to be solved, and still more had only been solved using inefficient programs. That was no way to convince the world.</p>

<p>“We wanted to make sure that it was something reasonably reproducible,” Blanchard said, “and also not write a proof where we would say, ‘Step 63: Let this program run for six months.’”</p>
<p>Over the following months, the community slowly cobbled together proofs for the remaining machines, but most had yet to be translated into Coq. Then in April a <a href="https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/proving-bb-5-in-coq/225">mysterious new contributor</a> known only by the pseudonym mxdys came in to finish the job. Nobody on the team knows where mxdys is located or any other personal details about them. In a Discord direct message exchange, they mentioned a long-standing interest in mathematical games, but they declined to provide more information about their background.</p>
<p>On May 10, mxdys posted a characteristically succinct message to the Discord server: “The Coq proof of BB(5) is finished.” Stérin replied a minute later with a series of seven exclamation points. In a matter of weeks, mxdys had refined the community’s techniques and synthesized their results into a single <a href="https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5">40,000-line Coq proof</a>.</p>
<p>“This is not a thing that’s easy to formalize,” said <a href="https://yforster.de/">Yannick Forster</a>, a Coq expert at the French national research institute Inria who reviewed the proof. “I’m still positively shocked.”</p>
<p>The machine that Marxen and Buntrock had discovered over 30 years earlier, which halted after 47 million steps, really was the fifth busy beaver.</p>
<p>“These news are very exciting for me,” Georgiev wrote in an email. “I never expected that this problem would be solved in my time.”</p>
<p>But for another Busy Beaver pioneer, the news came too late. Allen Brady <a href="https://www.rgj.com/obituaries/pnvs0805561">died on April 21</a>, less than a month before the proof was finished. He was 90 years old.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Beavers Roam</strong></h2>
<p>The Busy Beaver Challenge contributors have begun to draft a formal academic paper describing their results, supplementing mxdys’ Coq proof with a human-readable one. That’ll take a while: Most machines were proved non-halting in multiple ways, and the team will need to decide how best to combine the results into a single proof.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, part of the team has moved on to the next beaver. But just four days ago, mxdys and another contributor known as Racheline discovered a barrier for BB(6) that seems insurmountable: a six-rule machine whose halting problem resembles a famously intractable math problem called the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-attempt-to-corner-the-collatz-conjecture-20200826/">Collatz conjecture</a>. Connections between Turing machines and the Collatz conjecture date back to a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01409968">1993 paper</a> by the mathematician <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/~pascal.michel/index.html">Pascal Michel</a>, but the newly discovered machine, dubbed “<a href="https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RA_0LC1LE_1LD1LC_1LA0LB_1LF1RE_---0RA&amp;status=undecided">Antihydra</a>,” is the smallest one that appears unsolvable without a conceptual breakthrough in mathematics. That adds an extra layer of significance to the BB(5) result.</p>
<p>“It’s conceivable that this is the last busy beaver number that we will ever know,” Aaronson said.</p>
<p>There are many variants of the original busy beaver problem, and some Busy Beaver Challenge contributors plan to keep working on these. But not everyone intends to continue this work. They each came to the project on their own, for their own reasons, and their journeys are beginning to diverge.</p>
<p>Stérin wants to develop software tools to facilitate collaborative online projects in other areas of mathematics. “The thing that BB challenge brought me is the deep, deep, deep conviction that it’s an extremely effective way of performing research,” he said. “It deserves to have a bigger stage.”</p>

<p>Kądziołka too is pulling back, after developing a fascination with the European international rail network. “I will probably come back to busy beaver things again at some point, but currently it’s not the thing on my mind,” they said. “I’m currently pursuing becoming a train driver.”</p>
<p>Ligocki thinks he’ll keep up his busy beaver hunting, but after 20 years of switching between bursts of intense activity and not thinking about beavers at all, he’s learned not to put too much stock in his predictions.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of like the halting problem,” he said. “You just never can quite tell what’s going to happen.”</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>What happened to the old version of Pretzel AI - the visual, in-browser data manipulation tool?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> It's available in the <a href="https://github.com/pretzelai/pretzelai/tree/main/pretzelai_visual"><code>pretzelai_visual</code> folder here</a>. Please see <a href="https://github.com/pretzelai/pretzelai/pull/76" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/pretzelai/pretzelai/pull/76/hovercard">this PR</a> for more info.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>What AI model does Pretzel use?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> Pretzel uses different AI models for various tasks:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Default model: GPT-4o</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Offers a good balance between speed and quality</li>
<li>Can be changed in Pretzel Settings if you're using your own API key</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Inline completions: <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/codestral/" rel="nofollow">Mistral's Codestral model</a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Excellent for code completion</li>
<li>Very fast performance (22B parameter model)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Fallback option:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If you're using your own API key without providing a Mistral API Key, Pretzel will use GPT-4o for inline completions as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">We're continuing to experiment with models and supporting local models and Anthropic's Claude is at the top of our list.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>What about feature X?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> There's a ton we want to build. Please <a href="https://github.com/pretzelai/pretzelai/issues">open an issue</a> and tell us what you want us to build!</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>Where's the roadmap?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> We have a rough roadmap at the top of this README. There are many features we'd like to build, but there's just two of us. So, we're collecting feedback about what would be most helpful. Please open an issue or just email us with your feedback! Based on what we find, we'll prioritize our roadmap.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>Why are you using the AGPL license? Or, why not use MIT/BSD3 licenses?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> Our goal with building Pretzel is to make an amazing data tool that is free for both individuals and companies to use. That said, we are a two-person startup - and we don't want some third party to just take our code and sell a hosted version of it without giving back to the community. Jupyter code is licensed as BSD-3 and if we keep our new code BSD-3 licensed, there would be no way to stop a third party from doing this. As a result, we went with the AGPLv3 license for all the new code. This ensures that if someone else does want to take our code and sell it (SaaS or otherwise), they have to open-source all of their modifications under AGPLv3 as well.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>Why a fork of Jupyter? Why not contribute into Jupyter directly?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> This deserves a longer answer but here's the short answer: We've set out to make the <strong>new</strong> de-facto, modern, open-source data tool. Initially, we wanted to start from scratch. However, after talking to several data professionals, we realized it will be very hard to get people to switch to a new tool, no matter how good. The best way to get people to switch is to not have them switch at all. That's why we decided to fork Jupyter - for the near zero switching costs. Also, Jupyter is a mature product, and we're shipping feature really fast - frankly, at the pace we're shipping features, the code we write won't be accepted into the Jupyter codebase 😅. There are also many downsides to this decision - we've had to spend considerable time understanding the whole Jupyter ecosystem and multiple codebases, the complex release processes, the various APIs etc. However, we think this is the right decision for us.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>My company is worried about using an AGPLv3 licensed tool. What can I do?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> The AGPL is a barrier ONLY IF you're modifying Pretzel AND redistributing it to the public. If you're simply using it as a tool in your company (even with modifications), the AGPL DOES NOT ask you to share your code. Still, if AGPL is an issue for you, please contact us, and we can figure out something that works.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>How are you planning on making money? OR, how are you free? I'm worried that you'll make this tool paid in the future.</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> We're planning on selling a hosted version of the tool to companies to make money. This hosted version will probably have some company specific features that individuals don't want or need such as data access controls, connectors for data sources, integration with GitHub, hosted and shareable dashboard, scalable and on-demand compute for large data jobs etc. We will not retroactively make Pretzel's individual version paid.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5812560/ladybird-web-browser-becomes-a-non-profit-with-1-million-from-github-founder">https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5812560/ladybird-web-browser-becomes-a-non-profit-with-1-million-from-github-founder</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40856791">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The original founder of GitHub (Chris Wanstrath) has partnered up with the founder of SerenityOS and the Ladybird web browser (Andreas Kling) to create "<a href="https://ladybird.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ladybird Browser Initiative</a>" -- a USA-based non-profit dedicated exclusively to building a brand new web browser.&nbsp; From scratch.</p><p>While many have claimed that developing a new web browser "from scratch" is an impossible goal, the founders of The Ladybird Browser Initiative believe they can do it.&nbsp; What's more, they are confident it can be done without taking <em>any</em> funding from corporate deals or advertising revenue.</p><p>Their goal?&nbsp; To have a fully functional "Alpha" version of the Ladybird browser ready sometime in 2026.</p><h3>Ladybird Funding</h3><p>Roughly one year ago, the Ladybird Browser received their first major sponsorship (<a href="https://awesomekling.substack.com/p/welcoming-shopify-as-a-ladybird-sponsor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100,000 from Shopify</a>).&nbsp; Now, with the creation of a 501(c)(3) non-profit (accompanied by a $1 Million dollar pledge from the GitHub founder), Ladybird is preparing to become the only major web browser which does not treat the user like the product being sold.</p><blockquote><p>"Today, every major browser engine is open source, which is wonderful, but there's still one issue: <strong>they're all funded by Google's advertising empire</strong>. Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, and Opera all use Google's Chromium. Apple receives billions to make Google the default search engine in Safari, and Firefox has a similar deal where they receive hundreds of millions each year.</p><p>The world needs a browser that puts people first, contributes to open standards using a brand new engine, and is <strong>free from advertising's influence</strong>."</p></blockquote><p>The fact that every major web browser engine is funded by advertising (specifically, via Google) is, indeed, a concern -- which makes the idea of a web browser free from that influence incredibly interesting.</p><p>But how, exactly, is Ladybird going to pull this off?</p><blockquote><p>"Unlike traditional business models that rely on monetizing the user, <strong>Ladybird is funded entirely by sponsorships and donations</strong> from companies and individuals who care about the open web. <strong>Our non-profit will not pursue corporate deals or revenue outside of unrestricted donations</strong>. The software and its source code will be available for free, forever."</p></blockquote><p>While it's easy to dismiss the notion of "funding a web browser via donations" as an unachievable, whimsical goal... Ladybird has already had some significant success in that area (not least of which, the $1 Million dollars from the GitHub founder), resulting in Ladybird already having 4 paid, full time developers (with 3 more programmers "starting soon").</p><p>So, maybe this approach is not as "unachievable" and "whimsical" as it first seems.</p><h3>No Corporate Control</h3><p>Also fascinating is this statement:</p><blockquote><p>"Our non-profit will not pursue corporate deals or revenue outside of unrestricted donations."</p></blockquote><p>What does that mean, in practice?</p><p>It means Ladybird won't be doing corporate deals for default search engines.&nbsp; Or marketing campaigns for other companies.&nbsp; This means that, if they can stick to their guns, Ladybird stands a real chance of a truly independent web browser... one which no company can control.</p><p>In fact the Ladybird Browser Initiative even has a policy specifically not allowing corporate donors to buy board seats:</p><blockquote><p>"All sponsorships are in the form of unrestricted donations. <strong>Board seats and other forms of influence are not for sale</strong>."</p></blockquote><p>This is a huge deal.&nbsp; Massive.</p><p>A problem many non-profit foundations face is corruption of their core mission via corporate control of their boards.&nbsp; There are many examples throughout the Open Source world of exactly this sort of problem (<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5116049/70-of-companies-on-the-linux-foundation-board-are-gpl-violators" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking at you, Linux Foundation</a>), and to see Ladybird recognize this problem -- and take action to prevent it -- right from the start?</p><p>Color me impressed.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-06-30/102127/102127_n7xyyap4c92jiob_custom.jpeg" alt=""></p><h3>The Current Status</h3><p>The first public "Alpha" release of Ladybird may be a ways out (slated for 2026), but the current development versions are already quite far along.</p><blockquote><p>"<strong>We can already do some of our daily browsing with Ladybird</strong>, like managing GitHub issues and pull requests, and commenting on Hacker News. The browser is improving every day, as our community of contributors are actively fixing bugs and adding features."</p></blockquote><p>Testing of a recent build of Ladybird confirmed that statement.&nbsp; Many websites function perfectly -- including some quite complex sites.&nbsp; While many other websites were... less than functional.&nbsp; Lots of work has clearly been done, with lots more left to do.</p><p>Can the development team improve Ladybird to a point where it will be usable, as a primary web browser, some time in next few years?&nbsp; Considering the progress to date... it seems entirely possible.</p><h3>"We won't be chasing buzzwords"</h3><p>The Lunduke Journal reached out to <a href="https://ladybird.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ladybird Browser Initiative's</a> co-Founder, Andreas Kling, with a burning question...</p><p>Now that the Ladybird web browser has an official nonprofit, with multiple full time developers working on it, you are clearly moving towards direct competition with the likes of Google and Mozilla. &nbsp;The eye of Sauron is upon you. &nbsp;How does that feel?</p><p>Kling's response:</p><blockquote><p>"Feels great! The web is one of humanity's greatest inventions, and it deserves diverse, competing implementations to truly thrive. The industry has been heading in a troubling direction for years, with companies like Microsoft and Opera abandoning their own browser engines in favor of Chromium.</p><p>We obviously don't have the resources of companies like Google, Apple, and Mozilla, so <strong>things will take some time</strong>. However, I'm extremely optimistic about the road ahead. We have a fantastic community of developers working on Ladybird, and we're making solid, consistent progress.</p><p>One thing we have going for us is focus. <strong>Unlike the major players, we're *completely* focused on one thing only: the web browser</strong>.</p><p><strong>We won't be chasing buzzwords or looking for alternative revenue streams</strong>. Our goal is to build a good browser and give it away for free, while soliciting nothing but unrestricted donations from anyone who likes what we're doing."</p></blockquote><p>There's a lot here to be excited about.</p><ul><li>No chasing buzzwords.</li><li>No alternative revenue streams.</li><li>Total focus on the web browser.</li><li>A brand new, from scratch browser engine.</li><li>No advertising or Big Tech influence.</li><li>A rag-tag team of rebels going, toe to toe, with the Big Tech web browser makers.</li></ul><p>While, according to the Ladybird team, they are a ways off from a major public release... it's hard not to feel a bit optimistic about what this could mean for the future of web browsing.&nbsp; This may be early days still, but the possibilities are tantalizing.</p><p>The Lunduke Journal is rooting for you, Ladybird.</p><div>

The best hypotheses I could find were:</p><ul><li><p>It’s the farthest region from Spain, so the least communicated to the rest of the empire, and hence the one that drifted the most from the homeland.</p></li><li><p>It’s extremely isolated by the Andes, the ocean in the west, the ice in the south, and the desert in the north, making its connection even to Argentina, Bolivia or Peru really hard.</p></li><li><p>It didn’t have silver mines, or a climate for sugar or tobacco farming, so it wasn’t a particularly valuable place to exploit, and remained secondary in the empire, getting fewer visitors from other parts of the empire, and drifting further apart.</p></li><li><p>It has strong influences from other regions, such as German, Italian, or even Basque.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>But why is no other country as long?</p><p>You need:</p><ul><li><p>A sandwich between sea and continent</p></li><li><p>Oriented north-south, so that it changes climates quickly&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Far enough from the equator so that the north-south climate does change fast, and so that it’s not too densely populated.</p></li></ul><p>The sandwich requires an oceanic plate subducting under a continental plate, which only happens here:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

              <p>
                Ladybird is a brand-new browser &amp; web engine. Driven by a
                web standards first approach, Ladybird aims to render the
                modern web with good performance, stability and security.
              </p>
              <p>
                From its humble beginnings as an HTML viewer for the SerenityOS
                hobby operating system project, Ladybird has since grown into a
                cross-platform browser supporting Linux, macOS, and other
                Unix-like systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ladybird is currently in heavy development. We are targeting a
                first Alpha release for early adopters in 2026.

                  We are targeting Summer 2026 for a first Alpha version on
                  Linux and macOS. This will be aimed at developers and early

                  We currently have 4 paid full-time engineers working on
                  Ladybird. There is also a large community of volunteer contributors.

                  We have 3 new full-time engineers starting soon. Going
                  forward, we would like to grow the team at a reasonable pace.
                  Building the right team is more important than building it
                  quickly.
                </p>
              </div>

            <div><p>
                  The focus of the Ladybird project is to build a new browser
                  engine from the ground up. We don't use code from Blink,
                  WebKit, Gecko, or any other browser engine.
                  </p><p>
                  For historical reasons, the browser uses various libraries
                  from the SerenityOS project, which has a strong culture of
                  writing <i>everything</i> from scratch.
                  Now that Ladybird has forked from SerenityOS, it is no longer
                  bound by this culture, and we will be making use of 3rd party
                  libraries for common functionality (e.g image/audio/video formats,
                  encryption, graphics, etc.)
                  </p><p>
                  We are already using some of the same 3rd party libraries
                  that other browsers use, but we will never adopt another
                  browser engine instead of building our own.
                </p></div>

            <div><p>
                  We don't have anyone actively working on Windows support, and
                  there are considerable changes required to make it work well
                  outside a Unix-like environment.
                  </p><p>
                  We would like to do Windows eventually, but it's not a priority
                  at the moment.
                </p></div>

            <div><p>
                  We don't have anyone actively working on an Android or iOS port.
                  More effort will be put into mobile once we have the desktop versions in a good state.
                  </p><p>
                  While there is the start of an Android port in the project repository,
                  mobile is not a priority at the moment.

                  Ladybird started as a component of the SerenityOS hobby project, which only allows C++.
                  The choice of language was not so much a technical decision, but more one of personal convenience.
                  Andreas was most comfortable with C++ when creating SerenityOS, and now we have almost half
                  a million lines of modern C++ to maintain.
                  </p><p>
                  However, now that Ladybird has forked and become its own independent project,
                  all constraints previously imposed by SerenityOS are no longer in effect.
                  We are actively evaluating a number of alternatives and will
                  be adding a mature successor language to the project in the near future.
                  This process is already quite far along, and prototypes exist in
                  multiple languages.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">diff-pdf is a tool for visually comparing two PDFs.</p>
<p dir="auto">It takes two PDF files as arguments. By default, its only output is its return
code, which is 0 if there are no differences and 1 if the two PDFs differ. If
given the <code>--output-diff</code> option, it produces a PDF file with visually
highlighted differences:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ diff-pdf --output-diff=diff.pdf a.pdf b.pdf"><pre><code>$ diff-pdf --output-diff=diff.pdf a.pdf b.pdf
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Another option is to compare the two files visually in a simple GUI, using
the <code>--view</code> argument:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ diff-pdf --view a.pdf b.pdf"><pre><code>$ diff-pdf --view a.pdf b.pdf
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This opens a window that lets you view the files' pages and zoom in on details.
It is also possible to shift the two pages relatively to each other using
Ctrl-arrows (Cmd-arrows on MacOS). This is useful for identifying translation-only differences.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the output of <code>$ diff-pdf --help</code> for complete list of options.</p>

<p dir="auto">Precompiled version of the tool for Windows is available as part of
<a href="https://github.com/vslavik/diff-pdf/releases/latest/">the latest release</a>
as a ZIP archive, which contains everything you need to run diff-pdf. It will
work from any place you unpack it to.</p>

<p dir="auto">The build system uses Automake and so a Unix or Unix-like environment (Cygwin
or MSYS) is required. Compilation is done in the usual way:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install"><pre><code>$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">(Note that the first step, running the <code>./bootstrap</code> script, is only required
when building sources checked from version control system, i.e. when <code>configure</code>
and <code>Makefile.in</code> files are missing.)</p>
<p dir="auto">As for dependencies, diff-pdf requires the following libraries:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>wxWidgets &gt;= 3.0</li>
<li>Cairo &gt;= 1.4</li>
<li>Poppler &gt;= 0.10</li>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">First of all, you will need working MinGW installation with MSYS2 environment

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Once installed, launch the MSYS2 MinGW shell. It will open a terminal window;
type <code>cd /c/directory/with/diff-pdf</code> to go to the directory with diff-pdf
sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You will need to install additional MSYS components that are not normally

<p>Hi, I am sorrycc, one of the main maintainers of Mako, and also the creator of Umi, Dva, Father, and other libraries. I am thrilled to announce that Mako is finally open source, the Github url is <a href="https://github.com/umijs/mako/">https://github.com/umijs/mako/</a> , and I’m excited to formally introduce it to you today.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-mako%3F" tabindex="-1">What is Mako? <a href="#what-is-mako%3F">
          
        </a></h2>
<img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01dvFN0j1e2rYBJpJGJ_!!6000000003814-2-tps-2048-2048.png_240x240.jpg" width="120" height="120">
<p>Mako is an “extremely fast” and “production-grade” front-end build tool, based on Rust.</p>
<p>The “extremely fast” aspect was our initial motivation for starting the Mako project. Without build speed issues, Mako would not have been necessary. Refer to the Benchmark section below for some data, and we are constantly exploring even faster build speed solutions. The “production-grade” label comes from the fact that since 2023.11.24, Mako has been officially released internally at Ant Group. It has been validated with engineering practices on thousands of projects and all used npm packages and their versions. It has been implemented in hundreds of projects, serving various platforms and business scenarios internally, including management backends, mini-programs, H5 mobile, low-code, marketing, component libraries, component packaging, Serverless Functions, etc., demonstrating fully production-grade capabilities.</p>
<p>You can visit <a href="https://makojs.dev/docs/features">https://makojs.dev/docs/features</a> to learn more about Mako’s features.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-mako-come-about%3F" tabindex="-1">How did Mako come about? <a href="#how-did-mako-come-about%3F">
          
        </a></h2>
<p>Last year (2023.3), our team launched 3 projects, Rust, SSR, and AIG, and we took on the Rust direction to tackle build performance issues. Our team has been exploring faster build speed solutions, including <a href="https://umijs.org/blog/mfsu-faster-than-vite">MFSU</a>, which optimizes build speed within Webpack. However, this had certain limitations. We sought a thorough solution through Rust.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01GDA0FY1mgixV0oGkA_!!6000000004984-2-tps-2772-1330.png_1200x1200.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You might wonder why we didn’t use existing Rust tools but decided to create one ourselves. The reasons are complex. For instance, 1) the maturity level of community libraries and their compatibility with Ant’s needs, we researched all the community Rust build solutions before starting, ultimately deciding on creating our own, 2) having control, due to business reasons, build tools at Ant require a lot of customization, and this proved true as we found many matching needs after internal release, 3) the modern meta-frameworks require compilation-time frameworks, in addition to build, they also have a lot of compilation needs, especially in SSR &amp; RSC scenarios, for example, RSC scenarios required 4 builds internally, 4) the need to learn Rust and for team growth, modern frontend tools are all written in Rust, and we would fall behind if we did not advance.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN012T9Nlo1WVFBDT64dK_!!6000000002793-2-tps-2090-854.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The timeline above is for Mako. Mako kicked off in 2023.3, had its first usable version by 2023.7, was internally released at Ant in 2023.11, and was open-sourced by 2024.6. We initially had 3 members with zero Rust experience, with team members, especially the virtual team, coming and going, learning Rust while digesting build knowledge and working on Mako was challenging, but fortunately, we succeeded and learned a lot in the process. We would like to thank the pioneers in the build domain like Webpack, Farm, and Rspack, as well as ChatGPT.</p>
<h2 id="speed" tabindex="-1">Speed <a href="#speed">
          
        </a></h2>
<p>Mako has put a lot of effort into speed. Below is some Benchmark data.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/O1CN01Ibymuk1xrDoNp2jBg_!!6000000006496-2-tps-2018-340.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Benchmark ran on a project that Turbopack also tests, on a Mac Book Pro M2 Max. It includes dimensions such as dev cold start time, root node and leaf node HMR time, production Build build time, and JS bundle size. (Note: Farm was not tried successfully using API mode, so no HMR data was generated; RsBuild had some issues upgrading to 0.7, so it’s still on 0.6 for now. RsBuild 0.7 might be a bit faster.)</p>
<p>If you’re interested, feel free to clone the repository and try it out yourself.</p>

<p>Here’s how we compare to our previous selves.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01UkKwZd1nsv7biyZKf_!!6000000005146-1-tps-825-365.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>For Ant Design Pro full project build, Webpack takes 16s, Mako takes 3.9s, a 4x speed improvement.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN0180np4N1oZyLr5911c_!!6000000005240-1-tps-1340-610.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>For Ant Design Pro full project build, Mako is almost always real-time hot updates.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01LpdES21tqWkFN9mCg_!!6000000005953-1-tps-960-540.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Intranet Hybrid framework Smallfish project build, based on RSC (React Server Components), scaffold project, build time reduced from 36.7s to 1.2s. It looks a bit exaggerated, but these are real data.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01L1HteO1uPKqayzb0u_!!6000000006029-2-tps-1538-494.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These are more examples of speed improvements on such RSC projects.</p>

<p>Additionally, Mako also has an experimental SSU feature, similar to the previous MFSU implementation, which does packaging and caching of dependencies. Depending on the ratio of source code to dependencies, it can achieve a 10-50x speed boost in Dev hot start-up. Currently, it can be enabled with the <code>SSU=true</code> environment variable.</p>

I had no idea what to do. I spent days just looking around, poking at the <code>switch_root</code> source code, all for naught. Until I remembered a link <a href="https://a.exozy.me/">Anthony</a> had sent me: <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/226872/how-to-shrink-root-filesystem-without-booting-a-livecd/227318#227318">How to shrink root filesystem without booting a livecd</a>.

pivot_root: failed to change root from `.' to `oldroot': Invalid argument</code></pre><p>Apparently, <code>pivot_root</code> is <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/455224">not allowed</a> to pivot roots if the root being switched is in the initramfs. Unfortunate. The Stack Exchange answer tells me to use <code>switch_root</code>, which doesn't work either. However, part of that answer sticks out to me:</p><blockquote><p>initramfs is rootfs: you can neither pivot_root rootfs, nor unmount it. Instead delete everything out of rootfs to free up the space (find -xdev / -exec rm '{}' ';'), overmount rootfs with the new root (cd /newmount; mount --move . /; chroot .), attach stdin/stdout/stderr to the new /dev/console, and exec the new init.</p></blockquote><p>Would it be possible to manually switch the root <em>without</em> a specialized system call? What if I just chroot?</p><pre><code>...
dracut:/# mount --rbind /sys /sysroot/sys

Explicit --user argument required to run as user manager.</code></pre><p>Oh, I need to run the <code>chroot</code> command as PID 1 so Systemd can start up properly. I can actually tweak the initramfs's init script and just put my startup commands in there, and replace the <code>switch_root</code> call with <code>exec chroot /sbin/init</code>.</p><p>I put this in <code>modules.d/99base/init.sh</code> in the Dracut source after the udev rules are loaded and bypassed the <code>root</code> variable checks earlier.</p><pre><code>modprobe fuse

I have mounted Google Drive! Mounting Drive and a few <em>very long</em><code>rsync</code> runs later, I have Arch Linux on Google Drive.</p><p>Just kidding, it's never that easy.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p dir="ltr">Switzerland has enacted the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2023/682/de">"Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfilment of Governmental Tasks" (EMBAG),</a> establishing a mandatory requirement for open source software within public sector bodies. This legislative shift, championed by key figures such as Professor Dr. Matthias Stürmer, head of the Institute for Public Sector Transformation at the Bern University of Applied Sciences, signifies a paradigm shift in how governmental software development and procurement are approached.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>"Switzerland's new 'public money public code' law is a great opportunity for government, the IT industry and society. All stakeholders benefit from this new regulation since the public sector can reduce vendor lock-in, companies can grow their digital business solutions, and taxpayers spend less on IT solutions and receive better services due to increased competition and innovation."&nbsp; </em>Professor Dr. Matthias Stürmer</p>
<p dir="ltr">Professor Dr. Matthias Stürmer has been a pivotal advocate for this change. With a background in digital sustainability and open source community building, Stürmer has long argued for the benefits of OSS in enhancing digital transparency and reducing dependency on proprietary software. His involvement in various capacities, including his role at the Research Center for Digital Sustainability and as president of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ch-open.ch/en/ueber-ch-open/">open source association CH Open</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The EMBAG law stipulates that all public bodies must disclose the source code of software developed by or for them, unless precluded by third-party rights or security concerns. This mandate aims to ensure greater transparency, security, and efficiency in government operations by promoting the use of OSS, which allows for public scrutiny and contribution to the software code​​.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the critical aspects of this law is encapsulated in Article 9, which not only mandates the disclosure of source code but also allows public bodies to offer additional services related to support, integration, or IT security, provided these services align with public tasks and are offered at a cost-covering remuneration. This provision ensures that while fostering OSS, the government can also maintain a competitive balance and avoid market distortion​​.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The journey to this legislative milestone was not without its challenges. The concept of making OSS mandatory in the public sector was initially met with resistance. Key stakeholders, including members of the Swiss Parliament and various governmental bodies, engaged in extensive debates. Concerns ranged from potential intellectual property issues to fears of compromising security. However, through persistent lobbying and advocacy, notably by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.parldigi.ch/de/">Parliamentarian Group for Digital Sustainability (Parldigi)</a>, a consensus was reached, leading to the final compromise that forms the current EMBAG law​​.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The implementation of EMBAG is expected to serve as a model for other countries considering similar measures. The law aims to promote digital sovereignty and encourage innovation and collaboration within the public sector. As Switzerland adopts this approach, the benefits of open source software—greater security, cost efficiency, and enhanced public trust—may become more apparent.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Previous post: <a href="https://hallofdreams.org/posts/prologue-in-hatetris/">Prologue in HATETRIS</a></em></p><h2 id="tetris-that-hates-you">Tetris That Hates You</h2><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_611.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_611.png"> <em><a href="https://stickman.qntm.org/comics.php?n=611">StickManStickMan #611</a>, by Sam Hughes.</em></p><p><a href="https://qntm.org/files/hatetris/hatetris.html">HATETRIS</a> is a version of Tetris written in 2010 by programmer and sci-fi author <a href="https://twitter.com/qntm">Sam Hughes</a>. According to his <a href="https://qntm.org/hatetris">initial description of the game</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This is bad Tetris. It’s hateful Tetris. It’s Tetris according to the evil AI from “I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream”.</p></blockquote><p>(And if you aren’t familiar with Tetris at all, and don’t know the rules or pieces, we recommend <a href="https://tetris.com/play-tetris/">trying out the original game</a> for yourself; Wikipedia has an article about how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect">Tetris in particular can consume your life and enter your very dreams</a>, but we’re sure you’ll be fine.)</p><p>The hatred comes from the way pieces are selected. In most variants of Tetris, the piece selection is pseudorandom, with methods ranging from independently random selection to the more recent Bag Random Generator. In almost every variant that isn’t truly random, the changes to randomness are done to make the player less likely to get two pieces of the same type in a row, or to go too long without seeing a given piece.</p><p>HATETRIS selects pieces in almost precisely the opposite manner, with a one-move lookahead min-max algorithm:</p><ul><li>First, check every possible position for all seven pieces.</li><li>Second, among those positions, examine how ‘good’ each of these moves is for the player, by measuring how high the highest block in the well is.</li><li>Third, select the piece which has the worst best-case scenario for the player. If there is a tie, break the tie in the piece order <code>S, Z, O, I, L, J, T</code>.</li></ul><p>There’s no randomness involved: the first, second, and third pieces you get upon starting the game will always be the <code>S</code> piece, and so will most of the others throughout the game. There’s no <code>next piece</code> window, since the next piece isn’t decided until you finish your move. There’s no possibility at all of getting four lines at once with a well-placed <code>I</code> piece, since the game will never under any circumstances give you an <code>I</code>-piece that you could use to clear four lines. And, in general, if you’ve set up to clear a line and there’s any piece at all which denies you that line for at least a turn, that’s the piece you’re going to get.</p><p>It’s a common experience for players to try the game for the first time with a strategy perfectly sound for normal Tetris and score no points at all, simply because normal Tetris strategy amounts to setting up good situations and then waiting for the odds to be in your favor. With a deterministic algorithm like this one, the odds will <em>never</em> be in your favor.</p><h2 id="high-scores">High Scores</h2><p>The flip side of determinism is predictability. Because the algorithm will always return the same move given the same history of moves, it’s possible to plan ahead and come up with complex strategies that one could never use in a non-deterministic game - and it’s possible to share results. The first few records (Mr. Hughes’ initial game of 5 points, and commenter JeremyBowers’ and Kazanir’s claims at seven points) were lost to history, but once replay functionality was added the day after release, the comment section became a leaderboard, and anyone could take an existing replay and copy the moves to try to improve on the same strategy.</p><p>Commenter Atypical posted the first replay, an eleven-point run, and over the next month, the high score was pushed to 17, 20, 22, 28, and finally 30, all using the same opening sequence of moves to create wells where every piece can be used to clear a line, four or five times in a row. This sequence of moves was so successful, in fact, that every world record run for ten years after its discovery used it. The Atypical strategy consisted of stacking<code>S</code>-pieces to the left of the well, clearing as many lines as possible, building a flat ‘ceiling’ on top of the pieces currently in the well, and then effectively starting from scratch on top of that ceiling. By the time of the 30-point runs, the Atypical strategy was so successful that it was even done a third time, near the end of the game. So far as we know, there isn’t a term for this, so we call this a <strong>pseudoloop</strong>; you’re not getting back to the same well you had before, but you’re doing the same pattern over and over again.</p><center><video width="500" height="540" controls=""> <source src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/2022-08-05_30_Points_Compressed.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video></center><p>This score of 30 points, set a month after release by the Japanese Slashdot poster Deasuke, held for the next seven years. When we started playing the game in 2013, we assumed that 30 points was as high as humans would ever get, and was probably as high as the game’s mechanics would allow. But around 2017, we started tinkering a bit with machine learning, and the question naturally came up: could a program be written to beat HATETRIS? We floated around a few ideas - including what would have been a very primitive version of a Monte-Carlo tree search - but never got around to implementation, even after commenter chromeyhex eked out another point a few months later and proved that 30 was not the maximum after all. It wasn’t until June of 2021, when commenter knewjade optimized the final few moves of the existing high score to get a score of 32, and then 34 points two days later, that we decided to start coding in earnest.</p><p>And then, a week after that, knewjade got 41 points…and did so with a somewhat different opening sequence than the one which had been used and improved upon for ten years. And a week later, he pushed it to 45. The Rust emulator was working by that point and the program could play around a hundred random games per second…but that was about all it could do, and we weren’t even close to using any machine learning yet. We breathed a slow sigh of relief as weeks went by and our own project made progress with no new world records being set, until knewjade in late August of 2021 posted a high score completely unlike any game known to exist for HATETRIS, totalling 66 points.</p><center><video width="500" height="540" controls=""> <source src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/2022-08-05_66_Points_Compressed.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video></center><p><a href="https://twitter.com/1millim/status/1429774558379216907">This game is beautiful.</a> Pieces set up in clearly unclearable positions turn out to be vital to clearing a line ten moves later, and it isn’t until fifteen points in that knewjade is forced to allow even a single hole higher than the first line. There are no pseudoloops - the shape of the well is constantly changing, and the well is quite frequently piled up almost to the top of the well to then clear multiple lines one after the next. By this point, <a href="https://gist.github.com/knewjade/586c9d82bd53f13afa8bcb7a65f8bd5a">knewjade had posted an explanation of the code he used to find these new high scores</a> (and this explanation will be key to our success, later), but even without the explanation, it was very clear that there was machine search involved somewhere. The game was simply too novel, discovered too quickly, and optimized too well, to have been done by a human being unaided. So it was possible for a machine to learn HATETRIS - we just had to learn how to teach it.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/WorldRecordGraph.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/WorldRecordGraph.png"></p><h2 id="choosing-a-language">Choosing a Language</h2><p>For starting the project, our shortlist came down to three languages: Mathematica, python, and Rust. Each had various pros and cons:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Mathematica</em></strong>: Pros: huge amount of personal experience, huge number of useful built-in functions for machine learning and general analysis, easy to make visualizations or monitor in a dynamic way. Cons: slower than molasses in January.</li><li><strong><em>Python</em></strong>: Pros: Lots of good built-in machine learning APIs, like Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Faster than Mathematica. Cons: Still slower than compiled languages.</li><li><strong><em>Rust</em></strong>: Pros: Extremely fast. Cons: Not much in the way of built-in machine learning tools.</li></ul><p>Everything ultimately came down to speed; no matter what the plan, or what variant of machine learning we were going to do, we’d need vast quantities of data, and we’d need to get that data with a single mid-range desktop computer. And calculating the legal HATETRIS moves was going to take time; the initial implementation of the game in Javascript mentioned that the algorithm is “quite time-consuming to execute, so please forgive me if your browser chugs a little after locking each piece”. So, to get as many games and as much data as we could, we’d need every advantage, starting with the fastest language we personally knew.</p><p>As a point of reference, the first speed test we did was playing random games with an unoptimized emulator in Mathematica, and the same unoptimized emulator in Rust. Mathematica took 4.3 seconds per game on average, and Rust took 0.035 seconds per game on average. This was such a big difference that we deemed that all of the hassle and aggravation of negotiating with Rust’s borrow checker would be worth it.</p><h2 id="the-story-so-far">The Story So Far</h2><p>When we first started on this project, we had a very clear idea of what we thought a winning strategy would be: A Monte Carlo simulation, powered by Machine Learning! Just like they do in AlphaGo and the more generalized AlphaZero. Surely someone had already written an implementation and all <em>we</em> had to do was write an emulator, hook it up to a nebulous AlphaZero implementation and emerge with a world record. How long could it take? Two weeks?</p><h3 id="mcts">MCTS</h3><p>MCTS (Monte-Carlo Tree Search) is a well-trod path in gameplay simulations. Without getting into details, since the methodology behind MCTS is much better explained elsewhere, the core conceit is to make each move in a game into a tree-like structure and then explore the tree.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/Chaslot_MCTS.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/Chaslot_MCTS.png"> <em><a href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/multithreadedMCTS2.pdf">Chaslot et al., 2008</a></em></p><p>Implementing a tree structure for HATETRIS positions was achievable. It was only after the initial tree implementation that we considered that there would be a <em>lot</em> of repeated wells: after all, in this game you can reach the same position in a number of different ways. A lot of deliberation and a re-factored codebase later, we opted for a <em>directed acyclic graph</em> (DAG) instead, taking identical positions and merging them into the same entry in a graph, rather than making them distinct entries on a tree. This complicated things significantly, but reduced our memory needs by an order of magnitude, at least. Refactoring from tree searches to DAG searches was more work than we’d expected to put in to the project, but was yielding promising results. An early depth first search got us scores of up to 14, with a simple greedy search looking for easy scores. At the time, the record was sitting at 34, so we felt very confident that we were on the right track.</p><p>It was sobering to realize, also, that “Graph vs Tree” in MCTS was in fact a discussion happening in professional circles. For example, <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/15952/15763">this paper</a>, which we read and didn’t fully comprehend, had a very succinct explanation of how DAGs were different from trees, and why it mattered:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/Czech_DAG.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/Czech_DAG.png"></p><p>We highlight that we fully failed to understand these, because there’s two things we learned from this:</p><ul><li>Reading the academic papers is important, because sometimes experts have the same problems you do.</li><li>You don’t have to understand the whole paper (or most of the paper) to derive useful insights. Sometimes looking at the pictures is enough.</li></ul><p>By this point we had a working emulator and a directed acyclic graph, and were ready to get rolling.</p><h3 id="mcts--alphazero">MCTS + AlphaZero</h3><p>As it turns out, there is no “AlphaZero generic game engine that magically gets you world records” in Rust. There might be one in Python. Regardless, we could not just plug our MCTS to a magic library and hope for things to happen. Oh no. Instead, we had to build a monstrosity of layers using <code>tch</code>, a Rust-Pytorch-C binding library to make a model to train. The details of this are interesting, but not ultra-relevant to our world record run. We plan on writing a more detailed post-mortem after this blog where we dissect that at length. The main takeaways:</p><ul><li>Training a model took a long time, in the order of weeks.</li><li>Mutating hyperparameters to improve results was difficult with long runtimes.</li><li>We only had a few tens of thousands of games to train on, which made the learning extremely poor.</li><li>Weeks and weeks of iteration produced worse and worse models, some overtrained, others just terrible.</li><li>We were likely doing several things that would get us summarily exiled by real machine learning engineers.</li></ul><p>Now, we are going to intentionally gloss over the giant, annoying mess that was multithreading our MCTS, a tangled web of <code>mutexes</code>, <code>arc(mutexes)</code> and locking paths that we still haven’t cleaned the bugs out of. We even had to make our own branch of <code>tch</code> to support mutexing the learning network. In summary: We tried multithreading. It improved performance. But our models were… awful, taking two full months to get back to where the simple, greedy MCTS search had gotten us in a couple of days. And they showed no signs of ever improving.</p><p>As a desperate last maneuver, we looked to knewjade’s new shiny record (66, at this point in time). Using knewjade’s heuristic, we generated ten thousand more MCTS games (the best of which scored 20 points), fed them to the model, and let it cook for two weeks. The resulting model was somehow <em>worse</em> than our training data, scoring at most 17. Which meant our poor model was just never going to rise above its training data. Not with the meager resources we could provide it.</p><p>AlphaHATETRIS was officially dead.</p><h2 id="the-emulator">The Emulator</h2><p>So, with AlphaHATETRIS dead, what did we have to work with? Well for starters, we’d written a pretty darn good emulator. Our best version is still not the best version that exists, but it worked well for our needs. How does this emulator work, anyway?</p><h3 id="well-well-well">Well, Well, Well</h3><p>Some quick terminology, since we’ll be using the word “well” and “move” until they lose all meaning:</p><ul><li>A <strong>well</strong> is the <code>20 x 10</code> area in which the game is played, and any blocks currently in it. In general, when we talk about a well, you can think of it as a snapshot of a game in progress.</li><li>A <strong>piece</strong> is the four-block shape being maneuvered around in the well. When the piece cannot move down any further, it merges with the well and stops moving. This generates a new well.</li><li>A <strong>position</strong> refers to a legal placement of a piece within the well, be it terminal or not.</li><li>A <strong>terminal position</strong> is a piece that has reached a position where it can no longer descend, that is, it is going to become part of the well, exactly where it is. It’s terminal because once this piece is placed, we have created a new well.</li><li>A <strong>move</strong> is a placement of a piece within a well, such that it is terminal, and generates a new well. We do not consider non-terminal motion inside the well to be a ‘move’.</li></ul><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/basic_movement.png" width="800" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/basic_movement.png"> <em>(Left: A piece, in blue, at the beginning of its move. Center: a piece at the end of its move, in a terminal position. Right: a piece, in blue, at the beginning of the next move. The previous piece has merged with the rest of the well, indicated by the grey squares.)</em></p><h3 id="basic-state-management">Basic State Management</h3><p>Our first draft was the obvious approach, considering every possible position by every possible piece, and repeating until there are no new positions left.</p><p>Move generation in this context, refers to only generating the moves for a specific well. That is, each time you get a piece, what are the places the piece could go?</p><p>Our initial version of the emulator took a well, and considered all the possible positions for the piece inside the well:</p><ul><li>First, take the initial position, and calculate the positions that could result from going left, right, up or down.</li><li>Continue calculating the left, right, up, and down motions for each new position you encounter, and remove any illegal positions which intersect a filled square, or go outside the well. Merge any duplicate positions together.</li><li>When there are no more new positions, check to see which positions aren’t illegal, but which can’t go down. This gives you the possible terminal positions for the piece: the place where the piece can rest and merge with the well.</li><li>Repeat for all seven pieces.</li><li>When you’re done, determine which piece the HATETRIS algorithm would give you, pick from that piece’s terminal positions, and with this new well, start again from step 1.</li></ul><p>It’s a pretty straightforward approach to dealing with wells, and it was fast. It could get the moves for an empty well in 1.1 ms, which was very good compared to Mathematica’s 330 ms with the same algorithm, but we knew we could do better. And we would have to, since we needed several hundred million games to train our machine learning algorithm.</p><p>The first improvement we made was to cut out considering positions that would only traverse empty space. That is, in a well where the first row is filled, but no others, only really consider the space in lines 2-5.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/PotentialMovementsCombined.gif" alt=""> <em>Left: Considering all possible positions. Right: Considering only the positions in the non-empty part of the well.</em></p><p>The next logical improvement was to pre-generate the state graph. That is, instead of starting with the piece in the middle and generating positions for a left arrow, a right arrow, an up and a down, we pre-computed and cached <em>all</em> these states in the “blank” space above occupied rows, which meant we saved significant time trying to compute all these positions, at the expense of having to have a pretty large pre-cached data structure. Fortunately there are only a few thousand starting positions for pieces, which we generated programmatically. It wound up being exactly 2457 positions between all 7 pieces.</p><p><a href="#flamegraphs--attack-of-the-clones">In analyzing the performance of move detection</a>, we discovered that the majority of our time was now spent accessing the hash of positions, since whenever a new positions was explored, we had to check if it already existed. A bit of a further dig and we discovered that most of that time was spent running a hashing algorithm on the positions data for comparison. Which again, made sense…but we knew all our positions were unique among each other. We didn’t <em>need</em> to do any hashing, we could just use the position’s representation as a key directly, if we could find a reasonable way to encode it. So we replaced the hashing algorithm with our own custom version that encoded the position as a binary representation of position, rotation and piece type. This was much faster than having to hash a position, and we knew it guaranteed uniqueness. This <em>doubled</em> the speed of our move finder.</p><p>At this point, we had a speed of 300 <strong>microseconds</strong> per core. That’s a ~350% speedup over our initial speed in Rust and a 10,000% speedup over our initial speed in Mathematica. We were confident we’d optimized as much as we possibly could…and still, it wasn’t nearly fast enough. We needed something faster, since all our flamegraphs clearly showed that move calculation was a giant bottleneck in performance. So, we had to pivot.</p><h3 id="gpu-matrix-operations">GPU Matrix Operations</h3><p>The first idea we came up with was, fitting the theme of this project, a vague notion based on what we had read computers should be able to do. We could just do some matrix math in a GPU!</p><p>Our plan was to calculate the legal moves via matrix operations, and speed up those matrix operations dramatically by running them on the GPU. The idea is simple enough: there are a finite number of positions a piece can be in. So, we start with a vector <code>v</code> representing the starting position of a piece, and a matrix <code>M</code> representing all the ways a piece can move from one position to another. The vector <code>v*M</code> (the vector which is the product of multiplying <code>v</code> by <code>M</code>) will then be the vector consisting of all possible positions a piece can be in after one step. <code>v*M²</code> will be the vector consisting of all possible positions a piece can be in after two steps. Do this multiplication <code>n</code> times, and you get <code>v*M^n</code>, a vector consisting of all possible positions a piece can be in after <code>n</code> steps. Eventually, <code>v</code> will stop having new nonzero elements, and then, you’re done - the nonzero elements of <code>v</code> are the positions that the piece can reach in the given well.</p><pre><code>vCurrent = startingState
vReachable = vCurrent

while max(vCurrent) &gt; 0:
    vIntermediate = sign(v1.transitionMatrix)
    vCurrent = vIntermediate &amp; ~vReachable
    vReachable |= vIntermediate

return vReachable
</code></pre><p>There were various improvements and refinements we did with this idea. Instead of using multiplication, we used Boolean logic operators to keep all the numbers either 0 or 1; instead of a full matrix, we had four vectors representing left, right, down, and rotation movements. The math worked, and gave a modest tenfold speedup when tested in Mathematica, but we estimated that in Rust the speedup would be negligible, due to the large number of redundant operations the CPU would have to do. However, GPUs are specifically designed for a large number of simple redundant operations. If we could calculate the legal moves on a GPU, it might provide a substantial speedup.</p><pre><code>vCurrent = startingState
vReachable = vCurrent

while max(vCurrent) &gt; 0:
    vIntermediate = permute(vCurrent, leftPermutation)
    vIntermediate |= permute(vCurrent, rightPermutation)
    vIntermediate |= permute(vCurrent, upPermutation)
    vIntermediate |= permute(vCurrent, downPermutation)
    vIntermediate &amp;= vEmpty
    vCurrent = vIntermediate &amp; ~vReachable
    vReachable |= vIntermediate

return vReachable
</code></pre><p>This required us to get comfortable with difficult topics: writing code to be executed in the GPU via CUDA C and cross-compiling C code so it could run on the GPU. We’ll save the excruciating details of how that worked for the longer post, merely pointing out here that:</p><ul><li>It can be done.</li><li>Make sure you’re writing CUDA C and not C++ or plain C.</li><li>The linker is going to hate you, its not personal, you’ll just have to keep adjusting flags until it works.</li></ul><p>In the end, we decided not to go this route, since we came up with another emulator improvement which would provide roughly the same speedup without having to deal with the GPU, which to be honest, had proven quite daunting.</p><h3 id="let-me-count-the-waves">Let Me Count The Waves</h3><p>Our final approach begun by thinking of the problem differently:</p><p>First we considered this: given a specific height, there is a finite set of possible positions that fit within that height. (for example, the height 1-4). These positions are not independent of each other. That is to say, if one piece position is blocked due to a filled square, some other piece positions will be blocked as well. For a given four-line area in the grid, there is a limited subset of potential positions for a piece, considering all rotations and positions within that space. In fact, for every piece except the <code>O</code> piece, there are 34 possible positions (including rotations) in a <code>4 x 10</code> area.</p><p>A ‘wave’ can be represented as a binary number that is 34 bits, corresponding to the 34 potential positions available to a piece. The binary represents if the position is reachable for the given piece or not. That is to say, if a position is empty and reachable, the corresponding digit in the wave is 1, and if it isn’t, the corresponding digit is 0.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/waveform.gif" alt=""></p><p>You also have a surface. A surface is the reachable part of a well: That is, any point which has a clear path to the empty top of the well.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/well-surface.png" width="500" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/well-surface.png"></p><p>The key is that a wave and a four-line slice of a surface, together, form a unique transition: the same wave plus the same slice of a surface will always produce the same new wave one line further down. As a result, the number of possible waves and surfaces is finite, and as we calculate moves, we can store the wave-surface transitions that we encounter in a cache, and the next time we encounter that transition, simply look it up from the cache again, rather than calculating the positions from scratch.</p><p>The final result of all this? From an original time of 330 milliseconds per move on Mathematica, to 1.1 milliseconds per move per core in Rust, to an optimized state-based emulator time of 300 microseconds per move per core, we were now down to 48 microseconds per move per core, on average. And, more importantly, finding the positions that a given piece could reach in a given well was no longer the bottleneck; any further optimization would have to be elsewhere.</p><p>But why? AlphaHATETRIS was dead, and machine learning wasn’t going to get us there. But the most recent world record holder had some answers for us.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_017.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_017.png"> <em><a href="https://stickman.qntm.org/comics.php?n=17">StickManStickMan #17</a>, by Sam Hughes.</em></p><h2 id="the-era-of-knewjade">The Era of Knewjade</h2><h3 id="the-knewjade-heuristic">The Knewjade Heuristic</h3><p>We’ve talked a lot in the past few minutes about knewjade (<a href="https://twitter.com/1millim?lang=en">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://github.com/knewjade">GitHub</a>). His heuristic. His beam searches. That’s because his work redefined how we were thinking about and approaching the problem. If nothing else, we were sure we could improve upon what he had done. To understand what we did then, it is important to understand what knewjade did to get 66 points, the highest score ever achieved at that point. More than twice what we had once considered an unbeatable 31.</p><p>Fortunately, knewjade had published his work, <a href="https://gist.github.com/knewjade/586c9d82bd53f13afa8bcb7a65f8bd5a">here</a>. While we don’t speak Japanese, Google Translate and staring at pictures helped us understand what was going on.</p><p>The knewjade approach is also known as a ‘heuristic beam search’. What does that mean? A ‘beam search’ means that you take some number of positions, get all of their children, keep the best ones, and then repeat the process until you run out of positions. For instance, if you had a beam search with a width of twenty-five million, then at every step, you take the best twenty-five million children from all of your existing wells, and use them as your wells for the next step. The ‘heuristic’ part is how you sort the children from best to worst in order to keep the best twenty-five million of them.</p><p>Fundamentally, the knewjade heuristic is a weighted sum of a few different factors. First, holes (empty squares with at least one full square above), and enclosed holes (empty squares with no path reaching to the surface). Holes and enclosed holes are bad. It makes sense that enclosed holes would be problematic: you must clear lines to get to them, and as we know, clearing lines in HATETRIS is no mean feat. Non-enclosed holes are a little more difficult to reason about, but without getting too technical, the layout of a hole can make it impossible or at least extremely challenging to clear, contributing height to the well, without giving an easy means of clearing lines.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/enclosed-holes-knewjade.png" width="400" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/enclosed-holes-knewjade.png"> <em>(In red: holes. In teal: enclosed holes.)</em></p><p>Second, the number of lines containing enclosed holes. We’ve already covered that enclosed holes are bad for clearing lines, but not all enclosed holes are created equal. A line with more than one enclosed hole is about as bad as a line with any number of enclosed holes, since you will have to clear all the lines above it regardless of how many holes there are. Thus, we care more about how many <em>lines</em> have enclosed holes, than the number of overall enclosed holes. As an example, the two left wells in the picture below would score quite differently: the one on the top is much more “clearable” than the one on the bottom, since you only have to clear one line in order to be able to access the enclosed holes instead of three.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/knewjade-enclosed-lines.png" width="700" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/knewjade-enclosed-lines.png"> <em>(Left: two wells with two enclosed holes each; the bottom left well is clearly harder to clear than the top left well. Right, lines containing at least one enclosed hole.)</em></p><p>Third, the erasability. How many different pieces can be used to erase a line in this well? The easier it is to erase a line, the easier it is to score. Erasability is good. This well happens to have a very high erasability score, since any piece can clear a line. To demonstrate:</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/gif-of-clearability.gif" alt=""> <em>(A well which can clear all seven pieces)</em></p><p>And fourth, the score. A higher score is good. After all, we want world records. No matter how nice we make a well, all that matters is the score when we inevitably lose.</p><p>Each of these factors was given a weight, which knewjade generated with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">real-valued genetic algorithm</a>, and the resulting sum was the heuristic: an algorithm to evaluate any well, the higher the heuristic, the better the move.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/optimized-heuristic-gif.gif" alt=""></p><p>Knewjade had several improvements on this basic concept. One improvement was realizing that, since the surface of a well can almost never move down once it’s moved up, it doesn’t matter how many holes or enclosed holes there are below the surface. All that needs to be considered is the part of the well above the lowest line of the surface. A recap: a surface is the “reachable” part of the well, that is any area that can still be reached from the top.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/knewjade-ignore.png" width="400" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/knewjade-ignore.png"></p><p>However, there is in general one exception to the ‘surfaces can never move down’ rule: when a line at the bottom of the surface can be cleared with an <code>S</code> or <code>Z</code> piece. So, knewjade’s heuristic doesn’t count holes or enclosed holes if an <code>S</code> or <code>Z</code> piece can free them.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/knewjade-s-lowers.gif" alt=""></p><p>Knewjade’s approach is brilliant, interesting, and innovative, and we were confident we could copy it.</p><h3 id="following-footsteps">Following Footsteps</h3><p>So, all we had to do was implement this on our own. And as it turns out, implementing this on our own had a whole host of problems. Our calculation of the surface height took a huge amount of time, and at first, before we discovered waveforms, our emulator was extremely slow, and so calculating the erasability of a given well by calculating all of the legal moves possible for that well was extremely time-consuming. For a while, we thought we could get by without the erasability, and this was a mistake: without the erasability, we could only get a score of 41. Our personal record, for sure, but hardly 66 points.</p><p>So, we implemented erasability - but the slowdown was still a huge problem, so we made a second and much larger mistake: we took a shortcut. Rather than computing the erasability for <code>S</code>, <code>Z</code>, <code>O</code>, <code>I</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>J</code>, and <code>T</code>, every single time, we checked if <code>S</code> could be cleared, and <em>only</em> if it could be cleared checked for <code>Z</code>, and then only if <code>Z</code> could be cleared checked for <code>O</code>, and so forth. This sped up the heuristic evaluation significantly (many positions can’t be cleared by all seven pieces), but even when we improved the emulator and no longer had to worry as much about speed, we kept this shortcut in the code. And the problem with that is simple to state: if you’re setting up a well so that you can clear a line, you need to be able to clear that line with all seven pieces, and it does not matter what order you set this up in. We were throwing out perfectly good setups because the setups weren’t in our arbitrary order, and <em>we had completely forgotten that this assumption was bad</em>.</p><p>We describe this as a critical mistake, even though it only takes a few sentences to describe, and only one line of code to fix, because it was by far our most time-consuming error, more than any of the tedious debugging for the GPU or multithreading sections. We lost roughly three months due to this, after all was said and done. Knewjade’s beam search had a width of 25 million, and though he could run his in two or three days, we did not have the waveform-based emulator yet, and so our beam search would take three weeks to run. And, with no way of knowing ahead of time how well a given set of heuristic parameters would scale, that’s precisely what we did. Twice. We also had to get the parameters in the first place to test out, which (as we’ll discuss below) also took weeks, and in general we wasted a lot of time looking to improve the wrong parts of the code and not realizing that it was erasability that was limiting us.</p><p>Perhaps it’s unfair to blame this one mistake for months of wasted time, because even after we fixed the mistake, our implementation of knewjade’s heuristic was not as good as the original. We know this because knewjade was kind enough to send us his original parameters, and when we ran those parameters - in theory, using exactly the same heuristic he did - the beam search returned a score of 53, instead of the 66 he got. We still don’t know why it was that our heuristic did worse, or what the difference between his implementation and ours was. But by then, we’d come up with an additional term of our own, one which would make replicating the world record of 66 a moot point.</p><h2 id="mumble-mumble-graph-theory"><em>Mumble Mumble</em> Graph Theory</h2><p>For some months, we’d had a very interesting idea. The idea consisted of the words “graph theory”, which we’d occasionally gravely recite to each other and nod knowingly, with some vague gesticulations, and not much else. Much to our surprise, this turned out to be a workable strategy. Kind of.</p><p>While writing and making the visuals for this section, we actually discovered that the graph theory heuristic made no difference at all when used on a sufficiently wide beam search, and that we would have gotten 86 points with or without it. This was in large part because the games we mined for data weren’t representative of the kinds of moves that end up setting world records, and because we didn’t mine enough games to have good sampling rates. However, we include this section anyway, since we suspect that a properly implemented version could be a significant improvement; this heuristic by itself gets 38 points on a 25 million beam search, so setting what would have been the world record before 2021 means that there’s <em>something</em> worthwhile going on.</p><p>John Brzutowski, in his <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/831/1.0079748/1">1988 master’s thesis</a>, proved that for a specific sequence of <code>S</code> and <code>Z</code> pieces, it was impossible to win the game of Tetris, and in the process got the ball rolling on making evil versions of Tetris, since it was now a fact that Tetris could, in theory, be so difficult as to be unwinnable. Part of his analysis was looking at the life cycle of “flats” - the creatures occupying individual lines in a Tetris well. These ‘flats’ are composed of blocks and empty spaces, and one could track an individual ‘flat’ from birth when it is nothing more than an empty line in the well) all the way until death (when it is completely filled, and the line goes away).</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/FlatLifeCycle.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/FlatLifeCycle.png"></p><p>Brzutowski’s insight was that these ‘flats’ had a very limited number of behaviors each turn. On a given turn, a ‘flat’ can:</p><ul><li>Be born</li><li>Remain exactly the same.</li><li>Fall down a line if there was a cleared line below.</li><li>Grow (gain more full blocks in its line).</li><li>Die (become completely full, and vanish).</li></ul><p>So, we can take a full game, and tag each individual flat in the game, watching it as it moves through its life cycle from birth to death - or, move through its life cycle and then stop, permanently. Because, in a game of Tetris that ends, a given flat will at some point either die (get cleared) or reach a point where it never grows, falls down, or changes ever again. The key insight we had was that some line shapes are more likely to die and get cleared than others, and that graph theory could measure and predict this tendency. Essentially there are “good” lines that clear well, and “bad” lines that are really difficult to clear.</p><p>In a perfect world where we were furnished with $50,000 a day in AWS credits, we could thoroughly investigate these behaviors over four lines, but with commercial hardware, we could really only focus on one-line transitions. But how do you figure out what makes a line better than its competitors? The answer is where graph theory comes in:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/LineTransitions.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/LineTransitions.png"></p><p>We have in this image a complete set of all transitions for all lines (of width 4; the width 10 transition graph was too big to properly visualize, and even this is pushing it). And, with the data from the tens of thousands of MCTS games we had, it was possible to get a frequency for every transition in this graph, ranging from “vanishingly rare” to “happens almost every game”. There is one starting point – the empty line – and two ending points, not shown in this graph: a flat dying to clear a line, or a flat becoming immortal and never changing again. We could model this.</p><p>Model it how? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm">Ford-Fulkerson method</a>. Imagine the empty well as a source of water, and the two possible end states are buckets. The “water” that travels through the graph all winds up either in a “immortal” bucket or a “cleared” bucket. The frequency of the transitions in the graph, then, represents how ‘wide’ the channel is. Any flat <em>can</em> eventually be cleared, and any flat <em>can</em> become immortal, but if you have a pipe a foot wide towards one bucket and a drinking straw towards the other bucket, the amount of water in each bucket at the end will be different. What we want is to rank how good different flats are based on how much of the ‘water’ flowing through them eventually goes towards the bucket labeled ‘cleared’. This is what Ford-Fulkerson does (in broad strokes, it doesn’t actually model water), and with Mathematica’s implementation of it, we had <strong>clearability</strong>, the first part of our graph theory heuristic.</p><p>The second part was based on similar reasoning. Imagine you have what is frequently an incredible flat when it’s at the top, but the flat is now buried so deep below the surface of the well that no piece will ever reach it. No matter how easy that flat might be to clear in theory, in practice, it’ll never happen. So, we added a second component to the heuristic, <strong>permeability</strong>. We went through the tens of thousands of MCTS games again and made a second graph, this time detailing which pairs of lines had pieces go from the upper to the lower, and which didn’t.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/Permeability.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/Permeability.png"> <em>(Left: a well which would have a high permeability score. Right: a well which would have a low permeability score.)</em></p><p>So, the graph theory heuristic was the sum of a pair of terms. At each line, the odds that the line would ever eventually be cleared was multiplied by the odds that a piece could get down far enough to get to that line to clear it, with the empty line being by definition the most clearable of all. The higher this heuristic, the better.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/gif-graph.gif" alt=""></p><h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting It Together</h2><p>What we didn’t explicitly say yet, is that these two approaches can be combined. In a very direct way, the knewjade heuristic assesses the quality of a particular well, looking at its shape, considering the piece, and generally calculating its “quality”. The graph theory heuristic, on the other hand, considers only specific lines two at a time, without any broader context of well shape. This joint approach, combining shape and line, gives a more nuanced assessment of the state of the well.</p><p>What we suspected (though it’s not something we could formally prove) is that the two pieces should balance each other out. The knewjade heuristic looks at the aggregate shapes in a well – the holes and enclosed holes, the height of the surface – but does so in a general way, with no way of (for instance) determining that this hole is less bad than that one. The graph theory heuristic is quite precise, with thousands of parameters determined from millions of positions, but only considers lines in isolation, or lines in neighboring pairs, with no ability to look at the broader context of the well. Together, ideally, they balance out each other’s weaknesses, and can find better games than either could individually.</p><p>(And as mentioned before, on a large enough scale, none of this matters; the additional effect of the graph theory heuristic term drops to zero as the beam search gets wider, and when doing a full 25 million width beam search, it does not matter if the graph theory term is there or not. But that’s not something we’d learn until many months later, and something that might be fixed by improving the data backing our graph theory approach.)</p><h3 id="parameter-optimization">Parameter Optimization</h3><p>So, with the two parts of the heuristic – knewjade’s, and ours – we were ready to go, and all we needed to know were the weights. By how much should a hole be penalized? By how much should a clearable line be rewarded? How important is score? This last question was especially difficult to answer with just intuition; on one hand, weighting score extremely highly means that the beam search will be very greedy and potentially miss better strategies that take more moves to set up, but <em>not</em> weighting scores highly leads to the algorithm putting off scoring indefinitely, always figuring “Eh, scoring would take away this nice clearable line I found!”. We needed some empirical method to figure out what all these weights should be.</p><p>What we found was a Rust library called <a href="https://github.com/nestordemeure/Simplers"><code>Simple(x)</code> Global Optimization</a>, a simpler version of the more well known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization">Bayesian Optimization</a> method. This method, like all optimization methods, takes a set of variables (in our case the weights for the heuristic) and a function of that set of variables (in our case, the number of moves a beam search with those weights ran for), and attempts to find the combination of variables that results in the highest value of the function. The upside was that we didn’t have to use any intuition about which weight was more important than which other weight, because <code>Simple(x)</code> could do it all for us. The downside was that this optimization required hundreds of beam searches before we could be reasonably sure we’d tried a broad enough variety.</p><p>So, hundreds of beam searches is precisely what we did. With a beam width of 250,000, each search took somewhere between forty-five minutes to two hours, and we let this run for well over a week. Then, after the two failed 25 million width beam searches, and after we discovered <a href="#following-footsteps">the bug</a>, we did the same thing again. By the end, our 250,000 width beam searches had returned a cluster of parameter combinations which lasted for 46 points and 148 moves…and one lone parameter combination which lasted for 46 points and 147 moves, surrounded by very similar combinations of parameters which did much worse.</p><p>One of the failed 25 million beam searches had been stuck in a local maximum - the parameters had stumbled upon a game that was <em>good</em>, but that was very difficult to improve upon, like climbing to the top of K2 when you’re trying to climb to the top of Mount Everest. As such, we decided not to go for the cluster that lasted 148 moves, but go for the lone combination that lasted 147, on the hopes of not getting stuck in a local maximum once again.</p><p>And we should make explicit here that ‘hopes’ is what we were running on. We simply didn’t and don’t have the hardware to do many ultra-wide beam searches, and the optimum parameters probably change when you enlarge the width by two orders of magnitude. We both doubt very much that this set of parameters is the best possible. All we know is that it scaled up better than any other set of parameters we’d ever used.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Holes</td><td>11.2106</td></tr><tr><td>Enclosed Holes</td><td>83.7646</td></tr><tr><td>Enclosed Hole Lines</td><td>83.7646</td></tr><tr><td>Surface Height</td><td>-83.7646</td></tr><tr><td>Erasability</td><td>-83.7646 (per piece)</td></tr><tr><td>Graph Heuristic</td><td>-2.1413</td></tr><tr><td>Score</td><td>-332.2211</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>(The graph heuristic weight is included for completeness’ sake; do not try that one at home.)</p><h2 id="the-final-run">The Final Run</h2><p>It’s worth talking about what exactly we were using to run these beam searches and machine learning models and various other wild ideas, since to us it felt like every paper we read involved spending tens of thousands of dollars at your local cloud provider. We did <em>not</em> have tens of thousands of dollars to spend. We had about $150 on Azure credits, a machine we’d built a while ago with a slightly modern GPU, an i7 CPU, 16gb of RAM and a motherboard so old it wouldn’t accept any more RAM, and a couple laptops we were using for other things, and occasionally running long simulations on. No more than maybe $2,000 in hardware, being generous and counting the laptops.</p><p>Every few weeks as we’d work on the project, we’d read something about how AlphaZero was able to play 44 million games in nine hours and then run them all through neural network training powered by a fleet of thousands of TPUs, sigh wistfully, and look at our machine learning model, which needed another two weeks to finish training on a measly 10k games. Still, by the time we were running 25 million beam searches at the end it wasn’t <em>awful</em>; a beam search would take roughly four days, a vast improvement over the original 6 week runtime (the original beam searches took 3 weeks, but returned games half as long, so would have taken 6 with the better parameters). An agonizing four days, only to get scores like 53, which had once been impressive but were not exactly the world record. Finally, with our best heuristic ready, and all the graph theory <em>mumble mumble</em> was wired up, we decided we’d do it. We’d use a magical cloud machine and be done in a few hours.</p><p>We settled on a <code>c5d.18xlarge</code> instance on AWS for $3.50 an hour. The main draw was the 1800 GB SSD and the 72 available cores. With multithreading and some rough back of the napkin math it was slated to take 7 hours. A mere $24.50 for being done. And to be clear, this was our last hurrah. We were considering other ideas, but we knew this was our best shot and that if this failed, we’d likely lack the morale to go back to the drawing board and try again.</p><p>Things conspired to delay us. COVID. A stolen credit card. Random real life interrupts. Finally, the Friday of Memorial Day, we spun up the 72 core instance. We’d originally planned on running a few trials on a cheaper 16 core instance… but we opted to skip them. After all, we reasoned, if things would finish in 7 hours, we could reassess after that and see what needed to be changed. We installed Rust, copied files over, set up ssh keys… and then hit run. We’d be well within our budget, $24 being less than the $100 or so we’d budgeted for cloud computing.</p><p>An astute reader will probably guess that we did not leave and come back 7 hours later to a world record. Partially because we sat there, glued to the screen, watching games play out, and partially because something had gone terribly wrong. You see, it turns out our back of the napkin math hadn’t accounted for one thing: file reads and writes. Adding more cores made the threaded processes faster, but now the bottleneck was how quickly we could get in and out of the hard drive. And it was not encouragingly fast. 7 hours later we had achieved a score of 10 points at depth 33. Some more quick back of the napkin math suggested we needed probably another 150 moves in order to tie the world record, so another 35ish hours. 42 times $3.50 was only 147 dollars. Still within our mental budget of “no more than $200 of cloud computing”.</p><p>Over the next few hours we watched the score inch up, and the depth increase. Never getting as fast as we’d like. It was like watching water slowly, ever so slowly drip into a well, not knowing if it would ever tip over. 10. 25. 35. We still didn’t know if our heuristic could even generate a world record. Watching the score tick up and the cost do the same.</p><p>Us being us, we had no patience. Instead of watching it tick agonizingly forward, at around the 48 hour mark, when we were starting to see scores of around 63, we decided we’d cheat - we’d take one well, printed out with the output logs, and run a small 10k beam search on a laptop in order to get a lower bound for how good a game was possible. Like opening presents on Christmas Eve rather than Christmas morning, this did spoil a bit of the dramatic tension - but it also confirmed that we would, at bare minimum, get a score of 71 points, and that we would for a fact get the world record. Somehow this made the remaining ten hours of waiting worse, not better. At the 56 hour mark it finished. We’d done it. We’d discovered a 86 point game was possible, and we were only $196 in the hole. Considering the key-frame generation still had to run to give us the moves that the game had played, we might not even exceed our $250 cloud computing budget.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_021.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_021.png"> <em><a href="https://stickman.qntm.org/comics.php?n=21">StickManStickMan #21</a>, by Sam Hughes.</em></p><p>Key-frame generation? Didn’t we already have a winning game? Well, yes and no. We’d had the moves needed to play the winning game, but we also had billions of other moves that did <em>not</em> lead to the winning game. ‘Key-frame generation’ is how we reverse-engineer a game from a beam search. At each timestep, the beam search saves the top N wells (in this case, 25 million), and stores them all to disk. At the end, we take a well from the last available timestep, go through all of the wells in the previous timestep, and calculate all of their children (though we’ve since <a href="#reversing-the-polarity">figured out a better way</a>). When a well from the previous timestep has, as one of its children, the well we’re looking for, we stop, save that well, and go back another timestep to repeat the process. The process of finding each well reminded us a bit of rendering an animation by generating keyframes, hence the name.</p><p>An obvious question here: why didn’t we store the children of each well on disk, so that we wouldn’t have to recalculate the children again? The first answer is that the complete beam search already takes 225 GB of space, and storing the children would far exceed the available space on both the RAM and hard drive. The second answer is that, by the end, the emulator was fast enough that the extra time taken to read the data from disk would have been more than the time taken to recalculate the children.</p><p>56 hours in, we had a gorgeous score of 86, assuming there were no bugs in our emulator (an idea which at the time seemed dangerously possible), and all that was left was to wait for the fairly quick process of keyframe generation to finish. It was midnight, and we asked the fateful question “how long can it actually take? An hour?”. This didn’t seem unreasonable, since keyframe generation was usually by far the fastest part of the process. But, as before, we had not considered the issues of scale. The sheer amount of disk reads and the massive depth we’d reached meant that the 72 cores didn’t speed things up at all, since 90% of the time was spent on the single-core operation of reading the timestep files from disk. Some quick math showed that it was going to take us another 12 hours to finish the process. Another 42 dollars and more agonizing waiting. With nothing to be done about it, we went to bed, vowing to wake up in the morning and input the game.</p><p>We cannot emphasize enough the sheer frustration at waking up the next day, and seeing it still merrily chugging along, slowly, ever so slowly; the back of the envelope math we’d done had been based on reading files from the end of the search, which were much smaller and faster to read than the files in the bulk of the game. 68 hours in, and the accursed keyframe generator was still only gradually moving forward. Neither of us got to enjoy that Sunday at all, watching it inch forward, bit by bit. Tantalizingly close.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_019.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_019.png"> <em><a href="https://stickman.qntm.org/comics.php?n=19">StickManStickMan #19</a>, by Sam Hughes.</em></p><p>Finally, late that afternoon, it finished. We hopped on a voice call, and put the game in to the online Javascript HATETRIS game, move by move, wondering at each moment if <em>this</em> is where we’d discover a key emulator bug or bad edge case to make all our efforts be for naught. But as the well piled tall on either side, and we fumbled flips here and there, one thing became clear. It was real. The world record was ours. <a href="https://qntm.org/hatetris#komment6293f5024978c">86 points</a>.</p><center><video width="500" height="540" controls=""> <source src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/2022-08-05_86_Points_Compressed.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video></center><p>We breathed a sigh of relief. It was done. It was finished. Countless hours of engineering time. Endless runs on our machines, 100 dollars over what we’d originally planned to spend on AWS.

There’s been a plot, there’s been progress, there’s been a clear (if non-monotonic) improvement from A to B to C. But there’s more stuff we learned, and dead ends we went down, that don’t really fit the story. We’ve captured them here for two reasons. One, we think these are valuable lessons that anyone who dives into this type of problem can benefit from. Two: we did a <em>lot</em> of work, much of which was only tangentially related to getting the world record, and while we’ll save most of that for a future blog post, we want to show some of it off now. These headings will only be loosely coupled, and while we think there’s a few related conclusions, we leave grand sweeping paradigms as an exercise for the reader.</p><h3 id="flamegraphs--attack-of-the-clones">Flamegraphs &amp; Attack of the Clones</h3><p>One lesson that came up over and over again throughout this project is that profiling is <em>very</em> important, because we as developers are bad at estimating which parts of code are bottlenecks and which aren’t. In one of the earliest iterations of the emulator, we had an error-handling exception which would format and print a string with state information in the event of a panic, to make debugging easier. We quickly fixed the underlying bug which would cause that string to print, but kept the print statement in anyway. What harm could it do?</p><p>We had no idea what the relative time cost of any of our code was at that stage, and didn’t find out until later, when we started using <strong>flamegraphs</strong> (a visual aid showing the proportion of time spent on each function call in a program) to profile our code. We had certain functions we knew for a fact were bottlenecks, so some of the graph wasn’t a surprise. What was a surprise, however, was the mountain sticking up from the surrounding foothills, in the center of the graph:</p><p><em>(Click or hover for more details)</em></p><p>As it turned out, that string format statement was taking up 17% of the total runtime, all in the event of an error that literally never happened. And that was before all of our other optimizations; if we put this string format statement back into the current emulator, it would take up well over 95% of the runtime by itself. And without code profiling, we <em>still</em> would never have guessed this.</p><p>Reasoning about runtime is <em>extremely</em> tricky. For all the coding interviews that emphasize calculating the runtime complexity of your program, there is a lot of magic that happens in coding, and the only way to really know what’s going on is to use appropriate tools to detect it. Sure, you should avoid nested for loops inside for loops, but profiling your program can give you even better results.</p><p>And by the same token, profiling also revealed that we had no need to worry about some things that concerned us. We’d spent significant amounts of time discussing how we were going to fix our various issues with using <code>.clone()</code> to get around borrow issues, and do things properly… but when we looked at the flamegraphs it turns out our 70+ clones were not costing us any time, since they were being optimized away during compilation. What we had assumed was a major time-sink was nothing to worry about at all.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/attackclones.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/attackclones.png"></p><h3 id="array-vs-btree">Array vs. BTree</h3><p>That said, you can’t just ignore runtime complexity, either. Our original version of the beam search took <code>N</code> wells, calculated all of the children of all of the <code>N</code> wells (typically around <code>15*N</code>), sorted the list, and then took the best <code>N</code> children in the list to use for the next step. This is all well and good for small values of <code>N</code>, but when scaling up, this quickly becomes untenable; storing all of the children at the same time (as opposed to just storing the top <code>N</code> children) wastes a tremendous amount of memory, making the beam search take up on average fifteen times more RAM than it properly should. We knew we had to change something there.</p><p>So, we took the obvious route. To summarize in pseudocode:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre>for well in current_wells:
    for child in children(well):
        if child is better than worst_child in new_wells:
            insert child into new_wells in appropriate_position
            remove worst_child from new_wells
            get new worst_child from new_wells
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>And therein lay the problem, though we didn’t figure it out for another month and a half. Reading an arbitrary element from the vector is <code>O(1)</code>, but insertion into the middle of a dynamically-sized vector is not an <code>O(1)</code> operation - it’s <code>O(n)</code>, scaling with the number of elements in the vector. This caused a huge nonlinear increase in runtime with respect to the beam width; had we tried to do a full 25 million width beam search at this point (and we wouldn’t have tried), it would have taken literal years to finish even with Rust’s impressive compiler magic.</p><p>We briefly considered using linked lists, <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/">despite well-known warnings about how tedious and difficult they could get in Rust</a>, but linked lists presented a different problem. Insertion in between two elements is nice and fast at O(1), but reading through the linked list to find out <em>where</em> to insert is O(n). This was exactly the opposite of the situation with vectors, but it was no closer to being a solution.</p><p>Upon seeing that we had two data structures, one which could read quickly but insert slowly, and the other which could read slowly but insert quickly, we thought “surely there’s some sort of compromise data structure that does both pretty well”. And sure enough, there was. Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeSet.html">BTreeSet</a> was a built-in data structure based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-trees</a>, which have logarithmic read times and logarithmic write times. Things were slow enough already that we were willing to accept almost any constant in front of those logarithms, so we switched, and went from insertion taking up more than 90% of the beam search runtime to less than 1% instantly.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Data Type</th><th>Insertion Time</th><th>Element Read Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vector</td><td><code>O(n)</code></td><td><code>O(1)</code></td></tr><tr><td>Linked List</td><td><code>O(1)</code></td><td><code>O(n)</code></td></tr><tr><td>B-Tree</td><td><code>O(log(n))</code></td><td><code>O(log(n))</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Changing the datastructure was the key to unlocking larger beam searches, but this would have been futile without the improvements we got from the flamegraphs, and in turn wouldn’t have worked if we’d spent all our time cleaning up clones. Writing highly efficient code is more of an artform than a science (and we await a flurry of angry tweet from our many reader over this statement). It requires a mix of the right tooling, understanding your code, and figuring out what tradeoffs make sense.</p><h3 id="machine-learning-on-the-cheap">Machine Learning (on the cheap)</h3><p>There’s another lesson we learned as we optimized our code as best we could…no amount of optimal code will eliminate the need for absurd amounts of hardware for machine learning. It doesn’t matter how good your emulator is, how blazingly fast you can play games… the sheer amount of training data and training time needed makes trying to solve problems of more than trivial complexity on consumer hardware very very challenging.</p><p>We’re not machine learning engineers. We don’t have formal backgrounds in machine learning, or in anything remotely close. Mr. Hughes generously said that we “appear to be academic researchers”, but that appearance is purely surface level. It’s possible, as it always is, that we were just doing everything wrong, and someone with a PhD in applied machine learning will show up with a model far better than any beam search we’ve designed. We wish for nothing more. We <em>want</em> user friendly machine learning for amateurs like ourselves. In fact, when we set out on this project, one of the things we wanted to prove was that AlphaZero could be used for a practical purpose without a massive computing cluster. As far as we can tell, it cannot.</p><p>The cloud costs, in TPUs and GPUs and RAM, to really get this project off the ground would have been considerable. Our models, tiny and poor as they were, still took two plus weeks to train on a very low number of games, and one of the things we’ve realized is that machine learning <em>depends</em> on having vast reams of data. It’s not sufficient to have 100,000 good games; you need tens of millions. And you need to be able to take games generated by your models and train on them. With super slow hardware, its impossible to tweak hyperparameters to figure out the best learning approach. (Which is, as far as we can tell, how the big, successful projects figure out their hyperparameters, careful guessing, and a lot of tweaking.)</p><p>Its frustrating to learn that the incredible tools that are supposed to revolutionize problem solving are out of the reach of anyone not able to throw significant cash at it. There’s a whole possible blog post on this topic. We’re <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Scaling-hypothesis">hardly the first to realize it</a>, but we felt it extremely keenly.</p><h3 id="behaviors-at-different-well-heights">Behaviors at Different Well Heights</h3><p>Since we had an emulator handy, while we were waiting to get sufficiently good heuristic parameters for the full case, we thought to explore some smaller wells, and see if there was any obvious trend in maximum score and maximum game length we could extrapolate. The primary motivation behind this was simple: before embarking on programs which would take weeks or even months to run, we wanted to prove to ourselves that knewjade’s record of 66 was beatable, and that it wasn’t simply the maximum possible score attainable in HATETRIS. So, we did a series of breadth-first search runs, up until it exceeded the RAM available on a laptop, and wrote down the results.</p><h4 id="10-blocks-across">10 Blocks Across</h4><div><table><thead><tr><th>Height</th><th>Score</th><th>Length</th><th>BFS Width</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>310</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>11</td><td>9095</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>19</td><td>174634</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>31</td><td>4848325</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>12</td><td>43</td><td>141514270</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>≥17</td><td>≥57</td><td>≥1.00e8</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>≥86</td><td>≥247</td><td>≥2.50e7</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>This set of runs had some interesting results. Among other things, we had assumed (and we were <a href="https://twitter.com/qntm/status/1404880481657757700">not the only ones</a>) that since there were <code>10*16</code> squares in the grid, each one of which could be either filled or not filled, that there were roughly <code>2^(10*16) ≈ 10^48</code> possible HATETRIS wells. However, here, the results indicated that the number of possible wells was vastly less; the maximum width of the BFS search increased by a factor of ~30 with each additional line of height, so the maximum number of concurrent states would be somewhere around <code>10^20</code>:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/BFS_Widths.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/BFS_Widths.png"></p><p>For a game lasting (say) a thousand moves, this would be at most 10^23 possible wells. This was twenty-five orders of magnitude less than we expected, though sadly it was still nine orders of magnitude or so beyond what we could do with commercial brute-force and commercial hardware.</p><p>For completeness’ sake, we also examined narrower wells, to get as much of a feel for the behavior of HATETRIS with respect to well dimensions as possible. Width 4 is a special case, since an infinite loop there is actually possible in our emulator (and not possible in the newest version of HATETRIS); there’d be no point going any further. Doing BFS for wider wells might be interesting too, but our emulator currently can’t go beyond 10 blocks across, so we left that as a problem for a future date.</p><p><strong>EDIT (May 22nd, 2024)</strong>: The original values here were incorrect; this version of the emulator had a bug that only occurred when the well height was reduced; in certain circumstances, a piece which filled a line while sticking out the top of said line would be counted as a clear, rather than ending the game. That has been fixed, and these should hopefully be the correct values.</p><h4 id="8-blocks-across">8 Blocks Across</h4><div><table><thead><tr><th>Height</th><th>Score</th><th>Length</th><th>BFS Width</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>1172</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>17</td><td>12447</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>21</td><td>159942</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>28</td><td>2250610</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>34</td><td>31440780</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4 id="6-blocks-across">6 Blocks Across</h4><div><table><thead><tr><th>Height</th><th>Score</th><th>Length</th><th>BFS Width</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>142</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>682</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>13</td><td>3998</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>15</td><td>23337</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>19</td><td>149389</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>23</td><td>1017165</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>28</td><td>6995425</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>32</td><td>50825005</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4 id="4-blocks-across">4 Blocks Across</h4><div><table><thead><tr><th>Height</th><th>Score</th><th>Length</th><th>BFS Width</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>∞</td><td>∞</td><td>16</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4 id="5-blocks-across">5 Blocks Across</h4><div><table><thead><tr><th>Height</th><th>Score</th><th>Length</th><th>BFS Width</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>543</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>12</td><td>2150</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>14</td><td>8670</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>16</td><td>35017</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>19</td><td>148656</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>10</td><td>22</td><td>645397</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>24</td><td>2935961</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>12</td><td>26</td><td>13436407</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>13</td><td>29</td><td>61699120</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>32</td><td>285071640</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4 id="6-blocks-across-1">6 Blocks Across</h4><div><table><thead><tr><th>Height</th><th>Score</th><th>Length</th><th>BFS Width</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>139</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>679</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>3973</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>15</td><td>23126</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>19</td><td>143175</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>22</td><td>979997</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>27</td><td>6771901</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>30</td><td>48488721</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>36</td><td>362642476</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4 id="7-blocks-across">7 Blocks Across</h4><h3 id="finding-the-bug">Finding The Bug</h3><p>Along the way, trying to come up with optimizations for this state-based emulator, we encountered an interesting bug. ‘Interesting’ because the original implementation of HATETRIS briefly <a href="https://qntm.org/hatetris#komment2605">had exactly the same bug, and had it for exactly the same reason</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Start a new game and hit “rotate” four times. Note what happens to the piece. Unlike many Tetris games, the rotation process is actually mathematical; each new piece rotates around a “point of origin” which is at the junction point of four squares. The rotation is performed by fiddling with the actual coordinates of each of the four “bits” which make up the piece. Each piece actually has a point of rotation in addition to everything else.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The algorithm which tests all the possible positions, actions and final resting places of each possible new piece can do anything you can do: left, right, drop, rotate. The algorithm stores a list of all of these locations and applies all possible transforms to each location in turn in order to generate a complete list. Obviously, each new location thus generated has to be compared with the whole list to make sure it is new. One of my early attempts to make the algorithm faster made it so that it only checked the locations of the four bits, not the central point of rotation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>However, in the case of an <code>S</code> or <code>Z</code> piece, the point of rotation is significant. <strong>Hitting “rotate” will result in a different piece depending on which way up the piece is</strong>. In Tom’s 12-point run, the algorithm moved an <code>S</code> piece to the same location as he did, and hit “rotate”, but because the piece was the other way up, resistance was encountered and nothing happened. With the piece the other way up, which is what Tom did, the rotation is successful and a line is made.</p></blockquote><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/s-rotation.gif" alt=""></p><p>In other words, an <code>S</code> or <code>Z</code> piece occupying the same space can in fact be different pieces with different available positions. This means that the optimization of only considering the space a piece is taking up, rather than storing properties like ‘rotation’ and ‘position’ separately, will end up failing in some edge cases. This wouldn’t have been a huge speedup, and it’s not that important, but it was a signal to us that we were slowly but surely following the same path.</p><h3 id="echoes-of-alphazero">Echoes of AlphaZero</h3><p>The core premise of the AlphaZero neural architecture is that it is dual-head: the neural network has a policy head, and a value head, and the formula for determining which moves to investigate uses both. The value head is the simpler of the two: it takes in a position and outputs a single number ranging from -1 (meaning a predicted 100% chance of defeat) and +1 (meaning a predicted 100% chance of victory). The value head is what allows the algorithm to decide how good a position is, without having to play the entire game through to the end.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_691.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_691.png"> <em><a href="https://stickman.qntm.org/comics.php?n=691">StickManStickMan #691</a>, by Sam Hughes.</em></p><p>The policy head can be thought of (in <em>very</em> broad strokes, don’t take this too literally) as the ‘gut feeling’. If you’re a chess grandmaster, you don’t play as well as you do by looking at every possible move and counter-move that could be made - the branching factor of chess is simply too high. Instead, your gut feeling tells you to look at moves X, Y, and Z, so you do, and you don’t consider (or only briefly consider) the dozens of other possible moves available. The policy head works something like that, biasing the algorithm so that it does not consider all moves and all branches equally.</p><p>What we did, combining the overall ‘board sense’ from the knewjade heuristic and the line-by-line precision from the graph theory heuristic is very, very far removed from the original AlphaZero algorithm. Nevertheless, we couldn’t help but be reminded of the balance that the policy head and the value head were supposed to bring to each other when combined.</p><p>(This section was written long before we discovered that the graph theory heuristic made no difference; our intuition is no more perfect than the policy head’s.)</p><h3 id="reversing-the-polarity">Reversing the Polarity</h3><p>Keyframe generation took quite a while on the world record run, due to the sheer amount of time needed to read hundreds of gigabytes from disk into memory. There’s a better way to do it that didn’t occur to us until afterwards: make the emulator run backwards. That way, rather than calculating every child of every well that’s saved, simply calculate all of the possible parents of the well directly, and see which of those parents is in the previous generation’s well list.</p><p>If we really needed to speed up the process even further, we would write to a disk database rather than writing each timestep as its own file, and then when calculating the keyframes we’d only have to search the disk database for the dozen or so possible parents of the current well, probably getting the complete game in a few seconds.</p><p>Unfortunately, the initial idea of taking this idea to the extreme and calculating the entire ‘reverse game tree’ didn’t work; looking further than ten or so moves is currently very impractical, since most possible parents of a well are not reachable HATETRIS states (going back to the earlier discovery about how few reachable HATETRIS states there actually are). It’s possible to filter out some of the unreachable states (for instance, any well that has a partially filled line above a completely empty line is definitely unreachable), but we couldn’t figure out a way to filter out all of the unreachable parents, or even most of them, and so the effective branching factor is too high. If a full reverse emulator is possible, it would potentially allow for diskless beam searches, but right now it’s a bridge too far.</p><h2 id="the-next-world-record">The Next World Record</h2><p>We never bothered writing a script to take a list of wells and turn it directly into a valid <a href="https://github.com/qntm/base2048">Base2048</a> replay; it wouldn’t have been <em>that</em> difficult, but it was never important enough to actually get done. Instead, we printed out the list of wells, went through them one by one, and manually hit the arrow keys on the Javascript version of the game to move each piece where it needed to go. And along the way, we noticed a trend, one that we noticed also in knewjade’s 66 point run.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/WellHeight.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/WellHeight.png"></p><p>The winning game piled pieces up pretty high, and did so pretty early; it first had a piece touch the top of the well less than halfway through the game (move 120, for a game that lasted 247 moves). Looking at it, it makes sense that piling up pieces benefits the score; the HATETRIS algorithm is based on the height of the well, so maximizing the well height minimizes the amount of information the HATETRIS algorithm has at its disposal, and puts an upper bound on how evil its piece selection can be.</p><p>So by that logic, a perfect game should keep pieces piled all the way up to the top the whole time. Ours does not - our heuristic indirectly penalizes wells for being too high, because stacking pieces all the way up to the top takes time which could be used to score points and clear lines. And any well which goes too long without clearing any lines tends to get filtered out. The left-hand side of that graph is a land of opportunity, and a better heuristic than ours could probably get more than a hundred points by properly exploiting it.</p><p>Going back to the analysis on smaller wells, the length of the best possible games seems to increase approximately quadratically. Fitting a quadratic function to the results from well heights 2 through 7 and extrapolating out (and taking the result with a grain of salt), we’d expect the best possible game to last about 290 moves, which, like the previous estimate, would correspond to a best possible score of 102-103 - at the very least, indicating again that the current record is not the best possible game.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/MaximumGameLengths.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/MaximumGameLengths.png"></p><p>86 points is not the end of this story.

If you read this far, (which is, lets face it, unlikely) you’ve heard a lot of griping, seen some things that look semi-magical, and possibly left with the impression that the authors had some sort of incredible knowledge base, or are researchers deeply entwined with the topic.</p><p>We’re not. We’re not researchers at all. We’re just two people who became obsessed with a problem and put their meager knowledge to use, beating rocks against rocks in different configurations until something resembling a spearhead came out. Our experience with Rust was, up to this point, <a href="https://hallofdreams.org/categories/advent-of-code/">six blog posts done on introductory Advent of Code problems</a> over the course of six months. We didn’t know much at the start, but we learned. First, we Googled and clicked on the first result. Then we scoured Stack Overflow and papers, and when that failed, we reached out to specialist Discord servers and emailed experts. When existing Rust crates didn’t do what we needed, we made our own Rust crates. We now know a lot of very obscure information about HATETRIS, but you could still fill volumes with things about HATETRIS that we don’t know. Many of the breakthroughs we had were due to ignorance. We pulled out the concept of waveforms because we were <em>terrified</em> that the next thing we’d have to do to push things forward was do complex matrix operations on a GPU. Inventing a new way of thinking about the problem seemed easier.</p><p>You, too, can do something like this. Find a problem. Become obsessed with it. Learn everything you can about it. Fall down dead ends. Give up, and then keep thinking about the problem at night. Have Eureka moments that lead you down other dead ends. Find a friend willing to get as obsessed as you are. Underestimate the time commitment, and then refuse to back down. Embrace the sunk cost fallacy. As long as you keep thinking about the problem, even if its in short bursts every few years, you’re still making progress. And if you never finish? If all you find are side-paths and obstacles, and it turns out the entire mission was doomed from the outset? That’s okay too. Projects like this nourish us, because there’s a part of the human mind that wants nothing more than to climb the mountain, rappel into the cave, explore the unknown and grapple with it.</p><p>So, regardless if you’re here because you care about the technical details, or because you saw HATETRIS and said “I heard of that, I think”, if you only take one lesson away from this whole thing, we hope it’s this. You too can do the thing you think is impossible or difficult.</p><p>If you fail? Write about it anyway. The original title of this post was “How Not to Get the World Record in HATETRIS”.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_620.png" alt="" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/HATETRIS/Stickman_620.png"> <em><a href="https://stickman.qntm.org/comics.php?n=620">StickManStickMan #620</a>, by Sam Hughes.</em></p><p><em>Next post: <a href="https://hallofdreams.org/posts/hatetris-2/">Losing the World Record in HATETRIS</a></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

                <p>
There’s some 2015 research out of Microsoft titled <i>Code Reviews Do Not Find
Bugs</i><label for="fn.1">1</label><span><sup>1</sup> <i>Code Reviews Do Not Find Bugs; How the Current Code Review Best
Practice Slows Us Down</i>; Czerwonka, Greiler, Tilford; IEEE International
Conference on Software Engineering; 2015.</span> which seems strangely named because
reviewers <i>do</i> find bugs.
</p>

<p>
Here’s what the authors say:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Contrary to the often stated primary goal of code reviews, they often do not
find functionality defects that should block a code submission. Only about 15&nbsp;%
of comments provided by reviewers indicate a possible defect, much less a
blocking defect.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is a misleading statistic, because it says nothing about the defect
detection rate. Only about 15&nbsp;% of smokers get lung cancer, but that does not
mean we can ignore smoking as a cause – smoking is the cause of more than 80&nbsp;%
of lung cancer cases. The fact that 15&nbsp;% of code review comments are about
defects is not a statement about a lack of detected defects, but rather a
statement about how reviewers <i>also</i> write a lot of comments about other things
– and we will see more about that later.
</p>

<p>
This does just not support the idea that reviewers do not find defects. For
example, if the reviews in their data had an average of four comments each, then
more than half of the reviews did get comments about defects!
</p>

<p>
But we don’t need to speculate on how many comments there were in their data,
because there has been previous research on this. We have known for a while that
code review (as well as pair programming) finds an additional 60&nbsp;% of defects
for only a 15&nbsp;% increase in time investment.<label for="fn.2">2</label><span><sup>2</sup> <i>Balancing Agility and
Discipline</i>; Boehm, Turner, Booch, Cockburn, Pyster; Addison–Wesley
Professional; 2003</span>
</p>

<p>
At this point, we also have more detailed data on the effectiveness of code
review. During the first 60 minutes of code review of the day, the reviewer
finds roughly one defect per ten minutes of reviewing – as long as they review
less than about 50 lines of code per ten minutes.<label for="fn.3">3</label><span><sup>3</sup> <i>Making Software: What
Really Works, and Why We Believe It</i>; Oram &amp; Wilson; O’Reilly Media; 2010.</span> In
other words, reviews are most effective on small chunks at a time, and mustn’t
expand to cover large fractions of the workday.
</p>

<p>
What other activity can you imagine where a single developer can uncover a
defect every 10 minutes? Certainly not through manual testing – not even all
forms of automated testing beat this rate, given that the total cost of
automated testing of a component quickly exceeds 10 minutes of time investment.
Code review is ridiculously effective. Of all the quality measures we might have
in place, code review is the last one I’d get rid of.<label for="fn.4">4</label><span><sup>4</sup> But if we produce more
than about 300 lines of code per developer and day, I would be tempted to let
the excess lines of code go unreviewed, and focus reviewing on the most
important 300 lines per developer and day.</span>
</p>

<hr>

<p>
The Microsoft authors also report on how code review is remarkably effective for
learning the codebase.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The usefulness of code review comments – as judged by the author of a code
change – is positively correlated with reviewers’ experience. Without prior
exposure to the part of code base being reviewed, on average only 33&nbsp;% of any
reviewer’s comments are deemed useful by the author of a change. However,
reviewers typically learn very fast. When reviewing the same part of code base
for the third time, the usefulness ratio increases to about 67&nbsp;% of their
comments. By the fourth time, it is equivalent to the project’s long-term
average.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Granted, they don’t say enough to determine whether “the project’s long-term
average” is at a comparatively low or high familiarity level, but it sounds to
me like only <i>four</i> code reviews are enough to get people relatively familiar
with a completely new part of the codebase. Assuming a reasonably-sized change
(50–100 lines of code?) and a reasonable pace of reviewing for a beginner (10–50
lines of code per 10 minutes?) this would mean about 1–2 hours of code review is
enough to get familiar with a codebase.
</p>

<p>
That’s a cheat code. Exploration and exploitation are always in conflict; for
software engineering, this means knowledge sharing and speed are in conflict. If
we put someone experienced with a component on a task, they will finish quickly
but we won’t spread knowledge about that component. If we put someone
inexperienced on the task, the task is likely to take much longer but we do get
knowledge sharing. <i>Or</i>! We ask the inexperienced person to review the code of
the experienced person. This takes virtually no time (increases development time
by 15&nbsp;%) and they become familiar with the component as a side effect. We get
both knowledge sharing and speed.<label for="fn.5">5</label><span><sup>5</sup> Not to mention that sometimes we want to
share knowledge about a component which does not need changes made to it. We can
then have people review past changes and get feedback on their reviews from an
experienced member of the team.</span>
</p>

<hr>

<p>
The main thesis of the Microsoft paper seems to be that code review is not worth
the time spent on it. We have already seen that when the review load is properly
managed, code review is highly effective both in terms of finding defects and
learning the codebase.
</p>

<p>
The Microsoft paper goes on to say other things that appear to contradict their
thesis, like
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Feedback on long-term code maintainability covers 50&nbsp;% of code review
comments.</b> Sure, but isn’t this a good thing? Long-term code maintainability
is in my experience a large problem in organisations that don’t do peer
review.</li>
<li><b>The review is an opportunity for both author and reviewer to prove
themselves.</b> This seems like a potential motivator, and not a problem.</li>
<li><b>Code review usefulness is negatively correlated with change size.</b> This is a
feature, not a bug. It is an incentive to keep changes small and atomic.</li>
<li><b>Developers spend six hours per week reviewing.</b> This is a bit too much
(remembering the “first hour of the day” rule from before) but it should only
result in a marginal decrease in productivity – code review ought to still
appear to be a clear win.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I suspect the real problem with code review in the authors’ experience is one of
the last points they raise:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>The median review turnaround time is 24 hours.</b> The research on code review
has been mostly done in lab settings and not in integrated on-the-job
situations, so it has not emphasised turnaround time. But having half of the
reviews take more than 24 hours seems – in my experience – like way too much.
When I did the maths on this at a previous job, the median turnaround time was
6 hours, and that was borderline painful (which was why I ran the numbers in
the first place.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the end, I agree with the authors that we should not blindly copy best
practises (i.e. cargo cult practices) but the reported experience in this case
does not appear to follow best practices, so before judging best practices we
should first make sure we have followed them.
</p>

<p>
If they are impractical to follow in a large organisation, that would be <a href="https://two-wrongs.com/publish-your-observations.html">an
important observation worth publishing</a>, rather than claiming they don’t work
when followed.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3124261924762160653" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>WARNING: the following contains a whole lot of pedantry about proving
theorems at a level of detail such that you could likely convince a
computer proof assistant of their correctness. I teach a course where
students learn to write such proofs without computer assistance, because
doing so can profoundly affect how one perceives the possibilities for
formal definition and proof. Sometimes the default reasoning principles
provided by a proof assistant can restrict one’s perspective of what
reasoning principles are acceptable, how and why they might be judged
acceptable, and how to devise and validate new ones.</p>
<p>More relevant to the present post is that even the literature and
pedagogy of writing paper proofs is rife with defaults. I spend a lot of
time teaching about proof by induction, and I find that my students,
most of whom have learned something about proving stuff in the past,
often arrive constrained by a very regimented approach to induction,
involving mandatory “base cases” and “induction cases” and these
nebulous “induction hypotheses” which seem to descend from the sky when
invoked by arcane ceremony. I have some strong feelings about this,
mostly due to my own struggles with gaining comfort with induction as a
student, so I try to help students evade those struggles.</p>
<p>Taken at face value, this post is about some other proof principle,
proof by infinite descent, but at its heart it’s really about induction.
Ideally by the end of this post, I will have challenged, but also shed
light on, the nature of inductive proof cases and induction hypotheses.
As a bonus, you might see how induction can be used to explain another
proof principle that intuitively seems valid, but for which it may not
be obvious how to justify it formally.</p>
<h2 id="two-proofs-that-sqrt2-is-not-rational">Two Proofs That <span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is Not Rational</h2>
<p>In an excellent <a href="https://math.andrej.com/2010/03/29/proof-of-negation-and-proof-by-contradiction/">blog
post</a> about the difference between proof of negation and proof by
contradiction, Andrej Bauer gives as an example a proof that <span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is not a rational number. The
article is worth a read, but I would note in particular that in a
technical sense, his proof is not a proof that it <em>is an irrational
number</em>, just that it is not a rational number. I imagine that one
could also prove that <span>\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> is
not rational, but that had better not count as a proof that it is
irrational! However, if we also prove that <span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is a real number, which could be
done using Dedekind cuts for instance, then we can deduce that <span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is indeed irrational. And to no
one’s surprise, we can prove that <span>\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> is not a real number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong><span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is not rational.<br>
<em>Proof</em>. Suppose <span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>
were equal to a fraction <span>\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> with <span>\(a\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span> relatively prime. Then we would get
<span>\(a^2 = 2b^2\)</span>, hence <span>\(a^2\)</span> is even and so is <span>\(a\)</span>. Write <span>\(a =
2c\)</span> and plug it back in to get <span>\(2c^2
= b^2\)</span>, from which we conclude that <span>\(b\)</span> is even as well. This is a
contradiction since <span>\(a\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span> were assumed to be relatively prime.
QED.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a proof of the negation of some proposition, i.e., that
assuming the truth of the proposition implies a contradiction. Let’s
consider some of its details.</p>
<p>First, the proof assumes that <span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is equal to a fraction <span>\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span>, which implicitly implies
that <span>\(a\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span> are integers and that <span>\(b\)</span> is not 0. We <em>could</em> limit the
two numbers to be naturals, by which I mean non-negative integers,
applying the convention that <span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> denotes specifically the
positive root, but since there exists a negative number that when
squared equals 2, and since generalizing the claim plays into my overall
story, let’s make no commitment to whether <span>\(a\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span> are positive or negative.</p>
<p>Next, the proof uses the fact that every rational number can be
represented by a fraction <span>\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> such that <span>\(a\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span> are relatively prime, in other words
that no positive integer other than 1 divides them evenly, which is a
precise way of saying that <span>\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> is in reduced form. This is a
fact that needs to be proved separately and prior to this proof. We
could instead ntegrate this reasoning directly into the proof: omit the
relative primality assumption, and then let <span>\(a' = a/\gcd(a,b)\)</span> and <span>\(b' = b/\gcd(a,b)\)</span> where <span>\(gcd(a,b)\)</span> is the greatest common divisor
of both. It then follows from some proof effort that <span>\(a'\)</span> and <span>\(b'\)</span> are relatively prime and <span>\(\frac{a'}{b'} = \frac{a}{b}\)</span>, thus
completing the general proof. However, we’re still using an auxiliary
fact that can be proven by induction: that <span>\(a\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span> have a unique greatest common divisor.
More on that below.</p>
<p>From these assumptions and facts, the proof deduces that both <span>\(a\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span> are even, which means that <span>\(2\)</span> divides both of them, which contradicts
the assumption that among positive integers only 1 can do this. So
assuming that <span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is rational
leads to contradiction.</p>
<p>Now to drive the topic of this post, here’s a more annoying proof of
the same fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Suppose <span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>
were equal to a fraction <span>\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span>. Then we would get <span>\(a^2 = 2b^2\)</span>, hence <span>\(a^2\)</span> is even and so is <span>\(a\)</span>. Write <span>\(a =
2c\)</span> and plug it back in to get <span>\(2c^2
= b^2\)</span>, from which we conclude that <span>\(b\)</span> is even as well. Write <span>\(b = 2d\)</span> and plug it back in to get <span>\(c^2 = 2d^2\)</span>. This yields a contradiction
because we could divide our integers by <span>\(2\)</span> forever, which is impossible. QED.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the upside, this proof gets to omit the assumption that <span>\(a\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span> are relatively prime, which in turn
means we don’t need to consult Wikipedia to remind ourselves what the
heck “relatively prime” means anyway. But on the other hand...what just
happened?!? Intuitively this makes sense, but is this legit?</p>
<p>While Andrej’s proof is a direct proof of negation, this annoying one
is an example of <em>proof by infinite descent</em>, which according to
Wikipedia is a particular kind of proof by contradiction, and relies on
something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_infinite_descent">the
well-ordering principle</a>. By the end of this post, I hope to convince
you that: a) it is not a kind of proof by contradiction: rather it’s a
technique for proving negation, so this claim deserves some
finger-wagging from Andrej. b) it does not rely on the well-ordering
principle, and good thing that because if it did, then the annoying
proof would be broken, but it’s not.</p>
<p>We should be able to ascertain from a formal statement of the
principle that it is simply a proof of negation. Andrej’s post
elaborates on the source of confusion. And what is the problem with the
claim that proof by infinite descent relies on well-ordering, whatever
that is? To explain, let’s first pinpoint a more fundamental and general
property, called <em>well-foundedness</em>, and reasoning principle,
<em>well-founded induction</em>, that the principle of infinite descent
can be based upon and even generalized, and use that to explain the
confusion. Along the way, we’ll produce a different explanation of proof
by infinite descent in terms of induction: an explanation that suits my
induction-happy brain better. Also, we’ll get the opportunity to
investigate induction itself: in particular, I want to demonstrate that
the common “base case/induction case” recipe for induction is a useful
but limiting view of how induction can be applied.</p>
<h2 id="well-foundedness-and-well-ordering">Well-foundedness and
Well-ordering</h2>
<p>As you might guess from the above two proofs, they depend on some
notion of “getting smaller”, and in the case of natural numbers the
default notion is the less-than relation <span>\(&lt;\)</span>, but less-than-ness is just an
example of a more general phenomenon. So first, let’s isolate the
property of <span>\(&lt;\)</span> on natural numbers
that really powers induction. A binary relation <span>\(\sqsubset\)</span> is called <em>well-founded</em>
if all leftward chains of the form <span>\(\dots
\sqsubset x_3 \sqsubset x_2 \sqsubset x_1\)</span> must be finite in
length, so there cannot exist any <em>infinite descending chains</em>.
The <span>\(&lt;\)</span> relation on natural
numbers has this property, because starting from any <span>\(n\)</span> and producing smaller numbers and
stopping whenever you want, you will always have to stop, either
necessarily at <span>\(0\)</span> or earlier by
choice. On the other hand, <span>\(&lt;\)</span>
extended to integers does not have this property because you can go
forever down the negative numbers, e.g., <span>\(\dots -16 &lt; -8 &lt; -4 &lt; -2\)</span>.
Luckily, <span>\(&lt;\)</span> isn’t the only binary
relation on integers! Here’s a different one that <em>is</em>
well-founded: if <span>\(z_1,z_2 \in
\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, say <span>\(z_1
\mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}z_2\)</span> if and only if <span>\(\lvert z_1\rvert &lt; \lvert z_2\rvert\)</span>,
where <span>\(\lvert z\rvert\)</span> denotes the
absolute value of <span>\(z\)</span> and <span>\(&lt;\)</span> is restricted to natural numbers.
Then <span>\(2
\mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}3\)</span> but also <span>\(-2 \mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}3\)</span>,
<span>\(2
\mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}{-3}\)</span>, and <span>\(-2
\mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}-3\)</span>: the sign of the integer
is ignored! Notice, though, that <span>\(2\)</span>
and <span>\(-2\)</span> are not related by <span>\(\mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}\)</span> in
either direction. Since every leftward chain of the <span>\(\mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}\)</span>
relation works its way toward <span>\(0\)</span>,
the center of the number line, we can see that all such chains must be
finite.</p>
<p>Since “well-ordering” and “well-founded” both start with “well-”, you
might suspect that there’s a relationship between them, and you’d be
right. Well-orderedness is described a variety of ways in the
literature, but for our purposes the following is the most relevant
formulation: a well-founded relation <span>\(\sqsubset\)</span> is a well-ordering if and only
if it relates every distinct pair of elements, i.e. <span>\(x_1 \neq x_2\)</span> implies either <span>\(x_1 \sqsubset x_2\)</span> or <span>\(x_2 \sqsubset x_1\)</span>. So based on what we’ve
observed, <span>\(&lt;\)</span> is well-ordered, but
<span>\(\mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}\)</span> is
not (remember <span>\(2\)</span> and <span>\(-2\)</span>?).</p>
<p>To tie up a loose terminological end, consider the “-ordering” and
“-founded” suffixes. Well-orderings must be transitive: if <span>\(x_1 \sqsubset x_2\)</span> and <span>\(x_2 \sqsubset x_3\)</span> then <span>\(x_1 \sqsubset x_3\)</span>. The consequent must
hold because if it didn’t, then totality would force <span>\(x_3 \sqsubset x_1\)</span>, but that would
introduce a three-element cycle <span>\(\dots
\sqsubset x_3 \sqsubset x_1 \sqsubset x_2 \sqsubset x_3\)</span> and
break well-foundedness. Then, given some well-ordering <span>\(\sqsubset\)</span>, extending it to the relation
<span>\(\sqsubseteq\)</span>, which extends <span>\(\sqsubset\)</span> to be reflexive, is a <em>total
order</em>, i.e., a partial order (reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric
relation) that is also total. On the other hand, a well-founded relation
does not have to be transitive, let alone total, so extending one in
this manner is not even guaranteed to get you a partial order, let alone
a total one. Hence the suffix “-founded”.</p>
<h2 id="proof-by-infinite-descent-generalized">Proof by Infinite
Descent, Generalized</h2>
<p>Now that we have some grasp of well-foundedness, and why
well-orderedness is a red herring, Let’s use it to state the Principle
of Proof by Infinite Descent precisely and generally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem: Principle of Infinite Descent</strong><br>
Let <span>\(X\)</span> be a set and <span>\(\sqsubset\)</span> a well-founded relation on
<span>\(X\)</span>. Furthermore let <span>\(\Phi(x)\)</span> be some property of elements
<span>\(x\)</span> of <span>\(X\)</span>. Then if for every <span>\(x\)</span> in <span>\(X\)</span>, <span>\(\Phi(x)\)</span> implies <span>\(\Phi(y)\)</span> for some <span>\(y \sqsubset x\)</span>, it follows that <span>\(\Phi(x)\)</span> does not hold for any <span>\(x\)</span> in <span>\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Stated in formal logical notation: <span>\[(\forall x\in X.\, \Phi(x) \implies \exists y \in
X.\, y \sqsubset x \land \Phi(y)) \implies \forall x\in X.\,
\neg\Phi(x).\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The premise of the principle formalizes the idea that “no matter
where you are (which x), you can still make a ’descending’ step.”, and
the conclusion is that “well, if so then your property can’t apply to
any x: it leads to contradiction.” Arguably a better name for the
principle would be Proof by <em>No</em> Infinite Descent (thanks to
Andrej for this observation!).</p>
<p>Our proof that <span>\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is not
rational implicitly applies this principle: Let <span>\(X\)</span> be the integers <span>\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>; for integers <span>\(a,b\)</span>, let <span>\(a
\sqsubset b\)</span> be <span>\(a
\mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}b\)</span>; and let the property
<span>\(\Phi(a)\)</span> be “<span>\(a^2 = 2b^2\)</span> for some integer <span>\(b\)</span>” (formally, <span>\(\exists b\in \mathbb{Z}.\,a^2 = 2b^2\)</span>).
Assuming <span>\(a\)</span> and taking <span>\(b\)</span>, the proof uses division by <span>\(2\)</span> to produce a <span>\(c \mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}a\)</span>
for which some <span>\(d\)</span> satisfies the
equation. Having satisfied the premises of the principle, we use it to
deduce that no <span>\(a\)</span> satisfies the
property (though admittedly the prose proof shrouds this use of the
principle in squishy “forever is impossible” terminology).</p>
<p>The intuition for the principle is pretty straightforward: if the
premises hold, then in principle we can build an infinite descending
<span>\(\mathbin{\mathbin{\lvert&lt;\rvert}}\)</span>-sequence
of integers that satisfy the property. But there are no such infinite
sequences, because we assumed that all of them must be finite, so a
contradiction must follow.</p>
<p>But let’s buttress this intuition with rigour. We can <em>prove</em>
this principle as a consequence of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Principle of Well-founded Induction</strong>: Let <span>\(X\)</span> be a set and <span>\(\sqsubset\)</span> a <em>well-founded
relation</em> on <span>\(X\)</span>. Then let <span>\(\Psi(x)\)</span> be some property of elements
<span>\(x\)</span> of <span>\(X\)</span>. Then if for every <span>\(x\)</span> in <span>\(X\)</span>, <span>\(\Psi(y)\)</span> holding for every <span>\(y \sqsubset x\)</span> suffices to prove <span>\(\Psi(x)\)</span>, it follows that <span>\(\Psi(x)\)</span> holds for every <span>\(x\)</span> in <span>\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Stated in formal logical notation: <span>\[(\forall x\in X.\, (\forall y \in X.\, y
\sqsubset x \implies \Psi(y)) \implies \Psi(x)) \implies  \forall x\in
X.\, \Psi(x).\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This principle is quite abstract, since it’s stated in terms of a
general principle. To clarify, let’s instantiate it with particular
well-founded relations that lead to principles with which we are
familiar. We already observed that <span>\(&lt;\)</span> is a well-founded relation on
natural numbers (because all well-orderings are also well-founded), we
can specialize well-founded induction to get what is often called
<em>strong mathematical induction</em> or <em>course-of-values
induction</em> on natural numbers: <span>\[(\forall
n\in \mathbb{N}.\, ((\forall m \in \mathbb{N}.\, m &lt;  n \implies
\Psi(m)) \implies \Psi(n)) \implies  \forall n\in \mathbb{N}.\,
\Psi(n).\]</span></p>
<p>The general structure of a proof by course-of-values induction is to
assume some natural number <span>\(n\)</span>, then
prove that assuming that <span>\(\Psi(m)\)</span>
holds for every number less than <span>\(n\)</span>
suffices to prove <span>\(\Psi(n)\)</span>.
Achieving that suffices to prove that <span>\(\Psi\)</span> holds for every natural number <span>\(n\)</span>. Observe that the assumption “<span>\(\Psi(m)\)</span> holds for every number less than
<span>\(n\)</span>” is what gets called an
“induction hypothesis”. In the common style of prose proofs, the
“induction hypothesis” often gets evoked in the middle of an argument,
and for a specific value, rather than explicitly assumed at the
beginning of the argument in full generality. To me this always seemed
to me to be some magical thing that got pulled out of the air in the
middle of the proof, leaving me unsure and about what kind of thing
induction even was. But in fact the induction hypothesis is just an
assumption that you make as you attempt to prove <span>\(\Psi(n)\)</span>, and its justification is hidden
in the proof of the principle of well-founded induction. Surprise: you
can prove induction principles correct, and devise and prove correct new
ones: they need not be taken as axioms!</p>
<p>Though students have often seen strong mathematical induction, they
are more familiar with plain ole’ mathematical induction, where the
“induction hypothesis” is to assume that a property holds for a natural
number one less than the current one. We can get this by using the
well-founded relation <span>\(n_1 &lt;_1
n_2\)</span> which holds if and only if <span>\(n_2
= n_1 + 1\)</span>. This relation is neither total nor an order since it
only ever relates abutting natural numbers. But, curiously enough, we
can still plug it into the Principle of Proof by Infinite Descent if we
want, and get something meaningful, albeit more restrictive, than using
<span>\(&lt;\)</span>.</p>
<p>Advertisement: I first learned about this perspective on induction
from Glynn Winskel’s excellent textbook, The Formal Semantics of
Programming Languages. I highly recommend it.</p>
<h2 id="what-even-is-a-base-case">What even is a “base case”?</h2>
<p>A common structure used in proofs that proceed by either mathematical
induction or course-of-values induction, or at least in teaching such
proofs, is to assume <span>\(n\)</span>, assume the
induction hypothesis, and then proceed by cases on whether <span>\(n = 0\)</span> or whether <span>\(n &gt; 0\)</span>. The first case gets called the
“base case” and is proven outright, and the second case gets called the
“inductive case” which exploits “the induction hypothesis” to complete
that case. When using induction more generally, as is common in PL
theory, this notion of base cases and induction cases gets emphasized as
well. However, it’s worth looking back at the principle of well-founded
induction and observing that nothing about that theorem forces a
particular case analysis, or restricts the availability of the premise
that gets called “the induction hypothesis”. The funny thing is that the
“base case” also has a perfectly fine induction hypothesis, but
typically it is useless because most of the time the proof in question
is not equipped to conjure an <span>\(m &lt;
n\)</span> with which to exploit it.</p>
<p>This template for applying the proof by course-of-values induction is
so common that often the split into base case vs. inductive case, where
the base case does not appeal to induction, gets baked right into the
explanation of the proof principle, as if it were part of the approach.
I find this categorical specialization to be unfortunate for two
reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason is that sometimes a proof needs a case split, but
this particular case split is <em>the wrong one</em>: in that it does
not help push the proof through. My favourite demonstration of this
phenomenon is a proof that any two positive natural numbers have a
greatest common divisor. This proof could be extended to integers, and
thus apply to Andrej’s proof as discussed above, but doing so would
deviate more from my main point than I would like. The proof involves a
helper lemma followed by a main theorem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> For all positive natural numbers <span>\(a\)</span> and for all positive natural numbers
<span>\(b\)</span>, if <span>\(a
\geq b\)</span> then there exists a positive natural number <span>\(c\)</span> such that <span>\(xc = a\)</span> for some positive natural <span>\(x\)</span> and <span>\(yc =
b\)</span> for some positive natural <span>\(y\)</span>, and furthermore if <span>\(d\)</span> is a positive natural number that
satisfies these properties, then <span>\(c \geq
d\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lemma can be proven by course-of-values induction. Then the
statement of the main theorem has the same structure, but does not
assume <span>\(a \geq b\)</span>. It can be proven
by splitting cases on whether <span>\(a \geq
b\)</span> or <span>\(b \geq a\)</span> and then
applying the lemma with the two numbers appropriately ordered (either
order will work if the numbers are equal).</p>
<p>I’m only going to give a sketch of the lemma’s proof, since it
suffices to make the relevant point. It proceeds by course-of-values
induction on <span>\(a\)</span> where the relevant
property of a is the substatement : “for all positive natural numbers
<span>\(b\)</span> ...” (now you know why I
explicitly separated the two variable quantifications in the prose
statement of the lemma). After assuming the induction hypothesis,
assuming <span>\(b\)</span> and assuming <span>\(a \geq b\)</span>, we proceed by cases on whether
<span>\(a = b\)</span> or <span>\(a &gt; b\)</span>. If <span>\(a = b\)</span> then we can show that the greatest
common divisor is the number itself, so <span>\(a\)</span>. If <span>\(a &gt;
b\)</span>, then we can show that the greatest common divisor of <span>\(a-b\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span> is also the greatest common divisor of
<span>\(a\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span>. However, to appropriately apply the
induction hypothesis, we must first determine which of <span>\(a-b\)</span> and <span>\(b\)</span> is larger: since <span>\(b\)</span> is positive, we know that <span>\(a-b &lt; a\)</span>, and we previously assumed
<span>\(b &lt; a\)</span>, so either can play the
role of “smaller <span>\(a\)</span>”, but to make
sufficient progress with the induction hypothesis, we need “next <span>\(b\)</span>” to be less than “smaller <span>\(a\)</span>”, so we split cases on whether <span>\(a-b &lt; a\)</span> or not, arbitrarily letting
the alternate case also handle <span>\(a-b =
a\)</span>.</p>
<p>The interesting part of the above proof is that two cases are
considered, and only one of them appeals to the induction hypothesis.
But the case that does not is not an <span>\(a=0\)</span> case as per the default template. In
fact <span>\(a = 0\)</span> could never apply since
we assumed that <span>\(a\)</span> is positive.</p>
<p>For exactness sake, it’s worth pointing out that one can perfectly
well devise a principle of course-of-values induction that applies to
just the positive integers, such that <span>\(a =
1\)</span> would be viewed as the “base case”. If we were to separate
out that case, we could deduce that <span>\(b =
1\)</span> because it must be a positive integer, and it must be less
than or equal <span>\(a\)</span>. So in practice,
the <span>\(a = 1\)</span> case can get handled
using the exact same reasoning as the other <span>\(a = b\)</span> cases, which happen to circumscribe
those situations where no appeal to an “induction hypothesis” is
required.</p>
<p>So the lesson to be drawn from my first gripe is that when performing
induction, if we reconceive of “base cases” to mean those cases that do
not appeal to an induction hypothesis, then such cases need not coincide
with the cases that involve the minimal elements of the well-founded
relation (or the unique minimum element of a well-ordered relation). For
many proofs the default heuristic helps, but that default is not a
universal law of induction.</p>
<h2 id="no-base-case-no-problem">No base case? no problem!</h2>
<p>To reiterate, my first problem with how course-of-values induction is
taught is that the default base-case/inductive-case split may not be the
most fruitful one. The second problem I have is that <em>you may not
even need such a split</em>. Usually it is assumed that there must be
some “base case”, that does not get to exploit the induction hypothesis,
for how could it ever apply? But in some proofs <em>you can always
exploit the induction hypothesis</em>. This is exactly the case in the
following proof of the Principle of Infinite Descent that uses the
Principle of Well-founded Induction.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem: Principle of Infinite Descent</strong> <span>\[(\forall x\in X.\, \Phi(x) \implies \exists y \in
X.\, y \sqsubset x \land \Phi(y)) \implies \forall x\in X.\,
\neg\Phi(x).\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose <span>\((\forall
x\in X.\, \Phi(x) \implies \exists y \in X.\, y \sqsubset x \land
\Phi(y))\)</span>. Now we prove <span>\(\forall x\in
X.\, \neg\Phi(x)\)</span> by well-founded induction on <span>\(x\in X\)</span>. We will use as our predicate
<span>\(\Psi(x) := \neg\Phi(x)\)</span>, which is
synonymous with <span>\(\Phi(x) \implies
\bot\)</span>, i.e. <span>\(\Phi(x)\)</span> implies
contradiction. Suppose <span>\(x \in X\)</span>, and
suppose <span>\(((\forall y \in X.\, y \sqsubset x
\implies \neg\Phi(y))\)</span> At this point it suffices to show <span>\(\neg\Phi(x)\)</span>, for which it suffices to
assume <span>\(\Phi(x)\)</span> and deduce a
contradiction. So suppose <span>\(\Phi(x)\)</span>.
Now, applying our first assumption to this particular <span>\(x\)</span>, we learn <span>\(\Phi(x) \implies \exists y \in X.\, y \sqsubset x
\land \Phi(y))\)</span>, and combining this with our most recent
assumption, we learn that <span>\(\exists y \in X.\,
y \sqsubset x \land \Phi(y)\)</span>, so consider that <span>\(y \in X\)</span>. Since <span>\(y \sqsubset x\)</span>, we can use the induction
hypothesis to prove <span>\(\neg\Phi(y)\)</span>.
But we also have <span>\(\Phi(y)\)</span>, to which
we can apply <span>\(\neg\Phi(y)\)</span> to deduce
a contradiction. QED.</p>
<p>This proof of proof by infinite descent used course of values
induction, but did not need to consider distinct cases related to <span>\(x \in X\)</span>. There is no “base case” here, in
the sense that no part of the proof must be separately completed without
the help of an induction hypothesis. Now, when specialized to natural
numbers, one <em>could</em> do so, breaking out the <span>\(0\)</span> case and arguing directly that there is
no smaller number, without reference at all to <span>\(\Phi(x)\)</span>. Or more nebulously, we can split
on “minimal elements” versus “non-minimal elements”, but to what
end?</p>
<h2 id="part-way-back-around-without-proof-by-contradiction">Part way
back around, without proof by contradiction</h2>
<p>The following is a bonus: thanks to Andrej who made the observation
that inspired it.</p>
<p>We’ve proven that if <span>\(\sqsubset\)</span>
is well-founded, then principle of infinite descent applies. What about
the reverse? The answer is “it depends.” In particular, if you prefer to
work without proof by contradiction (i.e. constructively), then you can
only get part way there. But with some use of proof by contradiction,
you can get all the way there. In particular, we can prove that for an
arbitrary binary relation <span>\(R\)</span> on a
set <span>\(X\)</span>, if it satisfies the
statement of the principle of infinite descent, then it has no infinite
descending chains. Wait, isn’t that enough? Well, no, not in a world
where you want to work constructively, without proof by contradiction. I
sneakily defined well-foundedness as the assertion that all chains are
finite, which is a stronger statement than the assertion that there can
be no infinite descending chains, so long as you avoid proof by
contradiction. The positive conception is nice because it works in both
contexts, whereas “no infinite descending chains”, which is often taken
as the definition of well-foundedness in classical logic, does not.</p>
<p>Ok on to the proof. First, let’s get precise about descending chains.
Define a descending chain of a binary relation <span>\(R\)</span> to be a partial function <span>\(f : \mathbb{N} \rightharpoonup X\)</span> such
that for all natural numbers <span>\(n\)</span>, if
<span>\(f(n+1)\)</span> is defined, then so is <span>\(f(n)\)</span>, and furthermore <span>\(f(n+1) \mathrel{R} f(n)\)</span>. Then an infinite
descending chain is a descending chain that is defined for every natural
number <span>\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, we can prove that if <span>\(R\)</span> is
an arbitrary binary relation (rather than a well-founded onw) that
nonetheless satisfies the letter of the principle of infinite descent,
then <span>\(R\)</span> has no infinite descending
chains.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Suppose <span>\(R
\subseteq X\times X\)</span>, and suppose that for any property <span>\(\Phi(x)\)</span>: <span>\[(\forall x\in X.\, \Phi(x) \implies \exists y \in
X.\, y \mathrel{R} x \land \Phi(y)) \implies \forall x\in X.\,
\neg\Phi(x).\]</span> Then it suffices to assume <span>\(f : \mathbb{N} \to X\)</span> is an infinite
descending chain and then deduce a contradiction. To do so, it further
suffices to let <span>\(\Phi(x) := \exists
n\in\mathbb{N}.f(n)=x\)</span> and prove the premise of the
proof-by-infinite-descent-shaped assumption, because from that we can
deduce that <span>\(\forall x\in X.\neg\exists n\in
N.\,f(n)=x\)</span>, (i.e. <span>\(f\)</span> is
totally undefined, the empty partial function) which combined with <span>\(x = f(0)\)</span> and <span>\(n = 0\)</span> suffices to deduce a
contradiction.</p>
<p>Let’s prove the sufficient condition: suppose <span>\(x \in X\)</span> and <span>\(\Phi(x)\)</span>, i.e. that <span>\(f(n) = x\)</span> for some <span>\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. Then <span>\(\Phi(f(n+1)\)</span> holds, and by assumption
<span>\(f(n+1) \mathrel{R} f(n)\)</span>, which can
be combined to prove the existential conclusion. QED.</p>
<h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>
<p>According to John Stillwell’s Elements of Algebra (Section 2.10),
Blaise Pascal was “the first to use induction in the ’base case,
induction step’ format” in a paper from 1654. But our modern
understanding of induction has it’s origins in Richard Dedekind’s
seminal 1888 book “Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?” (sometimes
translated “What are the numbers and what are they for?”). Many
defaults—be they notation, techniques, and explanations—in mathematics
have historical origins that precede a more sophisticated understanding
of phenomena, and sometimes an impedance mismatch between the historical
and the modern can limit our understanding (treatment of variables and
functions by mathematical texts is one of my standard whipping horses,
but that’s a topic for another day). Those perspectives persist because
they were useful, and are still useful today, but it also helps to
consider how they might best be incorporated with those refined
conceptions we’ve gained since their inception.</p>
<p>As for the <em>use</em> of proof by infinite descent versus a proof
like Andrej’s that argues directly from minimality, one could reasonably
argue that explicitly calling out the existence of a minimal case is
more intuitively graspable for some arguments. It’s not clear to me
whether arguing from the perspective of “there must be one or more
minimal cases” versus “you can’t go down this way forever” is more
generally clear, especially once you have come to understand proof by
infinite descent. Furthermore, in the case of general well-foundedness,
there may not be <em>a</em> single smallest case, but rather a
(possibly) infinite number of minimal cases, in which case calling all
of them out abstractly may be less compelling than calling out a
singular minimum as was the case (pun intended) for the natural numbers.
Which argument is most enlightening probably depends on personal
taste.</p>

It is a great sadness and the only thing we can do is use their legacy to show children how beautiful our Sierra Nevada was,” Alejandra Melfo, an astrophysicist at the Universidad de los Andes in Mérida, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.</p><p>Venezuela had six glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, located about 16,000 feet above sea level. By 2011, five had already disappeared, but the Humboldt Glacier located near the second highest mountain in the country, Humboldt Peak, resisted the onslaught of the weather. Scientists believe its disappearance makes Venezuela the first country in the Americas — and the first country in modern history — to lose all its glaciers.</p><p>Glaciers are large masses of ice that have formed due to the accumulation of snow over centuries. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), they typically exist where average annual temperatures reach near-freezing levels and winter precipitation causes significant accumulations of&nbsp;snow.</p><p>An important aspect of glacier development is that temperatures during the rest of the year should not cause the complete loss of the previous winter’s snow accumulation, this is how glaciers are maintained and how they grow. And that’s what failed in the Humboldt case.</p><p>"In the case of the Humboldt, it's a process of erosion that has been going on for years without stopping," Melfo said. </p><p>With the increase in global temperatures due to climate change, the melting of large ice masses is a continuous phenomenon that, among other things, contributes to raising sea levels around the world.</p><p>"It is the end of a glacial cycle. And in the intertropical zones, basically below 5,000 meters, almost all the glaciers have been disappearing," said Maximiliano Bezada, a geological researcher at the University of Minnesota. "The case of Humboldt was iconic because it is at 4,800 meters and yet it remained for quite a long time, and that is a climatic anomaly."</p><p>Although the Humboldt Glacier was expected to last at least another decade, scientists had been unable to monitor the area where it's  located due to the country’s political turmoil.</p><p>“Venezuela’s glaciers are not the first to disappear, some have disappeared in Colombia and other countries. What happens is that Venezuela had few and all in the Sierra Nevada, I saw how the glaciers of Pico La Concha and Pico Bolívar disappeared. That is why it is the first country to run out of glaciers,” Melfo said.</p><h2>'The consequences of higher temperatures'</h2><p>Due to their large mass, glaciers tend to flow like very slow rivers. Although there is no universal consensus on how large an ice mass must be to be considered a glacier, the USGS states that a commonly accepted standard is about 25 acres. </p><p>The case of the Humboldt glacier is not the only one. Glaciers around the world are shrinking, and some are disappearing faster in defiance of scientific projections. A&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;client=webapp&amp;u=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1324" target="_blank">2023 study</a>&nbsp;analyzed the planet’s 215,000 terrestrial glaciers more comprehensively than previous research and concluded that, if temperatures continue to increase, 83% of the world’s glaciers will be gone by the year 2100.</p><p>“Although the end of the glacier was something that was going to happen due to the cycle we are experiencing, there is no doubt that global warming, a product of greenhouse gases, has of course accelerated the disappearance process,” Bezada said.</p><p>Between 1952 and 2019 alone, Venezuela’s glacier surface went from 2,317 square kilometers to just 0.046 square kilometers, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;client=webapp&amp;u=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230430.2020.1822728" target="_blank">a 2020 study</a>.</p><p>“There are several projects that monitor change in the Sierra Nevada with temperature sensors buried in the ground and that are measured every six months. The evidence shows warming, in addition, the plants that grow there are changing because climate change is already felt in the peaks of the Andes,” Melfo said.</p><p>Researchers believe that the El Niño climate phenomenon influenced the melting of the Humboldt Glacier, because it causes warmer temperatures that accelerate the disappearance of tropical glaciers.</p><p>“The speed at which glaciers are melting is evidence of climate change. However, this is not new. Glaciers began to disappear a long time ago, but the speed has changed due to high temperatures," Melfo said. "Beyond the glaciers, we are seeing rapid changes in the composition of species, plants and animals, and this is recorded. Denying climate change has become a very dangerous thing for everyone."</p><p>The Andes region — a mountain range running through parts of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela — has seen a temperature rise of at least 0.10 degrees Celsius over the past seven decades. For several scientists, that is one of the main reasons why Venezuela has lost all its glaciers.</p><p>“In the Andean zone of Venezuela, there have been some months with monthly anomalies above average, which is exceptional in those tropical latitudes,” said Maximiliano Herrera, climatologist and weather historian.</p><p>However, the melting of the glacier is also an opportunity for further study. Melfo said that the end of the glacier in Venezuela marks the beginning of a new process in the area and an event that will have to be investigated.</p><p>"Life starts to rise and colonize the rock. The lichens come first, then the mosses create the soil, organic matter is created and that creates conditions for the plants to arrive, and then the animals come. This is how an ecosystem is assembled; it's called primary succession and it is a unique process," she said. </p><p>Meanwhile, what little ice remains on Humboldt will continue to melt. Residents of Mérida, including Melfo, say the glacier will continue to exist as long as the white vestiges can be seen from the city — which stopped happening with the other glaciers.</p><p>“For the people of Mérida, perhaps the most beloved glacier was that of Pico Bolívar, which since 2012 was a remnant of a glacier. However, people continued to say that it was a glacier until the last bit of ice that could be seen from the city disappeared in 2020," Melfo said. "I think the same thing is going to happen with the Humboldt: until the last piece disappears, we are going to continue saying that it is a glacier."</p><p><a href="https://www.telemundo.com/noticias/noticias-telemundo/medio-ambiente/glaciar-humboldt-venezuela-rcna153532" target="_blank">An earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo.</a></p><br></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><p><span data-testid="byline-thumbnail"></span><span data-testid="byline-name">Albinson Linares, Noticias Telemundo</span><span></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

And why did it stop?&nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>The Roots of RAND</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Economists, physicists, and statisticians — civilian scientists to that point not traditionally valued by the military — first proved their utility in the late stages of World War II operational planning. American bomber units needed to improve their efficiency over long distances in the Pacific theater. The scientists hired by the Army Air Force proposed what at the time seemed a radical solution: removing the B-29 bomber’s armor to reduce weight and increase speed. This ran counter to USAAF doctrine, which assumed that an unprotected plane would be vulnerable to Japanese air attacks. The doctrine proved incorrect. The increased speed not only led to greater efficiency, it also led to more U.S. planes returning safely from missions, as Japanese planes and air defense systems were unable to keep up.<sup>

</sup>
 Civilian scientists were suddenly in demand. By the end of the war, all USAAF units had built out their own operations research departments to optimize battle strategy. When the war ended, the question turned to how to retain the scientific brain trust it had helped to assemble.&nbsp;</p><p>General Henry “Hap” Arnold, who had led the Army Air Force’s expansion into the most formidable air force in the world, had started to consider this question long before the war had ended. He found an answer in September 1945, when Franklin Collbohm, a former test pilot and executive at Douglas Aircraft, walked into Arnold’s office with a plan: a military-focused think tank staffed by the sharpest civilian scientists. Collbohm did not have to finish describing his idea before Arnold jumped and agreed. Project RAND was born.</p><p>Arnold, along with General Curtis LeMay — famous for his “strategic bombing” of Japan, which killed hundreds of thousands of civilians — scrounged up $10 million from unspent war funds to provide the project’s seed money, which was soon supplemented with a grant from the Ford Foundation. This put RAND into a privileged position for a research organization: stably funded.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that financial stability, RAND built what would become one of its greatest organizational strengths: a legendarily effective culture, and a workforce to match it.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Internal Culture and Talent</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>In an <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/drafts/DRU218.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal memo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Augenstein" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruno Augestein</a>, a mathematician and physicist whose research on ballistic missiles helped usher in the missile age, highlighted a set of factors that catalyzed RAND’s early success. In short: RAND had the best and brightest people working with the best computing resources in an environment that celebrated excellence, welcomed individual quirks, and dispensed with micromanagement and red tape.</p><p>Early RAND leadership was, above all else, committed to bringing in top talent and jealously guarded the sort of intellectual independence to which their academic hires were accustomed. Taking the mathematics department as an example, RAND hired <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/11/22/archives/john-williams-55-a-rand-researcher.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Williams</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Harris_(mathematician)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Harris</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/08/obituaries/edward-s-quade-79-was-rand-researcher.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ed Quade</a> to run it. While these were accomplished mathematicians in their own right, these three were also able to attract superlative talents to work under and around them. As Alex Abella writes in <em>Soldiers of Reason</em>, his history of RAND, “No test for ideological correctness was given to join, but then none was needed. The nation’s best and brightest joining RAND knew what they were signing on for, and readily accepted the vision of a rational world — America and its Western allies — engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the forces of darkness: the USSR.”&nbsp;</p><p>As the Cold War intensified, the mission became the sell. The aim of RAND, as the historian David Hounshell has it, “was nothing short of the salvation of the human race.”<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3"> -->
    <span id="fnref-3">
        3    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 The researchers attracted to that project believed that the only environment in which that aim could be realized was independent of the Air Force, its conventional wisdom, and — in particular — it’s conventional disciplinary boundaries</p><p>RAND’s earliest research aligned with the USAF’s (the Army Air Force had become its own service branch in 1947) initial vision: research in the hard sciences to attack problems like satellite launches and nuclear-powered jets.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4"> -->
    <span id="fnref-4">
        4    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 However, the mathematician John Davis Williams, Collbohm’s fifth hire, was convinced that RAND needed a wider breadth of disciplines to support the Air Force’s strategic thinking. He made the case to General LeMay, who supervised RAND, that the project needed “every facet of human knowledge to apply to problems.”<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-5" href="#fn-5"> -->
    <span id="fnref-5">
        5    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 To that end, he argued for recruiting economists, political scientists, and every other kind of social scientist. LeMay, once convinced, implored Williams to hire whoever it took to get the analysis right.</p><p>And so they did. RAND’s leadership invested heavily in recruiting the best established and emerging talent in academia. An invitation-only conference organized by Williams in New York in 1947 brought together top political scientists (Bernard Brodie), anthropologists (Margaret Mead), economists (Charles Hitch), sociologists (Hans Speier), and even a screenwriter (Leo Rosten). The promise of influence, exciting interdisciplinary research, and complete intellectual freedom drew many of the attendees to sign up.</p><p>Within two years, RAND had assembled 200 of America’s leading academics. The top end of RAND talent was (and would become) full of past (and future) Nobel winners, and Williams worked around many constraints — and eccentricities — to bring them on. For instance, RAND signed a contract with John von Neumann to produce a general theory of war, to be completed during a small slice of his time: that spent shaving. For his shaving thoughts, von Neumann received $200 a month, an average salary at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond the biggest names, RAND was <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/drafts/DRU218.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">“deliberate, vigorous, and proactive” in recruiting the “first-rate and youthful staff”</a> that made up most of its workforce. The average age of staff in 1950 was under 30.<sup>

    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 Competition between them helped drive the culture of excellence. Essays and working papers were passed around for comments, which were copious — and combative. New ideas had to pass “murder boards.” And the competition spilled into recreational life: Employees held tennis tournaments and boating competitions. James Drake, an aeronautical engineer, <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/faq.html%23:~:text=RAND%2520invented%2520windsurfing,%25E2%2580%259Cthe%2520father%2520of%2520windsurfing.%25E2%2580%259D" rel="noopener noreferrer">invented the sport of windsurfing</a>. The wives of RAND employees —&nbsp;who were, with a few notable exceptions, almost all male — even competed through a cooking club where they tried to make the most "exotic" recipes.</p><p>After bringing in such extraordinary talent, RAND’s leadership trusted them to largely self-organize.<strong> </strong>Department heads were given a budget and were free to spend it as they felt fit. They had control over personnel decisions, which allowed them the flexibility to attract and afford top talent. As a self-styled “university without students,” RAND researchers were affiliated with departments with clear disciplinary boundaries, which facilitated the movement of researchers between RAND and academia. But in practice, both departments and projects were organized along interdisciplinary lines.&nbsp;</p><p>The mathematics department brought on an anthropologist. The aeronautics department hired an MD. This hiring strategy paid off in surprising ways. For instance, while modeling the flow of drugs in the bloodstream, a group of mathematicians <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P2236-1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">stumbled upon a technique</a> to solve a certain class of differential equations that came to be used in understanding the trajectory of intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p></div>

											<p><h2><strong>Finding an Institutional Footing&nbsp;</strong></h2>
</p>
											<div><p>RAND was at the forefront of a postwar explosion in federal funding for science. Hundreds of millions of dollars poured into universities, think tanks, and industrial R&amp;D labs. Almost all of it was directed toward one purpose: maintaining military superiority over the Soviet Union. In 1950, over 90% of the federal research budget came from just two agencies: the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Defense.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-7" href="#fn-7"> -->
    <span id="fnref-7">
        7    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 Significant portions of this funding went toward basic research with no immediate military applications.<sup>

    <span id="fnref-8">

    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 Vannevar Bush, the influential head of the war-era Office of Scientific Research and Development, had argued for this approach in his 1945 book <em>Science, the Endless Frontier</em>: Freeing up scientists to follow their own research interests would inevitably lead to more innovation and ensure American technological dominance. Bush’s was not the only, or even the dominant, view of how postwar science should be organized —&nbsp;most science funding still went toward applied research — but his views helped inform the organization of a growing number of research institutions.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-9" href="#fn-9"> -->
    <span id="fnref-9">
        9    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
</p><p>No organization embodied this model more than RAND. Air Force contracts were the financial backbone of the organization. They provided the money required to run RAND, while profits were used to fund basic research. In the 1950s, USAF contracts comprised 56% of RAND’s work, while other sponsors made up just 7%.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-10" href="#fn-10"> -->
    <span id="fnref-10">

</sup>
 That left more than a third of RAND’s capacity open to pursue its own agenda in basic research. Many of the developments made there would be used in their applied research, making it stronger — and more profitable — in the process. This flywheel would become critical to RAND’s success.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Not all of these developments were successful, especially at first. RAND’s early research efforts in systems analysis — an ambitious pursuit in applying mathematical modeling that RANDites were optimistic could produce a holistic “science of warfare” — were flops. The first project, which aimed to optimize a strategic bombing plan on the Soviet Union, used linear programming, state-of-the-art computing, and featured no fewer than 400,000 different configurations of bombs and bombers. It proved of little use to war planners. Its assumptions fell prey to the “specification problem:” trying to optimize one thing, in this case, calculating the most damage for the least cost led to misleading and simplistic conclusions.<sup>

    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
&nbsp;</p><p>But RAND would soon find its footing, and a follow up to this work became a classic of the age. The 1954 paper <em>Selection and Use of Strategic Air Bases</em> proved the value of RAND’s interdisciplinary approach — though its conclusions were at first controversial. Up to the 1950s, there had been little analysis of how the Strategic Air Command, responsible for the United States’s long range bomber and nuclear deterrent forces, should use its Air Force bases. At the time, the SAC had 32 bases across Europe and Asia. The study, led by political scientist Albert Wohlstetter, found that the SAC was dangerously vulnerable to a surprise Soviet attack. The SAC’s radar defenses wouldn’t be able to detect low-flying Soviet bombers, which could reduce American bombers to ash — and thereby neutralize any threat of retaliation — before the Americans had a chance to react. Wohlstetter’s study recommended that the SAC keep its bombers in the U.S., dispersed at several locations to avoid concentration at any place.&nbsp;</p><p>LeMay, RAND’s original benefactor and commander of the SAC, resisted Wohlstetter’s conclusions. He worried the plan would reduce his control over the country’s nuclear fleet: With the SAC based in the U.S., LeMay would have to cede some authority to the rest of the U.S. Air Force. He pushed against it many times, proposing several alternatives in which the SAC kept control over the bombers, but no plan fully addressed the vulnerabilities identified by the report.&nbsp;</p><p>Undaunted — and sure of his logic — Wohlstetter pushed his conclusions even further. He proposed a fail-safe mechanism, where nuclear bombers would have to receive confirmation of their attack from multiple checkpoints along the way, to prevent rogue or mistaken orders from being followed. Wohlstetter went around LeMay, to Defense Secretary Charles Wilson and General Nathan Twining, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who ultimately accepted the study’s recommendations in full. It took over two decades, but they proved their value in 1980 when a faulty chip erroneously warned of an impending Soviet strike. While no order for a retaliatory attack was issued, had there been one, the fail-safe mechanism would have prevented the bombers from actually attacking the USSR. <em>Selection and Use of Strategic Air Bases</em> was a triumph for RAND. Not only had they provided correct advice to the USAF, they had also proved their independence from the institution’s internal politics.</p><p>And the flywheel would prove its value many times over. RAND’s basic research helped drive the development and strategy of ICBMs, the launch of the first meteorological satellite, and, later, on cost reductions in ICBM launch systems.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Diversification and Decline</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>RAND’s conclusions ran counter to USAF doctrine several times — and each time RAND fought to maintain its independence. When the USAF commissioned RAND to study the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGM-27_Polaris" rel="noopener noreferrer">Navy’s Polaris program</a> — in order to show that it was inferior to the Air Force’s bombers for nuclear weapon delivery — RAND found that the Polaris missiles were, in fact, superior. The same happened <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/corporate_pubs/CP564.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">with another study</a>, which challenged the effectiveness of the B-70 bomber in 1959.</p><p>Over time, however, these tensions added friction to the relationship. To make matters worse, between 1955 and 1960, the <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2009/R3807.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">USAF’s budget declined</a> in both absolute terms, and relative to the rest of the defense community. In 1959, the Air Force froze RAND’s budget, presumably due to the budget cuts — and their disputes with RAND.&nbsp;</p><p>This situation was not unique to the USAF, or to RAND. As the 1950s rolled into the ’60s, scientists at civilian institutions increasingly moved to disentangle themselves from their military benefactors. Throughout the decade, DOD funding for basic research would only continue to decline.<sup>

    <span id="fnref-12">
        12    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
&nbsp;</p><p>RAND weathered the transition by successfully seeking out new customers — the AEC, ARPA, the Office of the Comptroller, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs (ISA), NASA, the NSF, the NIH, and the Ford Foundation, to name a few. The percent of the outside funding coming from the USAF dropped from 95% when RAND started to 68% in 1959.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-13" href="#fn-13"> -->
    <span id="fnref-13">
        13    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 But their success came at a cost: This diversification is what led to RAND losing its edge in producing the cutting edge of policy and applied science.</p><p>Funding diversification reshaped both RAND’s culture and output. The increased number of clients made scheduling researchers’ work harder. Each client expected a different standard of work, and the tolerance levels for RAND’s previously freewheeling style varied. The transaction costs of starting a new contract were much higher and the flexible staffing protocols that had worked for the USAF in the 1950s needed to be systematized. The larger organization led to ballooning internal administration expenses.</p><p>Along with all of this, RAND’s increased size attracted more political detractors. In 1958, a RAND paper called <em><a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2007/R308.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strategic Surrender</a></em>, which examined the historical conditions for surrender, had generated a political firestorm. Politicians were furious with RAND for exploring conditions under which it would be strategic for the U.S. to surrender. Senators weren’t particularly interested in the study itself, but those who wanted to run for president (like Stuart Symington of Missouri) <a href="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/ad/ad_v9_2/swj01.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">used it as evidence</a> that the Eisenhower administration was weak on defense.&nbsp;</p><p>The Senate even passed a resolution (with an 88–2 margin) prohibiting the use of federal funds for studying U.S. surrender. RAND’s management, realizing that an intentional misinterpretation of their work potentially threatened future funding streams, now had to consider the wider domestic political context of their work. All of these factors changed RAND’s culture from one that encouraged innovation and individuality to one that sapped creativity.&nbsp;</p><p>But the biggest change was yet to come. In 1961, Robert McNamara took over the Department of Defense and brought with him a group of RAND scholars, commonly called the “Whiz Kids.” Their most important long-term contribution to U.S. governance was the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System. PPBS took a Randian approach to resource allocation, namely, modeling the most cost-effective ways to achieve desired outcomes. In 1965, after President Johnson faced criticism for poor targeting of his Great Society spending, he required nearly all executive agencies to adopt PPBS. Many RAND alumni were hired by McNamara and his team to help with the Great Society’s budgeting process.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1965, Henry Loomis, the deputy commissioner on education, approached RAND about conducting research on teaching techniques. Franklin Collbohm, RAND’s founder and then president, declined. He preferred that RAND stay within the realm of military analysis. RAND’s board disagreed and would eventually push Collbohm out of RAND in 1967. The board thought it was time for a change in leadership — and to RAND’s nonmilitary portfolio.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220811023739/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/henry-s-rowen-professor-economist-and-ex-president-of-rand-dies-at-90.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">entry of a new president</a>, Henry S. Rowen, an economist who had started his career at RAND, cemented this change. By 1972, the last year of Rowen’s tenure, almost half of all RAND projects were related to social science. For better or worse, this eroded RAND’s ability to take on cutting-edge scientific research and development.&nbsp;</p><p>RAND entered domestic policy research with a splash — or, rather, a belly flop. The politics of social policy research were markedly different from working with the DOD. For one, there were substantially more stakeholders — and they were more vocal about voicing their disagreements. One crucial example is when RAND proposed police reforms in New York City, but pressure from the police unions forced them to retract.&nbsp;</p><p>John Lindsay, the Republican mayor of New York, had tasked RAND with improving the New York Police Department, which had recently been implicated in narcotics scams, corruption, and police brutality. The report showed that in less than 5% of the cases in which an officer was charged with a crime or abusing a citizen did the officers receive anything more than a reprimand. The findings were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/08/archives/study-here-suggests-police-rookies-with-poor-ratings-should-be.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked to </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/08/archives/study-here-suggests-police-rookies-with-poor-ratings-should-be.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a></em>, which added to the impression among the police that RAND was the mayor’s mouthpiece.&nbsp;</p><p>RAND, for the first time, had to face the reality of <em>local</em> politics: a sometimes hostile environment, multiple stakeholders who sometimes acted in bad faith, and none of the free reign that characterized their first decades. RAND’s experience with the police report, and the controversy over the study of surrender, led RAND to be more conservative about the research it put out. And additionally, the focus on policy research crowded out the scientific research.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, beginning in the 1970s, <a href="https://www.rand.org/topics/mathematics.html?content-type=research&amp;page=5" rel="noopener noreferrer">RAND’s applied mathematics research</a> output slowed to a trickle, before stopping altogether in the 1990s. It was replaced by mathematics education policy. The same is true for <a href="https://www.rand.org/topics/physics.html?page=2" rel="noopener noreferrer">physics</a>, <a href="https://www.rand.org/topics/chemistry.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">chemistry</a>, and <a href="https://www.rand.org/topics/astronomy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">astronomy</a>. Another emblematic development in the dilution of RAND’s focus was the founding in 1970 of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, the nation’s first Ph.D.-granting program in policy analysis. While the idea of training the next generation in RAND techniques is admirable, RAND in the early years explicitly defined itself as a “university without students.”</p><p>RAND is still an impressive organization. It continues to produce successful policy research, which commands the eyes of policymakers in over 82 federal organizations and across dozens of local and even foreign governments. Still, their work today is inarguably less groundbreaking and innovative than it was in the ’50s. This relative decline was partially caused by internal policy choices, and partially by the eventual loss of their initial team of leading scientists. But part of it was also inevitable: We no longer live in an era when branches of the U.S. military can cut massive blank checks to think tanks in the interests of beating the Soviets. The successes of 1950s RAND do come with lessons for modern research organizations —&nbsp;about the importance of talent, the relevance of institutional culture, and the possibilities of intellectual freedom —&nbsp;but the particular conditions that created them can’t be replicated. It is remarkable that they existed at all.&nbsp;</p></div>
