<p dir="auto">Bash is great, but when it comes to writing more complex scripts,
many people prefer a more convenient programming language.
JavaScript is a perfect choice, but the Node.js standard library
requires additional hassle before using. The <code>zx</code> package provides
useful wrappers around <code>child_process</code>, escapes arguments and
gives sensible defaults.</p>

<p>Movie companies have lost a third attempt to unmask Reddit users who posted comments discussing piracy. In an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.423189/gov.uscourts.cand.423189.26.0.pdf">order</a> on Wednesday, the US District Court for the Northern District of California rejected movie copyright holders' demand for seven years' worth of "IP address log information" on six Reddit users.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.423189/gov.uscourts.cand.423189.1.0.pdf">motion to compel</a> that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/film-studios-demand-ip-addresses-of-people-who-discussed-piracy-on-reddit/">filed last month</a>, movie companies Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures argued that "Reddit users do not have a recognized privacy interest in their IP addresses." But in Wednesday's ruling, US Magistrate Judge Thomas Hixson said, "The Court finds no reason to believe provision of an IP address is not unmasking subject to First Amendment scrutiny."</p>
<p>Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures previously sued the Internet service provider Frontier Communications, alleging that it is liable for its users' copyright infringement. Seeking evidence for that case, the movie companies subpoenaed Reddit in an attempt to prove that Frontier has no meaningful policy for terminating repeat copyright infringers and that this lack of enforcement drew customers to Frontier's service.</p>
<p>"Reddit argues the Court should deny the motion because it is an unmasking subpoena, targeting a potential witness rather than a potential defendant, and is therefore subjected to First Amendment scrutiny," Hixson's order noted. Reddit also argued that the evidence sought by movie companies can be obtained instead from Frontier and from Frontier subscribers.</p>
<p>Hixson's order, which was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/reddit-doesnt-have-to-share-ip-addresses-of-piracy-commenters-court-rules-240208/">previously reported</a> by Torrent Freak, said that courts use a "higher standard for unmasking a non-party witness" than for potential defendants because "litigation can often continue without interfering with a non-party witness's First Amendment right to anonymity."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Reddit can protect First Amendment rights of users</h2>
<p>The ruling is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/judge-wont-force-reddit-to-identify-anonymous-users-who-discussed-piracy/">similar to previous</a> ones in which the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/reddit-beats-film-industry-wont-have-to-identify-users-who-admitted-torrenting/">same court denied</a> movie-industry attempts to unmask Reddit users. The fact that movie companies only sought IP addresses instead of names this time around wasn't enough to sway the court.</p>
<p>The previous cases are being called <em>Reddit I</em> and <em>Reddit II</em>. Voltage Holdings was one of the copyright holders involved in <em>Reddit I</em>, while both Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures were involved in <em>Reddit II</em>.</p>
<p>Hixson referred to the prior cases in this week's ruling, saying the third is similar in part because the "court adjudicating the copyright litigation has already ruled [the movie companies] can obtain identifying information from Frontier for IP addresses known to have pirated using Frontier's network." As in the previous cases, the movie companies "cannot show that the information they seek here is unavailable from other sources," Hixson wrote.</p>
<p>Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures cited Reddit posts in which users say that Frontier didn't terminate their Internet service despite sending many copyright infringement notices about torrent downloads. One of the users wrote, "I got a total of 44 emails from frontier about downloading torrents and that it could terminate service. They haven't yet. And I kinda feel like if they didn't do it after 44 emails. That they won't… ."</p>
<p>The movie companies argued that getting these Reddit users' IP addresses is relevant and proportional to the needs of the case because the comments support the allegation "that the ability to pirate content efficiently without any consequences is a draw for becoming a Frontier subscriber... and that Frontier does not have an effective policy for terminating repeat infringers."</p>
<p>But Reddit has the right to refuse to provide that information, Hixson decided. "The Ninth Circuit has recognized that Internet platforms can assert the First Amendment rights of their users, based on the close relationship between the platform and its users and the 'genuine obstacles' users face in asserting their rights to anonymity," Hixson wrote.</p>

Microsoft made the list because of its Windows OS and LinkedIn, and Google for its Chrome browser and search engine. The Commission gave the gatekeepers six months to comply with the DMA; failure would attract hefty fines and penalties.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nearly six years ago I wrote a blog post outlining <a href="https://pace.dev/blog/2018/05/09/how-I-write-http-services-after-eight-years.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how I write HTTP services in Go</a>, and I’m here to tell you, once again, how I write HTTP services.</p><p>That original post went a little viral and sparked some great discussions that have influenced how I do things today. And after years of hosting the <a href="https://changelog.com/gotime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Time podcast</a>, discussing Go on <a href="https://twitter.com/matryer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, and gaining more experience maintaining code like this over years, I thought it was time for a refresh.</p><p>(And for those pedants who notice Go isn’t exactly 13 years old, I started writing HTTP services in Go <a href="https://go.dev/doc/devel/pre_go1#r59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version .r59</a>.)</p><p>This post covers a range of topics related to building services in Go, including:</p><ul><li>Structuring servers and handlers for maximum maintainability&nbsp;</li><li>Tips and tricks for optimizing for a quick startup and graceful shutdown&nbsp;</li><li>How to handle common work that applies to many types of requests</li><li>Going deep on properly testing your services&nbsp;</li></ul><p>From small projects to large, these practices have stood the test of time for me, and I hope they will for you too.</p><h2 id="who-is-this-post-for">Who is this post for?</h2><p>This post is for you. It’s for everybody who plans to write some kind of HTTP service in Go. You may also find this useful if you’re learning Go, as lots of the examples follow good practices. Experienced gophers might also pick up some nice patterns.</p><p>To find this post most useful, you’ll need to know the basics of Go. If you don’t feel like you’re quite there yet, I cannot recommend <a href="https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn Go with tests</a> by Chris James enough. And if you’d like to hear more from Chris, you can check out the episode of Go Time we did with Ben Johnson on <a href="https://changelog.com/gotime/278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The files and folders of Go projects</a>.</p><p>If you’re familiar with the previous versions of this post, this section contains a quick summary of what’s different now. If you’d like to start from the beginning, skip to the next section.</p><ol><li>My handlers used to be methods hanging off a server struct, but I no longer do this. If a handler function wants a dependency, it can bloody well ask for it as an argument. No more surprise dependencies when you’re just trying to test a single handler.</li><li>I used to prefer <code>http.HandlerFunc</code> over <code>http.Handler</code> — enough third-party libraries think about <code>http.Handler</code> first that it makes sense to embrace that. <code>http.HandlerFunc</code> is still extremely useful, but now most things are represented as the interface type. It doesn’t make much difference either way.</li><li>I’ve added more about testing including some Opinions™.</li><li>I’ve added more sections, so a full read through is recommended for everybody.</li></ol><h2 id="the-newserver-constructor">The <code>NewServer</code> constructor</h2><p>Let’s start by looking at the backbone of any Go service: the server. The&nbsp; <code>NewServer</code> function makes the main <code>http.Handler</code>. Usually I have one per service, and I rely on HTTP routes to divert traffic to the right handlers within each service because:</p><ul><li><code>NewServer</code> is a big constructor that takes in all dependencies as arguments</li><li>It returns an <code>http.Handler</code> if possible, which can be a dedicated type for more complex situations</li><li>It usually configures its own muxer and calls out to <code>routes.go</code></li></ul><p>For example, your code might look similar to this:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func NewServer(
	logger *Logger
	config *Config
	commentStore *commentStore
	anotherStore *anotherStore
) http.Handler {
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	addRoutes(
		mux,
		Logger,
		Config,
		commentStore,
		anotherStore,
	)
	var handler http.Handler = mux
	handler = someMiddleware(handler)
	handler = someMiddleware2(handler)
	handler = someMiddleware3(handler)
	return handler
}</code></pre></div><p>In test cases that don’t need all of the dependencies, I pass in <code>nil</code> as a signal that it won’t be used.</p><p>The <code>NewServer</code> constructor is responsible for all the top-level HTTP stuff that applies to all endpoints, like CORS, auth middleware, and logging:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>var handler http.Handler = mux
handler = logging.NewLoggingMiddleware(logger, handler)
handler = logging.NewGoogleTraceIDMiddleware(logger, handler)
handler = checkAuthHeaders(handler)
return handler</code></pre></div><p>Setting up the server is usually a case of exposing it using Go’s built-in <code>http</code> package:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>srv := NewServer(
	logger,
	config,
	tenantsStore,
	slackLinkStore,
	msteamsLinkStore,
	proxy,
)
httpServer := &amp;http.Server{
	Addr:    net.JoinHostPort(config.Host, config.Port),
	Handler: srv,
}
go func() {
	log.Printf("listening on %s\n", httpServer.Addr)
	if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil &amp;&amp; err != http.ErrServerClosed {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error listening and serving: %s\n", err)
	}
}()
var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Add(1)
go func() {
	defer wg.Done()
	&lt;-ctx.Done()
	if err := httpServer.Shutdown(ctx); err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error shutting down http server: %s\n", err)
	}
}()
wg.Wait()
return nil</code></pre></div><h3 id="long-argument-lists">Long argument lists</h3><p>There must be a limit at which point it stops being the right thing to do, but most of the time I am happy adding lists of dependencies as arguments. And while they do sometimes get quite long, I find it’s still worth it.</p><p>Yes, it saves me from making a struct, but the real benefit is that I get slightly more type safety from arguments. I can make a struct skipping any fields that I don’t like, but a function forces my hand. I have to look up fields to know how to set them in a struct, whereas I can’t call a function if I don’t pass the right arguments.</p><p>It’s not so bad if you format it as a vertical list, like I’ve seen in modern frontend code:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>srv := NewServer(
	logger,
	config,
	tenantsStore,
	commentsStore,
	conversationService,
	chatGPTService,
)</code></pre></div><h2 id="map-the-entire-api-surface-in-routesgo">Map the entire API surface in <code>routes.go</code></h2><p>This file is the one place in your service where all routes are listed.</p><p>Sometimes you can’t help but have things spread around a bit, but it’s very helpful to be able to go to one file in every project to see its API surface.</p><p>Because of the big dependency argument lists in the <code>NewServer</code> constructor, you usually end up with the same list in your routes function. But again, it’s not so bad. And again, you soon know if you forgot something or got the order wrong thanks to Go’s type checking.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func addRoutes(
	mux                 *http.ServeMux,
	logger              *logging.Logger,
	config              Config,
	tenantsStore        *TenantsStore,
	commentsStore       *CommentsStore,
	conversationService *ConversationService,
	chatGPTService      *ChatGPTService,
	authProxy           *authProxy
) {
	mux.Handle("/api/v1/", handleTenantsGet(logger, tenantsStore))
	mux.Handle("/oauth2/", handleOAuth2Proxy(logger, authProxy))
	mux.HandleFunc("/healthz", handleHealthzPlease(logger))
	mux.Handle("/", http.NotFoundHandler())
}</code></pre></div><p>In my example, <code>addRoutes</code> doesn’t return an error. Anything that can throw an error is moved to the <code>run</code> function and sorted out before it gets to this point leaving this function free to remain simple and flat. Of course, if any of your handlers do return errors for whatever reason, then fine, this can return an error too.</p><h2 id="func-main-only-calls-run"><code>func main()</code> only calls <code>run()</code></h2><p>The <code>run</code> function is like the <code>main</code> function, except that it takes in operating system fundamentals as arguments, and returns, you guessed it, an error.</p><p>I wish <code>func main()</code> was <code>func main() error</code>. Or like in C where you can return the exit code: <code>func main() int</code>. By having an ultra simple main function, you too can have your dreams come true:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func run(ctx context.Context, w io.Writer, args []string) error {
	// ...
}

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	ctx, cancel := signal.NotifyContext(ctx, os.Interrupt)
	defer cancel()
	if err := run(ctx, os.Stdout, os.Args); err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%s\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}</code></pre></div><p>The code above creates a context, which is cancelled by <code>Ctrl+C</code> or equivalent, and calls down to the <code>run</code> function. If <code>run</code> returns <code>nil</code>, the function exits normally. If it returns an error, we write it to stderr and exit with a non-zero code. If I’m writing a command line tool where exit codes matter, I would return an int as well so I could write tests to assert the right one was returned.</p><p>Operating system fundamentals are passed into run as arguments. For example, you might pass in <code>os.Args</code> if it has flag support, and even <code>os.Stdin</code>, <code>os.Stdout</code>, <code>os.Stderr</code> dependencies. This makes your programs much easier to test because test code can call run to execute your program, controlling arguments, and all streams, just by passing different arguments.</p><p>The following table shows examples of input arguments to the run function:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Value</strong></th><th><strong>Type</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>os.Args</code></td><td><code>[]string</code></td><td>The arguments passed in when executing your program. It’s also used for parsing flags.</td></tr><tr><td><code>os.Stdin</code></td><td><code>io.Reader</code></td><td>For reading input</td></tr><tr><td><code>os.Stdout</code></td><td><code>io.Writer</code></td><td>For writing output</td></tr><tr><td><code>os.Stderr</code></td><td><code>io.Writer</code></td><td>For writing error logs</td></tr><tr><td><code>os.Getenv</code></td><td><code>func(string) string</code></td><td>For reading environment variables</td></tr><tr><td><code>os.Getwd</code></td><td><code>func() (string, error)</code></td><td>Get the working directory</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you keep away from any global scope data, you can usually use <code>t.Parallel()</code> in more places, to speed up your test suites. Everything is self-contained, so multiple calls to <code>run</code> don’t interfere with each other.</p><p>I often end up with <code>run</code> function signatures that look like this:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func run(
	ctx    context.Context,
	args   []string,
	getenv func(string) string,
	stdin  io.Reader,
	stdout, stderr io.Writer,
) error</code></pre></div><p>Now that we’re inside the <code>run</code> function, we can go back to writing normal Go code where we can return errors like it’s nobody’s business. We gophers just love returning errors, and the sooner we admit that to ourselves, the sooner those people on the internet can win and go away.</p><h3 id="gracefully-shutting-down">Gracefully shutting down</h3><p>If you’re running lots of tests, it’s important for your program to stop when each one is finished. (Alternatively, you might decide to keep one instance running for all tests, but that’s up to you.)</p><p>The context is passed through. It gets cancelled if a termination signal comes into the program, so it’s important to respect it at every level. At the very least, pass it to your dependencies. At best, check the <code>Err()</code> method in any long-running or loopy code, and if it returns an error, stop what you’re doing and return it up. This will help the server to gracefully shut down. If you kick off other goroutines, you can also use the context to decide if it’s time to stop them or not.</p><h3 id="controlling-the-environment">Controlling the environment</h3><p>The <code>args</code> and <code>getenv</code> parameters give us a couple of ways to control how our program behaves through flags and environment variables. Flags are processed using the args (as long as you don’t use the global space version of flags, and instead use <code>flags.NewFlagSet</code> inside <code>run</code>) so we can call run with different values:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>args := []string{
	"myapp",
	"--out", outFile,
	"--fmt", "markdown",
}
go run(ctx, args, etc.)</code></pre></div><p>If your program uses environment variables over flags (or even both) then the <code>getenv</code> function allows you to plug in different values without changing the actual environment.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>getenv := func(key string) string {
	switch key {
	case "MYAPP_FORMAT":
		return "markdown"
	case "MYAPP_TIMEOUT":
		return "5s"
	default:
		return ""
}
go run(ctx, args, getenv)</code></pre></div><p>For me, using this <code>getenv</code> technique beats using <code>t.SetEnv</code> for controlling environment variables because you can continue to run your tests in parallel by calling <code>t.Parallel()</code>, which <code>t.SetEnv</code> doesn’t allow.</p><p>This technique is even more useful when writing command line tools, because you often want to run the program with different settings to test all of its behavior.</p><p>In the <code>main</code> function, we can pass in the real things:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	ctx, cancel := signal.NotifyContext(ctx, os.Interrupt)
	defer cancel()
	if err := run(ctx, os.Getenv, os.Stderr); err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%s\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}</code></pre></div><h2 id="maker-funcs-return-the-handler">Maker funcs return the handler</h2><p>My handler functions don’t implement <code>http.Handler</code> or <code>http.HandlerFunc</code> directly, they return them. Specifically, they return <code>http.Handler</code> types.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>// handleSomething handles one of those web requests
// that you hear so much about.
func handleSomething(logger *Logger) http.Handler {
	thing := prepareThing()
	return http.HandlerFunc(
		func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			// use thing to handle request
			logger.Info(r.Context(), "msg", "handleSomething")
		}
	)
}</code></pre></div><p>This pattern gives each handler its own closure environment. You can do initialization work in this space, and the data will be available to the handlers when they are called.</p><p>Be sure to only read the shared data. If handlers modify anything, you’ll need a mutex or something to protect it.</p><p>Storing program state here is not usually what you want. In most cloud environments, you can’t trust that code will continue running over long periods of time. Depending on your production environment, servers will often shut down to save resources, or even just crash for other reasons. There may also be many instances of your service running with requests load balanced across them in unpredictable ways. In this case, an instance would only have access to its own local data. So it’s better to use a database or some other storage API to persist data in real projects.</p><h2 id="handle-decodingencoding-in-one-place">Handle decoding/encoding in one place</h2><p>Every service will need to decode the request bodies and encode response bodies. This is a sensible abstraction that stands the test of time.</p><p>I usually have a pair of helper functions called encode and decode. An example version using generics shows you that you really are just wrapping a few basic lines, which I wouldn’t usually do, however this becomes useful when you need to make changes here for all of your APIs. (For example, say you get a new boss stuck in the 1990s and they want to add XML support.)</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func encode[T any](w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, status int, v T) error {
	w.WriteHeader(status)
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	if err := json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(v); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("encode json: %w", err)
	}

func decode[T any](r *http.Request) (T, error) {
	var v T
	if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&amp;v); err != nil {
		return v, fmt.Errorf("decode json: %w", err)
	}
	return v, nil
}</code></pre></div><p>Interestingly, the compiler is able to infer the type from the argument, so you don’t need to pass it when calling encode:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>err := encode(w, r, http.StatusOK, obj)</code></pre></div><p>But since it is a return argument in decode, you will need to specify the type you expect:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>decoded, err := decode[CreateSomethingRequest](r)</code></pre></div><p>I try not to overload these functions, but in the past I was quite pleased with a simple validation interface that fit nicely into the decode function.</p><h2 id="validating-data">Validating data</h2><p>I like a simple interface. Love them, actually. Single method interfaces are so easy to implement. So when it comes to validating objects, I like to do this:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>// Validator is an object that can be validated.
type Validator interface {
	// Valid checks the object and returns any
	// problems. If len(problems) == 0 then
	// the object is valid.
	Valid(ctx context.Context) (problems map[string]string)
}</code></pre></div><p>The <code>Valid</code> method takes a context (which is optional but has been useful for me in the past) and returns a map. If there is a problem with a field, its name is used as the key, and a human-readable explanation of the issue is set as the value.</p><p>The method can do whatever it needs to validate the fields of the struct. For example, it can check to make sure:</p><ul><li>Required fields are not empty</li><li>Strings with a specific format (like email) are correct</li><li>Numbers are within an acceptable range</li></ul><p>If you need to do anything more complicated, like check the field in a database, that should happen elsewhere; it’s probably too important to be considered a quick validation check, and you wouldn’t expect to find that kind of thing in a function like this, so it could easily end up being hidden away.</p><p>I then use a type assertion to see if the object implements the interface. Or, in the generic world, I might choose to be more explicit about what’s going on by changing the decode method to insist on that interface being implemented.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func decodeValid[T Validator](r *http.Request) (T, map[string]string, error) {
	var v T
	if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&amp;v); err != nil {
		return v, nil, fmt.Errorf("decode json: %w", err)
	}
	if problems := v.Valid(r.Context()); len(problems) &gt; 0 {
		return v, problems, fmt.Errorf("invalid %T: %d problems", v, len(problems))
	}
	return v, nil, nil
}</code></pre></div><p>In this code, <code>T</code> has to implement the <code>Validator</code> interface, and the <code>Valid</code> method must return zero problems in order for the object to be considered successfully decoded.</p><p>It’s safe to return <code>nil</code> for problems because we are going to check <code>len(problems)</code>, which will be <code>0</code> for a <code>nil</code> map, but which won’t panic.</p><h2 id="the-adapter-pattern-for-middleware">The adapter pattern for middleware</h2><p>Middleware functions take an <code>http.Handler</code> and return a new one that can run code before and/or after calling the original handler — or it can decide not to call the original handler at all.</p><p>An example is a check to make sure the user is an administrator:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func (s *server) adminOnly(h http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		if !currentUser(r).IsAdmin {
			http.NotFound(w, r)
			return
		}
		h(w, r)
	})
}</code></pre></div><p>The logic inside the handler can optionally decide whether to call the original handler or not. In the example above, if <code>IsAdmin</code> is false, the handler will return an <code>HTTP 404 Not Found</code> and return (or abort); notice that the <code>h</code> handler is not called. If <code>IsAdmin</code> is true, the user is allowed to access the route, and so execution is passed to the h handler.</p><p>Usually I have middleware listed in the <code>routes.go</code> file:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>package app

func addRoutes(mux *http.ServeMux) {
	mux.HandleFunc("/api/", s.handleAPI())
	mux.HandleFunc("/about", s.handleAbout())
	mux.HandleFunc("/", s.handleIndex())
	mux.HandleFunc("/admin", s.adminOnly(s.handleAdminIndex()))
}</code></pre></div><p>This makes it very clear, just by looking at the map of endpoints, which middleware is applied to which routes. If the lists start getting bigger, try splitting them across many lines — I know, I know, but you get used to it.</p><h2 id="sometimes-i-return-the-middleware">Sometimes I return the middleware</h2><p>The above approach is great for simple cases, but if the middleware needs lots of dependencies (a logger, a database, some API clients, a byte array containing the data for “Never Gonna Give You Up” for a later prank), then I have been known to have a function that returns the middleware function.</p><p>The problem is, you end up with code that looks like this:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>mux.Handle("/route1", middleware(logger, db, slackClient, rroll []byte, handleSomething(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route2", middleware(logger, db, slackClient, rroll []byte, handleSomething2(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route3", middleware(logger, db, slackClient, rroll []byte, handleSomething3(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route4", middleware(logger, db, slackClient, rroll []byte, handleSomething4(handlerSpecificDeps))</code></pre></div><p>This bloats out the code and doesn’t really provide anything useful. Instead, I would have the middleware function take the dependencies, but return a function that takes only the next handler.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func newMiddleware(
	logger Logger,
	db *DB,
	slackClient *slack.Client,
	rroll []byte,
) func(h http.Handler) http.Handler</code></pre></div><p>The return type <code>func(h http.Handler) http.Handler</code> is the function that we will call when setting up our routes.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>middleware := newMiddleware(logger, db, slackClient, rroll)
mux.Handle("/route1", middleware(handleSomething(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route2", middleware(handleSomething2(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route3", middleware(handleSomething3(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route4", middleware(handleSomething4(handlerSpecificDeps))</code></pre></div><p>Some people, but not I, like to formalize that function type like this:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>// middleware is a function that wraps http.Handlers
// proving functionality before and after execution
// of the h handler.
type middleware func(h http.Handler) http.Handler</code></pre></div><p>This is fine. Do it if you like. I’m not going to come around to your work, wait outside for you, and then walk alongside you with my arm around your shoulders in an intimidating way, asking if you’re pleased with yourself.</p><p>The reason I don’t do it is because it gives an extra level of indirection. When you look at the <code>newMiddleware</code> function’s signature above, it’s very clear what’s going on. If the return type is middleware, you have a little extra work to do. Essentially, I optimize for reading code, not writing it.</p><h3 id="an-opportunity-to-hide-the-requestresponse-types-away">An opportunity to hide the request/response types away</h3><p>If an endpoint has its own request and response types, usually they’re only useful for that particular handler.</p><p>If that’s the case, you can define them inside the function.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func handleSomething() http.HandlerFunc {
	type request struct {
		Name string
	}
	type response struct {
		Greeting string `json:"greeting"`
	}
	return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		...
	}
}</code></pre></div><p>This keeps your global space clear and also prevents other handlers from relying on data you may not consider stable.</p><p>You sometimes encounter friction with this approach when your test code needs to use the same types. And to be fair, this is a good argument for breaking them out if that’s what you want to do.</p><h2 id="use-inline-requestresponse-types-for-additional-storytelling-in-tests">Use inline request/response types for additional storytelling in tests</h2><p>If your request/response types are hidden inside the handler, you can just declare new types in your test code.</p><p>This is an opportunity to do a bit of storytelling to future generations who will need to understand your code.</p><p>For example, let’s say we have a <code>Person</code> type in our code, and we reuse it on many endpoints. If we had a <code>/greet</code> endpoint, we might only care about their name, so we can express this in test code:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func TestGreet(t *testing.T) {
	is := is.New(t)
	person := struct {
		Name string `json:"name"`
	}{
		Name: "Mat Ryer",
	}
	var buf bytes.Buffer
	err := json.NewEncoder(&amp;buf).Encode(person)
	is.NoErr(err) // json.NewEncoder
	req, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, "/greet", &amp;buf)
	is.NoErr(err)
	//... more test code here</code></pre></div><p>It’s clear from this test that the only field we care about is the <code>Name</code> field.</p><h2 id="synconce-to-defer-setup"><code>sync.Once</code> to defer setup</h2><p>If I have to do anything expensive when preparing the handler, I defer it until that handler is first called.</p><p>This improves application startup time.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func (s *server) handleTemplate(files string...) http.HandlerFunc {
	var (
		init    sync.Once
		tpl     *template.Template
		tplerr  error
	)
	return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		init.Do(func(){
			tpl, tplerr = template.ParseFiles(files...)
		})
		if tplerr != nil {
		http.Error(w, tplerr.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}
		// use tpl
	}
}</code></pre></div><p><code>sync.Once</code> ensures the code is only executed one time, and other calls (other people making the same request) will block until it’s finished.</p><ul><li>The error check is outside of the <code>init</code> function, so if something does go wrong we still surface the error and won’t lose it in the logs</li><li>If the handler is not called, the expensive work is never done — this can have big benefits depending on how your code is deployed</li></ul><p>Remember that by doing this, you are moving the initialization time from startup to runtime (when the endpoint is first accessed). I use Google App Engine a lot, so this makes sense for me, but your case might be different, so it’s worth thinking about where and when to use <code>sync.Once</code> in this way.</p><h2 id="designing-for-testability">Designing for testability</h2><p>These patterns evolved partly because of how easy they are to test the code. The <code>run</code> function is a simple way to run your program right from test code.</p><p>You have lots of options when it comes to testing in Go, and it’s less about right and wrong, and more about:</p><ul><li>How easy is it to understand what your program does by looking at the tests?</li><li>How easy is it to change your code without worrying about breaking things?</li><li>If all your tests pass, can you push to production, or does it need to cover more things?</li></ul><h3 id="what-is-the-unit-when-unit-testing">What is the unit when unit testing?&nbsp;</h3><p>Following these patterns, the handlers themselves are also independently testable, but I tend not to do this, and I’ll explain why below. You have to consider what the best approach is for your project.</p><p>To test the handler only, you can:</p><ol><li>Call the function to get the <code>http.Handler</code> — you have to pass in all the required dependencies (this is a feature).</li><li>Call the <code>ServeHTTP</code> method on the <code>http.Handler</code> you get back using a real <code>http.Request</code> and a <code>ResponseRecorder</code> from the <code>httptest</code> package (see <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httptest#ResponseRecorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httptest#ResponseRecorder</a>)</li><li>Make assertions about the response (check the status code, decode the body and make sure it’s right, check any important headers, etc.)</li></ol><p>If you do this, you cut out any middleware like auth, and go straight to the handler code. This is nice if there is some specific complexity you want to build some test support around. However, there’s an advantage when your test code calls APIs in the same way your users will. I err on the side of end-to-end testing at this level, rather than unit testing all the pieces inside.</p><p>I would rather call the <code>run</code> function to execute the whole program as close to how it will run in production as possible. This will parse any arguments, connect to any dependencies, migrate the database, whatever else it will do in the wild, and eventually start up the server. Then when I hit the API from my test code, I am going through all the layers and even interacting with a real database. I am also testing <code>routes.go</code> at the same time.</p><p>I find I catch more issues earlier with this approach and I can avoid specifically testing boilerplate things. It also reduces the repetition in my tests. If I diligently test every layer, I can end up saying the same things multiple times in slightly different ways. You have to maintain all of this, so if you want to change something, updating one function and three tests doesn’t feel very productive. With end-to-end tests, you just have one set of main tests that describe the interactions between your users and your system.</p><p>I still use unit tests within this where appropriate. If I used TDD (which I often do) then I usually have a lot of tests done anyway, which I’m happy to maintain. But I will go back and delete tests if they’re repeating the same thing as an end-to-end test.</p><p>This decision will depend on lots of things, from the opinions of those around you to the complexity of your project, so like all the advice in this post, don’t fight to do this if it just doesn’t work for you.</p><h3 id="testing-with-the-run-function">Testing with the run function</h3><p>I like to call the <code>run</code> function from each test. Each test gets its own self-contained instance of the program. For each test, I can pass different arguments, flag values, standard-in and -out pipes, and even environment variables.</p><p>Since the <code>run</code> function takes a <code>context.Context</code>, and since all our code respects the context (right, everyone? It respects the context, right?) We can get a cancellation function by calling <code>context.WithCancel</code>. By deferring the <code>cancel</code> function, when the test function returns (i.e., when the tests have finished running) the context will be cancelled and the program will gracefully shut down. In Go 1.14 they added the <code>t.Cleanup</code> method which is a replacement for using the <code>defer</code> keyword yourself, and if you’d like to learn more about why that is, check out this issue: <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37333</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is all achieved in surprisingly little code. Of course, you have to keep checking <code>ctx.Err</code> or <code>ctx.Done</code> all over the place too:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func Test(t *testing.T) {
	ctx := context.Background()
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
	t.Cleanup(cancel)
	go run(ctx)
	// test code goes here</code></pre></div><h3 id="waiting-for-readiness">Waiting for readiness</h3><p>Since the <code>run</code> function executes in a goroutine, we don’t really know exactly when it’s going to start up. If we’re going to start hitting the API like real users, we are going to need to know when it’s ready.</p><p>We could set up some way of signalling readiness, like a channel or something — but I prefer to have a <code>/healthz</code> or <code>/readyz</code> endpoint running on the server. As my old grandma used to say, the proof of the pudding is in the actual HTTP requests (she was way ahead of her time).</p><p>This is an example where our efforts to make the code more testable gives us an insight into what our users will need. They probably want to know if the service is ready or not as well, so why not have an official way to find this out?</p><p>To wait for a service to be ready, you can just write a loop:&nbsp;</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>// waitForReady calls the specified endpoint until it gets a 200 
// response or until the context is cancelled or the timeout is 
// reached.
func waitForReady(
	ctx context.Context, 
	timeout time.Duration, 
	endpoint string,
) error {
	client := http.Client{}
	startTime := time.Now()
	for {
		req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(
			ctx, 
			http.MethodGet, 
			endpoint, 
			nil,
		)
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to create request: %w", err)
		}

		resp, err := client.Do(req)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error making request: %s\n", err.Error())
			continue
		}
		if resp.StatusCode == http.StatusOK {
			fmt.Println("Endpoint is ready!")
			resp.Body.Close()
			return nil
		}
		resp.Body.Close()

		select {
		case &lt;-ctx.Done():
			return ctx.Err()
		default:
			if time.Since(startTime) &gt;= timeout {
				return fmt.Errorf("timeout reached while waiting for endpoint")
			}
			// wait a little while between checks
			time.Sleep(250 * time.Millisecond)
		}
	}
}</code></pre></div><h2 id="putting-this-all-into-practice">Putting this all into practice</h2><p>Rolling simple APIs using these techniques remains my favorite way to go. It suits my aims of achieving maintainability excellence with code that’s easy to read, easy to extend by copying patterns, easy for new people to work with, easy to change without worrying, and explicitly done without any magic.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Today’s article is just some early findings on the Apple Vision Pro (<strong>AVP</strong>). I’m working on many things related to the AVP, and it will take me a while to prepare all of them for publishing. Among the things I am doing, I am trying to capture “through the optics” pictures of the AVP, and it is unveiling both interesting information on how the AVP works and the second test pattern I tried “broke” the foveated rending of the AVP. </p>



<p>Having done several searches, I have not seen any “through-the-optics” pictures of the AVP yet. They may be out there, but I haven’t found them. So, I thought I would put up a couple of my test pictures to be (hopefully) the first to publish a picture through the AVP’s optics. </p>



<h2>Eye Tracking Display Based Rendering, Mabye “Too smart for its own good” </h2>



<p>The AVP is sometimes “too smart for its own good,” resulting in bad visual artifacts. In addition to being used for selection, the AVP’s eye-tracking varies the resolution and corrects color issues (aberrations) in the optics by pre-processing the image. This makes it tricky to photograph because the camera lens looks different to the human eye.</p>



<p>Today, I threw together some spreadsheets to check my ability to take pictures through the AVP optics. I started with two large Excel spreadsheets displayed using the AVP’s native Excel App. One spreadsheet used black text on a white background, which looked like the AVP was making the text and lines look “bolder/thicker” than they should look, but it didn’t act that crazy; the AVP seems to be “enhancing” (not always what you want) the spreadsheet’s readability.  </p>



<p>But then I tried inverting everything with white text and lines on a black background, and the display started scintillating in a square box that followed the eye tracking. Fortunately, the AVP’s recording captured the effect in the video below. </p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="1506" height="848" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ciXLygHavps?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>I want to emphasize that it is not just the camera or the AVP’s video capture that shows the problem with the foveated rendering; I see it with my own eyes</strong>. I have provided the spreadsheets below so anyone with an AVP can verify my findings. I have only tested this with the Excel running on the AVP. The effect is most easily seen if you go into “View” in Excel” and make the view smaller with “-” magnifying glass 3 or 4 times to make the text and boxes smaller.</p>











<h2>My First Through-the-Optics Picture Experiments</h2>



<p>With its eye-tracking-based rendering, the AVP will be tricky to capture through the optics. The tracking behaves differently with different cameras and lenses. When setting up the camera, I can see the AVP changing colors, sometimes resulting in pictures that are colored differently than what my eye sees. </p>



<p>It seems pretty clear that the AVP is using “foveated,” variable resolution rendering even on still subjects like a spreadsheet. This re-rendering is based on the eyes and due to the change in the 3-D space locking (aka, SLAM) that caused the artifacts seen in the White text and lines on the BLACK spreadsheet. </p>



<p><strong>Furthermore, the resolution of the displays is definitely lower than the eye’s resolution, as you can easily see the anti-aliasing “twisted rope” rippling effect if you look at the white-on-black spreadsheet.</strong> The highest rendered resolution (“foveated”) part of the image that scintillates. I discussed this issue in <a href="https://kguttag.com/2023/08/05/apple-vision-pro-part-5a-why-monitor-replacement-is-ridiculous/">Apple Vision Pro (Part 5A) – Why Monitor Replacement is Ridiculous</a>, <a href="https://kguttag.com/2023/08/09/apple-vision-pro-part-5b-more-on-monitor-replacement-is-ridiculous/">Apple Vision Pro (Part 5B) – More on Monitor Replacement is Ridiculous</a>, and <a href="https://kguttag.com/2023/08/20/apple-vision-pro-part-5c-more-on-monitor-replacement-is-ridiculous/">Apple Vision Pro (Part 5C) – More on Monitor Replacement is Ridiculous</a>. </p>



<p><b>I should point out that if not for the foveation, the whole image would scintillate. S</b><strong><b>till, the</b> foveated rendering worsens because it creates a visible square at the boundary between the foveated area and the lower-resolution region</strong>. The “foveated rendering” makes it worse by changing the text and lines’ resolution and thickness. I would argue that a more graceful degradation would be to have the whole image rendered the same way (it is not a processing limitation to render a spreadsheet), with the whole image scintillating rather than having boundary lines where it does and does not and with the boldness changing at the boundaries as well. The key point is that the AVP’s display, while much better than almost all other VR/MR headsets, is not, as Apple puts it, “retinal resolution” (or beyond what the eye can see). </p>



<p>Anyway, for the record, below are a couple of through-the-optics test pictures. The first was taken with an R5 camera with a 28mm lens and “pixel shifting” to give a 400-megapixel image. Click on the crop of a very small portion of the center of that picture below to see it in full resolution.</p>

<p>The second image below was taken with an Olympus D mark III (Micro Four-Thirds camera) with a 17mm lens. It does not have the resolution of the R5, but the AVP’s eye tracking behaves better with this lens. This camera has a 24mp sensor, and then I used its pixel-shifting feature to capture the image at about 80 megapixels. The whole image (click to see at full resolution) is included below. </p>



<p>If you scroll around the full-resolution image, you can make out the pixel grid through most of the image, yet the text becomes blurrier much more quickly. Preliminarily, this seems to suggest foveated rendering. I have not had time to check yet, but I suspect the resolution falloff coincides with the squares in the white-on-black spreadsheet.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Designers have to be careful when it comes to applying technology. Sometimes, the same smarts that make one thing work will make others behave poorly. </p>



<p>The biggest part of the problem could be a bug in the AVP software or the Excel port. I’m not saying it is the end of the world, even if it is not improved. There is probably a way to “tone down” the foveated rending to reduce this problem, <strong>but I don’t think there is any way to eliminate it, given the display resolution</strong>. At the same time, the second test I tried caused it to “break/escape.” Since it happens so readily, this problem will likely show up elsewhere. Fundamentally, it comes down to the display not having a resolution as good as human vision.  </p>

<p>An Apple executive lobbied against a strong right-to-repair bill in Oregon Thursday, which is the first time the company has had an employee actively outline its stance on right to repair at an open hearing. Apple’s position in Oregon shows that <a href="https://www.404media.co/apple-endorses-california-right-to-repair-bill/"><u>despite supporting a weaker right to repair law in California</u></a>, it still intends to control its own repair ecosystem. It also sets up a highly interesting fight in the state because <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-formally-endorses-right-to-repair-will-lobby-to-pass-strong-repair-laws/"><u>Google has come out in favor</u></a> of the same legislation Apple is opposing.</p><p>“It is our belief that the bill’s current language around parts pairing will undermine the security, safety, and privacy of Oregonians by forcing device manufacturers to allow the use of parts of unknown origin in consumer devices,” John Perry, Apple’s principal secure repair architect, told the legislature.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a quick about-face for the company, which after years of lobbying against right to repair, began to lobby for it in California last fall. The difference now is that Oregon's bill includes a critical provision that Google says it can easily comply with but that is core for Apple to maintain its dominance over the repair market.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C. —&nbsp;</strong>Chairman Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unveiled the findings of their&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/letters/letters-venture-capital-firms-funding-problematic-prc-companies" target="_blank">bipartisan investigation</a>&nbsp;into five U.S. venture capital firms. The lawmakers found that these firms invested at least $3 billion in, and provided expertise and other benefits to, People's Republic of China (PRC) critical technology companies, including many aiding the Chinese military, surveillance state, or the CCP's genocide in Xinjiang.</p><p>The five firms used as case studies in the investigation are GGV Capital, GSR Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures,&nbsp;Sequoia&nbsp;Capital China, and Walden International. Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi uncovered that these firms funneled over $1.9 billion to AI companies that support China’s human rights abuses or military,&nbsp;and&nbsp;at least another $1.2 billion into the PRC’s semiconductor sector– including semiconductor companies that advance the CCP’s military, genocidal, and techno-totalitarian ambitions. The report also highlights other investments that may raise significant security or human rights concerns.</p><p>In the report,&nbsp;the lawmakers write,&nbsp;“The Committee’s findings suggest that there are billions of dollars beyond those captured in this report that have flowed into PRC companies that support the PRC’s military, digital authoritarianism, and efforts to develop technological supremacy and undermine American technological leadership. The status quo is untenable. . . .&nbsp;Decades of investment—including funding, knowledge transfer, and other intangible benefits—from U.S. VCs have helped build and strengthen the PRC’s priority sectors.”</p><div><p>﻿In certain cases, the lawmakers even uncovered internal VC memorandums stating that Chinese investments were more attractive if the company supported the Chinese government's surveillance state or its strategy for technological supremacy, designed to weaken the United States. The lawmakers also lay out how, beyond dollars, these investments provide credibility and know-how to problematic PRC companies.</p><p>﻿After uncovering the billions of dollars and intangible benefits VC firms have provided&nbsp;these&nbsp;companies tied to the CCP’s military and human rights abuses, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi recommend the United States immediately:</p><ul><li>Restrict U.S. investment in entities sanctioned or red-flagged by the U.S. Government for ties to the PLA, or forced labor and genocide.</li><li>Implement additional sectoral outbound investment restrictions in areas related to the PRC’s critical and emerging technologies, military capabilities, and human rights abuses, building upon those recently established through executive action for PRC AI, semiconductor, and quantum computing companies.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Read Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi’s report:&nbsp;"The CCP's Investors- How American Venture Capital Fuels the PRC Military and Human Rights Abuses" <a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-02-08%20FINAL%20VC%20Report.pdf"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p><p>Background:</p><p>In July 2023, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/investigations/select-committee-launches-investigations-us-venture-capital-firms-funding">l</a><a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/investigations/select-committee-launches-investigations-us-venture-capital-firms-funding" target="_blank">aunched</a>&nbsp;investigations into GGV Capital, GSR Venters, Qualcomm Ventures and Walden international after publicly available investment data indicated the firms were among the leading U.S. VCs in the PRC’s AI sector.</p><ul><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.07.18-letter-to-ggv.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>&nbsp;to read the letter to GGV Capital</li><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.07.18-letter-to-gsr.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>&nbsp;to read the letter to GSR Ventures</li><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.07.18-letter-to-qualcomm-ventures.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>&nbsp;to read the letter to Qualcomm Ventures</li><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.07.18-letter-to-walden.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>&nbsp;to read the letter to Walden International</li></ul><p>In October 2023, following similarly concerning public reports, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member&nbsp;expanded the investigation to include Sequoia Capital.</p><ul><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.10.17-letter-to-sequoia-capital.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>&nbsp;to read the letter to Sequoia.&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

That is, have several very clear services you offer at established rates. Brand yourself around a very clear idea that has people saying "hey, call the &lt;service&gt; guy" when they need &lt;service&gt;.</p><p>2) A lot of us in tech are shy and introverted by nature, which on the surface appears in direct opposition to the skills needed to sell. What I'm telling you is that you can absolutely learn how to be the life of the party - it just takes work and courage, just like any other skill.</p><p>3) Sharp branding can make you stand out. Good quality cards, website, etc. Speak well, write well. When you ask someone for a meeting, be very clear in communicating why it is a good use of their time. Figure out early if you are talking to the person with the authority to buy.</p><p>4) Small companies will often run you through the wringer of interviews etc, only to not actually have much money. Well-established companies will often be slow to pay and full of bureaucracy, but reliable income.</p><p>5) Time-boxing is your friend. It is hard to both do the sales and do the work. You need to really be aware of this as a potential problem.</p><p>6) Do sales by not doing sales - there is a lot to be said for meet up groups, speaking opportunities, providing "free" resources, etc. That is - be seen as an expert in your community and people will come to you and/or you will have already passed the social validation test.

As someone in a role that procures a lot of services the worst thing someone trying to get a foot in the door can do is “everything”. Especially if you can’t explain how you work.<p>It leaves all the burden of figuring out how I could potentially use your services on me, and I’ll try my best to avoid having to deal with that uncertainty on top of what I’m already trying to achieve.</p><p>If you want to be successful offering services be very clear about how you work.

Communication when you are independent can make or ruin it for you.

I feel a lot of client services businesses starting out (read: individuals going into consulting for themselves for the first time) try to build an enigma to make themselves seem experienced and comprehensive. As a buyer, I want to know, up front, what exactly an engagement with you looks like: What will you do? How much will it cost, over what schedule/criteria?

                  <p><span>Id recommend just giving it a shot and not reading books about it. You'll learn way more, way faster. And it'll be hard, there will be constant rejection, and there will be mistakes, but it's the only way. Speak to people, message people, put yourself out there online and in person. Follow up when people may be interested, and don't follow up if people arent. All you need is a contract / statement of work / agreement if your havent already, and get a business to sign it. That's all there is, everything else is a distraction. Forget every other theory about sales, it's certainly not a science but there's a world of snake oil sales people - selling to sales people - it's nearly all bullshit. Just know what your offer is and see who wants it. Youre no doubt a smart and capable person if you're a lead DevOps I'm sure, you will get hired and paid, confidence and applied effort is all you need. Good luck. I say all this confidenently as I sell software services for a living, I'm good at it (with all humility).</span></p></div></td></tr>

Bob shifts the focus of sales from selling, to helping people buy and make progress in their lives--demand-side sales.</p><p>Now, in Demand-Side Sales 101, you'll learn to really see what your customers see, hear what they hear, and understand what they mean.

  * Shortcuts like automation are a waste of time unless you're replicating success
  * Always ask for the sale
  * All meetings should have a next step / action. Preferably chain meetings together so you have the next one scheduled by end of current one.
  * "SOGOTP" - you need to respectfully but quickly move conversations to *sales* convos. If someone isn't going to buy, recognize it quickly and move them to nurture instead of taking your time

  - A corollary is that you cannot expect the client to put the same price on your work as you would or want.

  - Another corollary is that you will inevitably lose some bids.

  - Value-based pricing has been way simpler to deal with for me.

  - Hourly pay only for a retainer or a fixed amount of hours per month ("I'll be there when you call."). Otherwise I find that incentives get misaligned.

  - Requirements and client desires can change every single time you speak to them, so communicate often. I've been lucky with inflating time estimates by 25-33% to account for this inevitability.</code></pre></span></p></div></td></tr>

This is not to show how great my friends are (debatable), but how I have been completely unable to attract business outside of my network, even in 13 years!</p><p>Marketing yourself to even be considered a point of contact for whatever it is you're offering is - in my opinion — by far, the hardest nut to crack.</p><p>I'd love to hear suggestions by others who've been successful on this front, especially how you attract out-of-network leads.

                  <p><span>I like and recommend this one, but I also think he pulls a lot of sleight-of-hand... a lot of it is based on the premise that the client is willing to share (or can even get, in big enough companies...) numbers that inform the value created. For a tech consultant bopping between companies and industries, it's really challenging to come up with these numbers. Likewise, I found that even if you can prove a number, getting a big company to bite on it (unless you are truly talking to a Cx0) is nearly impossible... case in point... a major west-coast health care company had a crisis. I found the problem and laid out a path for a few million dollars to solve the problem. It was somehow way easier to pay IBM $50MM to "solve" the problem rather than the $10MM or less by actually fixing the problem. You run into a lot of that at the Fortune 500, which makes it clear it isn't about "value". Weiss seems to gloss over a lot of this.</span></p></div></td></tr>

<p>The U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) is now requiring large-scale commercial cryptocurrency mining operations to report their power consumption. This initiative is part of a larger effort to regulate and penalize cryptocurrency mining due to the exorbitant amount of energy the industry consumes yearly. For now, the EIA is only collecting data, but this new data should give birth to new regulations that will penalize miners in the future. This comes as the company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364" data-url="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364">released a study </a>(first reported on by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06022024/todays-climate-cryptocurrency-energy-information-administration-energy-use-climate-change/" data-url="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06022024/todays-climate-cryptocurrency-energy-information-administration-energy-use-climate-change/"><em>Inside Climate News</em></a>) suggesting that cryptocurrency mining represents up to 2.3% of U.S. power demand.</p><p>“We intend to continue to analyze and write about the energy implications of cryptocurrency mining activities in the United States...,” EIA administratior Joe DeCarolis <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php" data-url="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php">said in a release in January</a>. “We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.”</p><p>DeCarolis' words summarize that the United States will pay close attention to the environmental challenges cryptocurrency mining might be causing. We can surmise that the United States government specifically wants to crack down on mining operations that impact the reliability and sustainability of power in highly populated areas. Potentially leading to higher residential power costs and power shortage issues during peak hours. As of January 2024, the EIA has identified 137 cryptomining facilities.&nbsp;</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="Locations of 52 U.S. cryptocurrency mining operations, as of January 2024" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg"><source type="image/jpeg" alt="Locations of 52 U.S. cryptocurrency mining operations, as of January 2024" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg" alt="Locations of 52 U.S. cryptocurrency mining operations, as of January 2024" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1200-80.jpg 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>EIA Note: &nbsp;"The representative size shown for a facility is based upon estimates contained in our bottom-up approach. Number in brackets represents the number of facilities." </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: U.S. Energy Information Administration)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The EIA found that crypto-mining operations in the United States has grown substantially over the past few years, to the point where all U.S-based crypto-mining operations consume 0.6% to 2.3% of the nation's entire electricity consumption alone. For comparison, the total U.S. Bitcoin mining industry consumes the annual power budget of Utah or West Virginia. The estimated power draw of Bitcoin mining worldwide is projected to be anywhere between 0.2% to 0.9% of global demand, equating to the same power draw as Greece or Australia by themselves.</p><p>Bitcoin mining is very power-hungry in the United States specifically due to the exorbitant amount of mining that actually takes place within U.S borders. The EIA found that the global share of Bitcoin mining that takes place in the U.S. grew from 3.4% in 2020 to a whopping 37.8% in 2022.</p><p>The incredible power demands of the Bitcoin industry are a result of the Bitcoin mining algorithm becoming more and more difficult every single year. Bitcoin today isn't what it was eight to ten years ago, where you could mine it on a single computer and net a decent profit. Nowadays, Bitcoin needs to be mined on hundreds of specialized mining devices (ASICs) to be gathered at all. The continuous difficulty of the Bitcoin algorithm, in turn, creates higher and higher power costs as the cryptocurrency gets harder to mine.</p><p>We can expect this power phenomenon to become greater as Bitcoin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-comes-roaring-back-as-it-hits-2023-high-but-gaming-gpus-are-safe-from-miners-for-now-ai-remains-the-largest-threat-to-gpu-pricing" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-comes-roaring-back-as-it-hits-2023-high-but-gaming-gpus-are-safe-from-miners-for-now-ai-remains-the-largest-threat-to-gpu-pricing">grows in popularity</a>. 2024 is expected to be one of the most eventful years in Bitcoin history, with the cryptocurrency expected to blow past its record $69,000 high sometime after its halving event in April (when the reward for Bitcoin mining is cut in half) thanks to reduced mining profit and large-scale institutional adoption.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce the creation of a new family of Fedora Linux spins: Fedora Atomic Desktops! As Silverblue has grown in popularity, we’ve seen more of our mainline Fedora Linux spins make the jump to offer a version that implements rpm-ostree. It’s reached the point where it can be hard to talk about all of them at the same time. Therefore we’ve introduced a new brand that will serve to simplify how we discuss rpm-ostree and how we name future atomic spins.</p>



<p>Some may note that this is more of a reintroduction. <a href="https://projectatomic.io/blog/2014/04/announcing-project-atomic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Atomic</a> was started 10 years ago with the development of Atomic Host. As the team stated back then, “the Atomic Host comprises a set of packages from an operating system (…) , pulled together with rpm-ostree to create a filesystem tree that can be deployed, and updated, as an atomic unit.” In 2018 we saw the start of <a href="https://projectatomic.io/blog/2018/02/fedora-atomic-workstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fedora Atomic Workstation</a>, a desktop client implementation using GNOME, which became <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-silverblue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silverblue a year later</a>.</p>



<p>2021 saw the introduction of <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-35/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kinoite in Fedora 35</a>. Things seemed quiet for a while until last year, when we saw the release of two more rpm-ostree spins – <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-38/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sericea in Fedora 38</a> and <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-39/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onyx in Fedora 39</a>.</p>



<h2><a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/article-proposal-announcing-the-fedora-atomic-rebrand/104502#why-a-new-brand-2"></a>Why a New Brand?</h2>



<p>That leads to the first reason for needing to adjust our branding: more spins may come. We have four traditional Fedora Linux spins that do not yet have atomic variants. Some of these desktop environments are being experimented with, like Vauxite (Xfce) from within the <a href="https://universal-blue.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universal Blue custom images</a> project. There are other desktop environments, like Pantheon or the upcoming COSMIC, that we would love to welcome to the community if contributors would like to make that happen. As this group of spins grows, we need to organize them under one umbrella.</p>



<p>Secondly, not having a unified way to talk about our atomic spins makes it harder to talk about them. Have you ever tripped over yourself trying to mention all four atomic spins, or using a shorthand for referring to them (ie Silverblue and friends)? It’s a byproduct of how unwieldy it is to have one spin, Silverblue, represent three others while also meaning something specific, an rpm-ostree implementation of Fedora Linux Workstation. There is also confusion about what aspects of these spins are shared. For example, some folks may be looking for documentation on Kinoite not realizing that an article about Silverblue also applies to their problem. Using so many keywords when you’re looking for information on the one aspect they all share is inefficient.</p>



<p>Thirdly, this nice branding term is also a more accurate way of talking about how rpm-ostree works. Fedora Atomic spins are not actually immutable. There are ways to get around the read-only aspects of the implementation even though it is much harder. The nature of the OS, where updates are only implemented when they successfully build and you can rollback or rebase between core host systems, is better described by atomicity than immutability. Atomic is also how many of the contributors who work on rpm-ostree prefer to talk about it! Rebranding provides an opportunity to change the language surrounding this technology.</p>



<h2><a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/article-proposal-announcing-the-fedora-atomic-rebrand/104502#the-good-part-3"></a>The Good Part</h2>



<p>Fedora Atomic Desktops is made up of four atomic spins:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fedora Silverblue</a></li>



<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fedora Kinoite</a></li>



<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/sway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fedora Sway Atomic</a> (was Fedora Sericea)</li>



<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/budgie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fedora Budgie Atomic</a> (was Fedora Onyx)</li>
</ul>



<p>Silverblue and Kinoite retained their names because of brand recognition and being around for much longer. There are many articles and videos made with the Silverblue or Kinoite brands, and we don’t want to waste those resources by making them harder to find with a rebrand. Sericea and Onyx are much newer and both SIGs wanted to switch to the new naming convention.</p>



<p>Going forward, new atomic spins will use the ‘Fedora (DE name) Atomic’ format to keep things simple and clear. No more questions about which name refers to what desktop environment. No more mispronunciations. Much more clarity on why these Fedora spins are different from the regular spins.</p>



<p>The new umbrella brand also gives us a new name to put alongside their rpm-ostree cousins! Fedora Atomic Desktops live alongside Fedora CoreOS and Fedora IoT as they all use rpm-ostree in serving different needs.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/AtomicDesktops" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fedora Atomic Desktops SIG</a>, and many in the community, are very excited about this change. We hope it makes talking and learning about this kind of operating system easier.</p>

<p>The team I've been working in for the last year or so have had great success using Postgres-as-queue. We've
    managed to <em>avoid</em> the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Infrastructure/configuration<em> - I'd estimate each line of terraform to be an order of
        magnitude more risk/maintenance/faff than each line of Python</em>.</li>
    <li>Slow/crunky multi-container testing.</li>
    <li>The need for expertise in anything beyond Python + Postgres.</li>
    <li>Elaborate retry/dead-letter-queue mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Thinking about data serialisation over the wire.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a nut shell, it's simpler - there are just way fewer moving parts.</p>
<p>As we're using a monolithic codebase with a reasonable ORM, we also have none of the <a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/cmd-click-manifesto.html">CMD-clickability</a> issues that plague ad-hoc SNS/PubSub/Kafka <a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/manipleservices.html">architectures</a>.</p>
<h2 id="objection">Objection</h2>
<p>The main objection to doing Postgres-as-queue is a performance one, along the lines of "don't put
    unnecessary extra load on the db/don't increase row churn". Let's construct a reasonable example demonstrating that queue usage shouldn't introduce much extra load in many cases. <em>As always, before following
        anyone's advice on this kind of stuff, profile, profile, profile!</em></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In the (fairly unusual) case that you're doing many tasks, none of which touch the db (say constructing
        and sending emails from static data), you can ignore this blog post and get on with life. In another case, you
        may be operating at some crazy scale where <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/#:~:text=There%20are%20downsides%20to%20using%20SKIP%20LOCKED%20to%20implement%20a%20queue">these
            downsides</a> start applying, again, run the numbers and profile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's imagine the db load introduced by a hypothetical task - I currently work in the energy industry, so
    the example might be: a customer submits a meter reading, we queue a task to write the reading and update some
    account balance - the load looks like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Receive the message from the broker.</li>
    <li>Make 3 primary key <code>SELECT</code>s totalling 0.3ms db time.</li>
    <li>Make 2 slightly hairier <code>SELECT</code>s with some <code>JOIN</code>s/<code>GROUP BY</code>s totalling 4ms
        db time.</li>
    <li>Perform 2 <code>UPDATE</code>s totalling 2ms db time (and some row churn).</li>
    <li>ACK the message.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the new Postgres-as-queue world, this looks like:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Poll for a message that needs processing, on finding one, <code>UPDATE</code> the status, totalling 1ms db time.
    </b></li>
    <li>Make 3 primary key <code>SELECT</code>s totalling 0.3ms db time.</li>
    <li>Make 2 slightly hairier <code>SELECT</code>s with some <code>JOIN</code>s/<code>GROUP BY</code>s totalling 4ms
        db time.</li>
    <li>Perform 2 <code>UPDATE</code>s totalling 2ms db time (and some row churn).</li>
    <li><b>ACK the message by <code>UPDATE</code>ing the status totalling 0.5ms db time (and some row churn).</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, our db time has gone up from 6.3ms per task to 7.8ms. These figures are totally fictional, but
    we've demonstrated a reasonable way of thinking about the overhead.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>If we had just one worker polling for tasks, we could ignore locking and transactions, but we want to have many, so
    we have to use <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>. This atomically locks the row at the point where it selects it -
    there's discussion of ins and outs in this <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/">excellent blog post
        by 2ndQuadrant</a>.</p>
<p>For our example implementation, we have an event table that looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>id   | status   | updated_at
------------------------------------------</span>
UUID | SMALLINT | TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
</code></pre>
<p>We have an <code>INDEX</code> on <code>(status, updated_at)</code>. <em>In reality we have many tables, one per
        queue.</em></p>
<p>Our polling workers run a loop like:</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> _ <span>in</span> shutdown_handler.loop():  <span># see appendix below</span>
    event_meta = get_event_to_process(
        where_status_eq=TO_PROCESS,
        set_status_to=PROCESSING,
    )
    <span>if</span> event_meta <span>is</span> <span>None</span>:
        time.sleep(x)  <span># be gentle on the DB</span>
        <span>continue</span>

    <span>try</span>:
        <span># Perform task!</span>
        set_status(event_meta, PROCESSED)
    <span>except</span>:
        set_status(event_meta, ERRORED, ...)
</code></pre>
<p>And <code>get_event_to_process(...)</code> performs SQL along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>WITH ids AS MATERIALIZED (
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> event_queue
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>status</span> = {where_status_eq}
    <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> updated_at
    <span>LIMIT</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SKIP</span> <span>LOCKED</span>
)
<span>UPDATE</span> event_queue
<span>SET</span> <span>status</span> = {set_status_to}
<span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> = <span>ANY</span>(<span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> ids)
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span>
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note the use of <code>MATERIALISED</code> to force the CTE to evaluate eagerly before the <code>UPDATE</code>
        (aside: I'd like a postgres expert to assert that this query is truly race condition free)</em>.</p>
<p><code>set_status(...)</code> just performs an update of <code>status</code> and <code>updated_at</code> for a
    particular row.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-features">Bonus features</h2>
<p>Because you're simply interacting with a persistent table rather that some black-box queue, it's easy to add
    bells and whistles as your requirements change.</p>
<h2 id="retrying">Retrying</h2>
<p>Sometimes tasks fail/timeout. We have jobs that periodically poll for old tasks that have weird statuses and attempt
    to retry them as appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="ignore-before">Ignore before</h2>
<p>We have one more timestamp column on our <code>event_queue</code> tables - <code>ignore_before</code>. This is useful
    in two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We can represent timeouts (eg. "send an email if we didn't receive inbound x after 10 days") as
        regular ol' events.</li>
    <li>We want to batch up certain types of outbound event, so we can set their <code>ignore_before</code> to "at
        the next whole hour" and bundle up a load of events at dispatch-time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cruft-cleanup">Cruft cleanup</h2>
<p>You may want have cron jobs that delete queue data older than some time.</p>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<h2 id="shutdown-handler">Shutdown handler</h2>
<p>The following is a nice helper for polling loops that aids with shutdown handling, and times itself out after an hour
    of no activity.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> os, signal, threading

INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT = <span>60</span> * <span>60</span>  <span># 1 hour</span>
work_done: threading.Event


<span><span>def</span> <span>kill_after_timeout</span><span>()</span> -&gt; <span>None</span>:</span>
    <span>global</span> work_done
    work_done = threading.Event()
    <span>if</span> work_done.wait(INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT):
        <span>return</span>
    os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGKILL)


<span><span>class</span> <span>ShutdownHandler</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(self, max_loops: int | None = None)</span> -&gt; <span>None</span>:</span>
        self.exit_flag = <span>False</span>
        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, self.signal_handler)
        signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, self.signal_handler)

    <span><span>def</span> <span>signal_handler</span><span>(self, signal: int, frame: FrameType | None)</span> -&gt; <span>None</span>:</span>
        self.exit_flag = <span>True</span>

    <span><span>def</span> <span>loop</span><span>(self)</span> -&gt; Iterator[<span>None</span>]:</span>
        <span>global</span> work_done
        <span>while</span> <span>True</span>:
            <span>if</span> self.exit_flag():
                work_done.set()
                <span>return</span>
            <span># Making the thread a daemon means it will die if the parent thread dies.</span>
            threading.Thread(target=kill_after_timeout, daemon=<span>True</span>).start()
            <span>yield</span> <span>None</span>
            work_done.set()  <span># tell the timeout thread we did some work</span>
</code></pre>

In what follows, I try to make the same case nearly 30 years later, updated for today’s computing horrors. A version of this post was </em><a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/a-2024-plea-for-lean-software/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on my personal blog, <a href="http://berthub.eu/" target="_blank">Berthub.eu</a>.</em><br></p><p>Some years ago I did a talk at a local university on cybersecurity, titled “<a href="https://berthub.eu/cyber-mad/Cyber%20and%20information%20security.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cyber and Information Security: Have We All Gone Mad?</a>” It is still worth reading today since we <em>have</em> gone quite mad collectively.</p><p>The way we build and ship software these days is mostly ridiculous, leading to apps using millions of lines of code to open a garage door, and other simple programs importing <a href="https://github.com/SashenJayathilaka/Photo-Sharing-Application" target="_blank">1,600 external code libraries</a>—dependencies—of unknown provenance. Software security is dire, which is a function both of the quality of the code and the sheer amount of it. Many of us programmers know the current situation is untenable. Many programmers (and their management) sadly haven’t ever experienced anything else.

I also mention some regulatory and legislative things going on that we might use to make software quality a priority again. Finally, I talk about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an actual useful piece of software I wrote</a> as a proof of concept that one can still make <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">minimal and simple yet modern software</a>.</p><p>I hope that this post provides some mental and moral support for suffering programmers and technologists who want to improve things. It is not just you; We are not merely suffering from nostalgia: Software really is very weird today.</p><h2>The terrible state of software security</h2><p>Without going all <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Old man (48) yells at cloud</a>,” let me restate some obvious things. The state of software security is <em>dire</em>. If we only look at the past year, if you ran industry-standard software like <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/exploitation-ivanti-vulnerabilities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ivanti</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_MOVEit_data_breach" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MOVEit</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/russian-hackers-exploiting-outlook-bug-to-hijack-exchange-accounts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Outlook</a>, <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22518-improper-authorization-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1311473907.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/barracuda-esg-exploited-globally" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Barracuda Email Security Gateway</a>, <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/remediation-netscaler-adc-gateway-cve-2023-4966" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Citrix NetScaler ADC, and NetScaler Gateway</a>, chances are you got hacked. Even companies with near-infinite resources (like Apple and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a>) made <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/09/critical-vulnerability-in-libwebp-library.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trivial “worst practice” security mistakes</a> that put <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apple-zero-click-imessage-exploit-used-to-infect-iphones-with-spyware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their customers in danger</a>. Yet we continue to rely on all these products.</p><p>Software is now (rightfully) considered so dangerous that we tell everyone not to run it themselves. Instead, you are supposed to leave that to an “<em>X</em> as a service” provider, or perhaps just to “the cloud.” Compare this to a hypothetical situation where cars are so likely to catch fire that the advice is not to drive a car yourself, but to leave that to professionals who are always accompanied by professional firefighters.</p><p>Software is now (rightfully) considered so dangerous that we tell everyone not to run it themselves.

Yet in the past year, we’ve learned that Microsoft’s <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/outlook-breach-microsoft-reveals-how.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">email platform was thoroughly hacked</a>, including classified government email. (<a href="https://metacurity.substack.com/p/russian-hacking-group-midnight-blizzard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twice!</a>) There are also <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/azures-terrible-security-posture-comes-home-to-roost/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well-founded worries about the security of the Azure cloud</a>. Meanwhile, industry darling Okta, which provides cloud-based software that enables user log-in to various applications, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/okta-says-hackers-stole-data-all-customer-support-users-cyber-breach-2023-11-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">got comprehensively owned</a>. This was their second breach within two years. Also, there was a suspicious spate of Okta users subsequently getting hacked.</p><p>Clearly, we need better software.</p><p>The European Union has launched three pieces of legislation to this effect: <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NIS2 for important services</a>; the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cyber Resilience Act </a>for almost all commercial software and electronic devices; and a revamped <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-updates-product-liability-regime-to-include-software-artificial-intelligence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Product Liability Directive</a> that also extends to software. Legislation is always hard, and it remains to be seen <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-what-does-it-mean-for-open-source/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">if they got it right</a>. But that software security is terrible enough these days to warrant legislation seems obvious.</p><h2>Why software security is so bad</h2><p>I want to touch on incentives. The situation today is clearly working well for commercial operators. Making more secure software takes time and is a lot of work, and the current security incidents don’t appear to be impacting the bottom line or stock prices. You can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/software-components-only-the-giants-survive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speed up time to market by cutting corners</a>. So from an economic standpoint, what we see is entirely predictable. Legislation could be very important in changing this equation.</p><p>The security of software depends on two factors—the <em>density</em> of security issues in the source code and the sheer <em>amount of code</em> accessible by hackers. As the U.S. defense community loved to point out in the 1980s, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-said-Quantity-has-a-quality-all-its-own" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quantity has a quality all of its own</a>. The reverse applies to software—the more you have of it, the more risks you run.</p><p>As a case in point, Apple iPhone users got repeatedly hacked over many years because of the huge attack surface exposed by iMessage. It is possible to send an unsolicited iMessage to an Apple user. The phone will then immediately process that message so it can preview it. The problem is that Apple in its wisdom decided that such unsolicited messages needed to support a vast array of image formats, accidentally <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including PDFs with weird embedded compressed fonts</a> using an ancient format that effectively included a programming language. So someone could send an unsolicited message to your iPhone that could probe for weaknesses in the rest of the phone.</p><p>In this way, attackers were able to benefit from security bugs in the phone’s millions of lines of code. You don’t need a high bug density to find <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/PEGA/DV/2023/05-08/REPORTcompromises_EN.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an exploitable hole</a> in millions of lines of code.</p><p>Wiping out all the bugs in your code won’t save you from the decision to implement a feature to automatically execute code embedded in documents.</p><p>Apple could have prevented this situation by restricting previews to a far smaller range of image formats, or even a single “known good” image format. Apple could have saved themselves an enormous amount of pain simply by <a href="https://github.com/berthubert/sbox#sbox" target="_blank">exposing fewer lines of their code</a> to attackers. Incidentally, the E.U.’s Cyber Resilience Act <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-secure-coding-solution/" target="_blank">explicitly tells vendors to minimize the attack surface</a>.</p><p><span></span>Apple is (by far) not the worst offender in this field. But it is a widely respected and well-resourced company that usually thinks through what they do. And even they got it wrong by needlessly shipping and exposing too much code.</p><h2>Could we not write better code?</h2><p>There are those who think the biggest problem is the quality of the code, expressed in terms of the density of bugs in it. There are many interesting things happening on this front, like the use of <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3608324/us-and-international-partners-issue-recommendations-to-secure-software-products/" target="_blank">memory safe languages</a> like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>. Other languages are <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also upping their security game</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fuzzers</a>—test tools that automatically modify inputs to computer programs to find weaknesses and bugs—are also getting ever more advanced.</p><p>But many security problems are in the logic underlying the code. For example, the Barracuda email exploit originated in a third-party library that would actually <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-7101/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">execute code</a> in Excel spreadsheets when they were scanned for viruses. Wiping out all the bugs in your code won’t save you from the decision to implement a feature to automatically execute code embedded in documents.</p><h2>The state of shipping software</h2><p>Another problem is that we often don’t know what code we are actually shipping. Software has gotten <em>huge</em>. In 1995 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Niklaus Wirth</a> lamented that software had grown to megabytes in size. In his article “A Plea for Lean Software,” he went on to describe his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(operating_system)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oberon operating system</a>, which was only 200 kilobytes, including an editor and a compiler. There are now projects that have more than 200 KB for their configuration files alone.</p><p>A typical app today is built on <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electron JS</a>, a framework that incorporates both Chromium (“Chrome”) and Node.JS, which provides access to tens of thousands of software packages for JavaScript. I estimate just using Electron JS entails at least 50 million lines of code if you include dependencies. Perhaps more. The app meanwhile likely pulls in hundreds or thousands of helper packages. Many packages used will also, by default, snitch on your users to advertisers and other data brokers. Dependencies pull in further dependencies, and exactly what gets included in the build can change on a daily basis, and no one really knows.</p><p>If this app controls anything in your house, it will also connect to a software stack over at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amazon">Amazon</a>, probably also powered by Node.js, also pulling in many dependencies. </p><p>We are likely looking at over 50 million active lines of code to open a garage door, running several operating-system images on multiple servers.</p><p>But wait, there’s more. We used to ship software as the output of a compiler, or perhaps as a bunch of files to be interpreted. Such software then had to be <em>installed</em> and <em>configured</em> to work right. Getting your code packaged to ship like this is a lot of work. But it was good work since it forced people to think about what was in their “package.” This software package would then integrate with an operating system and with local services, based on the configuration.</p><p>Since the software ran on a different computer than the one it was developed on, people really had to know what they shipped and think it through. And sometimes it didn’t work, leading to the joke where a developer tells the operations people, “Well, it works on my system,” and the retort “Then back up your email, we’re taking your laptop into production!”</p><p>This used to be a joke, but these days we often ship software as containers, shipping not only the software itself but also including operating system files to make sure the software runs in a well-known environment. This frequently entails effectively shipping a complete computer disk image. This again vastly expands the amount of code being deployed. Note that you can do good things with containers like Docker (see below), but there are a lot of images over 350 MB on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/explore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>.</p><p>The world is shipping far too much code where we don’t even know what we ship and we aren’t looking hard enough (or at all) at what we <em>do</em> know we ship.</p><p>Add it all up and we are likely looking at over 50 million active lines of code to open a garage door, running several operating-system images on multiple servers.</p><p>Now, even if all the included dependencies are golden, are we sure that their security updates are making it to your garage door opener app? I wonder how many Electron apps are still shipping with the <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/09/critical-vulnerability-in-libwebp-library.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">image processing bug</a> that had Google and Apple scramble to put out updates last year. We don’t even know.</p><p>But even worse, it is a known fact that all these dependencies are <em>not</em> golden. The Node.js ecosystem has a <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/researchers-hijack-popular-npm-package.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comical history</a> of package repositories <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/npm-security-preventing-supply-chain-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">being taken over</a>, hijacked, or resurrected under the same name by someone else, someone with nefarious<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/19/npm_s3_buckets_malware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> plans for your security</a>. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/02/novel_pypi_attack_reversinglabs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PyPI</a> (a Python counterpart of Node.js) has suffered from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/04/pypi_pytorch_dependency_attack/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar problems</a>. Dependencies always need scrutiny, but no one can reasonably be expected to <a href="https://medium.com/graph-commons/analyzing-the-npm-dependency-network-e2cf318c1d0d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">check thousands of them frequently</a>. But we prefer not to think about this. (Note that you should also not overshoot and needlessly reimplement everything yourself to prevent dependencies. There are very good modules that <a href="https://sqlite.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">likely are more secure</a> than what you could type in on your own.)</p><p>The world is shipping far too much code where we don’t even know what we ship and we aren’t looking hard enough (or at all) at what we <em>do</em> know we ship.</p><h2>You <em>can</em> write lean code today</h2><p>Writing has been called the process by which you find out you don’t <a href="https://fs.blog/writing-to-think/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">know what you are talking about</a>. Actually doing stuff, meanwhile, is the process by which you find out you also did not know what you were writing about.</p><p>In a small reenactment of Wirth’s Oberon Project, I too wrote some code to prove a point, and to reassure myself I still know what I am talking and writing about. Can you still make useful and modern software the old way? I decided to try to create a minimalistic but full-featured image-sharing solution that I could trust.</p><p>Trifecta is the result. It is <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actual stand-alone software</a> that lets you use a browser to drag and drop images for easy sharing. It has pained me for years that I had to use <a href="https://imgur.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imgur</a> for this purpose. Not only does imgur install lots of cookies and trackers in my browser, I also force these trackers onto the people who view the images that I share. If you want to self-host a Web service like this, you also don’t want to get hacked. Most image-sharing solutions I found that you could run yourself are based on huge frameworks that I don’t trust too much for the reasons outlined above.</p><p>So, also to make a point, I decided to create a minimalistic but also useful image-sharing solution that I could trust. And more important, that other people could trust as well, because you can check out all Trifecta’s code within a few hours. It consists of <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology" target="_blank">1,600 lines of new source code</a>, plus around five important dependencies. </p><p>You end up with a grand total of 3 megabytes of code.</p><p>To contrast, <a href="https://github.com/CaramelFur/Picsur/pkgs/container/picsur" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one other image-sharing solution</a> ships as a 288-MB Docker image, although admittedly it looks better and has some more features. But not 285 MB worth of them. Another comparison is <a href="https://github.com/SashenJayathilaka/Photo-Sharing-Application" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this Node-based picture-sharing solution</a>, which clocks in at 1,600 dependencies, apparently totaling over 4 million lines of JavaScript.</p><p>The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this, there is a huge <em>attack surface</em> full of mediocre code.</p><p><span></span>Note that Trifecta is not intended as a public site where random people can share images, as that does not tend to end well. It is however very suitable for company or personal use. You can read more about the project <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta" target="_blank">here</a>, and there is also <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology" target="_blank">a page</a> about the technology used to deliver such a tiny self-contained solution.</p><h2>Response to Trifecta</h2><p>This has been rather interesting. The most common response to Trifecta so far has been that I should use a whole bag of Amazon Web Services to deploy it. This is an exceedingly odd response to a project with the clearly stated goal of providing stand-alone software that does not rely on external services. I’m not sure what is going on here.</p><p>Another reaction has been that I treat Docker unfairly, and that you could definitely use containers for good. And I agree wholeheartedly. But I also look at what people are actually doing (also with other forms of containers or virtual machines), and it’s not so great.</p><p>I want to end this post with some observations from <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Niklaus Wirth’s 1995 paper</a>:</p><blockquote>“To some, complexity equals power. (…) Increasingly, <em>people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication</em>, which is baffling—the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration.”</blockquote><p>I’ve similarly observed that some people prefer complicated systems. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tony Hoare</a> noted long ago, “[T]here are two methods in software design. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1283920.1283936" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One is to make the program so simple, there are obviously no errors</a>. The other is to make it so complicated, there are no obvious errors.” If you can’t do the first variant, the second way starts looking awfully attractive perhaps.</p><p>Back to Wirth: </p><blockquote>“Time pressure is probably the foremost reason behind the emergence of bulky software. The time pressure that designers endure discourages careful planning. It also discourages improving acceptable solutions; instead, it encourages quickly conceived software additions and corrections. Time pressure gradually corrupts an engineer’s standard of quality and perfection. It has a detrimental effect on people as well as products.”</blockquote><p>Why spend weeks paring down your software when you can also ship a whole pre-installed operating-system image that just works?</p><blockquote>“The plague of software explosion is not a ‘law of nature.’ It is avoidable, and it is the software engineer’s task to curtail it.”</blockquote><p>If this is indeed on the shoulders of software people, we should perhaps demand more time for it.</p><p>The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this, there is a huge <em>attack surface</em> full of mediocre code. Efforts are ongoing to improve the quality of code itself, but many exploits are due to logic fails, and less progress has been made scanning for those. Meanwhile, great strides could be made by paring down just how much code we expose to the world. This will increase time to market for products, but legislation is around the corner that should force vendors to take security more seriously.</p><p>Trifecta is, like Wirth’s Oberon Project mentioned above, meant as a proof that you can deliver a lot of functionality even with a limited amount of code and dependencies. With effort and legislation, maybe the future could again bring sub-50-million-line garage-door openers. Let’s try to make it happen.</p></div></div>]]></description>

(“Shipments” here means systems manufactured, a proxy for how many are actually sold.) By 2040, these states—California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island—are aiming for 90 percent of those shipments to be heat pumps.</p><p>“It’s a really strong signal from states that they’re committed to accelerating this transition to zero-emissions residential buildings,” says Emily Levin, senior policy adviser at the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), an association of air-quality agencies, which facilitated the agreement. The states will collaborate, for instance, in pursuing federal funding, developing standards for the rollout of heat pumps, and laying out an overarching plan “with priority actions to support widespread electrification of residential buildings.”</p><p>Instead of burning planet-warming natural gas, a heat pump warms a building by transferring heat from the outdoor air into the interior space. Run it in the opposite direction, and it can cool the inside of a building—a heat pump is both a heater and AC unit. Because the system is electric, it can run off a grid increasingly powered by renewables like wind and solar. Even if you have to run a heat pump with electricity from fossil-fuel power plants, it’s much more efficient than a furnace, because it’s moving heat instead of creating it.</p><p>A heat pump can save an average American household over $550 a year, <a data-offer-url="https://carbonswitch.com/heat-pump-carbon-reduction-and-savings-potential-report/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://carbonswitch.com/heat-pump-carbon-reduction-and-savings-potential-report/&quot;}" href="https://carbonswitch.com/heat-pump-carbon-reduction-and-savings-potential-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to one estimate</a>.

You can even install a heat pump system that also <a data-offer-url="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-water-heaters" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-water-heaters&quot;}" href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-water-heaters" rel="noopener" target="_blank">warms your water</a>. “We really need consumers to move away from dirty to clean heat, and we really want to get the message out that heat pumps are really the way to go,” says Serena McIlwain, Maryland’s secretary of the environment. “We have homeowners who are getting ready to replace their furnaces, and if they're not aware, they are not going to replace it with a heat pump.”</p><p>The coalition’s announcement comes just months after the federal government doubled down on its own commitment to heat pumps, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/you-need-a-heat-pump-soon-youll-have-more-american-made-options/">announcing $169 million in funding</a> for the domestic production of the systems. That money comes from 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act, which also provides an American household with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-inflation-reduction-act-climate-bill-save-you-money/">thousands of dollars in rebates or tax credits</a> to switch to a heat pump.</p><p>These states are aiming to further collaborate with those heat pump manufacturers by tracking sales and overall progress, sending a signal to the industry to ramp up production to meet the ensuing demand. They'll also collaborate with each other on research and generally share information, working toward the best strategies for realizing the transition from gas to electric. Basically, they’re pursuing a sort of standardization of the policies and regulations for getting more heat pumps built, bought, and installed, which other states outside of the coalition might eventually tap into.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“A consistent approach between states helps to ease the market transition,” says Matt Casale, senior manager of appliance standards at the Building Decarbonization Coalition, which is collaborating with the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management. “There are all of these manufacturers, and all of these contractors, all along the supply chain, trying to plan out their next several years. They want to know: What is it going to look like?”</p><p>There’s also the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-race-to-decarbonize-america-needs-more-workers/">less-talked-about challenge</a> of the green energy revolution: training enough technicians to actually install the heat pumps. To that end, the memorandum calls for workforce development and contractor training. “If we’re pushing heat pumps and more installations, and we don’t have enough electricians to do the job, we’re not going to meet the goal—period,” says McIlwain. “We do need to put a lot of money and energy and resources into making sure that we have the workforce available to do it.”</p><p>In addition to the technicians working with the systems, the country needs way more electricians to retrofit homes to go fully electric beyond heat pumps, with solar panels and induction stoves and home batteries. To help there, last year the White House announced the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-is-mobilizing-an-army-to-fight-the-climate-crisis/">formation of the American Climate Corps</a>, which aims to put more than 20,000 people to work in clean energy and overall climate resilience.</p><p>With states collaborating like this on heat pumps, the idea is to lift the device from an obscure technology cherished by climate nerds into ubiquity, for the good of consumers and the planet. “We need to be sending these unmistakable signals to the marketplace that heat pumps and zero-emission homes are the future,” says Casale. “This agreement between this many states really sets the stage for doing that.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

Luhn already held several patents, including one for a device that could measure a cloth’s thread count and another for a guide that determined what mixed drinks you could make from the ingredients in your kitchen. But in a 1953 internal IBM paper, he proposed a new technique for storing and retrieving information that is now built into just about all computational systems: the hash table.</p>
<p>Hash tables are a major class of data structures. They offer an especially convenient method for accessing and altering information in massive databases. But this technology comes with an unavoidable trade-off.</p>
<p>In a 1957 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5392733">paper</a> published in the <em>IBM Journal of Research and Development</em>, W. Wesley Peterson identified the main technical challenge that hash tables pose: They need to be fast, meaning that they can quickly retrieve the necessary information. But they also need to be compact, using as little memory as possible. These twin objectives are fundamentally at odds. Accessing and modifying a database can be done more quickly when the hash table has more memory; and operations become slower in hash tables that use less space. Ever since Peterson laid out this challenge, researchers have tried to find the best balance between time and space.</p>
<p>Computer scientists have now mathematically proved that they have found the optimal trade-off. The solution came from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00602">pair</a> of recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02253">papers</a> that complemented each other. “These papers resolve the long-standing open question about the best possible space-time trade-offs, yielding deeply surprising results that I expect will have a significant impact for many years to come,” said <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/">Michael Mitzenmacher</a>, a computer scientist at Harvard University who was not involved in either study.</p>
<p>“I would definitely say it is a big deal,” added <a href="https://rasmuspagh.net/">Rasmus Pagh</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen. “A lot of people have worked on this problem, trying to see how much you can squeeze space, while also having time-efficient operations. This is the one I would have loved to solve.”</p>
<h2><strong>Making a Hash of It</strong></h2>
<p>Hash tables are among the oldest, simplest, fastest and most widely used data structures today. They’re designed to perform three basic operations: insertions, which add new items to the database; queries, which access an item or check to see whether it exists; and deletions. A hash table can be ephemeral — existing only as long as a particular program runs — or it can be a permanent part of your computer’s operating system. A web browser such as Chrome or Safari may have multiple built-in hash tables intended to keep track of different kinds of data.</p>
<p>Entries in a hash table are stored as pairs, with the item — the information itself — connected to a key that identifies the information. Plug a key into a hash table’s query algorithm, and it takes you directly to the item. This may not sound so extraordinary, but for enormous databases it can be a great time-saver.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="Black and white photo of Hans Peter Luhn in a suit, reading a piece of paper." src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/02/HansPeterLuhn-BY-Courtesy-of-IBM-Corporation-2.webp"></p></div><figcaption><div><p>In 1953, Hans Peter Luhn suggested a new way to store and retrieve information called the hash table.</p><p>Courtesy of IBM Corporation</p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>To take an extremely simplified example, consider the Oxford English Dictionary, which has definitions for more than 600,000 words. If a digital edition relies on a hash table, you can simply use a given word as a key and proceed straight to the definition. Without a hash table, the dictionary would likely rely on a much slower search mechanism, using a process of elimination to eventually converge on the requested definition. And while a hash table can find any word in a constant amount of time (usually a tiny fraction of a second), the search time for other methods can go up as the number of words in the dictionary increases. A hash table also offers another advantage: It can keep the dictionary dynamic, making it easy to insert new words and delete outdated ones.</p>
<p>Researchers have spent decades building hash tables that attempt to maximize speed and minimize memory. In the 20th century, solutions tended to offer significant gains in just one aspect, time or space. Then in 2003, researchers <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45061-0_30">showed</a> that it was theoretically possible to make a major efficiency leap in both time and space simultaneously. It would take another two decades, however, for researchers to figure out the ideal balance between the two.</p>
<h2><strong>The Data Shuffle</strong></h2>
<p>The first major step toward that goal came in 2022 at a <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2022/STOCprogram.html">major computer science conference</a> in Rome. There, a team proposed a hash table with new features that could deliver the best combination of time and space efficiency yet conceived. The first author of the paper (listed alphabetically) was Michael Bender of Stony Brook University, so it is commonly referred to as the Bender et al. hash table. While the team didn’t try to build a functioning hash table, they proved that it could, in principle, be constructed with the features they described.</p>
<p>To evaluate the hash table they came up with, the group produced a trade-off curve — a graph that plots the time per operation (insertion or deletion) on one axis and the space taken up by memory on the other. But this graph defines space in a special way: Because of how they’re built, hash tables need more memory than just the bare minimum required to store a given set of items. Computer scientists call this extra space “wasted bits,” even though they’re not really wasted and are, to some extent, necessary. The space axis on a trade-off curve measures the number of wasted bits per key.</p>
<p>By analyzing a trade-off curve, researchers can figure out the fastest time possible for a hash table that uses a given amount of space. They can also flip the question around to figure out the smallest possible space for a given operation time. Usually, a small change in one variable will lead to a small change in the other, said <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/williamkuszmaul">William Kuszmaul</a>, a theoretical computer scientist at Harvard and a co-author of the 2022 paper. “If you double the time, perhaps you’ll halve the number of wasted bits per key.”</p>
<p>But that’s not the case with the hash table they designed. “If you increase the time by a little bit, the wasted bits per key decrease exponentially,” Kuszmaul said. The trade-off curve was so steep, it was literally off the charts.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="William Kuszmaul in a checkered shirt stands in front of a whiteboard with figures on it." src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/02/WilliamKuszmaul-BY-RoseSilver-copy.webp"></p></div><figcaption><div><p>William Kuszmaul helped design a hash table in 2022 that seemed incredibly efficient in both memory and speed.</p><p>Rose Silver</p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>The team built their hash table in two parts. They had a primary data structure, in which the items are stored without any wasted bits at all, and a secondary data structure, which helps a query request find the item it’s looking for. While the group did not invent the notion of a secondary data structure, they did make a crucial discovery that made their hyperefficient hash table possible: The structure’s overall memory efficiency depends on how the primary structure arranges its stored items.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that every item in the primary structure has preferred storage locations — a best location, a second-best one, a third best and so on. If an item is in its best spot, the number 1 is affixed to it, and that number is stored in the secondary data structure. In response to a query, the secondary structure provides just the number 1, which spells out the item’s exact location in the primary structure.</p>
<p>If the item is in its 100th-best spot, the secondary data structure attaches the number 100. And because the system uses binary, it represents the number 100 as 1100100. It takes more memory, of course, to store the number 1100100 than 1 — the number assigned to an item when it’s in the best spot. Differences like that become significant if you’re storing, say, a million items.</p>
<p>So the team realized that if you continually shift items in the primary data structure into their more preferred locations, you could significantly reduce the memory consumed by the secondary structure without having to increase query times.</p>
<p>“Before this work, no one had realized you could further compress the data structure by moving information around,” Pagh said. “That was the big insight of the Bender paper.”</p>
<p>The authors showed that their invention established a new upper bound for the most efficient hash tables, meaning that it was the best data structure yet devised in terms of both time and space efficiency. But the possibility remained that someone else might do even better.</p>
<h2><strong>Bound to Succeed</strong></h2>
<p>The next year, a team led by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~hy2/">Huacheng Yu</a>, a computer scientist at Princeton University, tried to improve the Bender team’s hash table. “We worked really hard and couldn’t do it,” said <a href="https://orbitingflea.github.io/">Renfei Zhou</a>, a student at Tsinghua University in Beijing and a member of Yu’s team. “That’s when we suspected that their upper bound was [also] a lower bound” — the best that can possibly be achieved. “When the upper bound equals the lower bound, the game is over, and you have your answer.” No matter how clever you are, no hash table can do any better.</p>
<p>Yu’s team employed a novel strategy to find out if that hunch was correct by calculating a lower bound from first principles. First, they reasoned that to perform an insertion or a deletion, a hash table — or, really, any data structure — must access the computer’s memory some number of times. If they could figure out the minimum number of times needed for a space-efficient hash table, they could multiply that by the time required per access (a constant), giving them a lower bound on the runtime.</p>
<p>But if they didn’t know anything about the hash table (except that it was space-efficient), how could the researchers figure out the minimum number of times required to access the memory? They derived it purely from theory, using a seemingly unrelated field called the theory of communication complexity, which studies how many bits are required to convey information between two parties. Eventually, the team succeeded: They figured out how many times a data structure must access its memory per operation.</p>

They were then able to establish a lower bound on the runtime for any space-efficient hash table. And they saw that it matched the Bender hash table exactly. “We thought [at first] it could be improved,” Zhou said. “It turned out we were wrong.” That, in turn, meant that Peterson’s problem had finally been solved.</p>
<p>Besides answering the decades-old question, Kuszmaul said, the amazing thing about the Yu proof is its generality. “Their lower bound applies to all possible data structures, including ones that have not been invented yet.” That means no method of data storage can ever beat the Bender hash table in terms of memory and speed.</p>
<h2><strong>Hashing Into the Future</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the new hash table’s unprecedented efficiency, no one is likely to try building it anytime soon. It’s just too complicated to construct. “An algorithm that is fast in theory is not necessarily fast in practice,” Zhou said.</p>
<p>It’s not unusual for such gaps between theory and practice to persist for a long while, Kuszmaul said, because theorists tend to ignore constant factors. The time it takes to perform an operation is typically multiplied by a number, some constant whose exact value may be immaterial from a theoretical standpoint. “But in practice, constants really matter,” he said. “In the real world, a factor of 10 is a game ender.”</p>
<p>Actual hash tables are still improving in material ways, even if they’re falling far short of the theoretical ideal. For example, a new hash table called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04068">IcebergHT</a>, built by Bender, Kuszmaul and others, is far better than its predecessors. According to Kuszmaul, it’s twice as fast as the most space-efficient hash table available today, and it uses three times less space than the fastest hash table.</p>

<p>Mitzenmacher hopes that the 2023 result may soon yield another kind of benefit: “Whenever you get a new lower bound — especially one that involves some new techniques — there is always hope that you could use them … for related problems.”</p>
<p>There’s also the intellectual satisfaction that comes from knowing you have solved a difficult and long-standing problem, said the computer scientist <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/indyk/">Piotr Indyk</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Once you’re sure that certain data structures cannot be improved upon, that can help focus the research effort.” Finally, data researchers can turn their attention away from Peterson’s challenge and focus on new problems in theoretical computer science, of which there is no shortage.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Tiny Quadrotor Learns to Fly in 18 Seconds" data-elid="2667196800" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/drone-quadrotor" data-authors="Evan Ackerman" data-page-title="Tiny Quadrotor Learns to Fly in 18 Seconds - IEEE Spectrum"><p>
	It’s kind of astonishing how quadrotors have scaled over the past decade. Like, we’re now at the point where they’re verging on disposable, at least from a commercial or research perspective—for a bit over US $200, you can buy a little <a href="https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">27-gram, completely open-source drone</a>, and all you have to do is teach it to fly. That’s where things do get a bit more challenging, though, because teaching drones to fly is not a straightforward process. Thanks to good simulation and techniques like reinforcement learning, it’s much easier to imbue drones with autonomy than it used to be. But it’s not typically a fast process, and it can be finicky to make a smooth transition from simulation to reality.
</p><p>
	New York University’s <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/" target="_blank">Agile Robotics and Perception Lab</a> in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.tii.ae/" target="_blank">Technology Innovation Institute</a> (TII) have managed to streamline the process of getting basic autonomy to work on drones, and streamline it by a lot: The lab’s system is able to train a drone in simulation from nothing up to stable and controllable flying in 18 seconds flat on a MacBook Pro. And it actually takes longer to compile and flash the firmware onto the drone itself than it does for the entire training process.
</p><hr><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="1fdc3045b585634aaa452d87bd2e574e"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NRD43ZA1D-4?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">ARPL NYU</small></p><p>
	So not only is the drone able to keep a stable hover while rejecting pokes and nudges and wind, but it’s also able to fly specific trajectories. Not bad for 18 seconds, right?
</p><p>
	One of the things that typically slows down training times is the need to keep refining exactly what you’re training for, without refining it so much that you’re only training your system to fly in your specific simulation rather than the real world. The strategy used here is what the researchers call a curriculum (you can also think of it as a sort of lesson plan) to adjust the reward function used to train the system through reinforcement learning. The curriculum starts things off being more forgiving and gradually increasing the penalties to emphasize robustness and reliability. This is all about efficiency: Doing that training that you need to do in the way that it needs to be done to get the results you want, and no more.
</p><p>
	There are other, more straightforward, tricks that optimize this technique for speed as well. The deep-reinforcement learning algorithms are particularly efficient, and leverage the hardware acceleration that comes along with Apple’s M-series processors. The simulator efficiency multiplies the benefits of the curriculum-driven sample efficiency of the reinforcement-learning pipeline, leading to that wicked-fast training time.
</p><p>
	This approach isn’t limited to simple tiny drones—it’ll work on pretty much any drone, including bigger and more expensive ones, or even a drone that you yourself build from scratch.

We’re told that it took minutes rather than seconds to train a policy for the drone in the video above, although the researchers expect that 18 seconds is achievable even for a more complex drone like this in the near future. And it’s all <a href="https://github.com/arplaboratory/learning-to-fly" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open source</a>, so you can, in fact, build a drone and teach it to fly with this system. But if you wait a little bit, it’s only going to get better: The researchers tell us that they’re working on integrating with the PX4 open source drone autopilot. Longer term, the idea is to have a single policy that can adapt to different environmental conditions, as well as different vehicle configurations, meaning that this could work on all kinds of flying robots rather than just quadrotors.

	Everything you need to run this yourself <a href="https://github.com/arplaboratory/learning-to-fly" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>, and the paper is on ArXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13081" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>
