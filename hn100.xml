Would it take advantage of elevation for views or make sure to block a nearby neighbour? Would it deal well with moisture, or fires, or access roads?

Even without changing any of these details we couldn't take the floorplans and just submit them for a different part of town as they would likely not match the requirements there.

Material strength is physical facts.  Water runs down hill.  Many other such things.  Many towns are in one of a couple national form based codes plans where if you follow the rules as laid out there is no need for approval as the engineering was already done for any generic house.  If your town/state is not, or is but provides extras on top it is corruption: either the industry is trying to create a local monopoly via legal means; or your town board is trying to increase their power.  Either way it is only making housing more expensive without serving any public good.<p>Not all houses need to meet the form based codes.  If you want to do something different then you need a professional engineer to stamp and approve the plans - once stamped the town needs no more input.</p><p>Apartments and commercial buildings start to get more complex (but even then many meet form based codes as it is cheaper than calculating out all the stresses).  However again professional engineer needs to approve the plans not the town.

I looked around for this type of thing back when I started, which was 2008.  At the time I didn't really find anything.  My wife and I ended up drawing it out ourselves, and my dad and I ended up sort of winging it during construction.  As in, "These plans don't quite work here, so we'll make these adjustments right now."  It should be said also that neither I nor my wife are architects.  At the time I would have said my dad was an extremely experienced and proficient amateur builder (he also built his house around 1980), and that I was just an amateur.  After 15 years of working on this project, I will call myself a proficient amateur as well.  I know that we could have done better at planning - I did not know enough about building before we started and relied too heavily on my dad during those times.  If I had the opportunity to do it a second time, it would be better, but I'm not doing it! (Probably).<p>Here are some of the benefits of building your own house:</p><p>1. You know everything about it.  Well, some things you forget, but most of it remains in the back of your mind. "Didn't I run some extra wire here just in case?"</p><p>2. You learn all of the skills that you will need to maintain your home, if you don't already have them.  This means you never need a handyman (but your weekends are shot).</p><p>3. Just like nobody will watch your money like you, nobody will build your house like you.  There are a lot of really crappy houses being built in 2023, and for the last 75 years or so.  The reason for the crappiness, of course, is money.Being able to make the decision to use quality building materials instead of collecting 10% more profit, for example, can result in a really big improvement over conventional building.</p><p>4. It's really satisfying living in your handiwork.  I'm sure there are more reasons - I can't write all day.</p><p>Now the pitfalls and reasons it sucks:</p><p>1. It's really frustrating living in your handiwork.  For me, every time I walk past something that still needs my attention, it's a little stressor.  Of course that's not too different from regular homeownership, I think.  There are also a lot of times that I wish I would have planned it better.</p><p>2. Regulations (and financing) are <i>really, really</i> not in favor of building your own home.  Unless you are a professional builder as well.  Permits will expire way too soon, you won't understand their processes, they won't understand your processes.  Assuming you need to borrow money, the bank won't know what the hell to do.  They will literally freak out and nobody will be able to help you.  This is too far outside of their routines.</p><p>3. It's a lifetime commitment.  I mean, I guess it doesn't have to be, but for me it definitely feels that way.  I built too big, and now I'm stuck working on it for what feels like forever.</p><p>Also, I'm in a temperate climate (Georgia, USA) where I don't have to worry about cold weather too much.  I'm back in the woods where people don't ask too many questions.  I have the support of my family, which I couldn't have done without.  Overall, I'm happy with where I am.  I usually enjoy the work, and at this point I don't mind taking time to do other things as well.

In the State of Florida where I live, all drawings and plans become public record and these would definitely be enough to build. This is because all drawings used to build are required to be submitted.

I mean, if anyone has those plans, then you'd think they'd have been scanned and uploaded to IA. I guess no one ever took Sears up on the "we'll send you the plans for free" page that was in the catalog.<p>I can say that the places that sell house plans, they want anywhere from about $3000 on up for the paper version, and they're usually numbered and watermarked. Digital ends up costing you several more grand on top of that, and I'm not sure exactly how they lock those down. <i>On top of that</i>, they're often missing important things like the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing plans.

Free plans probably could mean printed out single sheet plans with renderings. Open Source usually means the legal freedom to change, update and share whatever it is. To me, the source of the plans is provided so that someone could change/update the plans as they wish. In the context of architectural plans this could be the files in something like Fusion 360 if that were actually used for full house plans (I don't think it is).<p>Edit to add: I doubt an architectural firm would give their source files to plans away for free. They put a lot of effort into creating them, its their business after all.

                  <p><span>In Canada you are typically looking at approx 10-15k for drawings and to build the home you will spend anywhere from 400-Plus CAD per sq/meter depending on what kind of finish you want. This price is for a brick home, wooden frame, asphalt shingle roof. Nothing fancy. Typically drawings don't include any of the rough in like plumbing and electrical. That is designed on the fly by the contractor who does the work. House are typically built like shit since people only want to invest in the finish and don't care about the mechanical piece since it is out of sight and out of mind. If you can GC your own house, you can pick the contractors and supervise the construction and the quality of work will be better. If you hire a General Contractor, they will typically charge cost/plus 15% -20%. Most folks in Canada and the US buy houses that are built by large corporations where they have no control over the quality, etc. They just pick a model from the handful offered when there is a new development.There are few incentives or subsides.  The US is very similar.</span></p></div></td></tr>

            <p>I am currently not able to change the ulimit on my machine. As of the newest MacOs releases (11.7.9, 12.6.8, and 13.5) I am no longer able to increase the ulimit of my computer using the strategies outlined here:</p>
<ul><li><span>https://wilsonmar.github.io/maximum-limits/</span></li><li><span>https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/453050/how-to-increase-global-maxfiles-ulimit-on-osx-13-1-ventura?newreg=44fe471004094ccdb3ba51c1c3f9f84a</span></li></ul>
<p>Running <code>sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 65536 200000</code> returns <code>Could not set resource limits: 150: Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged</code>.</p>
<p>This is relevant for me as I am using Vite which is currently broken and blocks me from developing locally. It is mentioned in their troubleshooting page (<span>https://vitejs.dev/guide/troubleshooting.html#requests-are-stalled-forever</span>) that Vite causes a large number of open files and how to increase the limit. There are similar comments in the Ruby Vite troubleshooting page (https://vite-ruby.netlify.app/guide/troubleshooting.html#requests-to-vite-sporadically-return-a-500-error-response). I have added a comment in the Vite discussion board about this issue.</p>
<p>There is a discussion  the Apple Stack Exchange that reports this problem but no one has provided a solution yet (<span>https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/462489/how-to-increase-global-max-opened-files-limit-on-osx-13-5-ventura</span>)</p>

            <p>Changing a system-wide setting to work around an issue with a specific product seems rather extreme.  A better option would be to change it for that process specifically.  If you have access to the code, add a call to <code>setrlimit</code>.  If you don’t have access to the code, you could work out how the code is launched and add a wrapper, using either a shell script (and hence <code>ulimit</code>) or a native executable (<code>setrlimit</code> again).</p>

            <p>Vite isn't the only tool affected.</p>
<p>Maven also fails on any moderately sized project as well since any non-trivial project can require more than 256 open files for compilation.</p>
<p>Is there another solution that can be applied systemwide instead of writing wrappers for each tool I notice that is broken after 13.5?</p>

<p>Is there another solution that can be applied systemwide … ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no direct replacement for the previous <code>launchctl</code> mechanism.  The fact that this was placed behind a SIP barrier indicates that this is not accidental.</p>
<p>IMO there are three paths forward:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>If you hit this limit running programs from a shell, use <code>ulimit</code> to change the settings in your shell.  You can do this either interactively or in your profile.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you hit this with a GUI app, I recommend that you discuss this with the app’s vendor.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you hit this with some sort of Unix-y daemon or agent, you can tweak the settings in its <code>launchd</code> property list.  You might also want to raise this with the program’s vendor, because having a configuration option for this would make sense.</p>

        <p>I wonder what the appropriate action is, for something like IntelliJ IDEA. The limit has to be changed for IntelliJ itself, Maven, npm. Probably need to change the limit for whatever compiler is used (java, javascript...)</p>

    ">
        <p>For IntelliJ you can set the maxFile limit at process level from the terminal and then run IntelliJ IDE from that Shell
Commands to increase the limit at process level
<code>ulimit -Sn 524288</code>
<code>ulimit -Hn 10485760</code>
Then run this command to the IDE
<code>/Applications/Intellij\ IDEA.app/Contents/MacOS/idea</code></p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://adnauseam.io/" rel="nofollow">AdNauseam</a> is a lightweight browser extension that blends software tool and artware intervention to actively fight back against tracking by advertising networks. AdNauseam works like an ad-blocker (it is built atop <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a>) to silently simulate clicks on each blocked ad, confusing trackers as to one's real interests. At the same time, AdNauseam serves as a means of voicing your discontent with advertising networks that disregard privacy and engage in bulk surveillance.</p>
<p dir="auto">In light of the industry's failure to address the excesses of network tracking, AdNauseam allows individual users to take matters into their own hands, offering active defense against surveillance, profiling and potential discrimination. The software thus represents a similar approach to that of <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot" rel="nofollow">TrackMeNot</a>, relocating power in the hands of individual users, rather than vast commercial entities. For further information on this approach, please see <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/resources/trackmenot2009.pdf" rel="nofollow">this paper</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/news/eye-scans-detect-signs-parkinson-s-disease-seven-years-diagnosis">https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/news/eye-scans-detect-signs-parkinson-s-disease-seven-years-diagnosis</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37230843">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A team led by Siegfried Wagner and Pearse Keane of Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology (and spanning UCL institutions) has identified markers that indicate the presence of Parkinson’s disease in patients on average seven years before clinical presentation. This is the first time anyone has shown these findings several years before diagnosis, and these results were made possible by the largest study to date on retinal imaging in Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<p>The study, published today in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, identified markers of Parkinson’s in eye scans with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Its analysis of the AlzEye dataset was repeated using the wider UK Biobank database (healthy volunteers), which replicated the discoveries. The use of these two large, powerful datasets has enabled the team to identify these subtle markers, even though Parkinson’s disease has a relatively low prevalence (0.1-0.2% of the population). Generation of the AlzEye dataset was enabled by INSIGHT, the world's largest database of retinal images and associated clinical data.</p>
<p>The use of data from eye scans has previously revealed signs of other neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis and, most recently, schizophrenia, in an emerging and exciting field of research referred to as “oculomics”.</p>
<p>Doctors have known for a long time that the eye can act as a ‘window’ to the rest of the body, giving a direct insight into many aspects of our health. High-resolution images of the retina are now a routine part of eye care – in particular, a type of 3D scan known as ‘optical coherence tomography’ (OCT), which is widely used in eye clinics and high-street opticians. In less than a minute, an OCT scan produces a cross-section of the retina (the back of the eye) in incredible detail – down to a thousandth of a millimetre.</p>
<p>These images are extremely useful for monitoring eye health, but their value goes much further, as a scan of the retina is the only non-intrusive way to view layers of cells below the skin’s surface. In recent years, researchers have started to use powerful computers to accurately analyse large numbers of OCTs and other eye images, in a fraction of the time it would take a human. Using a type of AI known as ‘machine learning’, computers are now able to uncover hidden information about the whole body from these images alone. Harnessing this new potential is what oculomics is about. <br>This work has involved collaboration between the NIHR (National Institute of Health and Social Care) Biomedical Research Centres at Moorfields Eye Hospital, University Hospital Birmingham, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), Oxford University Hospital, University College Hospital London and the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health. The scope and quality of the research has been maximised through these exceptional NHS research partnerships.</p>
<p>Alastair Denniston, consultant ophthalmologist at University Hospitals Birmingham, professor at the University of Birmingham and part of NIHR Moorfields BRC said: “This work demonstrates the potential for eye data, harnessed by the technology to pick up signs and changes too subtle for humans to see. We can now detect very early signs of Parkinson’s, opening up new possibilities for treatment.”</p>
<p>Siegfried Wagner, clinical research fellow at Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology researcher and principal investigator for this and several other AlzEye studies, added: “I continue to be amazed by what we can discover through eye scans. While we are not yet ready to predict whether an individual will develop Parkinson’s, we hope that this method could soon become a pre-screening tool for people at risk of disease. Finding signs of a number of diseases before symptoms emerge means that, in the future, people could have the time to make lifestyle changes to prevent some conditions arising, and clinicians could delay the onset and impact of lifechanging neurodegenerative disorders.”</p>
<p>Louisa Wickham, Moorfields’ medical director, explained that “Increasing imaging across a wider population will have a huge impact on public health in the future, and will eventually lead to predictive analysis. OCT scans are more scalable, non-invasive, lower cost and quicker than brain scans for this purpose.”</p>

<p>I have a sportbike and use the stem mount. I can see a cruiser being a lot shakier especially on handles or something. So I'm curious if sportbikes and stem mounts would result in similar issues.

<p>The fight over water is nothing new on Maui. But the impact on the county’s ability to battle fires is coming clear. </p>



<p>With wildfires ravaging West Maui on Aug. 8, a state water official delayed the release of water that landowners wanted to help protect their property from fires. The water standoff played out over much of the day and the water didn’t come until too late.</p>



<p>The dispute involved the Department of Land and Natural Resources’ water resource management division and&nbsp;<a href="https://westmauiwater.com/">West Maui Land Co.</a>, which manages agricultural and residential subdivisions in West Maui as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://westmauiwater.com/lic">Launiupoko Irrigation Co.</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://westmauiwater.com/lwc-account">Launiupoko Water Co.</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://westmauiwater.com/owc-account">Olowalu Water Co.</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://westmauiwater.com/htwa-account">Ha’iku Town Water Association.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>DLNR delayed releasing water requested by West Maui Land Co. to help prevent the spread of fire, sources familiar with the situation said.</p>

<p>Specifically, according to accounts of four people with knowledge of the situation, <a href="https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/cwrm/aboutus/deputy/">M. Kaleo Manuel</a>, a Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner and DLNR’s deputy director for water resource management, initially balked at West Maui Land Co.’s requests for additional water to help prevent the fire from spreading to properties managed by the company.</p>



<div><header><h4>A Note On Anonymous Sources</h4></header><p>Civil Beat generally uses on-the-record sources. However, we occasionally use unnamed sources when a source is sharing important information we wouldn’t have otherwise been able to obtain and when they could face negative consequences for speaking publicly. The reporter and at least one editor must know the identity of the source and the use of anonymity must be approved by a senior editor.

<p>According to the sources, Manuel wanted West Maui Land to get permission from a taro, or kalo, farm located downstream from the company’s property. Manuel eventually released water but not until after the fire had spread. It was not clear on Monday how much damage the fire did in the interim or whether homes were damaged.</p>



<p>Manuel declined to be interviewed for this story. DLNR’s communications office said in an email that it was supporting the state’s emergency communications response and “unable to facilitate your inquiry at this time.” </p>



<p>Glenn Tremble, an executive with West Maui Land Co. said to have knowledge of the dispute, did not return a request for comment.</p>



<p>However, Gov. Josh Green spoke candidly Monday during a press briefing about conflicts over water on Maui – although not the DLNR-West Maui Land Co. incident directly – and encouraged news media to explore the issue. The conflicts are rooted in the diversion of water by large plantations, which starved downstream users from a resource essential for Native Hawaiian agriculture, particularly the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/03/a-struggle-over-water-lawmakers-push-to-protect-kalo-cultivation/">traditional practice of growing taro or kalo</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the governor said conflicts over water are being reshaped in an age of climate change and wildfires. Now the conflict includes opponents who do not want water to be used to fight fires, the governor said.</p>

<p>“One thing that people need to understand especially those from far away is that there’s been a great deal of water conflict on Maui for many years,” Green said. “It’s important that we’re honest about this. People have been fighting against the release of water to fight fires. I’ll leave that to you to explore.”</p>



<p>“We have a difficult time on Maui and other rural areas getting enough water for houses, for our people, for any response,” Green added. “But it’s important we start being honest. There are currently people still fighting in our state giving us water access to fight and prepare for fires even as more storms arise.”</p>



<p>Green said the state is in the midst of a “comprehensive review” by Attorney General Anne Lopez of decisions made before and during the firefighting efforts.</p>



<p>“There will be multiple reviews at every level,” he said.</p>



<p>In 2022, two Maui senators, <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/legislature/memberpage.aspx?member=186&amp;year=2023">Gil Keith-Agaran</a> and <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/legislature/memberpage.aspx?member=161&amp;year=2023">Lynne DeCoite</a>, introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session/archives/measure_indiv_Archives.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=2355&amp;year=2022">a measure</a>&nbsp;to push DLNR to allow fresh water to be used to fight fires and pointed to West Maui as being particularly vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bill noted that “in 2019, West Maui suffered from an active fire season in which wildfires scorched twenty-five thousand acres of land.” It would have required DLNR to “cooperate with the counties and reservoir owners to develop protocols and agreements for the use of reservoir waters for fire safety purposes.”</p>



<p>Specifically, the measure said, “The protocols and agreements shall address the emergency use of reservoir waters for prevention, control, and extinguishment of fires while taking into account the various competing uses of reservoir waters.”</p>



<p>The bill died without a hearing.</p>

<p><img alt="LIBREOFFICE" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/libreoffice.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
One nugget of information in the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/LibreOffice-7.6">LibreOffice 7.6</a> release announcement for those who missed it and deserves calling out specifically... Succeeding LibreOffice 7.6 will not be v7.7 or v8.0 but rather v24.2.
</p><p>
LibreOffice developers are moving to a year.month based versioning system. Thus the next release with their six-month based release cadence will be LibreOffice 24.2 and in turn LibreOffice 24.8, 25.2, 25.8, 26.2, etc. Due to the maturity of the LibreOffice codebase, the current versioning system isn't really reflective of major changes and in turn can be hard to genuinely justify bumping the significant version number. By switching to a calendar-based numbering system it's now decoupled from features or not of that release.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=libreoffice_242" alt="LibreOffice 24.2 dev builds"></p>
<p>There were some internal discussions whether it should move to say LibreOffice 2024.2 but in the end they decided for a YY.M-based scheme. There were also discussions whether to just always increase the major version number with each new release as Firefox and Google Chrome do now, but that too was <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libreoffice/2023-June/090430.html">decided</a> against.
</p><p>
So next February, look forward to LibreOffice 24.2.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“I had heard rumors that this was coming up, and I didn’t know exactly what to expect,” said <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vesna">Vesna Stojanoska</a>, a mathematician at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign who attended the conference.</p>
<p>It was soon clear the rumors were true. Beginning on Tuesday, and over the next three days, Levy and his co-authors — <a href="https://burklund.github.io/">Robert Burklund</a>, <a href="https://web.mit.edu/~jhahn01/www/">Jeremy Hahn</a> and <a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=1203">Tomer Schlank</a> — explained to the crowd of some 200 mathematicians how they’d proved that the telescope conjecture was false, making it the only one of Ravenel’s original conjectures not to be true.</p>
<p>The disproof of the telescope conjecture has wide-ranging implications, but one of the simplest and most profound is this: It means that in very high dimensions (think of a 100-dimensional sphere), the universe of different shapes is far more complicated than mathematicians anticipated.</p>
<h2><strong>Mapping the Maps</strong></h2>
<p>To classify shapes, or topological spaces, mathematicians distinguish between differences that matter and those that don’t. Homotopy theory is a perspective from which to make those distinctions. It considers a ball and an egg to be fundamentally the same topological space, because you can bend and stretch one into the other without ripping either. In the same way, homotopy theory considers a ball and an inner tube to be fundamentally different because you have to tear a hole in the ball to deform it into the inner tube.</p>
<p>Homotopy is useful for classifying topological spaces — creating a chart of all the kinds of shapes that are possible. It’s also important for understanding something else mathematicians care about: maps between spaces. If you have two topological spaces, one way to probe their properties is to look for functions that convert, or map, points on one to points on the other — input a point on space A, get a point on space B as your output, and do that for all the points on A.</p>

<p>To see how these maps work, and why they illuminate properties of the spaces involved, start with a circle. Now map it onto the two-dimensional sphere, which is the surface of a ball. There are infinitely many ways of doing this. If you imagine the sphere as Earth’s surface, you could put your circle at any line of latitude, for example. From the perspective of homotopy theory, they’re all equivalent, or homotopic, because they can all shrink down to a point at the north or south pole.</p>
<p>Next, map the circle onto the two-dimensional surface of an inner tube (a one-holed torus). Again, there are infinitely many ways of doing this, and most are homotopic. But not all of them. You could place a circle horizontally or vertically around the torus, and neither can be smoothly deformed into the other. These are two (of many) ways of mapping a circle onto the torus, while there is just one way to map it onto a sphere, reflecting a fundamental difference between the two spaces: The torus has one hole while the sphere has none.</p>
<p>It’s easy to count the ways we can map from the circle to the two-dimensional sphere or torus. They’re familiar spaces that are easy to visualize. But counting maps is much harder when higher-dimensional spaces are involved.</p>
<h2><strong>Dimensional Differences</strong></h2>
<p>If two spheres have the same dimension, there are always infinitely many maps between them. And if the space you’re mapping from is lower-dimensional than the space you’re mapping to (as in our example of the one-dimensional circle mapped onto a two-dimensional sphere), there is always only one map.</p>
<p>Partly for that reason, counting maps is most interesting when the space you’re mapping from has a higher dimension than the space you’re mapping to, like when you map a seven-dimensional sphere onto a three-dimensional sphere. In cases like those, the number of maps is always finite.</p>
<p>“The maps between spheres in general tend to be more interesting when the source has a larger dimension,” Hahn said.</p>
<p>Moreover, the number of maps depends only on the difference in the number of dimensions (once the dimensions get big enough compared to the difference). That is, the number of maps from a 73-dimensional sphere to a 53-dimensional sphere is the same as the number of maps from a 225-dimensional sphere to a 205-dimensional sphere, because in both cases, the difference in dimension is 20.</p>
<p>Mathematicians would like to know the number of maps between spaces of any difference in dimension. They’ve managed to compute the number of maps for almost all differences in dimension up to 100: There are 24 maps between spheres when the difference is 20, and&nbsp; 3,144,960 when it’s 23.</p>

                    <li>
                        <b> Second.</b> Find the connection between the

                    <li>
                        Have you seen it before?  Or have you seen the

                        use its result?  Could you use its method?
                        Should you introduce some auxiliary element in
                        order to make its use possible?

                    <li>
                        Could you restate the problem?  Could you
                        restate it still differently?  Go back to
                        definitions.

                        drop the other part; how far is the unknown then
                        determined, how can it vary?  Could you derive

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Credit reporting agency Experian must pay a $650,000 fine for violating spam laws. The US Justice Department and the FTC have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/permanent-injunction-and-650000-civil-penalty-imposed-experian-consumer-services-allegedly">announced a permanent injunction</a> granted by the US District Court in central California, forbidding the company’s deceptive marketing email practices. The regulators’ <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/1ECSComplaint.pdf">complaint last week</a> alleged that Experian had sent customers with free credit monitoring memberships deceptive marketing emails that lacked both “clear and conspicuous notice” of the ability to opt out and “a mechanism for doing so.” </p><p>The FTC says this violates the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/can-spam">CAN-SPAM Act</a>). The FTC referred the case to the DOJ to file the injunction before the court granted it, ordering Experian to pay the almost three-quarter-million-dollar fine within seven days.</p><p>If you’ve been unlucky enough to receive Experian spam, you may already know the format. A new car has been noticed on your account — please confirm it! You need dark web monitoring to protect you! And, of course, that old classic: boost your FICO score. And of course, when you log in to your account, you’re treated to a page that wants you to upgrade your account or sign up for a loan, though that doesn’t appear to fall under the purview of this case.</p><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/376x196/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/384x200/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/415x216/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/480x250/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/540x281/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/640x334/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/750x391/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/828x432/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/1080x563/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/1200x625/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/1440x751/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/1920x1001/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/2048x1067/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/2400x1251/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/2400x1251/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p>Text at the bottom of emails <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/1-ECSComplaintExhibits.pdf">shown in court docs</a> reads, “This is not a marketing email,” and claims the messages were notifications of recent account changes.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><!--[--><!--[--><div><p>Fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo is now available, with fine-tuning for GPT-4 coming this fall. This update gives developers the ability to customize models that perform better for their use cases and run these custom models at scale. Early tests have shown a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 Turbo can match, or even outperform, base GPT-4-level capabilities on certain narrow tasks. As with all our APIs, data sent in and out of the fine-tuning API is owned by the customer and is <a href="https://openai.com/api-data-privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not used by OpenAI</a>, or any other organization, to train other models.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="fine-tuning-use-cases" data-heading=""><p><h2>Fine-tuning use cases</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>Since the release of GPT-3.5 Turbo, developers and businesses have asked for the ability to customize the model to create unique and differentiated experiences for their users. With this launch, developers can now run supervised fine-tuning to make this model perform better for their use cases.</p><p>In our private beta, fine-tuning customers have been able to meaningfully improve model performance across common use cases, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Improved steerability</strong>: Fine-tuning allows businesses to make the model follow instructions better, such as making outputs terse or always responding in a given language. For instance, developers can use fine-tuning to ensure that the model always responds in German when prompted to use that language.</li><li><strong>Reliable output formatting:</strong> Fine-tuning improves the model's ability to consistently format responses—a crucial aspect for applications demanding a specific response format, such as code completion or composing API calls. A developer can use fine-tuning to more reliably convert user prompts into high-quality JSON snippets that can be used with their own systems.</li><li><strong>Custom tone:</strong> Fine-tuning is a great way to hone the qualitative feel of the model output, such as its tone, so it better fits the voice of businesses’ brands. A business with a recognizable brand voice can use fine-tuning for the model to be more consistent with their tone.</li></ul><p>In addition to increased performance, fine-tuning also enables businesses to <strong>shorten their prompts </strong>while ensuring similar performance.&nbsp; Fine-tuning with GPT-3.5-Turbo can also handle 4k tokens—double our previous fine-tuned models. Early testers have reduced prompt size by up to 90% by fine-tuning instructions into the model itself, speeding up each API call and cutting costs.</p><p>Fine-tuning is most powerful when combined with <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt-best-practices" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other techniques</a> such as prompt engineering, information retrieval, and function calling. Check out our <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fine-tuning guide</a> to learn more. Support for fine-tuning with function calling and <code>gpt-3.5-turbo-16k</code> will be coming later this fall. <br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><section><figure><p><h2>Fine-tuning steps</h2></p><div><!--[--><div><div><p><span>Step 3</span></p><p><span>Create a fine-tuning job</span></p></div><div><p>Once a model finishes the fine-tuning process, it is available to be used in production right away and has the same shared <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/what-are-the-rate-limits-for-our-api" target="_blank">rate limits</a> as the underlying model.</p></div></div><div><p><span>Step 4</span></p><p><span>Use a fine-tuned model</span></p></div><!--]--></div><p><figcaption> We will also be debuting a fine-tuning UI in the near future, which will give developers easier access to information about ongoing fine-tuning jobs, completed model snapshots, and more. </figcaption></p></figure></section><!--]--><!--[--><div id="safety" data-heading=""><p><h2>Safety</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>It is very important to us that the deployment of fine-tuning is safe. To preserve the default model's safety features through the&nbsp; fine-tuning process, fine-tuning training data is passed through our Moderation API and a GPT-4 powered moderation system to detect unsafe training data that conflict with our safety standards. <br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="pricing" data-heading=""><p><h2>Pricing</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>Fine-tuning costs are broken down into two buckets: the initial training cost and usage cost:</p><ul><li>Training: $0.008 / 1K Tokens</li><li>Usage input: $0.012 / 1K Tokens</li><li>Usage output: $0.016 / 1K Tokens</li></ul><p>For example, a <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> fine-tuning job with a training file of 100,000 tokens that is trained for 3 epochs would have an expected cost of $2.40.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="updated-gpt-3-models" data-heading=""><p><h2>Updated GPT-3 models</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>In July, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-4-api-general-availability" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">we announced</a> that the original GPT-3 base models (<code>ada</code>, <code>babbage</code>, <code>curie</code>, and <code>davinci</code>) would be turned off on January 4th, 2024. Today, we are making <code>babbage-002</code> and <code>davinci-002</code> available as replacements for these models, either as base or fine-tuned models. Customers can access those models by querying the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Completions API</a>.</p><p>These models can be fine-tuned with our new API endpoint <code>/v1/fine_tuning/jobs</code>. This new endpoint offers pagination and more extensibility to support the future evolution of the fine-tuning API. Transitioning from <code>/v1/fine-tunes</code> to the updated endpoint is straightforward and more details can be found in our new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fine-tuning guide</a>. This deprecates the old&nbsp;<code>/v1/fine-tunes</code> endpoint, which will be turned off on January 4th, 2024.</p><p>Pricing for base and fine-tuned GPT-3 models is as follows:<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--><!--]--></div></div>]]></description>

The outside world can answer each message very quickly, or not. You can't affect it that much.</p><p>Meanwhile, your program sits there, waiting for the answer to the message. And while it sits, what does it do in Python by default? It keeps the CPU core for itself.</p><p>Sure, this waiting and seating is often only a few milliseconds, so to a human it seems very quick at first glance. But one millisecond is a huge time for a computer that does billions of things in the blink of an eye.</p><p>asyncio, twisted, tornado and gevent have one trick up their sleeve: they can send a message to the network, and while waiting for the response, wake up another part of the program to do some other work. And they can do that with many messages in a row. While waiting for the network, they can let other parts of the program use the CPU core.</p><p>Note that they only can speed up waiting on the network. They will not make two calculations at the same time (can't use several CPU cores like with multiprocessing) and you can't speed up waiting on other types of I/O (like when you use threads to not block on user input or disk writes).</p><p>All in all, they are good for writing things like bots (web crawler, chat bots, network sniffers, etc.) and servers (web servers, proxies, ...). For maximum benefits, it's possible to use them inside other concurrency tools, such as multiprocessing or multithreading. You can perfectly have 4 processes, each of them containing 4 threads (so 16 threads in total), and each thread with their own asyncio loop running.</p><p>But let's not get side tracked, and focus on the question at hand: what are asyncio, tornado or twisted?</p><p>Let's take a few URLs from a completely random web site.

In other words, it's the default stuff at your disposal if you want to code something without waiting on the network.</span></p><p><span>asyncio replaces the old deprecated&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncore.html" rel="">asyncore</a><span>&nbsp;module. It is quite low level, so while you can manually code most network-related things with it, you are still at the level of TCP or UDP. If you want higher-level protocols, like FTP, HTTP or SSH, you have to either code it yourself, or install a third party library.</span></p><p><span>Because asyncio is the default solution, it has a the biggest ecosystem of 3rd party libs, and pretty much everything async strives to be compatible with it directly, or through compatibility layers like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/" rel="">anyio</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>20 years ago, there was no asyncio, there was no&nbsp;</span><code>async</code><span>/</span><code>await</code><span>, nodejs didn't exist and Python 3 was half a decade away. Yet, it was the .com bubble, everything needed to be connected now. And so was born&nbsp;</span><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Twisted/" rel="">twisted</a><span>, the grandfather of all the asynchronous frameworks we have today. Twisted ecosystem grew to include everything, from mail to ssh.</span></p><p>To this day, twisted is still a robust and versatile tool. But you do pay the price of its age. It doesn't follow PEP8 very well, and the design lean on the heavy size.</p><p>Here is a typical asyncio http request:</p><pre><code><code>import httpx
import asyncio

async def fetch_url(url):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get("url")
        print("Response received")

asyncio.run(fetch_url("https://www.bitecode.dev/p/relieving-your-python-packaging-pain"))</code></code></pre><p><span>And here is the code you will find&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.twisted.org/en/stable/web/howto/client.html" rel="">in the twisted docs</a><span>:</span></p><pre><code><code>from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.web.client import Agent

    Headers({"User-Agent": ["Twisted Web Client Example"]}),
    None
)

def cbResponse(ignored):
    print("Response received")

d.addCallback(cbResponse)

def cbShutdown(ignored):
    reactor.stop()

d.addBoth(cbShutdown)

reactor.run()</code></code></pre><p>To be fair, the code can be reduced to:</p><pre><code><code>from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.web.client import Agent

agent = Agent(reactor)

d = agent.request( b"GET", b"https://www.bitecode.dev/p/relieving-your-python-packaging-pain")
d.addCallback(lambda ignored: print("Response received"))
d.addBoth(lambda ignored: reactor.stop())

reactor.run()</code></code></pre><p>But in the end, you still get a lot of drawbacks:</p><ul><li><p>The doc, as you noticed, doesn't have your back.</p></li><li><p><span>There are too many things to know. Wants SSL support? You need to install&nbsp;</span><code>twisted[tls]</code><span>, not&nbsp;</span><code>twisted</code><span>. You have to use bytes, not strings. You have to manually tear down the reactor.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Twisted does support&nbsp;</span><code>async</code><span>/</span><code>await</code><span>, but I leave you figuring out how to turn this snippet into using it. You'll see.</span></p></li><li><p>ChatGPT will not help you much. Most twisted code is old, and use the old APIs and code style. You'll get... twisted results.</p></li><li><p><span>Google will find many examples still using&nbsp;</span><code>yield</code><span>&nbsp;and other contraptions.</span></p></li><li><p>The deferred system is like "futures" or "promises" in other tools. Until it's not.</p></li><li><p>High levels libs are hard to find.</p></li></ul><p><span>For the last point, you may think it's not important, but it's easy to find httpx or aiohttp for asyncio. However, unless you know the ecosystem, good luck finding out the existence of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/twisted/treq" rel="">treq</a><span>, the high-level HTTP defacto lib. Which turns the code into a much better:</span></p><pre><code><code>import treq

It came about in 2009, the same year as Tornado, but with a fundamentally different design. Instead of attempting to provide an asychronous API, it decided to do black magic. When you use gevent, you call&nbsp;</span><code>from gevent import monkey; monkey.patch_all()</code><span>&nbsp;and it changes the underlying mechanism of Python networking, making everything non-blocking.</span></p><p>I used to fear gevent at the time:</p><ul><li><p>You had to compile it from source, or use eggs, and that had too many ways to fail.</p></li><li><p>Monkey patching is brittle by nature, so you rolled the dice every time you used it.</p></li><li><p><span>Task switching is implicit, and you never knew what dragon would&nbsp;</span><code>await</code><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>So I avoided it like the plague.</p><p>Ironically, today, gevent is becoming quite appealing.</p><p><span>Thanks to </span><a href="https://realpython.com/python-wheels/" rel="">wheels</a><span>, installing it is simple and robust.

The article is quite complex, but the core idea is simple: spawning a coroutine (or goroutine, or green thread) is like calling&nbsp;</span><code>goto</code><span>. For the youngsters among the readers, it's a reference to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful" rel="">a famous Edsger Dijkstra's letter</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In short, it states that every time you start an async task, just like with&nbsp;</span><code>goto</code><span>, you jump somewhere else, in some other part of the code.

Scope and life spans are suddenly opaque, which makes reasoning about the whole software difficult.</span></p><p>And according to him, this is a problem with the design of our asyncio API, not with the nature of async itself.</p><p>Nathaniel didn't just come with a problem, it also brought a solution: a new kind of design for async handling, inspired by Beazley's concepts, with a few twists.</p><p><span>This solution grew into a library,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/python-trio/trio" rel="">trio</a><span>.</span></p><p>Trio is not compatible with asyncio, nor gevent or twisted by default. This means it's also its little own async island.</p><p>But in exchange for that, it provides a very different internal take on how to deal with this kind of concurrency, where every coroutine is tied to an explicit scope, everything can be awaited easily, or canceled.</p><p>The code isn't that different from your typical asyncio script:</p><pre><code><code>import re

But the most important part is the nursery:</span></p><pre><code><code>    # That's the biggest API difference

First, the API is better than expecting the user to wait manually like with&nbsp;</span><code>asyncio.gather</code><span>: you cannot start concurrent coroutines without a clear scope in trio, it doesn't rely on the coder's discipline. But under the hood, the design is also different. The whole bunch of coroutines you group and start can be canceled easily, because trio always knows where things begin and end. As soon as things get complicated,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/#example-1-asyncio-with-callbacks" rel="">code with curio-like design become radically simpler than ones with asyncio-like design</a><span>.</span></p><p>Would I recommend using trio in prod for now? No.</p><p>The asyncio ecosystem and compat advantage is too good to pass on.</p><p><span>But it is inspiring changes in asyncio design itself in very positive ways. E.G, in 3.11, we got&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.TaskGroup" rel="">asyncio.TaskGroup</a><span>, a similar concept to nurseries, and we had&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-groups" rel="">exception groups</a><span>&nbsp;added to Python. This can't change the underlying asyncio design, but the API is way nicer.</span></p><p>Fast API is not in the same category as the other libs. It's not supposed to be part of this article, because it's a completely different beast, but people asked questions about it and seemed confused, so I decided to add a little section to clarify.</p><p><span>Fast API is a high-level web framework like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/" rel="">flask</a><span>, but that happens to be async, unlike flask. With the added benefit of using type hints and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/" rel="">pydantic</a><span>&nbsp;to generate schemas.</span></p><p>It's not a building block like twisted, gevent, trio or asyncio. In fact, it's built on top of asyncio. It's in the same group as flask, bottle, django, pyramid, etc. Although it's a micro-framework, so it's focused on routing, data validation and API delivery.</p><p>I use Fast API when I want to make a quick little web API. It basically replaced flask for everything I used it for, unless my clients or co-workers as for it, of course.</p><p><span>But don't get me wrong, Django is my web framework of choice, as I very rarely need a full web async framework, and with&nbsp;</span><a href="https://django-ninja.rest-framework.com/" rel="">django-ninja</a><span>, it's very easy to build a Web API almost like Fast API.</span></p><p><span>Also, and this will be the topic of another controversial article, I strongly believe beginners should start their first serious project with django and&nbsp;</span><strong>not</strong><span>&nbsp;flask, despite the fact most people see it the other way around. Flask is fine for learning, or for serious projects if you know what you are doing. In the middle lie troubles.</span></p><p>So which async lib to use?</p><p>Well, probably none of them.</p><p>Those tools serve a very niche purpose, and most people don't encounter it very often.</p><p>In fact, I would dare to say that  the vast majority of developers are not working on problems where network performance is an issue that hasn't be solved in a better way. At least at their scale.</p><p>If you are doing a web site, blocking frameworks like Django or Flask are fine, and you'll need a task queue no matter your stack. Small to medium companies rarely build services that would need more than that. Even a lot of big companies probably don’t need more.  </p><p>If you are doing calculations, this is CPU related, and they will not help you.</p><p><span>If you need to get a few URLS fast, a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html" rel="">ThreadPoolExecutor</a><span>&nbsp;is likely the Pareto solution, 99% of the time.</span></p><p><span>If you need an industrial crawler,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://scrapy.org/" rel="">scrappy</a><span>&nbsp;is there for you.</span></p><p>You have to understand that async programming is hard, and no matter how good the tooling is, it's going to make your code more difficult to manage. It has a high price.</p><p>Ok, but let's say you are sure you need some async lib, then which one?</p><p>If you are asking this question, then just go with asyncio. It's standard, so you'll get more doc, more 3rd party components, more resources in general.</p><p>I’ll add you probably should not go with asyncio manually. Use a higher level asyncio based lib, or better, framework. Async is hard enough as it is.</p><p>Some of you may think: “but wait, for this particular task, I do need async, and I did my research, and asyncio is not the proper tool”.</p><p>But then, you don’t need the help of this article to decide, you already have the skills to make an educated choice.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since we launched <a href="https://figma.com/blog/introducing-dev-mode/">Dev Mode at Config</a>, we’ve been focused on improving it to better meet your needs. We’ve seen the blog articles, webinars, social posts, and more than 5,000 messages where you shared your input, and we’ve <a href="https://figma.com/blog/anatomy-of-an-open-beta/">considered every single piece of feedback</a>. From upgrading existing features, to expanding functionality, to creating help articles, we’re excited to share that we’ve shipped 200+ updates. Here are 35 you should definitely know&nbsp;about.</p></div><div><h2 id="new-to-dev-mode"><a href="#new-to-dev-mode">New to Dev Mode</a></h2><p>1. <strong>You can now add status labels to components, instances, and frames</strong> in addition to sections on the canvas—making it even easier to share assets for development without having to totally reorganize your&nbsp;file.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Add status labels to components, instances, frames, and sections on the canvas to signal when they’re ready for development.</figcaption></figure></div><p>2.

Want to learn more about detached components? Voilà—<strong>you can compare changes to the main&nbsp;component.</strong></p><div><figure><figcaption>See when a component has been detached and compare it with the main component.</figcaption></figure></div><p>4. By popular demand, <strong>we brought back Android XML &amp; iOS UIKit as&nbsp;code&nbsp;options</strong>.</p><p>5. Expand your palette with <strong>the new UIColor option</strong>. Select it using the color format dropdown in the Inspect&nbsp;panel.</p><p>6. Drum roll, please: <strong>With version history, you can view and inspect different iterations</strong> of your design by clicking the file name in&nbsp;the&nbsp;toolbar.</p><h2 id="usability-and-performance-improvements"><a href="#usability-and-performance-improvements">Usability and performance improvements </a></h2><p>7. When a design system component hails from an external library, <strong>we’ll surface the name of&nbsp;that&nbsp;library</strong>.</p><p>8. <strong>Nested component props show up in the component playground</strong>, giving you higher detail and more to experiment with.</p><div><figure><figcaption>See which library a component came from and experiment with modes in the component playground.</figcaption></figure></div><p>9. If you have different modes set for a component configuration—say, light and dark modes—<strong>you can experiment with them in the component playground</strong>, too.</p><p>10. When choosing which units you want to see in the canvas and generated code, <strong>you can select the rem unit only with text properties</strong>, and keep the other properties in&nbsp;pixels.</p><div><figure><figcaption>See rem units with text, but keep other properties in pixels.</figcaption></figure></div><p>11. <strong>You can select—and even export—multiple objects at once</strong> from the canvas. Just hold “Shift” and click to round&nbsp;’em&nbsp;up.</p><p>12. <strong>All files and notifications from your Figma account <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15023121296151-Figma-for-VS-Code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">will surface in VS Code</a></strong>, making it easier for you to switch projects and stay on top&nbsp;of&nbsp;changes.</p><p>13. Typography preview goes beyond visualization, <strong>revealing rich text properties like style name, font size, and line height</strong>—all of which you can copy with&nbsp;a&nbsp;click.</p><p>14. Let’s get granular. <strong>You can select individual parts of the text on the canvas to&nbsp;inspect</strong>.</p><p>15. <strong>The layers section in the left panel is vertically resizable</strong>—just click and drag to change the height to your heart’s&nbsp;desire.</p><p>16. When there’s a raw value with a high probability match with a variable in your design system, <strong>we’ll suggest the variable</strong> so designers don’t have to add them in&nbsp;manually.</p><p>17. You can inspect values not only through code snippets, but <strong>also as Figma properties</strong>.</p><p>18. The new source files section <strong>allows you to download files</strong>, such as images, that are part of&nbsp;the&nbsp;design.</p><p>19. We added the<strong> alternative units feature </strong>to the regular preference menu to make it easier&nbsp;to&nbsp;find.</p><p>20. When a section is selected, you’ll get <strong>a collated view for links by frame</strong> at the section level.</p><h2 id="updates-to-code-generation"><a href="#updates-to-code-generation">Updates to code generation</a></h2><p>21. New shortcut alert: <strong>Hold down “Shift” to copy all code snippets</strong> at once.</p><p>22. You can use <code>padding-top</code>, <code>-bottom</code>, <code>-left</code>, and <code>-right</code> in CSS even if only one padding value&nbsp;is&nbsp;set.</p><p>23. No more squinting to see if that’s Arial or Helvetica. We always show <code>font-style</code>, <code>line-height</code>, and <code>font-weight</code> in code snippets. </p><p>24. Code snippets show <code>line-height</code> as both a % value and pixel value, so you always have the information you&nbsp;need.</p><p>25. OpenType font features <code>font-feature-settings</code>, <code>font-variant-numeric</code>, and <code>font-kerning</code> are supported in&nbsp;CSS&nbsp;codegen.</p><p>26. We’ve added variable support for auto layout properties <code>min-width</code>, <code>max-width</code>, <code>min-height</code>, and <code>max-height</code> as well as vertical gap in wrapping layouts.</p><p>27. For text layers that have multiple paragraphs or spans that include different text styles, <strong>we display the CSS code for each individual style.</strong></p><p>28. We can’t take credit for this one, but <strong>there are nearly 80 codegen plugins available</strong> in the Figma community. <a href="https://figma.com/community/plugins/devmode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Check out some of our favorites</a> for Tailwind, React, Vue,&nbsp;and&nbsp;more.</p><h2 id="bug-fixes"><a href="#bug-fixes">Bug fixes</a></h2><p>29. <strong>Switch between Design and Dev Mode</strong> using tab navigation. </p><p>30.

    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>The new <code>log/slog</code> package in Go 1.21 brings structured logging to the standard
library. Structured logs use key-value pairs so they can be parsed, filtered,
searched, and analyzed quickly and reliably.
For servers, logging is an important way for developers to
observe the detailed behavior of the system, and often the first place they go
to debug it. Logs therefore tend to be voluminous, and the ability to search and
filter them quickly is essential.</p>
<p>The standard library has had a logging package, <code>log</code>,
since Go’s initial release over a decade ago.
Over time,
we’ve learned that structured logging is important to Go programmers. It has
consistently ranked high in our annual survey, and many packages in the Go
ecosystem provide it. Some of these are quite popular: one of the first structured
logging packages for Go, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sirupsen/logrus" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">logrus</a>,
is used in over 100,000 other packages.</p>
<p>With many structured logging packages to choose from, large programs
will often end up including more than one through their dependencies. The main program
might have to configure each of these logging packages so that the log output is
consistent: it all goes to the same place, in the same format. By including
structured logging in the standard library, we can provide a common framework
that all the other structured logging packages can share.</p>
<h2 id="a-tour-of-slog">A tour of <code>slog</code></h2>
<p>Here is the simplest program that uses <code>slog</code>:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "log/slog"

func main() {
    slog.Info("hello, world")
}
</code></pre>
<p>As of this writing, it prints:</p>
<pre><code>2023/08/04 16:09:19 INFO hello, world
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Info</code> function prints a message at the Info log level using the
default logger, which in this case is the default logger from the <code>log</code>
package—the same logger you get when you write <code>log.Printf</code>.
That explains why the output looks so similar: only the “INFO” is new.
Out of the box, <code>slog</code> and the original <code>log</code> package work together to make it
easy to get started.</p>
<p>Besides <code>Info</code>, there are functions for three other levels—<code>Debug</code>, <code>Warn</code>, and
<code>Error</code>—as well as a more general <code>Log</code> function that takes the level as an
argument. In <code>slog</code>, levels are just integers, so you aren’t limited to the four
named levels. For example, <code>Info</code> is zero and <code>Warn</code> is 4, so if your logging system
has a level in between those, you can use 2 for it.</p>
<p>Unlike with the <code>log</code> package, we can easily add key-value pairs to our output
by writing them after the message:</p>
<pre><code>slog.Info("hello, world", "user", os.Getenv("USER"))
</code></pre>
<p>The output now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>2023/08/04 16:27:19 INFO hello, world user=jba
</code></pre>
<p>As we mentioned, <code>slog</code>’s top-level functions use the default logger.
We can get this logger explicitly, and call its methods:</p>
<pre><code>logger := slog.Default()
logger.Info("hello, world", "user", os.Getenv("USER"))
</code></pre>
<p>Every top-level function corresponds to a method on a <code>slog.Logger</code>.
The output is the same as before.</p>
<p>Initially, slog’s output goes through the default <code>log.Logger</code>, producing the
output we’ve seen above.
We can change the output by changing the <em>handler</em> used by the logger.
<code>slog</code> comes with two built-in handlers.
A <code>TextHandler</code> emits all log information in the form <code>key=value</code>.
This program creates a new logger using a <code>TextHandler</code> and
makes the same call to the <code>Info</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, nil))
logger.Info("hello, world", "user", os.Getenv("USER"))
</code></pre>
<p>Now the output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>time=2023-08-04T16:56:03.786-04:00 level=INFO msg="hello, world" user=jba
</code></pre>
<p>Everything has been turned into a key-value pair, with strings quoted as needed to preserve structure.</p>
<p>For JSON output, install the built-in <code>JSONHandler</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code>logger := slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil))
logger.Info("hello, world", "user", os.Getenv("USER"))
</code></pre>
<p>Now our output is a sequence of JSON objects, one per logging call:</p>
<pre><code>{"time":"2023-08-04T16:58:02.939245411-04:00","level":"INFO","msg":"hello, world","user":"jba"}
</code></pre>
<p>You are not limited to the built-in handlers. Anyone can write a handler by
implementing the <code>slog.Handler</code> interface. A handler can generate output in a
particular format, or it can wrap another handler to add functionality.
One of the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog@master#example-Handler-LevelHandler" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">examples</a> in
the <code>slog</code> documentation shows how to write a wrapping handler that changes the minimum
level at which log messages will be displayed.</p>
<p>The alternating key-value syntax for attributes that we’ve been using so far is convenient, but for frequently executed log statements it may be more efficient to use the <code>Attr</code> type and call the <code>LogAttrs</code> method.
These work together to minimize memory allocations.
There are functions for building <code>Attr</code>s out of strings, numbers, and other common
types. This call to <code>LogAttrs</code> produces the same output as above, but does it faster:</p>
<pre><code>slog.LogAttrs(context.Background(), slog.LevelInfo, "hello, world",
    slog.String("user", os.Getenv("USER")))
</code></pre>
<p>There is a lot more to <code>slog</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As the call to <code>LogAttrs</code> shows, you can pass a <code>context.Context</code> to some log functions
so a handler can extract context information like trace IDs. (Canceling the context does not prevent the log entry from being written.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can call <code>Logger.With</code> to add attributes to a logger that will appear in
all of its output, effectively factoring out the common parts of several log
statements. This is not only convenient, but it can also help performance, as discussed below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attributes can be combined into groups. This can add more structure to your
log output and can help to disambiguate keys that would otherwise be identical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can control how a value appears in the logs by providing its type with a <code>LogValue</code>
method. That can be used to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog@master#example-LogValuer-Group" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">log the fields of a struct as a
group</a> or <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog@master#example-LogValuer-Secret" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">redact
sensitive data</a>,
among other things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The best place to learn about all of <code>slog</code> is the <a href="https://pkg.dev.go/log/slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">package
documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>We wanted <code>slog</code> to be fast.
For large-scale performance gains, we designed <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog#Handler" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">the <code>Handler</code>
interface</a> to provide optimization
opportunities. The <code>Enabled</code> method is called at the beginning of every log
event, giving the handler a chance to drop unwanted log events quickly. The
<code>WithAttrs</code> and <code>WithGroup</code> methods let the handler format
attributes added by <code>Logger.With</code> once, rather than at each logging call. This
pre-formatting can provide a significant speedup when large attributes, like an
<code>http.Request</code>, are added to a <code>Logger</code> and then used in many logging calls.</p>
<p>To inform our performance optimization work, we investigated typical patterns of logging in existing open-source projects. We found that over 95%
of calls to logging methods pass five or fewer attributes. We also categorized
the types of attributes, finding that a handful of common types accounted for
the majority.
We then wrote benchmarks that captured the common cases, and used them as a
guide to see where the time went.
The greatest gains came from paying careful attention to memory allocation.</p>
<h2 id="the-design-process">The design process</h2>
<p>The <code>slog</code> package is one of the largest additions to the standard library since
Go 1 was released in 2012. We wanted to take our time designing it, and we knew
that community feedback would be essential.</p>
<p>By April 2022, we had gathered enough data to demonstrate the importance of
structured logging to the Go community. The Go team decided to explore adding it
to the standard library.</p>
<p>We began by looking at how the existing structured logging packages were
designed. We also took advantage of the large collection of open-source Go code
stored on the Go module proxy to learn how these packages were actually used.
Our first design was informed by this research as well as Go’s spirit of
simplicity.
We wanted an API that is light on the page and easy to understand, without
sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>It was never a goal to replace existing third-party logging packages.
They are all good at what they do, and replacing existing code that works well
is rarely a good use of a developer’s time.
We divided the API into a frontend, <code>Logger</code>, that calls a backend interface, <code>Handler</code>.
That way, existing logging packages can talk to a common backend,
so the packages that use them can interoperate without having to be rewritten.
Handlers are written or in progress for many common logging
packages, including
<a href="https://github.com/uber-go/zap/tree/master/exp/zapslog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Zap</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/go-logr/logr/pull/196" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">logr</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/evanphx/go-hclog-slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">hclog</a>.</p>
<p>We shared our initial design within the Go team and other developers who had
extensive logging experience. We made alterations based on their feedback, and
by August of 2022 we felt we had a workable design. On August 29,
we made our <a href="https://github.com/golang/exp/tree/master/slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">experimental
implementation</a> public
and began a <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/54763" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub discussion</a> to hear
what the community had to say.
The response was enthusiastic and largely positive.
Thanks to insightful comments from the designers and users of other structured
logging packages, we made several changes and added a few features, like groups
and the <code>LogValuer</code> interface. We changed the mapping from log levels to
integers twice.</p>
<p>After two months and about 300 comments, we felt we were ready for an actual
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/56345" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">proposal</a> and accompanying <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/03441cb358c7b27a8443bca839e5d7a314677ea6/design/56345-structured-logging.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">design
doc</a>.
The proposal issue garnered over 800 comments and resulted in many improvements to
the API and the implementation. Here are two examples of API changes, both
concerning <code>context.Context</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Originally the API supported adding loggers to a
context. Many felt that this was a convenient way to plumb a logger easily
through levels of code that didn’t care about it. But others felt it was
smuggling in  an implicit dependency, making the code harder to understand.
Ultimately, we removed the feature as being too controversial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also wrestled
with the related question of passing a context to logging methods, trying a
number of designs. We initially resisted the standard pattern of passing the
context as the first argument because we didn’t want every logging call to
require a context, but ultimately created two sets of logging methods, one
with a context and one without.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One change we did not make concerned the alternating key-and-value syntax for
expressing attributes:</p>
<pre><code>slog.Info("message", "k1", v1, "k2", v2)
</code></pre>
<p>Many felt strongly that this was a bad idea. They found it hard to read
and easy to get wrong by omitting a key or value. They preferred explicit
attributes for expressing structure:</p>
<pre><code>slog.Info("message", slog.Int("k1", v1), slog.String("k2", v2))
</code></pre>
<p>But we felt that the lighter syntax was important to keeping Go easy and fun to
use, especially for new Go programmers. We also knew that several Go logging
packages, like <code>logr</code>, <code>go-kit/log</code> and <code>zap</code> (with its <code>SugaredLogger</code>)
successfully used alternating keys and
values. We added a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">vet
check</a>
to catch common mistakes, but did not change the design.</p>
<p>On March 15, 2023, the proposal was accepted, but there were still some minor
unresolved issues. Over the next few weeks, ten additional changes were proposed
and resolved. By early July, the <code>log/slog</code> package implementation was complete,
along with the <code>testing/slogtest</code> package for verifying
handlers and the vet check for correct usage of alternating keys and values.</p>
<p>And on August 8, Go 1.21 was released, and <code>slog</code> with it.
We hope you find it useful, and as fun to use as it was to build.</p>
<p>And a big thanks to everyone who participated in the discussion and the proposal
process. Your contributions improved <code>slog</code> immensely.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">documentation</a> for the <code>log/slog</code> package
explains how to use it and provides several examples.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Resources-for-slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">wiki page</a> has
additional resources provided by the Go community, including a variety of
handlers.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My 12 year old dev account <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=darken"><code>darken</code></a> was just terminated.</p>

<p>I was having a pretty good week until now :(.</p>

<p>I didn't think I would make such a post one day but here it is:</p>

<p>At 21:44 i got two mails saying my apps "SD Maid 1" and "SD Maid 2" have been suspended and removed for violating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Stalkerware policy".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>16 minutes later at 22:00 they nuked my whole account:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reason for termination: We have identified a pattern of high risk or abuse associated with your Developer Account and are taking this action pursuant to Section 8.3/10.3 of Google Play’s Developer Distribution Agreement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm at a loss here why. I obviously don't stalk anyone, and the app has no functionality that supports stalking in any way. Both apps "in short" free storage space.</p>

<p>SD Maid 1 has millions of users and been in the Google Play store for over a decade. There was no major change. Yesterday I bumped the target SDK to 33, but that's about it.</p>

<p>For those who don't know the app, </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ws-5mwcgm6EJ:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Deu.thedarken.sdm%26hl%3Dde&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=dk">here is the cached play store site:</a></li>
</ul>

<p>SD Maid 2 is a rewrite of the same app because I couldn't keep the spaghetti code in check that is needed to handle the different storage access patterns (SAF) etc.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gvOXGR2TpwQJ:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Deu.darken.sdmse%26hl%3Den_US&amp;cd=11&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=dk">Here is a cached link to the playstore</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>And for this one the code is even open-source: <a href="https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se">https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se</a></strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>AI mistake? Crackdown on "cleaner apps"?</p>

<p>There's another dev here who was hit at the same time just now:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/15xi4iw/app_suspension_confused_policy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/15xi4iw/app_suspension_confused_policy/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If Google suddenly changes their policy and disallows some types apps, then they can do so, but why end my indie dev career?</p>

<p>I'd love to talk to someone at Google, because I don't understand it. But no matter how much money you made Google or millions of users you have, I don't have any way to talk to someone.</p>

<p>I fear that you only get once chance to appeal and I'm not even sure what to appeal. I don't think the "your AI got it wrong route" is effective. </p>

<p>Talk to me my fellow devs, I'm pretty upset :(.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<header><p>22 Aug 2023</p></header><p>Conformant OpenGL®
ES 3.1 drivers are now available for M1- and M2-family GPUs. That means
the drivers are compatible with any OpenGL ES 3.1 application.
Interested? <a href="https://fedora-asahi-remix.org/">Just install
Linux!</a></p>
<p>Once you’ve installed <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi
Linux</a>, upgrade your system with
<code>dnf upgrade</code> (Fedora) or
<code>pacman -Syu</code> (Arch) for the
latest drivers.</p>
<p>Our reverse-engineered, free and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/asahi/mesa">open source graphics
drivers</a> are the world’s <strong><em>only</em></strong> conformant
OpenGL ES 3.1 implementation for M1- and M2-family graphics hardware.
That means our driver passed tens of thousands of tests to demonstrate
correctness and is now recognized by the industry.</p>
<p>To become conformant, an “implementation” must pass the official
conformance test suite, designed to verify every feature in the
specification. The test results are submitted to Khronos, the standards
body. After a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/">30-day review
period</a>, if no issues are found, the implementation becomes
conformant. The Khronos website lists all conformant implementations,
including our drivers for the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_1007">M1</a>,
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_1014">M1
Pro/Max/Ultra</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_1016">M2</a>,
and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_1017">M2
Pro/Max</a>.</p>
<p>Today’s milestone isn’t just about OpenGL ES. We’re releasing the
first conformant implementation of <em>any</em> graphics standard for
the M1. And we don’t plan to stop here ;-)</p>
<p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/vkinstancing.webp"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vkinstancing2.webp" alt="Teaser of the “Vulkan instancing” demo running on Asahi Linux"></a></p>
<p>Unlike ours, the manufacturer’s M1 drivers are unfortunately not
conformant for <em>any</em> standard graphics API, whether Vulkan or
OpenGL or OpenGL ES. That means that there is no guarantee that
applications using the standards will work on your M1/M2 (if you’re not
running Linux). This isn’t just a theoretical issue. Consider Vulkan.
The third-party <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK">MoltenVK</a> layers a
subset of Vulkan on top of the proprietary drivers. However, those
drivers lack key functionality, breaking valid Vulkan applications. That
hinders developers and users alike, if they haven’t yet switched their
M1/M2 computers to Linux.</p>
<p>Why did <em>we</em> pursue standards conformance when the
manufacturer did not? Above all, our commitment to quality. We want our
users to know that they can depend on our Linux drivers. We want
standard software to run without M1-specific hacks or porting. We want
to set the right example for the ecosystem: the way forward is
implementing open standards, conformant to the specifications, without
compromises for “portability”. We are not satisfied with proprietary
drivers, proprietary APIs, and refusal to implement standards. The rest
of the industry knows that progress comes from cross-vendor
collaboration. We know it, too. Achieving conformance is a win for our
community, for open source, and for open graphics.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://vt.social/@lina/">Asahi Lina</a> and I
are two individuals with minimal funding. It’s a little awkward that we
beat the big corporation…</p>
<p>It’s not too late though. They should follow our lead!</p>
<hr>
<p>OpenGL ES 3.1 updates the experimental <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/opengl3-on-asahi-linux.html">OpenGL ES
3.0 and OpenGL 3.1</a> we shipped in June. Notably, ES 3.1 adds compute
shaders, typically used to accelerate general computations within
graphics applications. For example, a 3D game could run its physics
simulations in a compute shader. The simulation results can then be used
for rendering, eliminating stalls that would otherwise be required to
synchronize the GPU with a CPU physics simulation. That lets the game
run faster.</p>
<p>Let’s zoom in on one new feature: atomics on images. Older versions
of OpenGL ES allowed an application to read an image in order to display
it on screen. ES 3.1 allows the application to <em>write</em> to the
image, typically from a compute shader. This new feature enables
flexible image processing algorithms, which previously needed to fit
into the fixed-function 3D pipeline. However, GPUs are massively
parallel, running thousands of threads at the same time. If two threads
write to the same location, there is a conflict: depending which thread
runs first, the result will be different. We have a race condition.</p>
<p>“Atomic” access to memory provides a solution to race conditions.
With atomics, special hardware in the memory subsystem guarantees
consistent, well-defined results for select operations, regardless of
the order of the threads. Modern graphics hardware supports various
atomic operations, like addition, serving as building blocks to complex
parallel algorithms.</p>
<p>Can we put these two features together to write to an image
atomically?</p>
<p>Yes. A ubiquitous OpenGL ES <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/OES/OES_shader_image_atomic.txt">extension</a>,
required for ES 3.2, adds atomics operating on pixels in an image. For
example, a compute shader could atomically increment the value at pixel
(10, 20).</p>
<p>Other GPUs have dedicated instructions to perform atomics on an
images, making the driver implementation straightforward. For us, the
story is more complicated. The M1 lacks hardware instructions for image
atomics, even though it has non-image atomics and non-atomic images. We
need to reframe the problem.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: to perform an atomic on a pixel, we instead
calculate the address of the pixel in memory and perform a regular
atomic on that address. Since the hardware supports regular atomics, our
task is “just” calculating the pixel’s address.</p>
<p>If the image were laid out linearly in memory, this would be
straightforward: multiply the Y-coordinate by the number of bytes per
row (“stride”), multiply the X-coordinate by the number of bytes per
pixel, and add. That gives the pixel’s offset in bytes relative to the
first pixel of the image. To get the final address, we add that offset
to the address of the first pixel.</p>

<p>Alas, images are rarely linear in memory. To improve cache
efficiency, modern graphics hardware interleaves the X- and
Y-coordinates. Instead of one row after the next, pixels in memory
follow a <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/texture-tiling-and-swizzling/">spiral-like
curve</a>.</p>
<p>We need to amend our previous equation to interleave the coordinates.
We could use many instructions to mask one bit at a time, shifting to
construct the interleaved result, but that’s inefficient. We can do
better.</p>
<p>There is a well-known <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#InterleaveBMN">“bit
twiddling” algorithm to interleave bits</a>. Rather than shuffle one bit
at a time, the algorithm shuffles groups of bits, parallelizing the
problem. Implementing this algorithm in shader code improves
performance.</p>
<p>In practice, only the lower 7-bits (or less) of each coordinate are
interleaved. That lets us use 32-bit instructions to “vectorize” the
interleave, by putting the X- and Y-coordinates in the low and high
16-bits of a 32-bit register. Those 32-bit instructions let us
interleave X and Y at the same time, halving the instruction count.
Plus, we can exploit the GPU’s combined shift-and-add instruction.
Putting the tricks together, we interleave in 10 instructions of M1 GPU
assembly:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"># Inputs x<span>,</span> y in r0l<span>,</span> r0h<span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"># Output in r1<span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>add</span> r2<span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> r0<span>,</span> lsl <span>4</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>or</span>  r1<span>,</span> r0<span>,</span> r2</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><span>and</span> r1<span>,</span> r1<span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>0xf0f0f0f</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><span>add</span> r2<span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> r1<span>,</span> lsl <span>2</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><span>or</span>  r1<span>,</span> r1<span>,</span> r2</span>

<p>We could stop here, but what if there’s a <em>dedicated</em>
instruction to interleave bits? PowerVR has a “shuffle” instruction <a href="https://docs.imgtec.com/reference-manuals/powervr-instruction-set-reference/topics/bitwise-instructions/SHFL.html"><code>shfl</code></a>,
and the M1 GPU borrows from PowerVR. Perhaps that instruction was
borrowed too. Unfortunately, even if it was, the proprietary compiler
won’t use it when compiling our test shaders. That makes it difficult to
reverse-engineer the instruction – if it exists – by observing compiled
shaders.</p>
<p>It’s time to dust off a powerful reverse-engineering technique from
magic kindergarten: guess and check.</p>
<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@dougall">Dougall Johnson</a>
provided the guess. When considering the instructions we already know
about, he took special notice of the “reverse bits” instruction. Since
reversing bits is a type of bit shuffle, the interleave instruction
should be encoded similarly. The bit reverse instruction has a two-bit
field specifying the operation, with value <code>01</code>. Related
instructions to <em>count the number of set bits</em> and <em>find the
first set bit</em> have values <code>10</code> and <code>11</code>
respectively. That encompasses all known “complex bit manipulation”
instructions.</p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>00</code></td>
<td><strong><a href="" onclick="const p = document.createElement('span');p.innerText = 'Interleave!';this.replaceWith(p);document.getElementById('center-rule').remove();return false;">?
? ?</a></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>01</code></td>
<td>Reverse bits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>10</code></td>
<td>Count set bits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>11</code></td>
<td>Find first set</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There is one value of the two-bit enumeration that is unobserved and
unknown: <code>00</code>. If this interleave instruction exists, it’s
probably encoded like the bit reverse but with operation code
<code>00</code> instead of <code>01</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a difficulty: the three known instructions have one single
input source, but our instruction interleaves two sources. Where does
the second source go? We can make a guess based on symmetry. Presumably
to simplify the hardware decoder, M1 GPU instructions usually encode
their sources in consistent locations across instructions. The other
three instructions have a gap where we would expect the second source to
be, in a two-source arithmetic instruction. Probably the second source
is there.</p>
<p>Armed with a guess, it’s our turn to check. Rather than handwrite GPU
assembly, we can hack our compiler to replace some two-source integer
operation (like multiply) with our guessed encoding of “interleave”.
Then we write a compute shader using this operation (by “multiplying”
numbers) and run it with the newfangled compute support in our
driver.</p>
<p>All that’s left is writing a <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/interleave.shader_test">shader</a> that
checks that the mystery instruction returns the interleaved result for
each possible input. Since the instruction takes two 16-bit sources,
there are about 4 billion
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>32</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2^32</annotation></semantics></math>)
inputs. With our driver, the M1 GPU manages to check them all in under a
second, and the verdict is in: this is our interleave instruction.</p>
<p>As for our clever vectorized assembly to interleave coordinates? We
can replace it with one instruction. It’s anticlimactic, but it’s fast
and it passes the conformance tests.</p>
<p>And that’s what matters.</p>

In March 1919, the <i>Daily Mirror</i> newspaper published a cartoon by the English cartoonist and caricaturist, William Kerridge Haselden (1872–1953), predicting the invention – and some of the effects – of the ‘pocket telephone’.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhti5eTkyyNKv8Q8eChZ8NajIDp7L11jQ895VShh3gYoO00-8Y5meNLHVZS9WZXzFl5vF886md6uiVhmsE0oN7Cfos9bqeSfNQATWKeP80LunJPCu59zm7o7e83Q7XhEZnSm6ryTr9QCqtD24vig7E2aFj0oAMXVecrgyygdxINLDXkeZSNOrgDqkStkok/s907/the-pocket-telephone.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="907" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhti5eTkyyNKv8Q8eChZ8NajIDp7L11jQ895VShh3gYoO00-8Y5meNLHVZS9WZXzFl5vF886md6uiVhmsE0oN7Cfos9bqeSfNQATWKeP80LunJPCu59zm7o7e83Q7XhEZnSm6ryTr9QCqtD24vig7E2aFj0oAMXVecrgyygdxINLDXkeZSNOrgDqkStkok/s16000/the-pocket-telephone.jpg"></a></p><p>The cartoon was placed alongside other situations where this ‘pocket telephone’ might prove a personal annoyance and social nuisance: whether it be on a busy train, when you’re in a hurry, at a concert, with babies, or even when you’re at the alter.</p><p>It was not until 54 years later, in 1973, that the first handheld cellular mobile phone was demonstrated in public by John F.

<p>What override would get them a potentially malicious update without spotting this themselves? If they rely on older versions they’re still protected by the hash, and if they deliberately upgrade to 1.3 they’re in the hands of upstream.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Earlier this year myself and a couple others at DrDoctor did some training in C4 Architecture modelling<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The trainer was really good and over a few sessions with him we got the hang of the method. We went onto use what we had learnt, meeting everything Thursday over the course of 3 months. We focused mainly on modelling our existing architecture into Level 1 (Context) and Level 2 (Container) diagrams. This process was enlightening and we all learnt a lot from it - that alone could easily be a couple of posts.</p>
<p>I have had two main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the training itself, is that <strong>the C4 method provides a consistent language</strong> which can be used when talking about architecture</li>
<li>From using and applying the C4 method, is that diagrams can be <strong>an enabler for better conversations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before digging into the benefits that come from having C4 diagrams, there are two limitations in particular that I would like to highlight.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The C4 Model does not provide a standard way of communicating the story of your architecture in written form. Given all the things it does well, provides consistent language, introduce detail/complexity incrementally through different levels of diagrams, this felt like an oversight and something that would be really useful to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lack of real-world examples available - this obviously isn’t a limitation of the model itself but rather due to the fact that companies don’t want to advertise their architecture in detail in public. However it does mean that understanding how to practically apply the model outside of the public examples available is difficult.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We had a number of sessions with Brian from <a href="https://buildingbetterteams.de/diagram-your-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">buildingbetterteams.de</a>, he was able to walk us through the basics and then guide us through the process of modelling our existing architecture (company money well spent).</p>
<h2 id="situations-where-diagrams-have-been-an-enabler">Situations where diagrams have been an enabler</h2>
<h3 id="onboarding-new-team-members">Onboarding new team members</h3>
<p>You can imagine when onboarding new engineers to a team the conversation goes something like this</p>
<ol>
<li>git clone /path/to/repository</li>
<li>open in [your IDE of choice]</li>
<li>why haven’t you finished your first story/task/ticket yet?</li>
</ol>
<p>(Thankfully this isn’t how we do onboarding at DrDoctor). One of the things that is missing from the above, one of the many things missing, is context. Even if you follow “best practices” around Clean/Hexagonal/DDD layout for your code/solution, it’s still confusing. Questions will still need to be asked and answered:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the main entry point?</li>
<li>What are (if any) the interactions between projects?</li>
<li>What external dependencies are there?</li>
<li>Do any external projects depend on this solution?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where having C4 architecture docs has come in handy, they have served as a starting point for helping new engineers build up their mental model of the architecture, interactions and dependencies of new projects.</p>
<p>It’s worth adding, that the diagrams I’ve been using with my team have been useful not only for new engineers but also for our Engineering Manager and Technical Product Manager - specially to help them understand the complexity of the project that we’re working in, and to understand why some piece of work are more complicated than others.</p>
<h3 id="planning-upcoming-work">Planning upcoming work</h3>
<p>As a team we have recently been preparing to build out a new piece of major functionality for an existing system. Understanding the what of the functionality was straightforward enough. But to get to the how was enabled by having a decent (ie pretty good/good enough) architecture diagram. The architecture diagrams were useful as prompts for conversation.</p>
<p>The diagrams gave all team members something to centre around, it also gave everyone common language to use.</p>
<p>They also helped us to think about iterative ways to deliver the end goal. Being able to visualise the end state of what we wanted to deliver helped us think about how we could do this incrementally. If we had only spoken about this verbally I don’t think we would have or could have, come to the same conclusions about how we wanted to go about building this.</p>
<h3 id="communicating-changes-to-other-teams">Communicating changes to other teams</h3>
<p>Following on from the previous point, this new piece of functionality that we’re setting out ot build involves making some changes to the larger architectural landscape at DrDoctor. Which means that we are going to be making changes to how some projects which are <em>owned</em> by other teams function. Having architecture diagrams to communicate the scope of change to other Leads has been a game changer. Once again, the diagrams were useful as the centre piece of conversations and helped others outside our team to build up a mental model of what we were setting out to change.</p>
<p>I was also able to easily talk though the iterations we would be going through to deliver the end state.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>I still feel like I’m early in my journey of building (or drawing) architecture diagrams, however based on recent experiences I can see the immense value they bring to an engineering team. These benefits reinforce that the time and effort put into creating and maintaining architecture diagrams is time well spent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focuses communication:</strong> Having a diagram to centre conversations around has been a game changer, the focus is taken off an individual and put on something that can be reasoned about, questioned, probed without it feeling personal</li>
<li><strong>Universal understanding:</strong> Diagrams being visual in nature help technical and non-technical folks to understand the interaction points and dependencies. They also provide common language for all team members to use.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitates planning:</strong> Having diagrams has been incredibly helpful during the planning process (of big and small pieces of functionality) particularly when a team consists of a number of new team members, being able to refer to components and understand the scope of change that a piece of functionality will have helps the team to understand the complexity of the change</li>
</ul>
