<p>Apple’s latest research about running large language models on smartphones offers the clearest signal yet that the iPhone maker plans to catch up with its Silicon Valley rivals in generative artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The paper, entitled “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11514.pdf">LLM in a Flash</a>,” offers a “solution to a current computational bottleneck,” its researchers write.</p>
<p>Its approach “paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory,” they said. Inference refers to how large language models, the large data repositories that power apps like ChatGPT, respond to users’ queries. Chatbots and LLMs normally run in vast data centers with much greater computing power than an iPhone.</p>
<p>The paper was published on December 12 but caught wider attention after Hugging Face, a popular site for AI researchers to showcase their work, <a href="https://huggingface.co/papers/2312.11514">highlighted it</a> late on Wednesday. It is the second Apple paper on generative AI this month and follows earlier moves to enable image-generating models such as Stable Diffusion to run on its custom chips.</p>
<p>Device manufacturers and chipmakers are hoping that new AI features will help revive the smartphone market, which has had its worst year in a decade, with shipments falling an estimated 5 percent, according to Counterpoint Research.</p>
<p>Despite launching one of the first virtual assistants, Siri, back in 2011, Apple has been largely left out of the wave of excitement about generative AI that has swept through Silicon Valley in the year since OpenAI launched its breakthrough chatbot ChatGPT. Apple has been viewed by many in the AI community as lagging behind its Big Tech rivals, despite hiring Google’s top AI executive, John Giannandrea, in 2018.</p>
<p>While Microsoft and Google have largely focused on delivering chatbots and other generative AI services over the Internet from their vast cloud computing platforms, Apple’s research suggests that it will instead focus on AI that can run directly on an iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple’s rivals, such as Samsung, are gearing up to launch a new kind of “AI smartphone” next year. Counterpoint estimated more than 100 million AI-focused smartphones would be shipped in 2024, with 40 percent of new devices offering such capabilities by 2027.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The head of the world’s largest mobile chipmaker, Qualcomm chief executive Cristiano Amon, forecast that bringing AI to smartphones would create a whole new experience for consumers and reverse declining mobile sales.</p>
<p>“You’re going to see devices launch in early 2024 with a number of generative AI use cases,” he told the Financial Times in a recent interview. “As those things get scaled up, they start to make a meaningful change in the user experience and enable new innovation which has the potential to create a new upgrade cycle in smartphones.”</p>
<p>More sophisticated virtual assistants will be able to anticipate users’ actions such as texting or scheduling a meeting, he said, while devices will also be capable of new kinds of photo editing techniques.</p>
<p>Google this month unveiled a version of its new Gemini LLM that will run “natively” on its Pixel smartphones.</p>
<p>Running the kind of large AI model that powers ChatGPT or Google’s Bard on a personal device brings formidable technical challenges, because smartphones lack the huge computing resources and energy available in a data center. Solving this problem could mean that AI assistants respond more quickly than they do from the cloud and even work offline.</p>
<p>Ensuring that queries are answered on an individual’s own device without sending data to the cloud is also likely to bring privacy benefits, a key differentiator for Apple in recent years.</p>
<p>“Our experiment is designed to optimize inference efficiency on personal devices,” its researchers said. Apple tested its approach on models including Falcon 7B, a smaller version of an open source LLM originally developed by the Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Optimizing LLMs to run on battery-powered devices has been a growing focus for AI researchers. Academic papers are not a direct indicator of how Apple intends to add new features to its products, but they offer a rare glimpse into its secretive research labs and the company’s latest technical breakthroughs.</p>
<p>“Our work not only provides a solution to a current computational bottleneck but also sets a precedent for future research,” wrote Apple’s researchers in the conclusion to their paper. “We believe as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, approaches like this work will be essential for harnessing their full potential in a wide range of devices and applications.”</p>
<p>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

Don’t do it because you want people to grind until Dec 24th at 6 pm. Do it because it’s great the rest of the year, too. I’d recommend you look into (or ask me about) feature flags, alerting, and automated roll-backs.</p><p>The short version is: there’s a meta-system on top of your release process that can tell (if you are using roll-back not features flags):
- commits until xyzsdf are fine;
- roll-outs starting from commit abcdef have a 2% error rate, 80% on Android;
- revert to xyzsdf, send a message (low-priority, email) to the DevOps on call and the author of abcdef that it happened;
- for all commits after abcdef: if there no conflicts with xyzsdf, re-try to roll them out;
- if there is a conflict because they were on top or abcdef, send a message (low-priority email) to the authors that there is a conflict.</p><p>There are more sophisticated versions that can do things like, if you use feature flags, flagging Android users to use the previous version. Another way to do this is to scale who has access to abcdef gradually: say 1% every hour, and revert if you detect issues.</p><p>All those seem daunting to teams that haven’t worked like this before, but it my experience, they love it very fast.

		<p>arXiv’s goal is equitable access to scientific research for all – and to achieve this, we have been working to make research papers more accessible for arXiv users with disabilities. We are happy to announce that as of Monday, December 18<sup>th</sup>, arXiv is now generating an HTML formatted version of all papers submitted in TeX/LaTeX (as long as papers were submitted on or after December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023 and HTML conversion is successful – more on this below).</p>
<p>HTML is not replacing PDF but will be an additional format available for arXiv users. Submitters will be invited to preview the HTML version of their papers during submission time, the same way they have always done with PDF.</p>
<p>When accessing a paper’s abstract page, readers will see a link to view the HTML paper right under the PDF link:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2023/12/Access-Paper-300x122.png" alt="" width="300" height="122" srcset="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2023/12/Access-Paper-300x122.png 300w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2023/12/Access-Paper.png 404w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>The request to offer arXiv-hosted papers in HTML format comes directly from scientists with disabilities who face barriers to accessing the research they need. HTML formatted papers are more easily and accurately read by screen readers and other technologies, which can assist researchers with reading disabilities, including blindness, low vision, dyslexia, and more.</p>
<p>We know that the HTML conversion isn’t perfect yet – right now our HTML is in the “experimental” phase as we work to make conversion more accurate. Currently, not every paper will be able to be correctly converted into HTML. However, researchers with disabilities have told arXiv that HTML is needed *now* for accessibility, and so we wanted to offer that accessibility as quickly as possible, while we continue to work on improving conversions with the help of our community. arXiv will *not* prevent or hold submissions where the HTML conversion has failed, but we do hope that authors will carefully review the HTML version of their submission, as sometimes as sometimes small changes in the source TeX code can improve the HTML rendering.</p>
<p>Experimental HTML is a big step towards making science accessible to all. We want to thank everyone who collaborated on arXiv’s pilot <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessible_HTML.html">HTML Papers project</a> which includes <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">The LaTeX Project</a>, and the <a href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/">LaTeXML</a> team from NIST. If you are familiar with <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html">ar5iv, an arXivLabs collaboration</a>, our HTML offering is essentially bringing this impactful project fully “in-house”. Our ultimate goal is to backfill arXiv’s entire corpus so that every paper will have an HTML version, but for now this feature is reserved for new papers.</p>
<p>And a big thank you to all the arXiv users who have taken the time to fill out bug reports for arXiv’s HTML Papers project – our team is currently reading and analyzing the bug reports and hope to make our first round of improvements in the new year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>With over 3 billion Android users worldwide, the little green robot powers more devices than any other mobile operating system.</p><p><span>But here’s something you may not know: </span><strong>Android isn’t free</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Sure, you can download and use Android without explicitly paying anything. But behind the scenes, Google employs all sorts of creative ways to profit from their open source operating system. After all, tech companies don’t provide products out of the goodness of their hearts.</p><p><em>So how does Google make money from Android? And how much money are we talking here? </em><span>Let’s break it down.</span></p><p>The first and most direct way Google profits from Android is by charging phone makers licensing fees to install Google’s apps. </p><p>Technically, Android the operating system is open source and free. But if device manufacturers like Samsung want access to popular Google apps like Gmail or Google Maps or YouTube, they need to pay up. </p><p><span> Without Google’s apps, an Android phone would be useless to most people. So phone makers don’t really have a choice but to license this bundle, which Google calls </span><strong>Google Mobile Services (GMS)</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>According to court filings, Google charges phone makers between </span><strong>$2.50 to $40</strong><span> per device to license GMS, with the average being about </span><strong>$20 per phone</strong><span>. </span></p><p>With over a billion Android devices shipped every year, those licensing fees add up, on average generating Google about $20 billion annually.</p><p>But that’s not all…</p><p><span>The Google Play Store is a massive money maker on its own through paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions, and advertising. </span><strong>In 2021, the Play Store generated $38.8 billion in revenue, and by 2025, experts predict Google Play Store will make $64 billion annually</strong></p><p>Like with most app stores, Google charges app developers 15 - 30% of all revenue generated from the Play Store.</p><p>Data on how much Google actually makes from this is unavailable, however, even by conservative estimates, over $22 billion of the Play Store’s revenue becomes profit for Google. </p><p>Here’s where things get crazy. Beyond direct revenue sources like hardware and app stores fees, controlling Android also steers billions of users towards Google’s family of apps. These include:</p><ul><li><p>Google Search</p></li><li><p>Google Maps</p></li><li><p>YouTube  </p></li><li><p>Gmail  </p></li><li><p>Google Drive </p></li><li><p>Google Photos</p></li><li><p>Google Chrome</p></li><li><p>Google Assistant</p></li></ul><p>These pre-installed apps don’t directly earn Google money. But by getting them in front of users by default, Google drives eyeballs that they then monetize through advertising and data collection across their ecosystem. </p><p>Having Android lead users into their funnel makes Google’s ads more valuable and gives them an unrivaled profile of user behaviors to optimize their services.</p><p>To quantify this indirect value provided by Google owning Android, let’s consider Google’s deal with Apple:</p><p><span>Google pays Apple a whopping </span><strong>$18 billion per year</strong><span> simply to be the default search engine on iPhones. And that’s just for search, without all the other pre-installed apps Android provides Google! </span></p><p><span>Combining the value of Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, and more - </span><strong>experts estimate Google gains over $50 billion per year indirectly from Android.</strong></p><p>So next time you see an Android phone, consider the irony. Google lets users download and use their ubiquitous operating system without paying a dime, then makes billions directly and indirectly from those same users.  </p><p>Rather than some free, open-source utopia, Android exists as a massive pipeline driving value to Google at each stage of the user journey. Phone makers pay, app developers pay, advertisers pay, and users pay with their data and eyeballs all so Google can turn around and maximize their profits.</p><p>It’s quite a strategy - Android provides massive access and control of the mobile world for Google while users happily carry around the data-gathering portal in their pockets as if it was free.</p><p><span>So while you may not pay for Android in dollars and cents, it certainly isn’t free. But for Google shareholders, they’ll surely say it’s </span><strong>priceless</strong><span>!</span></p><p><span>You may also like:</span><br></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SiriusXM is getting sued by the state of New York for making it too difficult for subscribers to cancel their plans. The suit claims that customers who want to cancel are required to chat over the phone or online with an agent who bombards them with questions and offers. “Sirius deliberately wastes its subscribers’ time even though it has the ability to process cancellations with the click of a button,” <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/sirius-petition.pdf">the suit</a> reads.</p><p>Attorney General Letitia James’ office claims that SiriusXM’s own data reveals that it takes subscribers an average of 11.5 minutes to cancel by phone, and 30 minutes to cancel online. The suit is seeking damages for affected customers, as well as a $5,000 penalty to the state of New York for each violation.</p><p>“Having to endure a lengthy and frustrating process to cancel a subscription is a stressful burden no one looks forward to, and when companies make it hard to cancel subscriptions, it’s illegal,” James said <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-sues-siriusxm-radio-trapping-consumers-unwanted">in a statement</a>. “Consumers should be able to cancel a subscription they no longer use or need without any issues, and companies have a legal duty to make their cancellation process easy.”</p><p>Clearly, some people have managed to endure SiriusXM’s cancellation process. The company <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/siriusxm-pandora-third-quarter-subscriber-loss-advertising-revenue-1235633143/">reported a drop</a> of 336,000 subscribers to its flagship satellite radio service in the first nine months of 2023.</p><p>“It’s telling that the New York Attorney General issued a press release before providing SiriusXM with a copy of the complaint,” SiriusXM spokesperson Jessica Casano-Antonellis said in a statement. “Like a number of consumer businesses, we offer a variety of options for customers to sign up for or cancel their SiriusXM subscription and, upon receiving and reviewing the complaint, we intend to vigorously defend against these baseless allegations that grossly mischaracterize SiriusXM’s practices.”&nbsp;</p><p>The long-term trend away from broadcast means that SiriusXM has had to get creative about its future. Aside from the alleged cancellation gymnastics, the company has invested heavily in podcasting. It bought Stitcher in 2020 for $325 million and Conan O’Brien’s production company in 2022 for $150 million, and it handed out lucrative distribution deals to top podcasts <em>Crime Junkie</em> and <em>Pod Save America</em>. Additionally, the company debuted its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/8/23952400/siriusxm-new-app-logo-mobile-car-pandora-podcasts">modernized new app</a> last month that looks and acts much more like Spotify. </p></div></div>]]></description>

The iMessage connection software that powers Beeper Mini and Beeper Cloud is now 100% open source (</span><a href="https://github.com/beeper/imessage" rel="">github.com/beeper/imessage</a><span>). Anyone who wants can use it or continue development.</span></p><p><span>In the new year, we’re shifting focus back to our long-term goal of </span><a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/were-building-the-best-chat-app-on" rel="">building the best chat app on earth</a><span>.</span></p><p>Beeper Mini is beautiful, fast and fun. Our main goal with the app is to upgrade chats between iPhone and Android users from unencrypted green bubble SMS to encrypted, fully featured blue bubble chats. This is a huge win for both iPhone and Android users in the US, where texting via SMS is the default form of chat. The only people on the ‘other’ side of this debate seem to be Apple and some ardent online supporters.</p><p><span>Apple and other commentators have made a number of claims about Beeper Mini, including a </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23995150/beeper-imessage-android-apple-statement" rel="">public statement to The Verge</a><span>. These claims are serious, but flawed.</span></p><ul><li><p><em>“These techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure”</em></p><ul><li><p><span>It’s </span><a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/how-beeper-mini-works" rel="">straightforward to verify</a><span> that Beeper Mini is not a malicious app designed to steal your messages and accounts, or harvest your data. If you want, you can inspect the code of our core </span><a href="https://github.com/beeper/imessage" rel="">open source</a><span> iMessage bridge (which is embedded inside Beeper Mini), and self-host it yourself to prove that it only connects to Apple servers. So let’s put to rest the idea that Beeper Mini is inherently insecure. If Apple wants to accuse us of being insecure, they need to back that up with hard evidence. We’re eager to fix any security issues reported by Apple or anyone else.</span></p></li><li><p>The truth is that Beeper Mini upgrades insecure chats between iPhone and Android contacts and makes them secure with end-to-end encryption. By blocking Beeper Mini, Apple is actively harming their own iPhone customers by forcing them to fall back to insecure SMS chats. We believe that, for this reason alone, their actions are morally indefensible.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><em>“…exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage”</em></p><ul><li><p><span>As we shared in our </span><a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/a28168bb-b204-41b0-b6ee-7305584a8075" rel="">recent blog post</a><span>, Beeper uses real registration data from real Macs and iPhones. These credentials are being used by real people, with real Apple accounts, to send real iMessages. Many Beeper Mini users tell us that they are Apple customers with Macbooks or iPads, etc, but choose to use an Android smartphone. All they want to do is continue their iMessage chats on their phone. Honestly, we don’t understand this claim at all.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><em>“…enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks”</em></p><ul><li><p>Uh, isn’t that what SMS is for? 😂 With iMessage, Apple even has the ability to block spammers and scammers at the network layer. It’s much easier for them to block iMessage spam than SMS spam, which can only be blocked client-side. We don’t really understand this argument at all.</p></li><li><p><span>Keep in mind that from an iPhone user’s perspective, there is no way to tell if it’s a new iMessage or a new SMS message in the inbox. You can’t </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207006" rel="">tell that they are different</a><span> until you open the chat. </span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><em>“Apple’s going to support RCS next year, just wait for that!”</em></p><ul><li><p><span>On Nov 16, Apple sent a 3 sentence statement to </span><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/16/apple-rcs-coming-to-iphone/" rel="">9to5Mac</a><span> saying that they are planning to support RCS. This would be great! Beeper has </span><a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/08/17/google-messages-rcs-beeper/" rel="">supported RCS</a><span> since August. We’d immediately switch to using this for iPhone ↔ Android chats. Very few hard facts are available. It’s not clear if Apple’s RCS will support the same encryption protocol as Google’s RCS.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Just one year ago, </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23342243/tim-cook-apple-rcs-imessage-android-iphone-compatibility" rel="">Tim Cook had this to say</a><span> about RCS: "I don't hear our users asking that we put a lot of energy in on that at this point. […] Buy your mom an iPhone.”</span></p></li><li><p><span>Long story short, I will believe it when I see it. Apple has a long history of claiming they will support an open standard, then failing to add support. In 2010, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOxf9tEXEKQ" rel="">Steve Jobs promised</a><span> that Apple ‘would make FaceTime an open industry standard’. That never happened. More recently, in 2021, </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking" rel="">Apple promised</a><span> to open their Find My network to competitors like Tile. Instead, they’ve penalized Tile by additional warnings in front of their app.</span></p></li><li><p>Beeper Mini has a working solution to this problem today. Why should iPhone customers and Android users have to wait for Apple to adopt RCS? What if their implementation is delayed? What if they cancel it?</p></li></ul></li><li><p><em>“Apple is within their rights to run iMessage how they see fit”</em></p><ul><li><p><span>This might be true if Apple was a small company. But they aren’t. They control more than 50% of the US smartphone market, and lock customers into using Apple’s official app for texting (which, in the US, sadly, is the default way people communicate). Large companies that dominate their industry must follow a different set of rules that govern fair competition, harm to consumers and barriers to innovation. We are not experts in antitrust law, but Apple’s actions have already caught the attention of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jolingkent/status/1736601539790446592" rel="">US Congress</a><span> and the </span><a href="https://archive.is/mkGId" rel="">Department of Justice</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><em>“But you guys are making money off Apple’s servers!”</em></p><ul><li><p>We stopped charging for Beeper Mini on Dec 11, and Beeper Cloud has always been free to use. Additionally, Beeper Mini users chat with paying Apple customers on the other side of the conversation! If Apple proposed some way for us to reimburse them for the (minuscule) infrastructure costs of enabling paying iPhone customers to text Android users, we’d be happy to comply with that.</p></li><li><p>Our preference is to charge for our app because it allows us to align our interests with those of our customers, compared with ‘free’ apps that do questionable things with user data to make money.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>At this stage, Apple’s actions to block Beeper Mini look increasingly hard for Apple to defend. The only potential reason Apple has left is that they might make less money selling iPhones if iMessage were available on Android. Some </span><a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1589450766506692609" rel="">Apple folks</a><span> have admitted that ‘iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove and obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones’. Our hope is that Apple has more faith in their overall product offering than to think that people buy iPhones just to get a blue bubble.</span><br></p><p><strong>Eric Migicovsky</strong><br><span>Beeper CEO</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/blue-pholed">https://spectrum.ieee.org/blue-pholed</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38721604">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Meet the PHOLED That Is Transforming Displays" data-elid="2666590289" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/blue-pholed" data-authors="Tekla S. Perry" data-page-title="Meet the PHOLED That Is Transforming Displays - IEEE Spectrum"><p><strong>OLED displays dominate cellphones</strong> and have grabbed a big piece of the high-end TV market, thanks to their crisp images, deep black levels, and wide viewing angles.
</p><p>
	But 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/oled-tv-arrives" target="_self">OLED technology</a> doesn’t do better than the alternative—LCDs—in longevity or brightness. And energy efficiency is a toss-up, depending on the images being displayed.
</p><p>
	This year, OLED will get a big boost in all three of those metrics, when blue phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED) materials become commercially available. 
	<a href="https://oled.com/" target="_blank">Universal Display Corp.</a> (UDC), which has been chasing this technology for decades, says it has finally caught it and is about to begin mass production.
</p><p>
	“A lot of research groups have worked on it, many people have published on it, but we believe we have it,” says Michael Hack, vice president of business development at UDC.
</p><p>
	And while cellphone and TV manufacturers are characteristically mum about upcoming designs, they will likely rush blue PHOLEDs into their devices as soon as they can.
</p><h2>Fluorescent vs. Phosphorescent OLEDs </h2><p>
	To appreciate why a blue PHOLED is such a big deal, you have to understand the difference between conventional OLEDs and the newer, phosphorescent ones. And then you have to consider how today’s OLED displays are structured.
</p><p>
	OLEDs—organic light-emitting diodes—convert electrical energy directly into photons. They have multiple layers, including a cathode, an anode, and an emissive layer. When current passes through an OLED, electrons leave the cathode and holes leave the anode; they recombine in the central emissive layer, joining into excitons and releasing either light or heat as they decay.
</p><p>
	Depending on how the spin states of the molecules line up, this process can generate two types of 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/photon-upconversion" target="_self">excitons</a>: singlets and triplets. Singlets are typically outnumbered by triplets three to one, explains UDC’s Hack. That’s a problem, because in traditional—that is, fluorescent—OLEDs, only the singlets emit photons, while the triplets release their energy as heat. And that’s inefficient: Displays using fluorescent OLED materials turn only 25 percent of incoming electrical energy into light. The excess heat can eat away at a device’s life-span.
</p><p>
	When heavy metals are added to the mix of organic compounds that make up OLEDs, Hack says, the spin states change, and even the triplet excitons emit light. The result is a phosphorescent OLED. It’s potentially 100 percent efficient and doesn’t generate damaging heat.
</p><p>
	Phosphorescent red OLEDs have been around for about two decades; green has been available for one. But creating blue—which has the highest energy level of the three colors—has been a challenge.
</p><p>
	“We’ve had a lot of bright chemists and physicists working on this problem for years,” Hack says. “The more energy involved, the more likely bad things can happen, so it’s been hard to get long lifetimes. But we will have it available in 2024.”
</p><p>
	“The physics are very challenging, because those short, high-energy wavelengths of light are almost destroying the material as they are being generated,” says Jeff Yurek, vice president of marketing for 
	<a href="https://nanosys.com/" target="_blank">Nanosys</a>, a quantum-dot manufacturer that is now a division of Shoei Chemical. “It’s also hard to do a true 450-nanometer blue [the standard wavelength for blue], not 460 or 470. Some people had written this off as impossible to achieve.”
</p><p>
	UDC’s PHOLEDs are to date the only ones of any color commercially available, points out analyst Robert J. O’Brien, cofounder of the 
	<a href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/" target="_blank">market-research firm DSCC</a>, and UDC is already supplying red and green PHOLEDs to just about every manufacturer of OLED displays. UDC isn’t saying how much of a premium blue PHOLEDs will command over traditional blue OLEDs. But Hack says that as part of a display, the cost of the OLED materials of any variety is minimal.
</p><h2>Blue PHOLEDs for longer cellphone battery life </h2><p>
	What will the availability of blue PHOLEDs mean? That depends on the display that will incorporate them.
</p><p>
	Today’s smartphone displays use OLEDs directly, without color filters. Each pixel has three OLED subpixels: red, green, and blue. At present, only the red and green subpixels use phosphorescent OLEDs, and so the blue must rely on the less-efficient fluorescent OLED. That means the blue subpixel is generally much larger than the other two, in order to produce the required brightness without reducing lifetimes.
</p><p>
	Replacing the fluorescent blue with phosphorescent blue will mean a more balanced pixel structure and could enable higher-resolution displays in the future. In the near term, the switch will lead to an approximate 25 percent gain in efficiency; manufacturers can take advantage of this to increase battery life, reduce the size of the battery, or enable a brighter display. And in any of those cases, reducing extraneous heat generation should increase the lifetime of all the surrounding electronics.
</p><h2>Blue PHOLEDs enable cheaper, brighter TVs </h2><p>
	TV manufacturers use OLEDs a little differently than phone-display makers do, and they have different approaches.
</p><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/qd-oled" target="_self">Samsung’s OLED TV displays</a> use only blue OLEDs, creating the necessary red and green subpixels through the use of quantum dots, a material that takes in light energy at one wavelength and emits it at another. So the switch from the current fluorescent blue to phosphorescent blue will make Samsung’s displays much more efficient. It will also make them easier and cheaper to manufacture, says analyst O’Brien. To get the necessary brightness out of today’s fluorescent blue OLEDs, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/" target="_blank">Samsung</a> now uses three layers of the material. PHOLEDs will allow Samsung to cut that number to two, O’Brien says, and possibly even one. Or Samsung could choose to stick with three layers, at least in some premium models, and boost brightness significantly, says Yurek, at Nanosys.
</p><p><a href="https://www.lg.com/us/experience-tvs/best-lg-oled-tv" target="_blank">LG</a>, another major manufacturer of OLED TVs, builds its displays by combining layers of red, green, and blue OLEDs. The red and green layers are phosphorescent, and the blue is fluorescent, which creates white light that is then separated into subpixels using color filters. The current design requires two blue layers in the stack; PHOLED blue should allow LG to cut that to one layer.
</p><p>
	As with cellphone displays, the switch to blue PHOLEDs in TVs should boost display longevity. Says Hack, “Lifetimes are best when devices are cool and use less current.”
</p><h2>Who will deploy blue PHOLEDs first?</h2><p>
	When will displays incorporating blue phosphorescent OLEDs get into consumer hands? Possibly this year, says O’Brien, and most likely from Samsung first, for a couple of reasons.
</p><p>
	For one, Samsung is ready, he says. The company’s researchers have been developing phosphorescent blue OLEDs for years, regularly publishing papers about their efforts. So they are likely far along in planning how they will use it in display design. These displays won’t just show up in Samsung-branded products. In addition to making displays for its own phones, Samsung supplies them to many other manufacturers. The company is the biggest display supplier for iPhones, O’Brien says.
</p><p>
	Samsung will also likely be the first to incorporate blue PHOLEDs into TV displays, both because of its research jump and because the impacts on its all-blue OLED display will be greater than those on LG’s mixed-color approach.
</p><p>
	Looking into the future, O’Brien sees blue PHOLEDs as making OLED displays more compelling overall. Expect them to start moving beyond phones and large-screen TVs into tablets, notebooks, and computers, where LCD technology has yet to give ground.

<p><span>Waymo on Wednesday released new crash data based on the company's first 7.1 million miles of fully driverless operations in Arizona and California. The data shows that human-driven cars are more than twice as likely to get into a crash that is reported to the police. And depending on how you do the math, </span><span>human-driven cars are four to seven times more likely to get into crashes that lead to an injury.</span></p>
<p>Through October 2023, driverless Waymo vehicles have had only three crashes with injuries—two in the Phoenix area and one in San Francisco. Waymo says all three injuries were minor. If those same miles had been driven by typical human drivers in the same cities, we would have expected around 13 injury crashes.</p>
<p><span>The new data comes at a crucial time for the self-driving industry. In October, a woman was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/california-suspends-cruises-robotaxis-after-pedestrian-was-critically-injured/">dragged about 20 feet</a> underneath a vehicle by Waymo's main rival, Cruise. Since then, Cruise has </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/after-robotaxi-dragged-pedestrian-20-feet-cruise-founder-and-ceo-resigns/"><span>lost its CEO</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/14/cruise-slashes-24-of-self-driving-car-workforce-in-sweeping-layoffs/"><span>laid off 24 percent of its workforce</span></a><span>, and suspended driverless operations nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span>Cruise’s implosion has left Waymo as the undisputed leader in the driverless taxi market. But it has also heightened public skepticism about self-driving technology in general. So Waymo is going to have to work hard to convince the public that its technology not only has the potential to make the roads safer in the future, but is already doing so now.</span></p>
<p><span>The new data provides Waymo fresh ammunition to make that case. If Waymo can maintain its excellent safety record in the coming months and years, it will have a strong argument for continued expansion regardless of what happens in the rest of the industry.</span></p>
<h2>7 million miles, 3 injuries</h2>
<p><span>Since their inception, Waymo vehicles have driven 5.3 million driverless miles in Phoenix, 1.8 million driverless miles in San Francisco, and a few thousand driverless miles in Los Angeles through the end of October 2023. And during all those miles, there were three crashes serious enough to cause injuries:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In July, a Waymo in Tempe, Arizona, braked to avoid hitting a downed branch, leading to a three-car pileup. A Waymo passenger was not wearing a seatbelt (they were sitting on the buckled seatbelt instead) and sustained injuries that Waymo described as minor.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In August, a Waymo at an intersection “began to proceed forward” but then “slowed to a stop” and was hit from behind by an SUV. The SUV left the scene without exchanging information, and a Waymo passenger reported minor injuries.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In October, a Waymo vehicle in Chandler, Arizona, was traveling in the left lane when it detected another vehicle approaching from behind at high speed. The Waymo tried to accelerate to avoid a collision but got hit from behind. Again, there was an injury, but Waymo described it as minor.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The two Arizona injuries over 5.3 million miles works out to 0.38 injuries per million vehicle miles. One San Francisco injury over 1.75 million miles equals 0.57 injuries per million vehicle miles. An important question is whether that’s more or less than you’d expect from a human-driven vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span>After making certain adjustments—including the fact that driverless Waymo vehicles do not travel on freeways—Waymo calculates that comparable human drivers reported 1.29 injury crashes per million miles in Phoenix and 3.79 injury crashes per million miles in San Francisco. In other words, human drivers get into injury crashes three times as often as Waymo in the Phoenix area and six times as often in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span>Waymo argues that these figures actually understate the gap because human drivers don't report all crashes. Independent studies have estimated that about a third of injury crashes go unreported. After adjusting for these and other reporting biases, Waymo estimates that human-driven vehicles actually get into five times as many injury crashes in Phoenix and nine times as many in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span>To help evaluate the study, I talked to David Zuby, the chief research officer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The IIHS is a well-respected nonprofit that is funded by the insurance industry, which has a strong interest in promoting automotive safety.</span></p>
<p><span>While Zuby had some quibbles with some details of Waymo’s methodology, he was generally positive about the study. Zuby agrees with Waymo that human drivers underreport crashes relative to Waymo. But it's hard to estimate this underreporting rate with any precision. Ultimately, </span><span>Zuby believes that the true rate of crashes for human-driven vehicles lies somewhere between Waymo’s adjusted and unadjusted figures.</span></p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 14:47:34 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/12/21/async-fn-rpit-in-traits.html">https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/12/21/async-fn-rpit-in-traits.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38721039">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The Rust Async Working Group is excited to announce major progress towards our goal of enabling the use of <code>async fn</code> in traits. Rust 1.75, which hits stable next week, will include support for both <code>-&gt; impl Trait</code> notation and <code>async fn</code> in traits.</p>
<p>This is a big milestone, and we know many users will be itching to try these out in their own code. However, we are still missing some important features that many users need. Read on for recommendations on when and how to use the stabilized features.</p>
<h2>What's stabilizing</h2>
<p>Ever since the stabilization of <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1522-conservative-impl-trait.html">RFC #1522</a> in Rust 1.26, Rust has allowed users to write <code>impl Trait</code> as the return type of functions (often called "RPIT"). This means that the function returns "some type that implements <code>Trait</code>". This is commonly used to return closures, iterators, and other types that are complex or impossible to write explicitly.</p>
<pre><code>/// Given a list of players, return an iterator
/// over their names.
fn player_names(
    players: &amp;[Player]
) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = &amp;String&gt; {
    players
        .iter()
        .map(|p| &amp;p.name)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Starting in Rust 1.75, you can use <strong>return-position <code>impl Trait</code> in trait</strong> (RPITIT) definitions and in trait impls. For example, you could use this to write a trait method that returns an iterator:</p>
<pre><code>trait Container {
    fn items(&amp;self) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = Widget&gt;;
}

impl Container for MyContainer {
    fn items(&amp;self) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = Widget&gt; {
        self.items.iter().cloned()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So what does all of this have to do with async functions? Well, async functions are "just sugar" for functions that return <code>-&gt; impl Future</code>. Since these are now permitted in traits, <strong>we also permit you to write traits that use <code>async fn</code></strong>.</p>
<pre><code>trait HttpService {
    async fn fetch(&amp;self, url: Url) -&gt; HtmlBody;
//  ^^^^^^^^ desugars to:
//  fn fetch(&amp;self, url: Url) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Output = HtmlBody&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Where the gaps lie</h2>
<h3><code>-&gt; impl Trait</code> in public traits</h3>
<p>The use of <code>-&gt; impl Trait</code> is still discouraged for general use in <strong>public</strong> traits and APIs for the reason that users can't put additional bounds on the return type. For example, there is no way to write this function in a way that is generic over the <code>Container</code> trait:</p>
<pre><code>fn print_in_reverse(container: impl Container) {
    for item in container.items().rev() {
        // ERROR:                 ^^^
        // the trait `DoubleEndedIterator`
        // is not implemented for
        // `impl Iterator&lt;Item = Widget&gt;`
        eprintln!("{item}");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Even though some implementations might return an iterator that implements <code>DoubleEndedIterator</code>, there is no way for generic code to take advantage of this without defining another trait. In the future we plan to add a solution for this. For now, <code>-&gt; impl Trait</code> is best used in internal traits or when you're confident your users won't need additional bounds. Otherwise you should consider using an associated type.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3><code>async fn</code> in public traits</h3>
<p>Since <code>async fn</code> desugars to <code>-&gt; impl Future</code>, the same limitations apply. In fact, if you use bare <code>async fn</code> in a public trait today, you'll see a warning.</p>
<pre><code>warning: use of `async fn` in public traits is discouraged as auto trait bounds cannot be specified
 --&gt; src/lib.rs:7:5
  |
7 |     async fn fetch(&amp;self, url: Url) -&gt; HtmlBody;
  |     ^^^^^
  |
help: you can desugar to a normal `fn` that returns `impl Future` and add any desired bounds such as `Send`, but these cannot be relaxed without a breaking API change
  |
7 -     async fn fetch(&amp;self, url: Url) -&gt; HtmlBody;
7 +     fn fetch(&amp;self, url: Url) -&gt; impl std::future::Future&lt;Output = HtmlBody&gt; + Send;
  |
</code></pre>
<p>Of particular interest to users of async are <code>Send</code> bounds on the returned future. Since users cannot add bounds later, the error message is saying that you as a trait author need to make a choice: Do you want your trait to work with multithreaded, work-stealing executors?</p>
<p>Thankfully, we have a solution that allows using <code>async fn</code> in public traits today! We recommend using the <code>trait_variant::make</code> proc macro to let your users choose. This proc macro is part of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/trait-variant"><code>trait-variant</code></a> crate, published by the rust-lang org. Add it to your project with <code>cargo add trait-variant</code>, then use it like so:</p>
<pre><code>#[trait_variant::make(HttpService: Send)]
pub trait LocalHttpService {
    async fn fetch(&amp;self, url: Url) -&gt; HtmlBody;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This creates <em>two</em> versions of your trait: <code>LocalHttpService</code> for single-threaded executors and <code>HttpService</code> for multithreaded work-stealing executors. Since we expect the latter to be used more commonly, it has the shorter name in this example. It has additional Send bounds:</p>
<pre><code>pub trait HttpService: Send {
    fn fetch(
        &amp;self,
        url: Url,
    ) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Output = HtmlBody&gt; + Send;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This macro works for async because <code>impl Future</code> rarely requires additional bounds other than Send, so we can set our users up for success. See the FAQ below for an example of where this is needed.</p>
<h3>Dynamic dispatch</h3>
<p>Traits that use <code>-&gt; impl Trait</code> and <code>async fn</code> are not object-safe, which means they lack support for dynamic dispatch. We plan to provide utilities that enable dynamic dispatch in an upcoming version of the <code>trait-variant</code> crate.</p>
<h2>How we hope to improve in the future</h2>
<p>In the future we would like to allow users to add their own bounds to <code>impl Trait</code> return types, which would make them more generally useful. It would also enable more advanced uses of <code>async fn</code>. The syntax might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>trait HttpService = LocalHttpService&lt;fetch(): Send&gt; + Send;
</code></pre>
<p>Since these aliases won't require any support on the part of the trait author, it will technically make the Send variants of async traits unnecessary. However, those variants will still be a nice convenience for users, so we expect that most crates will continue to provide them.</p>
<p>Of course, the goals of the Async Working Group don't stop with <code>async fn</code> in traits. We want to continue building features on top of it that enable more reliable and sophisticated use of async Rust, and we intend to publish a more extensive roadmap in the new year.</p>
<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>Is it okay to use <code>-&gt; impl Trait</code> in traits?</h3>
<p>For private traits you can use <code>-&gt; impl Trait</code> freely. For public traits, it's best to avoid them for now unless you can anticipate all the bounds your users might want (in which case you can use <code>#[trait_variant::make]</code>, as we do for async). We expect to lift this restriction in the future.</p>
<h3>Should I still use the <code>#[async_trait]</code> macro?</h3>
<p>There are a couple of reasons you might need to continue using async-trait:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to support Rust versions older than 1.75.</li>
<li>You want dynamic dispatch.</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated above, we hope to enable dynamic dispatch in a future version of the <code>trait-variant</code> crate.</p>
<h3>Is it okay to use <code>async fn</code> in traits? What are the limitations?</h3>
<p>Assuming you don't need to use <code>#[async_trait]</code> for one of the reasons stated above, it's totally fine to use regular <code>async fn</code> in traits. Just remember to use <code>#[trait_variant::make]</code> if you want to support multithreaded runtimes.</p>
<p>The biggest limitation is that a type must always decide if it implements the Send or non-Send version of a trait. It cannot implement the Send version <em>conditionally</em> on one of its generics. This can come up in the <a href="https://github.com/tower-rs/tower/blob/master/guides/building-a-middleware-from-scratch.md">middleware</a> pattern, for example, <code>RequestLimitingService&lt;T&gt;</code> that is HttpService if <code>T: HttpService</code>.</p>
<h3>Why do I need <code>#[trait_variant::make]</code> and <code>Send</code> bounds?</h3>
<p>In simple cases you may find that your trait appears to work fine with a multithreaded executor. There are some patterns that just won't work, however. Consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>fn spawn_task(service: impl HttpService + 'static) {
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        let url = Url::from("https://rust-lang.org");
        let _body = service.fetch(url).await;
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>Without Send bounds on our trait, this would fail to compile with the error: "future cannot be sent between threads safely". By creating a variant of your trait with Send bounds, you avoid sending your users into this trap.</p>
<p>Note that you won't see a warning if your trait is not public, because if you run into this problem you can always add the Send bounds yourself later.</p>
<p>For a more thorough explanation of the problem, see <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/05/03/stabilizing-async-fn-in-trait.html">this blog post</a>.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<h3>Can I mix async fn and impl trait?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can freely move between the <code>async fn</code> and <code>-&gt; impl Future</code> spelling in your traits and impls. This is true even when one form has a Send bound.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> This makes the traits created by <code>trait_variant</code> nicer to use.</p>
<pre><code>trait HttpService: Send {
    fn fetch(&amp;self, url: Url)
    -&gt; impl Future&lt;Output = HtmlBody&gt; + Send;
}

impl HttpService for MyService {
    async fn fetch(&amp;self, url: Url) -&gt; HtmlBody {
        // This works, as long as `do_fetch(): Send`!
        self.client.do_fetch(url).await.into_body()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Why don't these signatures use <code>impl Future + '_</code>?</h3>
<p>For <code>-&gt; impl Trait</code> in traits we adopted the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3498-lifetime-capture-rules-2024.html">2024 Capture Rules</a> early. This means that the <code>+ '_</code> you often see today is unnecessary in traits, because the return type is already assumed to capture input lifetimes. In the 2024 edition this rule will apply to all function signatures. See the linked RFC for more.</p>
<h3>Why am I getting a "refine" warning when I implement a trait with <code>-&gt; impl Trait</code>?</h3>
<p>If your impl signature includes more detailed information than the trait itself, you'll <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=beta&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=6248cfe0419a693d1331ef47c729d1fe">get a warning</a>:</p>
<pre><code>pub trait Foo {
    fn foo(self) -&gt; impl Debug;
}

impl Foo for u32 {
    fn foo(self) -&gt; String {
//                  ^^^^^^
//  warning: impl trait in impl method signature does not match trait method signature
        self.to_string()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The reason is that you may be leaking more details of your implementation than you meant to. For instance, should the following code compile?</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
    // Did the implementer mean to allow
    // use of `Display`, or only `Debug` as
    // the trait says?
    println!("{}", 32.foo());
}
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3245-refined-impls.html">refined trait implementations</a> it does compile, but the compiler asks you to confirm your intent to refine the trait interface with <code>#[allow(refining_impl_trait)]</code> on the impl.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Async Working Group is excited to end 2023 by announcing the completion of our primary goal for the year! Thank you to everyone who helpfully participated in design, implementation, and stabilization discussions. Thanks also to the users of async Rust who have given great feedback over the years. We're looking forward to seeing what you build, and to delivering continued improvements in the years to come.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said today that the company made an existential business decision in 2018 that few realized would redefine its future and help redefine an evolving industry. It’s paid off enormously, of course, but Huang said this is only the beginning of an AI-powered near future — a future powered primarily by Nvidia hardware. Was this successful gambit lucky or smart? The answer, it seems, is “yes.”</p>
<p>He made these remarks and reflections <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/siggraph/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during a keynote</a> at SIGGRAPH in Los Angeles. That watershed moment five years ago, Huang said, was the choice to embrace AI-powered image processing in the form of ray tracing and intelligent upscaling: RTX and DLSS, respectively. (Quotes are from my notes and may not be verbatim, some minor corrections may take place after checking the transcript.)</p>
<p>“We realized rasterization was reaching its limits,” he said, referring to the traditional, widely used method of rendering a 3D scene. “2018 was a ‘bet the company’ moment. It required that we reinvent the hardware, the software, the algorithms. And while we were reinventing CG with AI, we were reinventing the GPU for AI.”</p>
<p>While ray-tracing and DLSS are still in the process of being adopted across the diverse and complex world of consumer GPUs and gaming, the architecture that they had created to enable it was found to be a perfect partner for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/11/age-of-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/"> the growing machine learning development community.</a></p>
<p>The massive amount of calculation required to train larger and larger generative models was served best not by traditional datacenters with some GPU capability, but systems like the H100 designed from the start to perform the necessary operations at scale. It would be fair to say that AI development was in some ways only limited by the availability of these computing resources. Nvidia was in possession of a Beanie Baby-scale boom and has sold about as many servers and workstations as it has been able to make.</p>
<p>But Huang asserted that this has just been the beginning. The new models not only need to be trained, but run in real time by millions, perhaps billions of users on a regular basis.</p>
<p>“The future is an LLM at the front of just about everything: “Human” is the new programming language,” he said. Everything from visual effects to a rapidly digitizing manufacturing market, factory design, and heavy industry will adopt in some degree a natural language interface, Huang hazarded.</p>
<p>“Entire factories will be software-defined and robotic, and the cars they’ll be building will themselves be robotic. So it’s robotically designed robots building robots,” he said.</p>
<p>Some may not share his outlook, which while plausible also happens to be extremely friendly to Nvidia’s interests.</p>
<p>But while the <em>degree</em> of reliance on LLMs may be unknown, few would say it will not be adopted at all, and even a conservative estimate of who will use it and for what will necessitate a serious investment in new computing resources.</p>
<p>Investing millions of dollars in last-generation computing resources, like CPU-focused racks, is foolish when something like a GH200, the newly revealed and datacenter-dedicated AI development hardware, can do the same job for less than a tenth of the cost and power requirements.</p>
<p>He gleefully presented a video showing a LEGO-like assembly of multiple Grace Hopper computing units into a blade, then a rack, then a row of GH200s all connected at such high speeds that they amounted to “the world’s largest single GPU,” comprising one full exaflop of ML-specialty computing power.</p>

<p>“This is real size, by the way,” he said, standing for dramatic effect at the center of the visualization. “And it probably even runs Crysis.”</p>
<p>These are going to be the basic unit of the digital, AI-dominated industry of the future, he proposed.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who said it, but… the more you buy, the more you save. If I could ask you to remember one thing from my talk today, that would be it,” he said, earning a laugh from the game audience here at SIGGRAPH.</p>
<p>No mention of AI’s many challenges, regulation, or the entire concept of AI shifting — as it already has multiple times in the last year. It’s a rose-tinted view of the world, to be sure, but when you’re selling pickaxes and shovels during a gold rush, you can afford to think that way.</p>

<p>Apple asserts itself as a champion of user privacy; however, this claim will be proven untrue in this article.
For almost a decade, Apple allowed apps had the capability to track users’ locations without affording them the option to disable this feature or even raising awareness about it.
And this is “ONLY APPLE CAN DO”!</p>

<h2 id="the-hotspothelper-api-in-action">The HotspotHelper API in Action</h2>

<p>Since the introduction of iOS 9 in 2015, Apple has included an API call named “HotspotHelper,” enabling developers to request a capability for their apps to assist the system in connecting to WiFi access points.
Let’s delve into how this API works with a simplified code snippet:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>CoreLocation</span>
<span>import</span> <span>NetworkExtension</span>

<span>class</span> <span>LocationTrackingManager</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>func</span> <span>setupHotspotHelper</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>networkList</span> <span>=</span> <span>command</span><span>.</span><span>networkList</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>for</span> <span>network</span> <span>in</span> <span>networkList</span> <span>{</span>
                    <span>// Access WiFi network information (SSID, MAC address)</span>
                    <span>// see: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nehotspotnetwork</span>
                    <span>let</span> <span>ssid</span> <span>=</span> <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>ssid</span>
                    <span>let</span> <span>macAddress</span> <span>=</span> <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>bssid</span>
                    
                    <span>// Perform location tracking logic with ssid and macAddress</span>
                    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>trackLocation</span><span>(</span><span>withSSID</span><span>:</span> <span>ssid</span><span>,</span> <span>andMACAddress</span><span>:</span> <span>macAddress</span><span>)</span>
                <span>}</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>func</span> <span>trackLocation</span><span>(</span><span>withSSID</span> <span>ssid</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>andMACAddress</span> <span>macAddress</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// Your location tracking logic goes here</span>
        <span>// Use the ssid and macAddress to determine user location</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This snippet demonstrates how developers can utilize the HotspotHelper API to register for WiFi network information.
The trackLocation method showcases the potential for extracting data that can be used for location tracking.</p>

<h2 id="the-privacy-dilemma">The Privacy Dilemma</h2>

<p>The real cause for concern arises from the fact that, with access to such information, apps can effectively track a user’s location.
This is based on the premise that most WiFi access points remain stationary after deployment, providing a consistent reference for triangulating a user’s whereabouts.
Public API avalible such as <a href="https://developer.precisely.com/apis/geolocation">Precisely Location By Wi-fi Access Point</a>,
<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/requests-geolocation">Google’s Geolocation API</a>.
While the intentions behind HotspotHelper may be rooted in facilitating seamless connectivity, the unintended consequence of potential location tracking without explicit user consent raises eyebrows in the ongoing privacy debate.</p>

<p>This capability is activated whenever the user’s device scans nearby WiFi access points, extending beyond explicit user engagement with the system settings to include instances where the device is locked in someone’s pocket.
The system will initiate the registered app with this API, enabling the app to retrieve nearby SSIDs and their MAC addresses and transmit this information to the server side.
Consequently, if the app developer wishes, they possess the capability to nearly real-time track the user’s location.
Importantly, users remain unaware of this process occurring on their screens, and they lack the option to disable it.
On the other hand, almost all the users doesn’t know the App has this feature and they don’t need/use this feature to help their lives.
But again, they have no choice, their devices has to launch the App and submit near by WiFi info to the developers of the App.</p>

<h2 id="global-impact-wechat-and-alipay">Global Impact: WeChat and Alipay</h2>

<p>Adding another layer to the discussion is the fact that major apps like WeChat and Alipay have already implemented this capability.
These two apps are ubiquitous in mainland China, touching almost every aspect of people’s lives.
The widespread use of these applications in a densely populated region intensifies the implications of location tracking without user consent.</p>

<p>A compelling debate could center around whether WeChat and/or Alipay function as responsible citizens in the app world,
asserting that their data collection aims solely at enhancing user experience and facilitating seamless connections to nearby WiFi.
Nevertheless, the opaque server-side logic embedded in their code raises questions.
Could it be that once again, “ONLY APPLE CAN DO” in terms of ensuring transparency and accountability?</p>

<h2 id="apples-response">Apple’s “response”</h2>

<p>In reality, I discovered this issue approximately two years ago and created a <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16Z4y1Q7fN/">video</a> on Bilibili (a Chinese alternative to YouTube) discussing the matter.
However, it has only very limited public awareness. I also brought this concern to Apple’s attention and received an email response, but as of now, there has been no further update on the matter.</p>

<p><img src="https://wingu.se/images/apple-response-to-hotspot-helper.jpg" alt="Apple email response regarding HotspotHelper"></p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I strongly advocate for Apple to offer users the option to disable this feature, akin to other privacy settings such as location and notifications.
Apps should explicitly seek permission before accessing this feature, ensuring users have the ability to grant or deny access while using the app.</p>

<p>As the conversation around digital privacy continues to evolve, Apple finds itself navigating the fine line between innovation and safeguarding user data.
The question remains: can Apple maintain its commitment to privacy while addressing concerns raised by the HotspotHelper feature?
Only time will tell how this controversial aspect fits into Apple’s broader privacy narrative.</p>

<p>苹果公司自诩为用户隐私的捍卫者，然而这并非事实。
在近十年的时间里，苹果允许应用程序具备跟踪用户位置的能力，而不提供关闭此功能或引起用户对此的关注的选项。

</code></pre></div>

<p>这个片段演示了开发人员如何利用 HotspotHelper API 注册 WiFi 网络信息。
<code>trackLocation</code> 方法展示了提取可用于位置跟踪的数据的潜力。</p>

<h2 id="隐私困境">隐私困境</h2>

<p>真正引起关注的原因在于，有了这样的信息访问权限，应用程序可以有效地跟踪用户的位置。
这是基于这样一个前提，即大多数 WiFi 接入点在部署后保持不动，为三角定位用户位置提供了一个一致的参考。
公开的 API 包括 <a href="https://developer.precisely.com/apis/geolocation">Precisely 的 Wi-fi 接入点的准确位置</a>，
<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/requests-geolocation">Google 的 Geolocation API</a>。
尽管 HotspotHelper 的初衷可能是促进无缝连接，但潜在的未经用户明示同意的位置跟踪的意外后果应在持续的隐私辩论中引起关注。</p>

<p>这一功能在用户设备扫描附近 WiFi 接入点时激活，超出了用户明确与系统设置互动的情况，还包括设备被锁在口袋里的情况。
系统将使用此 API 启动注册的应用程序，使应用程序检索附近的 SSID 和它们的 MAC 地址，并将此信息传输到服务器端。
因此，如果应用程序开发人员希望，他们就可以几乎实时跟踪用户的位置。
重要的是，用户对其屏幕上发生的此过程毫不知情，并且他们无法禁用它。
另一方面，几乎所有用户都不知道应用程序具有此功能，他们不需要/使用此功能来帮助他们的生活。
但再次，他们别无选择，他们的设备必须启动应用程序并将附近的 WiFi 信息提交给应用程序的开发人员。</p>

<h2 id="世界范围的影响微信和支付宝">世界范围的影响：微信和支付宝</h2>

<p>讨论的另一个层面是微信和支付宝等主要应用已经实施了这一功能。
这两个应用在中国大陆无处不在，几乎触及人们生活的方方面面。
这些应用在人口密集地区的广泛使用加剧了未经用户同意的位置跟踪的影响。</p>

<p>一个可能有力的抗辩可能会说，微信和/或支付宝是在应用程序世界中有责任感的公民，他们的数据收集目的仅在于增强用户体验和促进与附近 WiFi 的无缝连接。
然而，我们无法审查他们服务器端的代码，我们无从得知从我们设备发送出去的数据他们会怎么处理。
难道再次可以说，「只有苹果可以做到的」（Only Apple Can Do）确保他们的透明度和付责任吗？</p>

<h2 id="苹果的回应">苹果的「回应」</h2>

<p>实际上，我大约两年前发现了这个问题，并在哔哩哔哩上创建了一个 <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16Z4y1Q7fN/">视频</a> 来讨论这个问题。
然而，它的公众认知非常有限。我还把这个问题带给了苹果的注意，并收到了一封电子邮件回复，但截至目前，对此事并没有进一步的更新。</p>

<p><img src="https://wingu.se/images/apple-response-to-hotspot-helper.jpg" alt="苹果关于 HotspotHelper 的电子邮件回应"></p>

<h2 id="小结">小结</h2>

<p>我强烈主张苹果向用户提供禁用此功能的选项，类似于其他隐私设置，如位置和通知。
应用程序在访问此功能之前应明确请求权限，确保用户在使用应用程序时具有授予或拒绝访问的能力。</p>

<p>随着数字隐私讨论的不断发展，苹果会发现自己在创新和保护用户数据之间的窄缝中航行。
问题仍然是：苹果是否希望在解决 HotspotHelper 功能引起的担忧的，保持对隐私的承诺？
只有时间能告诉我们这种致用户隐私不顾的行为，会如何融入到苹果宏大的隐私叙事中。</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we are celebrating a major milestone for the company and the Cilium project ecosystem as Cisco announces the intent to acquire Isovalent. When we started our journey seven years ago, writing the first few lines of Cilium source code, we couldn’t imagine in our wildest dreams what Cilium would become. We founded Isovalent a year after starting the project, embarking on the mission of bringing the exciting eBPF technology to everyone by redefining what is possible in networking and security for the cloud native age with Cilium. While we evolved our technology and company, and built a thriving open source community, we hired a mind-blowingly talented team of amazing people and focused on building technology and products loved by customers. As we celebrate this major milestone for the team, we want to look back, but also look forward to see the exciting future ahead for Isovalent and Cisco.</p>

<p>In the last seven years, we have invested all our passion and heart into the open source projects Cilium, Tetragon, Hubble, and eBPF. We donated the Cilium project ecosystem to the CNCF and, together with your help as a community, have developed and matured it to the point of Cilium becoming a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2023/10/11/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-cilium-graduation/">graduated CNCF project</a> among the ranks of Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Envoy. As a Cilium community we have developed what has become the standard for cloud native networking and security, deployed into many Kubernetes distributions you are running today.</p>

<p>As initial talks with Cisco sparked, we didn’t have to ask what a potential acquisition would mean for Cilium, Tetragon, and our other projects. It was clear from the beginning that Cisco came to the table with a clear vision to double down on our products and our open source strategy with a strong commitment to our open source projects. Open source has become the way to standardize technology and cloud native infrastructure is no exception.</p>

<p>As Cilium and Tetragon evolved, we also launched Isovalent Enterprise – the leading enterprise distribution of Cilium and Tetragon. As we join Cisco, we are excited to continue developing and enhancing Isovalent Enterprise and working with all of you.</p>



<p>There are countless other milestones that we have achieved over the years as Isovalent. With Cilium, we built a technology that all three major public cloud providers have selected for their managed Kubernetes offerings. Countless enterprises around the globe have adopted our products. Large-scale Kubernetes users like Datadog, ByteDance, and Sky bet on Cilium. Customers such as GitHub, G-Research, and Nationwide are securing their highly sensitive infrastructure with Tetragon.</p>

<p>We helped create a foundation around eBPF and became “movie stars” by collaborating on a fantastic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb_vD3XZYOA&amp;ab_channel=SpeakeasyProductions">documentary on eBPF</a> together with many of our friends in the eBPF community. We<a href="https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-isovalent/"> raised money from investors such as a16z</a>, an investor most founders only dream about. We spoke at countless KubeCons and are looking forward to continuing enjoying all the interactions and hallway conversations with all of you. But these milestones have little meaning compared to what we are most proud of: the incredible team and amazing culture we managed to build. Dan and I couldn’t be happier with or more proud of the team we are taking this next step with.</p>

<p>We not only got really good at innovating, building communities, and selling together, we also explore the world, have great food, make friends, and have fun on every occasion we can find. As we join Cisco as a team, we look forward to bringing along the Isovalent culture and spirit, and welcoming more of you as we continue our journey.</p>



<p>As we learned more about Cisco’s strategy and plan, we got more and more excited about the joint vision of continuing to build out our amazing team around eBPF, Cilium, and our open source projects while also accelerating the product side and bringing cloud native excellence to customers with products they love. We are excited about this shared vision and what is ahead for Cilium and Tetragon, and we look forward to continuing our eBPF journey as part of Cisco to bring our technology and products to an even larger customer base.</p>



<p>We are taking a moment to appreciate what we have achieved as a team, and we thank all of you in the community and all our customers and partners for helping us get where we are today.</p>



<p>🫶 Thomas, Dan, and the Isovalent Team</p>

<div><p>
Today I’m publicizing a Google OAuth vulnerability that allows employees at companies to retain indefinite access to applications like Slack and Zoom, after they’re off-boarded and removed from their company’s Google organization. The vulnerability is easy for a non-technical audience to understand and exploit.</p><p>No changes have been pushed by Google to mitigate this risk at this time.
</p></div>
<p>
Here’s a timeline of events:
</p>

<block-list data-block="a5f6af">
<div slot="content">
<ul><li>August 4th- Disclosure to Google, informed them hundreds of applications are likely affected</li><li>August 7th- The issue was triaged</li><li>October 5th- Google paid $1337 for the issue</li><li>November 25th- Bulk private disclosure to dozens of impacted applications (including Zoom and Slack)</li><li>December 16th- Public disclosure 134 days after notifying Google</li></ul>
</div>
</block-list>

<block-title data-block="f4f9e8">

</block-title>
<p>
Back in August, we <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/discovering-a-vulnerability-in-forager-authz-hours-before-public-launch%ef%bf%bc/">publicly disclosed</a> that one of the beta testers of Truffle Security’s <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/introducing-forager/">Forager</a> tool had found our login was impacted by <a href="https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth">Descope’s Microsoft OAuth vulnerability</a>. At the time I remember being surprised to learn that Microsoft would send Email claims that were not created or validated by Microsoft, and that the email claim in general was not considered reliable.
</p>
<p>
This was counter-intuitive to me, because I had thought the entire purpose of OIDC was to establish reliable identity via a 3rd party like Microsoft. To illustrate this point, I went to take a screenshot of Google’s email claim, which at the time I had thought to be rock solid reliable. To my surprise, Google’s documentation in fact warned against using Email as an identifier:
</p>


<block-image data-block="d0f36d">
<div slot="content">
<div><p><img src="https://trufflesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/badprimaryidentifer.png" alt="" width="500" height="0" ratio="500x0"></p></div>
<p>Google’s OIDC documentation</p>

</div>
</block-image>
<p>
That’s weird. Also the email-verified claim is weird too, though I have not actually found a way to generate an email claim from an unverified email. I did however find ample examples of abusing the email claim itself.
</p>
<block-title data-block="be2bbb">
<div slot="content">
<block-title-line data-block="a78dc4">
<div slot="content">
<p>Non-Gmail Google accounts</p>
</div>
</block-title-line>
</div>
</block-title>
<p>
As it turns out, you can create Google accounts using existing email addresses, that don’t have to be Gmail. You could for example create a Google account with a Yahoo email address:
</p>

<block-image data-block="d287ff">
<div slot="content"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://trufflesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/janedoeyahoo.png" alt="" width="500" height="0" ratio="500x0"></p></div>
</block-image>
<p>
You may see where this is going, this new Google account, now has “<a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="3f555e515a5b505a7f465e575050115c5052">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>” set as its non-Gmail email, and can be used to send yahoo email claims:
</p>

<block-image data-block="e48374">
<div slot="content">
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://trufflesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/yahoooauth.png" alt="" width="500" height="0" ratio="500x0"></p></div>
<p>Yahoo Oauth</p>

</div>
</block-image>
<p>
The reason Google’s documentation tells you to not use email as a primary identifier, is because it’s actually possible for two different Google accounts to send the same email claim, if you edit your non-Gmail email in settings, and a new account is created with your old pre-edited email.
</p>
<block-title data-block="eed2d6">
<div slot="content">
<block-title-line data-block="b3485e">
<div slot="content">
<p>Where it becomes a problem</p>
</div>
</block-title-line>
</div>
</block-title>
<p>
The issue is, we can actually create Google accounts off of corporate Google organization, via email aliases, and email plus sign forwarding. In google <strong><a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e49d8b91968189858d88cf858a9d9790968d8a838c819681a4858a9d808b89858d8aca878b89">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></strong> will be forwarded to <strong><a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="93eafce6e1f6fef2faffd3f2fdeaf7fcfef2fafdbdf0fcfe">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></strong>‘s inbox.
</p>
<div><p>
This creates a window of opportunity to create a non-Gmail Google account with a plus sign email using your company’s Google organization email, that cannot be deleted or off-boarded by your organization:</p></div>

<block-image data-block="fc09cd">
<div slot="content"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://trufflesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zoomwamy.png" alt="" width="500" height="0" ratio="500x0"></p></div>
</block-image>
<p>
This email address, will be parsed by many impacted organizations, and the domain at the end of it, will be used to decide if you can log in:<br>
</p>

<block-image data-block="d4648b">
<div slot="content">
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://trufflesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Zoom.png" alt="" width="500" height="0" ratio="500x0"></p></div>
<p>Joining Zoom with the account</p>

</div>
</block-image>

<block-image data-block="c0d508">
<div slot="content">
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://trufflesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Slack.png" alt="" width="500" height="0" ratio="500x0"></p></div>
<p>Joining Slack with the account</p>

</div>
</block-image>
<p>
Because these non-Gmail Google accounts aren’t actually a member of the Google organization, they won’t show up in any administrator settings, or user Google lists.
</p>
<block-title data-block="c7ca6e">

</block-title>
<p>
The remediations for this issue fall into 3 buckets:<br>
</p>
<block-list data-block="b5cbc6">
<div slot="content">
<ul><li>What can Organizations do to protect themselves</li><li>What can service providers like Zoom and Slack do</li><li>What can Google do</li></ul>
</div>
</block-list>
<block-title data-block="c022ae">

</block-title>
<p>
If you’re reading this thinking to yourself “Dang, I gotta stop disgruntled people from accessing our Slack until the end of time”, there’s good news. All you have to do is disable login with Google, and strictly enforce SAML. This actually works for most service providers, however some don’t offer this option, and you may also have some internally developed applications that are impacted and don’t support SAML.
</p>
<block-title data-block="c959f9">

</block-title>
<p>
Google actually has a way for service providers to determine organization membership, sort of… One of the other OAuth claims, HD, sends you the domain of the Google organization the account is attached to. The HD claim is left off of accounts that aren’t members of Google orgs.
</p>

<block-image data-block="a49f53">
<div slot="content">
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://trufflesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hdclaim.png" alt="" width="500" height="0" ratio="500x0"></p></div>
<p>The HD claim</p>

</div>
</block-image>
<p>
However, there is a major drawback to the HD claim: it’s just the domain, it’s not a unique identifier. This means if the Google organization gets deleted, and the domain abandoned, someone could snatch it up, and create a new Google org, and log into all your old services. Consider a case where company A gets acquired by company B, company B spins down company A’s services and does not renew its old domain. Someone on the internet could buy company A’s domain, and use it to log into company A’s old accounts.
</p>
<p>
Most of the service providers I tested did not use HD, they used the email claim.
</p>
<p>
One more remediation service providers can implement, is to not allow just-in-time account creation as a feature, generally, and to instead switch to invite only, or LDAP group only account provisioning.
</p>
<block-title data-block="b9bccd">

</block-title>
<p>
Google could take several steps to broadly fix this for everyone. One such step could be to just ban Google accounts created of existing google Organization domains. Interestingly enough, Google themselves banned google.com accounts:
</p>

<block-image data-block="b70f36">
<div slot="content">
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://trufflesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/googlebaned.png" alt="" width="500" height="0" ratio="500x0"></p></div>
<p>Google protecting themselves</p>

</div>
</block-image>
<div><p>
It seems reasonable to ask them to extend the protection they affording themselves, to everyone else.</p><p>Another solution they could implement, is banning plus signed Google accounts from signing up, banning Google email aliases from signing up, or just generally provide better administration settings for orgs to configure these things.
</p></div>
<block-title data-block="ba8218">

</block-title>
<p>
One more thing I’ll call out is it is actually technically possible to get access to an organization’s Zoom and Slack given no initial access. This piggy backs off the vulnerability research others have <a href="https://medium.com/intigriti/how-i-hacked-hundreds-of-companies-through-their-helpdesk-b7680ddc2d4c">found in magic link sign-in flows</a>, that certain support and ticketing systems such as Zendesk, allow you to create a support ticket via email. Following this flow, you can create a Google account using a support ticket email address, potentially view the contents of the ticket to finish the account creation, and start using the support email address to Oauth into stuff. Keeping your “email to support” feature on your main domain isn’t safe, and you should consider configuring your zendesk support email with an alt email address.
</p>
<block-title data-block="aede48">

</block-title>
<p>
Former employees retaining access to platforms like Slack and Zoom because of a loophole in Google’s OAuth system isn’t just an oversight; it’s a significant security lapse. Google has the power to push broad fixes to mitigate this, and the intent behind the public disclosure is to push them to make real changes, beyond minor cosmetic documentation changes. I appreciate Google’s promptness in triaging the issue, however following their own best practice of 90 days to remediate issues, on today, the 134th day, this issue is now public. Below is a video that goes into a few more details:<br>

<p>The second set in The Moronobu Duo is based on the 17th-century work of Hishikawa Moronobu. This set is extracted from 東海道分間絵図 (A Charted Map of the Tōkaidō). Whereas Gansai was ink and watercolor washes, this set is firmly in Hishikawa’s wheelhouse, a solid example of the ukiyo-e (浮世絵) woodblock work he made famous. This is a great set to construct your perfect Japan-inspired fantasy map covering a range of objects.</p>

<p>The first set in a planned duo is based on 東海道分間絵図 or Map of the Tōkaidō, a 17th-century watercolor map painted enormous scrolls by Hishikawa Moronobu. My most extensive set to date, over 1140 brushes, allows for the creation of works that feel more like picturesque landscapes that stand apart from typical fantasy maps. It is a unique approach to any fantasy map and perfect if you’re looking to create something that evokes an elegant Edo-Period style.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="https://kmalexander.com/2023/07/13/kensett-a-free-19th-century-urban-cartography-brush-set-for-fantasy-maps/">Kensett: A 19th Century Urban Cartography Brush Set</a></strong></h3>



<p>This is a unique urban cartography brush set based on Thomas Kensett’s “A plan of the town of New Haven” from 1806, based on James Wadsworth’s survey from 1748. It’s a comprehensive set with hundreds of houses, their lots, land, inhabitants, and various outbuildings. The style is charming and unique and perfect if you’re looking to map a village or a small town.</p>

<p>This small set of twelve wind directions and a large globe is taken from Claudius Ptolemy’s geographical account published in 1525 for Johann Koberger by Johann Grüninger. <strong>The link above will download the file.</strong> (I didn’t announce this one with a blog post.)

<p>This cartography brush set was extracted from four woodblock print maps coming from&nbsp;廣東輿圖&nbsp;(Map of Guangdong), an atlas and gazetteer depicting the various settlements and locations of the Chinese province of&nbsp;Guangdong during the&nbsp;Qing dynasty. It’s a fantastic collection with mountain-profile signs and symbols rendered in a Chinese-calligraphy aesthetic, but the rough woodblock printing technique gives the whole set a lived-in feel that helps it stand out.</p>

<h3><a href="https://kmalexander.com/2022/11/10/ishikawa-a-free-17th-century-brush-set-for-fantasy-maps/"><strong>Ishikawa: A Free 17th Century Cartography Brush Set</strong></a></h3>



<p>This is an enormous cartography brush set based on 日本海山潮陸圖 (Map of Sea, Mountain, Tide, and Land of Japan) by Ishikawa Ryūsen depicting the Japanese islands of Honshū, Shikoku, and Kyūshu during the Edo Period. For the most part, this is a hill-profile set with its unique style from the almost kanji-inspired flora to the elegant, calligraphic mountains. Still, more modern iconographic touches for settlements and points of interest exist. We end up with a fascinating hybrid style, not precisely hill-profile and yet not thoroughly “modern.” A great set that will help your fantasy maps stand apart.</p>

<p>This is an extensive cartography brush set based on the first plate of de Fer’s&nbsp;<em>Le Cours de Missisipi, ou de St. Louis</em>, an early 18th-century map depicting headwaters of the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes region. The source map isn’t as accurate as other maps from the period. Still, like his other work, de Fer’s artistic ability shines as he goes into extensive detail, creating a unique art piece with signs and symbols that stand apart from others and work exceptionally well for fantasy maps.</p>

<p>This extensive battlefield brush set is based on de Fer’s <em>Le Combat de Leuze ou de la Catoire</em>, a late 17th-century map depicting the fortification of the Belgium city of Leuze-en-Hainaut in 1691, and the Battle of Leuze, a French calvary victory from the Nine Years’ War. It’s full of the sort of stuff that makes these maps fascinating, charging cavalry units, stalwart pike men, soldiers, explosions, battles, villages, and more. Perfect to add a bit of narrative drama to your fantasy maps.</p>

<p>This 18th-century settlement set is the first in a series coming from French cartographer Nicolas de Fer who eventually became the official geographer to the Spanish and the French court. This set comes from La Banlieue De Paris, an 18th-century map of the homes, towns, and villages that filled the Parisian countryside. Filled with lots of interesting little details, this set should work alongside any of my previous brush sets and allow a bit of variety to your fantasy map settlements.</p>

<p>This mountain-focused set is my first taken from 19th-Century sources, and as one would imagine, it’s a hybrid of more modern styles paired with older topographical landforms. Based on an 1828 map of the road from Lhasa, Tibet, to Chengdu, China. The source was created by the archimandrite monk Nikita Bichurin who took on the monastic name “Hyacinth”—hence the name. This set serves as another transitional example of cartographic evolution. One can see the hill profile approach to elevation, but the landforms are beginning to adopt some of the aspects commonly found in hachure relief—a refreshingly different approach to landforms.</p>

<p>Little different from my other sets, Ende is a 17th/18th century hatch-style paint-in littoral edger for your fantasy maps allowing you to quickly paint in your coastlines. Ende will work best when placed on its own layer behind an opaque “landmass” layer. It’s designed to be a base point. I recommend adding noise, applying some texture, or using subtle distortion to rough them up. That way, they’ll fit whatever aesthetic you’re looking to achieve.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="https://kmalexander.com/2020/10/21/homann-a-free-18th-century-cartography-brush-set-for-fantasy-maps/">Homann: A Free 18th Century Cartography Brush Set</a></strong></h3>



<p>This set comes from L’Isle de Cadix du Detroit de Gibraltar, a 1788 map of the Strait of Gibraltar, by Johann Baptist Homann, a prolific German geographer, cartographer, and wig-haver. The OG map it comes from is pretty unique as it mixes many different styles. So the set is also a bit eclectic. It’s partly a battlefield set with fortresses, defensive positions, towns, camps, and unit locations. It’s partly cartographic, with mountains, flora, and even agriculture represented. It’s partly nautical with anchorages and sounding markers. It should work well alongside my other sets.</p>

<p>This fuzzy-caterpillar/hachure set comes from L’estremadura Di Portogallo, a 1775 map of southern Portugal created by Italian cartographer Antonio Zatta as part of his&nbsp;<em>Atlante Novissimo</em>. This transitory set, sitting somewhere between hill-profile and top-down hachure design, is perfect for flintlock fantasy, steampunk, or anything that sits on that historical edge between the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>

<p>This is a topographical brush set with a nautical focus based on Johannes Janssonius’ 1650 nautical chart of the Bay of Bengal. Along with the standard symbols of settlements, flora, and landforms, I’ve also made sure to incorporate a whole host of maritime signs—rocks, sounding marks, shallows, and a whole bunch more. It’ll be handy if you’re telling a tale set on the high seas or want to add a flash of authenticity to the coasts of your map.</p>

<p>A topographic set based on the <em>Archiducatus Austriae inferioris</em>, an incredibly detailed map of lower Austria created by Georg Matthäus Vischer in 1697. The unique style features a few stylistic touches that help set it apart. Hills do double duty serving as forests, and most of the cities, towns, and villages are rendered quite intricately, giving each its own unique look.</p>

<p>The brushes within this set are based on the incredible work of Georg Braun taken from his <em>Civitates orbis terrarum</em>—easily one of the most significant volumes of cartographic antiquity featuring bird’s eye maps of over five hundred and forty Renaissance cities. The detail and density represented in these symbols give an extra layer of texture and are perfect for the right fantastical city map.</p>

<p>My first brush set focusing on creating realistic maps for fantastical urban environments! Gomboust is a huge set, and its symbols are extracted from Jacques Gomboust’s 1652 map of Paris. The style is detailed yet quirky, isometric yet off-kilter, and it brings a lot of personality to a project.</p>

<p>Based on Eugene Henry Fricx’s “Cartes des Paysbas et des Frontieres de France,” this set leans into its 1727 gothic styling and its focus on the developed rather than the natural. It’s hauntingly familiar yet strikingly different.</p>

<p>This set has quickly become a favorite, and it’s perfect for a wide variety of projects. The brushes are taken from 1746’s A Map of the British Empire in America by Henry Popple, and it has a fresh style that does a fantastic job capturing the wildness of a frontier. Plus, it has swamps! And we know swamps have become a necessity in fantasy cartography.</p>

<p>While not my most extensive set (a little over one hundred brushes), Donia boasts one of the more unique takes on settlements from the 17th century. If you’re looking for flora, I suggest checking out other sets, but if you want to pay attention to your map’s cities, towns, castles, churches, towers, forts, and even fountains, this is the right set for you.</p>

Elegant and nuanced, everything works within a system, but nearly every sign is unique.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In 2005, federal law compelled retailers nationwide <a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(06)00633-6/fulltext">to move pseudoephedrine</a>, sold as Sudafed, from over-the-counter (OTC) to behind it, so as to combat its use in making illicit methamphetamine. This move <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/a-popular-decongestant-doesnt-work-what-does1/">changed the formulas</a> of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stuffy-noses-are-miserable-these-nasal-congestion-treatments-actually-work/">cough and cold medicines</a> in the U.S.. It also led me and my colleague Leslie Hendeles to prove that pseudoephedrine’s replacement, oral phenylephrine, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/a-popular-decongestant-doesnt-work-what-does1/">was ineffective as a decongestant</a>.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">We petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) twice, yet it took the agency more than a decade and a half to act&nbsp;on our findings. In September, an agency advisory panel finally <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/172701/download">agreed with our conclusion</a> that this compound did little to quell congestion and recommended that products containing it be pulled from shelves. If FDA acts on this recommendation, oral phenylephrine could be the first OTC drug approved under the agency’s “monograph” process to be discontinued. But in the meantime, millions of people have been trusting the FDA’s OTC regulatory process to ensure that medications work, but instead&nbsp;have been wasting money for nearly two decades on <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fda-warns-parents-not-to-give-tots-cold-and-cough-drugs/">ones that don’t</a>.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">FDA regulation of OTC medications with older ingredients needs to change. In the process of figuring out that oral phenylephrine doesn’t work, we’ve also spotlighted a loophole in FDA’s regulatory process that must be fixed so that people can trust not just recent over-the-counter approvals, but historic ones as well.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Once pseudoephedrine was moved behind the counter in the 2000s, that left phenylephrine as the only remaining oral decongestant sold on the shelves of pharmacies, grocery stores, convenience stores and other retail outlets. Makers of oral decongestants and cold remedies reformulated their products to contain phenylephrine, sold as Sudafed PE, among others, instead of pseudoephedrine.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Phenylephrine products went from few to many.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">I learned that customers did not recognize that these products had been reformulated. Consumers complained to their pharmacists when Sudafed PE did not work like the “old” Sudafed. Those pharmacists contacted me at the University of Florida (UF) drug information service, a laboratory for doctor of pharmacy students that teaches them how to receive, research and answer drug-related questions. They asked us: Does oral phenylephrine work? If so, what is the correct dose?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">My students and I searched the literature. We located an article <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7507590/">by Hendeles, published in 1993</a>. He was reporting on well-done but unpublished studies from before 1971 by Hylan Bickerman of Columbia University that showed phenylpropanolamine, a common oral decongestant at the time, worked, as did another compound called pseudoephedrine, but oral phenylephrine did not. Hendeles’ paper did not get much attention since phenylephrine wasn’t widely used in the 1990s. However, roughly 10 years later, it was suddenly important.</p><figure data-original-class="image-captioned" data-block="sciam/image"><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/GettyImages-1676556101.jpg?w=2000" target="_blank"><img alt="Cold and flu medicine sits on a store shelf " decoding="async" height="1303" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/GettyImages-1676556101.jpg?w=900" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/GettyImages-1676556101.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/GettyImages-1676556101.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/GettyImages-1676556101.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/GettyImages-1676556101.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/GettyImages-1676556101.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/GettyImages-1676556101.jpg?w=1350 1350w" width="2000"></a>
<figcaption>Cold and flu medicine sits on a store shelf on September 12, 2023 in Miami, Florida. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel announced that an ingredient in many over-the-counter cold and allergy medications called phenylephrine doesn’t work to get rid of nasal congestion and that the decongestant was no more effective than a placebo. Credit: <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/cold-and-flu-medicine-sits-on-a-store-shelf-on-september-12-news-photo/1676556101">Joe Raedle/Getty Images</a></figcaption></figure><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">I contacted Hendeles and he and I decided to get to the bottom of whether oral phenylephrine worked. Before the FDA required that drugs had to be proven effective, it determined whether OTC drugs were effective through expert panels that reviewed existing data. These <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/otc-drug-review-process-otc-drug-monographs">OTC monographs</a> establish what older OTC ingredients can be marketed without FDA approval.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The oral decongestant monograph panel reviewed a few published studies and multiple unpublished studies for phenylephrine. Of the unpublished studies, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2006.03.002">only four studies showed oral phenylephrine was effective, while seven showed it was no better than placebo</a>. We requested copies of all evidence used by the nasal decongestant review panel via a Freedom of Information Act request and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis ourselves.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1345/aph.1h679">Our findings</a> validated the concerns from the Bickerman study and the pharmacists’ calls to UF. Interestingly, we found that one commercial laboratory gave strikingly positive results for oral phenylephrine’s efficacy. The low variability of the data, a lack of increasing effect with an increased dose and the lack of a placebo response prompted us to look at the data more closely. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.3842">A statistical analysis</a> of this laboratory’s data suggested integrity issues; normal variation of measurements should have a typical distribution from zero to nine for the last digit, but here nearly a quarter of all observations ended with a five. Such anomalies occur when data are falsified. We were confident then that oral phenylephrine did not work.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">We then naively contacted the FDA to inform them of what we had found. They were not interested. Oral phenylephrine was not harming anyone, so they saw no need to limit sales. FDA uses a risk-based approach to regulatory actions because they have limited resources, so the relative safety of oral phenylephrine relegated it to the back burner despite its ineffectiveness. So, we took the political route, contacting then-congressman Henry Waxman, whose committee at the time had FDA oversight. Waxman’s office wrote four letters imploring the agency to reconsider oral phenylephrine’s effectiveness.

<figcaption>Credit: Amanda Montañez; Source: Randy Hatton</figcaption></figure><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The FDA has multiple regulatory processes for different types of medicinal compounds. People are perhaps most familiar with the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/new-drug-application-nda">New Drug Application process</a>, which leads to clinical trials for prescription drug approvals. However, many OTC or nonprescription drugs are regulated differently. In fact, a law passed in 1951, the Durham-Humphrey Amendment to the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, created the categories of prescription and nonprescription drugs. In 1962, the act was amended again so that drugs had to be shown to be effective, hence the requirement for well-done clinical trials.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">But what about the drugs that were approved before 1962? This is the loophole that some OTC drugs fall through. For prescription drugs, FDA tried to address pre-1962 approvals through a review of over 3,000 prescription drugs. Most of those drugs have now been reviewed and addressed, but there are still unapproved prescription drugs on the market today, such as an extended-release form of oral nitroglycerin.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">For nonprescription drugs, <a href="https://dps.fda.gov/omuf/monographsearch">FDA established the OTC monograph process</a> 10 years after the 1962 amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which required products not proven effective to be reconsidered. FDA formed advisory panels grouping hundreds of ingredients into 26 categories based on the products' uses. After gathering all available information, both published and unpublished, from manufacturers, the advisory panels issued final reports to FDA about whether <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/grase-what-are-grase-ingredients">these ingredients were GRASE</a> (generally recognized as safe and effective), not GRASE, or inconclusive. GRASE ingredients can be used in nonprescription drugs without FDA approval if the use matches the monograph.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/historical-status-otc-rulemakings/rulemaking-history-otc-nasal-decongestant-drug-products">monograph for OTC nasal decongestants</a> started in 1976 and <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/fedreg/fr041/fr041176/fr041176.pdf#page=134">listed three effective oral decongestants: phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, and pseudoephedrine</a>. The review took 18 years, and the final monograph was released in 1994. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/science-background-safety-phenylpropanolamine">Phenylpropanolamine was removed from the market in the 2000s, because it was associated with strokes</a>. It was effective—just not safe.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">At the time, most OTC nasal decongestants contained either phenylpropanolamine or pseudoephedrine—few contained oral phenylephrine, perhaps because manufacturers privately questioned its effectiveness. <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170404050459/https:/www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/minutes/2007-4335m1-Final.pdf">FDA's charge</a> for the 2007 Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee was to determine whether phenylephrine in a 10-mg immediate release formulation <em>may</em> be effective when dosed every [four] hours for symptomatic relief of nasal congestion. Although most of the committee voted that there was <em>some </em>evidence that oral phenylephrine <em>may</em> be effective, they recognized the limitations of the available evidence. They asked for new data on the absorption and efficacy of oral phenylephrine using more modern standards.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Schering-Plough, the maker of Claritin D (loratadine and pseudoephedrine), was already studying phenylephrine as an alternative oral decongestant. In addition to funding two studies that found phenylephrine was no better than placebo when patients with seasonal allergies were exposed to allergens (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60240-2">grass</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60339-0">ragweed</a>) in a controlled chamber, they funded additional research.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The oral absorption of phenylephrine is erratic. Perhaps that is why it was not used as an oral decongestant until it was the only choice. It had long been known that enzymes in the gut lining metabolized oral phenylephrine to inactive metabolites, reducing the amount of the active compound that could enter the bloodstream. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00637623">The most cited study</a> found that an oral dose of phenylephrine had an absorption rate of 38 percent of an oral dose of phenylephrine, but this study measured more than just the compound's active form. Later studies with more sensitive tests found that less than 1 percent of oral phenylephrine enters the bloodstream in an active form. Phenylephrine causes blood vessels to constrict, so if there isn’t enough of the active compound in the bloodstream, it won’t reduce the swelling of nasal blood vessels to aid in reducing nasal congestion.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">After the 2007 FDA advisory committee suggested better data on phenylephrine’s efficacy were needed, Schering-Plough funded Eli Meltzer to do <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2015.10.022">two</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2015.05.007">studies</a> showing oral phenylephrine was no better than placebo—even when using up to four times the approved dosage.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Based on Meltzer's research, we filed a second citizen's petition in 2015. The science was clear: oral phenylephrine does not work. Then, we waited. Nothing seemed to happen at FDA. We wrote an academic commentary in 2022 asking, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280221081526">Why is Oral Phenylephrine on the Market After Compelling Evidence of Its Ineffectiveness as a Decongestant?</a>”<em> </em>We did not know that with a new administration and new FDA Commissioner, the agency had already started a thorough review of all the available data.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In 2023, 16 external experts on the second Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee looked at all the evidence compiled by FDA staff, heard manufacturers’ arguments that oral phenylephrine was effective, and heard from experts like me who argued that oral phenylephrine was ineffective. In the end, they concluded that oral phenylephrine is not GRASE. A final ruling on whether these decongestants can be sold will take time. Hopefully, science will prevail.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">We’ve learned from this experience that the monograph process for OTC drugs approved before 1962 needs to be reexamined. Other nonprescription drugs like guaifenesin (sold in Mucinex and Robitussin), dextromethorphan (sold in Robitussin DM), and antihistamines for a cold like chlorpheniramine likely don't help with coughs and colds. They are usually not dangerous, but their effects are likely to be a placebo response; more modern research is needed.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The oral phenylephrine example shows that FDA needs more funding to look at these old drugs. We need public funds to support independent researchers who want to examine these products objectively. The government should be able to spend millions to save consumers billions on ineffective products. Companies that market these products have no incentive to prove they don't work. Nonprescription drugs must be effective—not just safe.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Considering all the confusion around these drugs, remember pharmacists receive considerable education on OTC drugs—more than any other health care profession. Ask your pharmacist when you have questions about which OTC products to choose. And then ask your local congressional representatives to support modern scientific reviews of these old OTC products. Your pocketbook, if not your respiratory health, will see the rewards.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><em>This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of&nbsp;</em>Scientific American.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            We introduce the Splatter Image, an ultra-fast approach for monocular 3D object reconstruction which operates at 38 FPS.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Splatter Image is based on Gaussian Splatting, which has recently brought real-time rendering, fast training, and excellent scaling to multi-view reconstruction.
            For the first time, we apply Gaussian Splatting in a monocular reconstruction setting.
            Our approach is learning-based, and, at test time, reconstruction only requires the feed-forward evaluation of a neural network.
            The main innovation of the Splatter Image is its surprisingly straightforward design: it uses a 2D image-to-image network to map the input image to one 3D Gaussian per pixel.
            The resulting Gaussians thus have the form of an image, the Splatter Image.
          </p>
          <p>
            We further extend the method to incorporate more than one image as input, which we do by adding cross-attention views.
            Owning to the speed of the renderer (588 FPS), furthermore, we can easily generate entire images during training, to optimize perceptual metrics like LPIPS.
            Furthermore, we use a single GPU for training.
            On standard benchmarks, we demonstrate not only fast reconstruction but also better results than recent and much more expensive baselines in terms of PSNR, LPIPS, and other metrics.

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The Splatter Image method uses Gaussian Splatting as the underlying 3D representation, taking advantage of its rendering quality and speed.
            It works by applying an image-to-image neural network to the input view and obtain, as output, another image that holds the parameters of one coloured 3D Gaussian per pixel.
            The resulting Gaussian mixture can be rendered very quickly into an arbitrary view of the object by using Gaussian Splatting.
            Remarkably, the 3D Gaussians in the resulting `Splatter Image' provide high-quality 360 degree reconstructions even when compared to much slower methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key challenge in using 3D Gaussians for monocular reconstruction is to design a network that takes an image of an object as input and produces as output a corresponding Gaussian mixture that represent all sides of it.
            Our key insight is that, while a Gaussian mixture is a set, i.e., an unordered collection, it can still be stored in an ordered data structure.
            Splatter Image takes advantage of this fact by using a <b>2D image</b> as container for the 3D Gaussians, so that each pixel contains in turn the parameters of one Gaussian, including its opacity, shape, and colour.

          <h3>Analysis</h3>
          <p>
              The Splatter Image represents full 360 degrees of an object despite using a 2D data structure.
              It represents unobserved object parts by allocating background pixels to appropriate 3D locations (third row) to predict occluded elements like wheels (left) or chair legs (middle). 
              Alternatively, it predicts offsets in the foreground pixels to represent occluded chair parts (right).

<p>All of the big pharmacy chains in the US hand over sensitive medical records to law enforcement without a warrant—and some will do so without even running the requests by a legal professional, according to a congressional investigation.</p>
<p>The revelation raises grave medical privacy concerns, particularly in a post-<em>Dobbs</em> era in which many states are working to criminalize reproductive health care. Even if people in states with restrictive laws cross state lines for care, pharmacists in massive chains, such as CVS, can access records across borders.</p>
<p>Lawmakers noted the pharmacies' policies for releasing medical records in <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/hhs_pharmacy_surveillance_letter_signed.pdf">a letter dated Tuesday</a> to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra. The letter—signed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), and Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.)—said their investigation pulled information from briefings with eight big prescription drug suppliers.</p>
<p>They include the seven largest pharmacy chains in the country: CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Cigna, Optum Rx, Walmart Stores, Inc., The Kroger Company, and Rite Aid Corporation. The lawmakers also spoke with Amazon Pharmacy.</p>
<p>All eight of the pharmacies said they do not require law enforcement to have a warrant prior to sharing private and sensitive medical records, which can include the prescription drugs a person used or uses and their medical conditions. Instead, all the pharmacies hand over such information with nothing more than a subpoena, which can be issued by government agencies and does not require review or approval by a judge.</p>
<p>Three pharmacies—CVS Health, The Kroger Company, and Rite Aid Corporation—told lawmakers they didn't even require their pharmacy staff to consult legal professionals before responding to law enforcement requests at pharmacy counters. According to the lawmakers, CVS, Kroger, and Rite Aid said that "their pharmacy staff face extreme pressure to immediately respond to law enforcement demands and, as such, the companies instruct their staff to process those requests in store."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The rest of the pharmacies—Amazon, Cigna, Optum Rx, Walmart, and Walgreens Boots Alliance—at least require that law enforcement requests be reviewed by legal professionals before pharmacists respond. But, only Amazon said it had a policy of notifying customers of law enforcement demands for pharmacy records unless there were legal prohibitions to doing so, such as a gag order.</p>
<h2>HIPAA and transparency</h2>
<p>The lawmakers note that the pharmacies aren't violating regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The pharmacies pointed to language in HIPAA regulations that allow health care providers, including pharmacists, to provide medical records if required by law, with subpoenas being a sufficient legal process for such a request. However, the lawmakers note that the HHS has discretion in determining the legal standard here—that is, it has the power to strengthen the regulation to require a warrant, which the lawmakers say it should do.</p>
<p>"We urge HHS to consider further strengthening its HIPAA regulations to more closely align them with Americans’ reasonable expectations of privacy and Constitutional principles," the three lawmakers wrote.</p>
<p>They also pushed for pharmacies to do better, encouraging them to follow the lead of tech companies. "Pharmacies can and should insist on a warrant, and invite law enforcement agencies that insist on demanding patient medical records with solely a subpoena to go to court to enforce that demand. The requirement for a warrant is exactly the approach taken by tech companies to protect customer privacy." The trio noted that Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo have since 2010 required law enforcement to have a warrant to obtain customers' emails.</p>
<p>Also noting tech companies' lead, the lawmakers encouraged pharmacies to publish annual transparency reports. In the course of the investigation, only CVS Health said it planned to do so.</p>
<p>"Americans deserve to have their private medical information protected at the pharmacy counter and a full picture of pharmacies’ privacy practices, so they can make informed choices about where to get their prescriptions filled," the lawmakers wrote.</p>
<p>For now, HIPAA regulations grant patients the right to know who is accessing their health records. But, to do so, patients have to specifically request that information—and almost no one does that. "Last year, CVS Health, the largest pharmacy in the nation by total prescription revenue, only received a single-digit number of such consumer requests," the lawmakers noted.</p>
<p>"The average American is likely unaware that this is even a problem," the lawmakers said.</p>

            <p>653,000 people in the USA were homeless at the beginning of 2023 - twelve percent more than in the previous year. Many homeless people are without permanent accommodation for the first time in their lives.</p>

<p>The number of homeless people in the United States has increased dramatically. According to the authorities, 653,000 people were homeless as of January 2023, twelve percent more than at the same time last year. The federal agency US Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) cited rising rents and the decline in Corona aid payments as reasons for the sharp increase.</p><p>The United States has more homeless people than ever since the country began measuring the size of the homeless population annually in 2007. Compared to January 2022, there were 70,650 more homeless people in the USA in the following year.&nbsp;</p><p>The latest estimate suggests that much of the increase is due to people becoming homeless for the first time. The agency had noted a downward trend in family homelessness since 2012. This trend did not continue in 2023. Families now make up 28 percent of the country's homeless population .</p><p>A US study (PDF) recently showed that homelessness is increasing in the USA, particularly where people have to spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. Cities with high levels of homelessness, such as San Francisco and Boston, are among the wealthiest in the country, while the number of homeless people in the impoverished industrial city of Detroit is relatively low.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="there-is-a-lack-of-affordable-housing">There is a lack of affordable housing</h2><p>“This data underscores the urgent need to support proven solutions and strategies that help people quickly end homelessness and prevent homelessness in the first place,” Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge said of the numbers.</p><p>USICH Executive Director Jeff Olivet said coronavirus relief has delayed the rise in homelessness that is now being seen. Although there are various driving factors, the most important cause of homelessness is a lack of affordable housing. High housing costs left many Americans living paycheck to paycheck and “one crisis away from homelessness.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>A</span></span>merican taxpayers footed the bill for at least $1.8 trillion in federal and state health care expenditures in 2022 — about 41% of the nearly $4.5 trillion in both public and private health care spending the U.S. recorded last year, according to the annual report <a href="https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released last week</a> by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>On top of that $1.8 trillion, third-party programs, which are often government-funded, and public health programs accounted for another $600 billion in spending.</p>
<p>This means the U.S. government spent more on health care last year than the governments of Germany, the U.K., Italy, Spain, Austria, and France combined <a href="https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent to provide</a> universal health care coverage to the whole of their population (335 million in total), which is comparable in size to the U.S. population of <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/united-states-adult-population-grew-faster-than-nations-total-population-from-2010-to-2020.html#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20U.S.%20Census,from%20234.6%20million%20in%202010." target="_blank" rel="noopener">331 million</a>.</p>
<p>Between direct public spending and compulsory, tax-driven insurance programs, Germany spent about $380 billion in health care in 2022; France spent around $300 billion, and so did the U.K.; Italy, $147 billion; Spain, $105 billion; and Austria, $43 billion. The total, $1.2 trillion, is about two-thirds of what the U.S. government spent without offering all of its citizens the option of forgoing private insurance.</p>
		
		
<p>This isn’t an aberration. The fact that, for many years, more taxpayer dollars have gone to health care in the U.S. than in countries where the health system is actually meant to be taxpayer-funded is central to the argument made by economists Amy Finkelstein and Liran Einav in their recent book, “<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/10/23/universal-health-care-amy-finkelstein/">We’ve Got You Covered: Rebooting American Health Care</a>.”</p>
<p>“We’re already paying as taxpayers for universal basic automatic coverage, we’re just not getting it,” Finkelstein said at the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/10/23/universal-health-care-amy-finkelstein/">STAT Summit </a>this past October. “We might as well formalize and fund that commitment upfront.” The numbers in this CMS report illustrate their point: The U.S. would not need to raise taxes in order to provide basic universal coverage, since it’s already responsible for picking up a relative majority of the expenses.</p>
		
		
<p>Offering universal coverage would cut health care costs for individuals too, according to Finkelstein and Einav. That’s because people would have the choice not to purchase additional private health insurance, thereby avoiding contributions that get deducted from their paychecks as well as out-of-pocket charges. According to the latest CMS data, Americans spent $471 billion on out-of-pocket health expenses in 2022, on top of whatever they were already paying for health care coverage.</p>
<p>Overall, health care spending grew 4% in 2022 from the previous year, accounting for 17.3% of gross domestic product. The increase was largely driven by growth in Medicaid and private health insurance spending.</p>

		<p>It has been over a decade of Stratechery; this is the 11th Year in Review I have published. You can find previous years here:</p>

<p>I am both proud and grateful to have made it to this milestone. Stratechery has changed my life; I hope it has had some small impact on yours.</p>

<p>At the beginning of last year’s review I said that the biggest story in tech was the emergence of AI; I can say the exact same thing about 2023, but even more so: 12 of Stratechery’s free Weekly Articles were about AI in some way, shape, or form. The second biggest topic was a Stratechery staple: the evolving content landscape; 2023 was particularly notable, though, for the dramatic shifts that are hitting Hollywood, highlighted by both strikes and the Disney-Charter standoff this fall. There were also big stories about the tech industry itself, from a bank failure to board room drama, and a “vision” of what might come next.</p>

<p>This year Stratechery published 27 free <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/articles/">Articles</a>, 105 subsriber <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/daily-email/">Updates</a>, and 37 <a href="https://stratechery.com/topic/events/interview/">Interviews</a>. Today, as per tradition, I summarize the most popular and most important posts of the year.</p>
<h3>The Five Most-Viewed Articles</h3>
<p>The five most-viewed articles on Stratechery according to page views:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/">From Bing to Sydney</a> — Microsoft launched a new conversational UI in Bing based on GPT-4; I got early access, and discovered Sydney, and had a series of conversations that blew my mind.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-four-horsemen-of-the-tech-recession/">The Four Horsemen of the Tech Recession</a> — Tech is increasingly divorced from the real economy thanks to the COVID hangover and Apple’s App Tracking Transparency.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/openais-misalignment-and-microsofts-gain/">OpenAI’s Misalignment and Microsoft’s Gain</a> — The end of a dramatic weekend in tech is that OpenAI has split and Microsoft is partnered with one and has hired the other; this is the ultimate failure case of what should have been a for-profit company organized the wrong way.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/apple-vision/">Apple Vision</a> — Apple Vision is incredibly compelling, first as a product, and second as far as potential use cases. What it says about society, though, is a bit more pessimistic.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-death-of-silicon-valley-bank/">The End of Silicon Valley (Bank)</a> — Silicon Valley Bank bears responsibility for its demise, but it symbolizes a Silicon Valley reality that is very different from the myth — and the ultimate cause is tech itself.</li>
</ol>
<h3>AI Strategy</h3>
<p>Is AI a sustaining technology that makes existing companies stronger, or a disruptive one that leads to new entrants?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/ai-and-the-big-five/">AI and the Big Five</a> — Given the success of existing companies with new epochs, the most obvious place to start when thinking about the impact of AI is with the big five: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/google-i-o-and-the-coming-ai-battles/">Google I/O and the Coming AI Battles</a> — Google A/I suggests that AI is a sustaining innovation for all of Big Tech; that means the real battle will be between incumbents and Big Tech on one side, and open source on the other.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/windows-and-the-ai-platform-shift/">Windows and the AI Platform Shift</a> — Microsoft argued there is an AI platform shift, and the fact that Windows is interesting again — and that Apple is facing AI-related questions for its newest products — is evidence that is correct.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-openai-keynote/">The OpenAI Keynote</a> — OpenAI’s developer keynote was exciting, both because AI was exciting, and because OpenAI has the potential to be a meaningful consumer tech company.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/googles-true-moonshot/">Google’s True Moonshot</a> — Google could do more than just win the chatbot war: it is the one company that could make a universal assistant. The question is if the company is willing to risk it all.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Questions and Philosophy</h3>
<p>AI doesn’t just raise strategic questions: it raises questions about the nature of computing, the future of society, and what it means to be human.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-learns-computing/">ChatGPT Gets a Computer</a> — It’s possible that large language models are more like the human brain than we thought, given that it is about prediction; that is why ChatGPT needs its own computer in the form of plug-ins.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/ai-nil-and-zero-trust-authenticity/">AI Philosophy</a> — AI-generated content is not going to harm those with the capability of breaking through: it will make them stronger, aided by Zero Trust Authenticity.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/">Nvidia On the Mountaintop</a> — Nvidia has gone from the valley to the mountain-top in less than a year, thanks to ChatGPT and the frenzy it inspired; whether or not there is a cliff depends on developing new kinds of demand that only GPUs can fulfill.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/ai-hardware-and-virtual-reality/">AI, Hardware, and Virtual Reality</a> — Defining virtual reality as being about hardware is to miss the point: virtual reality is AI, and hardware is an (essential) means to an end.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/regretful-accelerationism/">Regretful Accelerationism</a> — The Internet removed constraints from the analog world, and AI is finishing the job. That this may be the final blow for the Internet as a source for truth may ultimately be for the best.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Streaming and Hollywood</h3>
<p>While the past, present, and future of content has always been a focus of Stratechery, this year felt like a tipping point for Hollywood in particular.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/netflixs-new-chapter/">Netflix’s New Chapter</a> — Netflix waited out Blockbuster with better economics, and it’s seeking to do the same with its competitors today; the key to the company’s differentiation, though, is increasingly creativity, not execution.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-unified-content-business-model/">The Unified Content Business Model</a> — Every content company is or should be moving to a model that incorporates both subscriptions and ads; creator platforms should help their publishers do the same.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/hollywood-on-strike/">Hollywood on Strike</a> — The Hollywood strike is setting talent against studios, but the problem is that both are jointly threatened by the reality of the Internet and zero distribution costs.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/disneys-taylor-swift-era/">Disney’s Taylor Swift Era</a> — Not even Taylor Swift can fight the devaluation of recorded music, but she makes it up in physical experiences; Disney isn’t much different, but it looks much worse given the company’s old business model.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-rise-and-fall-of-espns-leverage/">The Rise and Fall of ESPN’s Leverage</a> — Charting ESPN’s rise, including how it build leverage over the cable TV providers, and its ongoing decline, caused by the Internet <em>(See also: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/charter-disney-winners-and-losers/">Charter-Disney Winners and Losers</a>)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Regulation</h3>
<p>It is, for better or worse, impossible to cover technology without discussing regulation, and 2023 was no different.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/amazon-friction-and-the-ftc/">Amazon, Friction, and the FTC</a> — The FTC’s Amazon complaint raises some fair points in isolation, but misses the bigger picture, both in terms of Amazon specifically and the Internet generally.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/ftc-sues-amazon-fba-and-prime-pricing-punishment/">FTC Sues Amazon</a> — The FTC is suing Amazon, and some of the complaints are compelling, but ultimately not convincing.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/china-chips-and-moores-law/">China Chips and Moore’s Law</a> — Moore’s Law is not yet dead, nor is Moore’s Precept, even if AI computes differently. Addressing both is the key to succeeding with the China chip ban.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/attenuating-innovation-ai/">Attenuating Innovation (AI)</a> — Innovation required humility about the future and openness to what might be possible; Biden’s executive order proscribing AI development is the opposite, blocking progress and hindering the solutions to our greatest challenges.</li>
</ul>

Historically, pumped storage systems have been the main form of energy storage, but battery storage systems have become increasingly common as costs have fallen.</p><p>The operators of interconnectors and energy storage systems earn a profit from the difference in electricity prices between countries or over time, while increasing the resilience of energy supply and helping to stabilise prices as demand and generation fluctuate.</p>"></span></dt>

            The rise of wind
          </h2>
          <p>
            Great Britain’s exposed position in the north-east Atlantic makes it one of the best locations in the world for wind power, and the shallow waters of the North Sea host several of the world’s largest offshore wind farms.
          </p>
          <p>
            New wind power records are set regularly, and between 9:30am and 10:00am on 21st December 2023 British wind farms averaged a record 21.84GW of generation.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><br>
Researchers at <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> (LLNL) have developed a modeling tool for assessing the potential use of a nuclear device to defend the planet against catastrophic asteroid impacts.</p>

<p>The research, <a href="https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ad0838__;!!G2kpM7uM-TzIFchu!xjlOpdYnU_U7w6iEGrT7fMBC50wwbOh6jBgdneZS2RbFIBes6tgXL_o_0SWnZPZqE17LaMOaFFBd7RUD1Z8-rR02$" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published today in the Planetary Science Journal</a>, introduces a novel approach to simulating the energy deposition from a nuclear device on an asteroid's surface. This new tool improves our understanding of the nuclear deflection's radiation interactions on the asteroid's surface while opening the door to new research on the shockwave dynamics affecting the inner asteroid.</p>

<p>This model will allow researchers to build upon the insights gained from <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-defense-dart/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NASA’s recent Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission</a>, <a id="_Int_tW0xGMxZ">where</a>, in September 2022, a kinetic impactor was deliberately crashed into an asteroid to alter its trajectory. However, with limitations in the mass that can be lifted to space, scientists continue to explore nuclear deflection as a viable alternative to kinetic impact missions.</p>

<p>Nuclear devices have the highest ratio of energy density per unit of mass of any human technology, making them an invaluable tool in mitigating asteroid threats, said LLNL physicist Mary Burkey, who led the research.</p>

<figure><p><a href="https://contenthub.llnl.gov/sites/contenthub/files/2023-12/Burkey_AsteroidSim_4-Panel_1000px2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://contenthub.llnl.gov/sites/contenthub/files/styles/scaled_400h/public/2023-12/Burkey_AsteroidSim_4-Panel_1000px2.jpg?itok=mNN80_uN" alt="Burkey_AsteroidSim_4-Panel" title="Burkey_AsteroidSim_4-Panel"></a>
</p>
<figcaption>A modeling tool developed by scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory shows the progression an asteroid being broken up by a theoretical nuclear device detonated near the the surface of the near-Earth object. Graphic illustration courtesy of Mary Burkey.</figcaption></figure><p>“If we have enough warning time, we could potentially launch a nuclear device, sending it millions of miles away to an asteroid that is headed toward Earth,” Burkey said. “We would then detonate the device and either deflect the asteroid, keeping it intact but providing a controlled push away from Earth, or we could disrupt the asteroid, breaking it up into small, fast-moving fragments that would also miss the planet.”</p>

<p>Accurate predictions for the effectiveness of nuclear deflection missions rely on sophisticated multiphysics simulations, Burkey said, explaining that LLNL simulation models cover a wide range of physical factors, which makes them complex and computationally demanding.</p>

<p>The paper introduces an efficient and accurate library of X-ray energy deposition functions, developed using the Kull radiation-hydrodynamics code. High-fidelity simulations tracked photons penetrating surfaces of asteroid-like materials such as rock, iron, and ice, while accounting for more complex processes, such as reradiation. The model also considers a diverse set of initial conditions, including different porosities, source spectra, radiation fluences, source durations, and angles of incidence. This comprehensive approach makes the model applicable to a wide range of potential asteroid scenarios.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Should a real planetary defense emergency arise, high-fidelity simulation modeling will be critical in providing decision-makers with actionable, risk-informed information that could prevent asteroid impact, protect essential infrastructure and save lives, explained Megan Bruck Syal, LLNL’s planetary defense project lead.</p>

<p>“While the probability of a large asteroid impact during our lifetime is low, the potential consequences could be devastating,”&nbsp;Bruck Syal said.</p>

<p>Led by Burkey, LLNL’s research team included co-authors Robert Managan, Nicholas Gentile, Bruck Syal, Kirsten Howley and Joseph Wasem.</p>

<p>The planetary defense group at LLNL works on a variety of projects in collaboration with research institutions, including Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, NASA Planetary Defense Coordination Office, NASA Goddard, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA Ames and the U.S. Geological Survey.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="the-introduction">The Introduction</h2><p>So I saw a post today, and it’s so wrong I was about to post a ranty missive on
Hacker News.</p><p>But my ranty missives get long, so here’s a blog post instead.</p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Code is an asset, and tech debt is when the software <em>and its
internal model</em> do not match the problem and the mental model, or when the
internal interfaces do not minimize assumptions.</p><h2 id="the-post">The Post</h2><p>The post is <a href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/all-code-is-technical-debt">“All Code Is Technical Debt”</a> written by <a href="https://www.tokyodev.com/authors/paul-mcmahon">Paul McMahon</a>.</p><p>And everything is just <em>slightly</em> wrong, starting from the title.</p><p>So let’s break it down.</p><h2 id="the-thesis">The Thesis</h2><p>Paul’s thesis is at the end of his introduction:</p><blockquote><p>As the more code you add to an application, the slower development becomes, I
view all code as technical debt.</p></blockquote><p>But is this true? Does development speed always get slower if you add code?</p><p>Let’s look at the corollary: does development speed always get faster if you
<em>remove</em> code?</p><p>That is false on its face!</p><p>One of the reasons people don’t like C (besides <a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2023/02/why-i-use-c-when-i-believe-in-memory-safety/">memory bugs</a>) is its paltry
standard library! C is basically the extreme of “remove code,” and I can tell
you from experience that its tiny standard library slows development.</p><p>I’ve spent about <a href="https://git.yzena.com/Yzena/Yc/commit/8b803cf03f98b3864">7 years</a> building my own C libraries as a replacement.</p><p>So if the corollary is not true, is the thesis?</p><p><strong>It is absolutely not true.</strong></p><p>Take <a href="https://git.gavinhoward.com/gavin/bc/commit/1ead5b9652a1be00">this commit</a> from my <a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2023/02/my-code-conquered-another-os/">most famous</a> <a href="https://git.gavinhoward.com/gavin/bc">project</a>.</p><p>In that commit, I am adding three, <em>three!</em>, new keywords and commands to <code>bc</code>
<em>and</em> <code>dc</code>.</p><p>For that commit, I deleted 7 lines and added 108.</p><p>More accurately, I changed 7 lines and added 101.</p><p>That means I deleted an average of 1 line per keyword <em>per program</em>, and added
an average of 18 lines per keyword per program.</p><p>Okay, let’s see how much of that code exists 537 commits later.</p><p>To get the 537 number, I ran <code>git rev-list 1ead5b96..HEAD | wc -l</code>.</p><p>I ran blames and took out whitespace-only code style fixes. Of the 108 lines,
77 still exist. That’s 71.2%.</p><p>And most of the ones that changed were numbers or other data that got changed
when I added <em>other</em> keywords.</p><p>But the other key is how <em>easy</em> it was to add those features; even if we count
both programs together, adding a keyword took me 36 lines. That’s easy to
review, easy to test, and easy to change. It’s like technical debt does not
exist.</p><p>“Okay, Gavin, but what does that have to do with Paul’s thesis?”</p><p>Paul’s point is that adding code is always more technical debt. He said,</p><blockquote><p>When you’re first building out an application, you can develop new features at
incredible speed. There’s no need to worry about the impact on existing users.
You can just focus on implementing new features.</p><p>However, as an application matures, development speed will inevitably slow
down. On a poorly implemented product, development speed slows down quickly.
But even on a beautifully implemented one, development speed still slows down
over time.</p></blockquote><p>But that was not the case for these three features. They took me about two hours
<em>total</em>, including testing!</p><p>This was <em>not</em> the case when I started; I could take <em>weeks</em> to add just <em>one</em>
new feature!</p><p>So my development speed has <em>increased</em> even though my code has grown!</p><p>How much has it grown? This much:</p><p><a href="https://gavinhoward.com/img/bc_stack_plot.png"><img src="https://gavinhoward.com/img/bc_stack_plot.png" alt="Git of Theseus stack plot for bc as of Dec 20, 2023" aria-label="Git of Theseus stack plot for bc as of Dec 20, 2023"></a></p><p>And that image only counts files in <code>include/</code>, <code>src/</code>, and <code>gen/</code>. It also
excludes text files in <code>gen/</code>.</p><p>In particular, note that the only month that lost a significant amount of code
is Aug 2018, which was early.</p><p>If you were to plot the survival rates of code in <code>bc</code>, it would look like this:</p><p><a href="https://gavinhoward.com/img/bc_survival_plot1.png"><img src="https://gavinhoward.com/img/bc_survival_plot1.png" alt="Git of Theseus stack plot for bc as of Dec 20, 2023" aria-label="Git of Theseus stack plot for bc as of Dec 20, 2023"></a></p><p>And again, that only counts files in the same directories as above. If you plot
the survival rate for the entire repo, you’ll get this:</p><p><a href="https://gavinhoward.com/img/bc_survival_plot2.png"><img src="https://gavinhoward.com/img/bc_survival_plot2.png" alt="Second Git of Theseus stack plot for bc as of Dec 20, 2023" aria-label="Second Git of Theseus stack plot for bc as of Dec 20, 2023"></a></p><p>Notice that the first 40% disappeared in six months, but the next 40% is <em>still</em>
not gone more than five years later.</p><p>Also, do you see those small cliffs at various points? Those are where I did a
refactor to reduce tech debt.</p><p>There was a large cliff at the beginning because I was exploring and refactoring
as I went. I finally settled into something good after six months, but I didn’t
rest on my laurels; when I saw a problem, I fixed it.</p><p>In fact, I often <em>added</em> code to reduce tech debt.</p><p>An example is when I implemented my own <a href="https://git.gavinhoward.com/gavin/bc/src/branch/master/src/file.c">file I/O</a> in <code>bc</code>.</p><p>“Oh, Gavin…”</p><p><a href="https://media1.tenor.com/m/ofdD0cJ5xQ0AAAAC/you-are-so-dumb-you-are-really-dumb.gif"><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/ofdD0cJ5xQ0AAAAC/you-are-so-dumb-you-are-really-dumb.gif" alt="You are so dumb" aria-label="You are so dumb"></a></p><p>No I’m not.</p><p>You see, I have a built-in command-line history implementation, and that needs
raw access to the terminal for obvious reasons.</p><p>If I used the regular file I/O, it would have “worked,” but I would deal with
sticky issues between it and history.</p><p>But by implementing my own, I got rid of the sticky issues and reduced my tech
debt.</p><p><em>Adding</em> code <em>reduced</em> my tech debt.</p><p>Paul is right by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb">rule of thumb</a>, but I would rather not be ruled by
<a href="https://spykids.fandom.com/wiki/Thumb_Thumbs">thumbs</a>.</p><p>So let’s find a more precise “rule.”</p><h2 id="the-rule">The Rule</h2><p>I already <a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2022/10/technical-debt-costs-more-than-you-think-or-my-software-development-process/">came up with one</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Your software is trying to solve a problem, and every problem has an unknown
shape because <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail">reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>…</p><p><strong>Technical debt is every place where the software does not fit the
problem.</strong></p></blockquote><p>(Emphasis added.)</p><p>And it is that simple: tech debt is when your software (and the model behind it)
do not fit the problem it is trying to solve.</p><p>Well, not quite…</p><p>“Okay, Gavin, so what about our metaphor? Should we want more code or less?
Because it sure sounds like you’re advocating for more code.”</p><p>Nah, less code <em>is</em> better, all else being equal. But “all else equal” is
lottery-rare.</p><p>That’s not to say that “less code equals better” is <em>also</em> rare; it’s not.</p><p>I would like to propose a different metaphor: code/software is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset"><em>asset</em></a>.</p><p>“Well, what’s tech debt, then?”</p><p>Patience.</p><p>If I’m going to go all in on financial terms, let’s add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)">liabilities</a>:</p><dl><dt>Liability</dt><dd><p>The quantity of value that a[n]…entity owes.</p></dd></dl><p>As a programmer, you owe the ability to solve a problem. Anything in the code
that doesn’t solve the problem is part of that liability.</p><p>So technical <em>debt</em> is really <em>code liability</em>.</p><p>“That’s stupid, Gavin; assets can’t be liabilities, so your metaphor is wrong.”</p><p>True, assets cannot be liabilities, but they <em>can</em> have liabilities attached to
them.</p><p>For example, say I buy a car with financing; that debt is a <em>liability</em> even
though the car itself is an <em>asset</em>, and that liability is attached to the car.</p><p>In like manner, code as an asset can have a liability attached that lessens the
value of the asset.</p><p>It goes further: you can be <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwater.asp">“underwater”</a> on an asset. This means that your
asset may be worth <em>less</em> than the liability attached to it.</p><p>You can experience this with code as well; when development slows to a crawl,
you’ve gone under.</p><p>It can happen in two ways: the problem changes (your liability increases) or
your software becomes less useful (your asset <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation">depreciates</a>).</p><p>Yep, I’m <em>still</em> going on the financial metaphors.</p><p>“How can software depreciate, Gavin? It’s just code.”</p><p><em><strong><code>node_modules</code> enters the chat</strong></em></p><p>If its environment changes, it may not run. And software that won’t run has
depreciated to nothing.</p><p>This is <em>another</em> reason <a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2023/02/why-i-use-c-when-i-believe-in-memory-safety/">I choose C</a>: the environment does not change.</p><p>“But that doesn’t explain your supposed ‘zero’ code liability, Gavin.”</p><p>You’re partially right. I do keep up to date on the problem, and I do update my
software to fit the problem.</p><h2 id="the-interfaces">The Interfaces</h2><p>But that is not the only reason I have nigh nil code liability and why you do
not.</p><p>Paul says, <a href="https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/all-code-is-technical-debt#adding-new-assumptions-increases-debt">“Adding new assumptions increases debt,”</a> and in this, he is
correct.</p><p>But he is assuming that adding features requires adding assumptions. If you
create and use interfaces properly, few to no new assumptions are necessary.</p><p>Don’t believe me?</p><p>Remember that I added keywords to my <code>bc</code>; all three needed <em>zero</em> additional
assumptions.</p><p>The parsing followed the existing assumptions of the parser (parse up to the
character you need and no more) and the existing assumption of the virtual
machine (remove operands from the results stack and replace them with the
result).</p><p>“But that’s just because you were making a programming language and could make
easy assumptions!”</p><p>Uh, this programming language is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness"><em>Turing-complete!</em></a> That is the very
<em>definition</em> of <strong>hard</strong> in programming. It’s also hard to making a programming
language match the problem it is made to solve.</p><div><p>And I have pulled off the same thing in a larger language with <em>user-defined
keywords</em> and <em>user-defined lexers!</em></p><p>Coming soon…</p></div><p>To wit: <strong>your interfaces should minimize assumptions</strong>.</p><p>Or in other words, the code’s internal model (assumptions) needs to match the
internal interfaces.</p><p>I do this by:</p><ul><li>Never programming past my limited ability.</li><li>Strictly documenting interfaces, including preconditions and postconditions.</li><li>Strictly programming to those interfaces, adjusting one or the other as
necessary.</li><li>Iterating until the interfaces are close to perfect.</li></ul><p>I know I have succeeded when those interfaces make it easy to add stuff without
intefering with other features.</p><h2 id="the-model">The Model</h2><p>And yet, that is <em>still</em> not enough.</p><p>The last way software can have a liability is that it doesn’t match the model.</p><p>The <em>mental</em> model.</p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/onlurking/fc5c81d18cfce9ff81bc968a7f342fb1">“Programming as Theory Building”</a> (<a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf">original</a>) is a famous essay (which
you should go read <em>right now!</em>) that uses the word <em>theory</em> for this concept,
but it is the same concept.</p><p>Whatever the term, the model/theory is the software as it exists in the minds of
those who create and use it.</p><p>Of course, the mental model will be inaccurate; if it wasn’t, we would never
have bugs, so the <em>other</em> form of code liability is when the software is
different from the mental model.</p><p>I fix this by testing, testing, testing. I fuzz with a crash-happy build, and I
fix every bug.</p><p>“But how does that improve your mental model?”</p><p>Because for me, one of the definitions of a bug is a <em>mismatch between my mental
model and the reality of the software</em>.</p><p>So when I fix a bug, I’m bring my model and the reality closer together. And I
do this until they are in harmony.</p><p>Sometimes, this includes changing my mental model when the reality is better.</p><h2 id="the-bloat">The Bloat</h2><p>In addition, unneeded bloat is also code liability.</p><p>All code has a cost because assets have to be maintained, so extra code will
have a higher maintenance cost than necessary.</p><p>I regularly look for code to purge.</p><h2 id="the-prevention">The Prevention</h2><p>I also do one more thing that almost no developer does: I actually <em>design</em> my
code before I ever start coding.</p><p>In other words, I build a mental model, including the problem that the software
solves, before I start.</p><p>This keeps my coding laser-focused on its purpose and helps me prevent
divergence between reality and model.</p><p>Of course, I do have to update the initial model, but an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure.</p><p>And <em>that</em> is how I smash code liability.</p><h2 id="the-other-points">The Other Points</h2><p>I guess I should respond to Paul’s other points.</p><p>Yes, that is true, and that matches with my metaphor.</p><p>A feature that does not match the problem has negative value, but it is still
an <em>asset</em>, just a bad one, like a junker car.</p><p>In the real world, assets can <em>also</em> be a poor match for their purpose, such as
the <a href="https://simpleflying.com/airbus-a380-programme-cancelled/">Airbus A380</a>.</p><p>Yes, that is true.</p><p>Code that does not match the problem has negative value.</p><p>You heard that right: this is just a restatement of of <strong>“Features can have
negative value.”</strong></p><p>This is also mostly true.</p><p>This is why I’m bullish on keeping code liability to a minimum from the start;
if I ruthlessly prune features before they can entrench themselves, this
terrible fact is not a fact for me.</p><p>I suggest you do the same if you can while still meeting your business goals.</p><p>Well, yes, but this is also like saying “to avoid missing in basketball, don’t
shoot.”</p><p>Code is an asset, but you need assets to do stuff.</p><p>Just remember that assets need maintenance to remain above water. Write code to
solve problems, and make sure that code matches the problem. Maintain it to keep
it that way.</p><p>Yes, this is great advice; it is the same advice I gave above about assumptions,
although you should change bad assumptions if you can.</p><h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2><p>Tech debt and code liability are hotly debated, so let me throw out my opinion:</p><ul><li>Code is an asset.</li><li>Code can have a liability attached, which can be one or more of:<ul><li>When the code does not match the problem.</li><li>When the code’s internal model does not match the problem.</li><li>When the code’s internal model does not match the mental model of users
and programmers.</li><li>When the code’s internal model does not match the code’s internal
interfaces.</li><li>And yes, when there is more code than necessary to match the problem.</li></ul></li><li>You can be underwater on code; this is when development stalls.</li><li>Thus, code must be maintained, just like any other asset.</li></ul><p>Am I right? Well, I’ll leave that for you to decide.</p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38717873">Let the debate rage on!</a></p><hr><p><strong>Edit (2023-12-21)</strong>: Added “The Bloat” section based on Hacker News comments.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>PDF Parsing: Utilizes GROBID for efficient text extraction from PDFs.</li>
<li>Chunking Algorithm: Custom-built algorithm for optimal text chunking. Chunks by logical section (intro, abstract, authors, etc.) and also utilizes recursive subdivision chunking (chunk at 512 characters, then 256, then 128...)</li>
<li>Text Embedding: Uses Cohere's EmbedV3 model for accurate text embeddings.</li>
<li>Vector Database Integration: Uses Pinecone for storing and querying embeddings. This also functions to cache research papers so a paper only ever needs to be embedded once.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>It was the late 1980s when Gary Mund felt his pinky tremble. At first it seemed like a random occurrence, but pretty quickly he realized something was seriously wrong.</p><p>Within two years, Mund — a crew worker with the Eastern Municipal Water District in Riverside County — was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The illness would eventually consume much of his life, clouding his speech, zapping most of his motor skills and taking away his ability to work and drive. </p><p>“It sucks,” said Mund, 69. He speaks tersely, because every word is a hard-won battle. “I was told the herbicide wouldn’t hurt you.”</p><p>The herbicide is paraquat, an extremely powerful weed killer that Mund sprayed on vegetation as part of his job from about 1980 to 1985. Mund contends the product is responsible for his disease, but the manufacturer denies there is a causal link between the chemical and Parkinson’s.</p><div data-click="enhancement"

and multiple different investigators in multiple different locations — that have found that paraquat, when fed to laboratory animals, reproduces the features of Parkinson’s disease,” Dorsey said. </p><p>He said that paraquat has been shown to damage mitochondria — the energy-producing components of cells — and damaged mitochondria have been implicated in the likely environmental and genetic causes of Parkinson’s. </p><p>He referenced an oft-cited 2011 study funded by the National Institutes of Health that found a <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1002839" target="_blank">strong association</a> between Parkinson’s and paraquat. It found that workers exposed to paraquat had a 250% greater risk of getting Parkinson’s disease than people not exposed to the chemical. “Because paraquat remains one of the most widely used herbicides worldwide, this finding potentially has great public health significance,” the study concluded. </p><p>Currently, an estimated <a href="https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/statistics" target="_blank">1 million people</a> in the United States are living with Parkinson’s disease, which has no known cure. California is home to a high incidence of cases, with large clusters found in agricultural regions where herbicides are heavily used, including Kern, Kings, Merced and San Joaquin counties, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-022-00410-y" target="_blank">2022 geographic study</a>. </p><p>Dorsey and other researchers ceded that, as with cancer and other diseases, it can be difficult to isolate the precise cause of a patient’s Parkinson’s.

Syngenta reported a record <a href="https://www.syngentagroup.com/en/media/syngenta-news/year/2023/syngenta-group-reports-record-334-billion-sales-and-56-billion-ebitda" target="_blank">$33 billion in sales in 2022</a>. One leading researcher on the matter said she has been retained as a witness in pending lawsuits and so was not comfortable commenting publicly for this report. </p><div data-click="enhancement"

of the <a href="https://fixel.ufhealth.org/" target="_blank">Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases</a> at the University of Florida. “The collective evidence really points to a serious problem and an emerging association with paraquat that just keeps getting stronger and stronger over time,” said Okun, who is also a medical advisor with the Parkinson’s Foundation, a national nonprofit organization. </p><div data-with-aside="false"><p>For the record:</p><p><span>12:46 p.m. Dec. 20, 2023</span><span>An earlier version of this article said documents were unveiled as part of ongoing court proceedings in Illinois. The proceedings are in California.</span></p></div><p>Documents unveiled as part of ongoing court proceedings in  California show that Syngenta has spent decades investigating the potential side effects of its product. This research has sometimes contradicted  public statements issued  by the company, a difference first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/20/syngenta-weedkiller-pesticide-parkinsons-disease-paraquat-documents" target="_blank">reported by the Guardian</a>. This includes the 2011 study that showed a 250% increase in disease incidence among workers exposed to paraquat. </p><p>In a 2022 deposition, Syngenta’s principal science advisor, Philip Botham, acknowledged that the company made a considerable effort to obtain the data used in that study and conducted its own analysis, which reached the same conclusion about the incidence of the disease, according to a transcript of his testimony. However, the finding was not publicized and Botham did not divulge it in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/business/fact-check-paraquat-weed-killer-parkinsons.html" target="_blank">subsequent interview</a> with the New York Times. </p><p>Another transcript indicates that Syngenta attempted to downplay studies showing that paraquat administered to mice caused a reduction in the number of dopamine cells in the substantia nigra, the part of the brain that produces dopamine, which is another hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. </p><p>In 2003, a Syngenta scientist, Louise Marks, attempted to replicate those mice studies but found no such reduction in dopamine. However, she expressed concerns about potential shortcomings in her methodology, according to Botham’s testimony. Marks then traveled to California, where a Syngenta consultant taught her an improved methodology, after which she repeated the study multiple times and did indeed find a reduction in dopamine cells.</p><p>Despite Marks’ concerns, Syngenta publicized her original findings at an annual meeting of the Society of Neuroscience in 2004, Botham testified. Syngenta did not publish all of her updated studies or report her reservations to the EPA, he said.</p><p>Das, of Syngenta, dismissed the 2011 study as an “interim study that looked at only part of the data,” and said the findings were later expanded upon and improved in the 2020 study that found no clear link. </p><p>Regarding dopamine loss in mice, he said the animals in those studies were given doses “as much as 22,000 times higher than the highest amount of exposure found in U.S. farmers” and that animal studies cannot be used to prove causation. He said the majority of Marks’ findings were not reported to the EPA because they were materially similar to what was already in the public literature.</p><p>“In short, the hypothesis that paraquat causes Parkinson’s is not accepted in the medical community or peer-reviewed science, nor has it been accepted at any time in the past,” he said.</p><p>Still, Syngenta has paid at least $187.5 million into its settlement fund as of 2021, according to its financial report. One attorney involved in California litigation estimated that there are at least 300 active plaintiffs in the state and at least 4,500 in the country.</p><p>Chevron is also named as a defendant in many cases, because the company distributed paraquat in the U.S. from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s before abandoning the product. </p><p>In Mund’s legal complaint, attorneys ague that the companies “failed to warn that paraquat was likely to cause neurological damage that was both permanent and cumulative, and repeated exposures were likely to cause clinically significant neurodegenerative disease, including Parkinson’s disease.” </p><p>Officials with Syngenta, however, said the endless stream of litigation is the product of a “mass tort machine” generated by law firms with profit motives. At one time, they said, there were commercials airing on television every six minutes seeking plaintiffs or people who may have a claim to injury.</p><p>In California, at least, the debate rages on. </p><p>Last year, half a dozen researchers, including Okun and Dorsey, <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/pesticides_reduction/pdfs/2022-11-4_Ritz-et-al-Scientist-clincian-letter-to-CDPR-paraquat.pdf" target="_blank">signed a letter</a> to the California Department of Pesticide Registration urging it to reconsider use of the chemical. The letter warned that “paraquat presents a public health hazard to residents and workers in the state of California.” </p><p>The letter was among more than 4,600 comments submitted to the agency last year related to the use of paraquat in the state — including some that cited more than 70 news articles and 40 scientific studies regarding potential human health and ecological toxicity, according to department officials. </p><p>“DPR continues to evaluate the data associated with the public comments on paraquat dichloride renewal and plans to issue a response after considering the comments and available information,” wrote Tulio Macedo, chief of the pesticide registration branch, in the agency’s <a href="https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/registration/canot/2023/ca2023-10.pdf" target="_blank">most recent semiannual report</a> in September.</p><p>At the same time, federal legislation has been introduced that seeks to ban paraquat in the United States. That includes the proposed <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/protect_americas_children_from_toxic_pesticides_act1.pdf" target="_blank">Protect America’s Children from Toxic Pesticides Act of 2023</a>, introduced by Sen.

				<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://murena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murena</a> is in the business of deGoogling Android smartphones in the name of privacy. The French/European firm has been doing this for around five years, as a not-for-profit foundation — but also, in more recent years, opening a for-profit arm that sells devices running its alternative, anti-tracking OS.</p>
<p>It’s hardware agnostic, loading its open source smartphone OS onto a variety of new or refurbished handsets, including ethical smartphone maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/fairphones-repairable-smartphone-goes-on-sale-in-us-for-the-first-time-in-a-degoogled-murena-e-os-variant/">Fairphone’s kit</a>; and its own brand, eponymous mid-range handset. Murena can even sell you a deGoogled (Google) Pixel which comes purged of the usual Google services — with no Play Store, Chrome browser, Google Maps etc — and running its alternative /e/OS, rather than mainstream Android. (Albeit /e/OS is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/24/lineage/">fork of an Android-based OS</a> which was based on another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/24/cyanogen-failed-to-kill-android-now-it-is-shuttering-its-services-and-os-as-part-of-a-pivot/">fork of Android…</a> ). And, well, a deGoogled Pixel does feel like quite the flex.</p>
<p>We recently got our hands on a Fairphone 4 running Murena’s tracker-blocking /e/OS. Our curiosity was piqued to see an alternative OS running on alt hardware. The combo seems a bit of a throwback to ideas that swirled around the Android-compatible<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/10/jolla-phone-review/"> Sailfish OS and Jolla Phone</a> — remember ’em! — which were also pitched as a plucky alternative to mainstream Android a decade or so ago (yet never managed to be more than a niche proposition). But if you’ve been in tech long enough you’ll be familiar with such back-and-forth product cycles. And our sense is, on the software side, a Google-free/Google-lite Android-compatible smartphone may command more demand now vs back then, given increased awareness of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/11/teen-and-mom-plead-guilty-to-abortion-charges-based-on-facebook-data/">privacy risks posed by tracking</a>.</p>
<p>The core promise for Murena’s (open source) OS is no phoning home to Google or any other third parties by default. It says the user can be assured the OS itself is locked down. (And, being open source, it invites others to audit its privacy-by-design claims.) It also offers tools to help users limit tracking by third party apps, while recognizing they may sometimes need to use apps and services that could compromise their privacy. But the goal is to offer increased control over such privacy incursions.</p>
<p>First up, instead of the usual Google gubbins, replete with the adtech giant’s commercial trackers, /e/OS users will find a set of native open source apps and services Murena has developed to replace all that. This includes a browser, messages app, camera software, contacts and so on. (Maps is an exception, though, as it’s preloading a third party app called Magic Earth that’s not open source — but it says the app publisher has agreed to provide a <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/pdf/user_data_privacy_20180906_v6.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy report</a> detailing its personal data collection.)</p>
<p>All of these native apps seemed functional, enough, in a ‘no frills’/zero bells-and-whistles kind of way. Although performance did seem rather laggy, at times — but it was hard to know if that was a software or hardware issue with Fairphone’s mid-tier handset.</p>
<p>The default search engine on /e/OS is a meta search engine called Spot which aggregates results from third party search engines while anonymizing requests to protect against tracking. Users can also pick from other anti-tracking choices, via the settings, including (for now) DuckDuckGo, Qwant and Mojeek.</p>
<p>“By default, we’re looking at matching basically what people get on a standard phone or standard Google device. And by default, this environment is not scanning what people do on the device,” is Murena’s top-line claim for /e/OS.</p>
<p>“We don’t look at what apps are installed on the phone, we don’t really care. We don’t scan the device location, we don’t scan the phone usage,” it also tells TechCrunch, fleshing out the core differentiation and contrast vs the Google-configured mainstream flavor of Android OS — which, by merit of its adtech giant owner’s surveillance-based business model, embeds default data collection into the platform.</p>
<p>Murena even argues software running on Apple’s iOS may be “phoning home”, or else leaking to third parties such as data brokers (albeit Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature does require third party apps to request iOS users’ permission to creep on their activity). Plus it sounds a sceptical note over the iPhone maker’s brand positioning as a pro-privacy champion, pointing to Cupertino’s choice of default search engine being Google’s (a default product placement for which Apple is handsomely paid — even as iOS users can switch to a non-Google alternative if they dig in and change the setting). Whereas the whole <em>raison d’être</em> for /e/OS is no default scanning.</p>
<p>Murena’s tracking-free app offerings even stretch to a suite of cloud services that /e/OS users can sign up for (with 1GB of free storage and paid plans on offer to expand that) — which enables it to extend the available portfolio of alternatives to cover utilities like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar and even Microsoft Office. (Google isn’t the only mainstream tech giant that’s also in the business of tracking users, after all.)</p>
<p>So far, so deGoogled. However smartphones running Murena’s /e/OS can’t entirely cut the data umbilical cord back to Mountain View. The sticky issue of third party apps makes stepping off that ledge essentially commercial suicide. No one is going to buy or even use a smartphone that can’t access popular mainstream apps. So this is where the inexorable compromise has to happen — and explains why a “deGoogled” OS still asks the user whether they want to log in with, er, a Google account! This is Murena’s rather gigantic workaround for enabling users to access third party apps they’ve previously paid for via Google Play.</p>
<p>The app store you’ll find on an /e/OS device is not Google Play, of course; it’s an alternative Murena has built — which is calls the App Lounge. This offers open source apps (which it’s fetching from the <a href="https://f-droid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F-Droid</a> store); and “progressive web apps” (basically app-like web experiences), as it looks for ways to try to wean users off full-fat apps to try to weaken the aforementioned chain-link back to Google’s dominant OS. It also allows for anonymous browsing if you’re willing to abstain from paid apps. But access to paid commercial apps via the App Lounge requires signing in with a Google account <em>and</em> having access to Google Play on a separate Android device in order to make the purchase using the Google account before you can download it on the Murena device…</p>
<p>So this is where the dream of deGoogling Google Android breaks down into a series of compromising glitches.</p>

<p>If you select the Google Account option, Murena’s OS pops up with a recommendation to use a “dedicated” Google account to mitigate tracking (i.e. by avoiding linking any existing Google account you may have to your activity on the device) — but also to “limit impact in case this account is restricted by Google”, which suggests ToS issues could be a risk. (<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/murena-one-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XDA</a>‘s assessment of Murena’s App Lounge is that it looks much like the Aurora Store, another unofficial Google Play client which also pulls apps from Google’s servers but lives in what its report dubs “a grey area” of likely T&amp;Cs violations that could get your Google account banned.)</p>
<p>Murena’s documentation isn’t illuminating on this point. It does <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/support-topics/app_lounge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> that commercial apps on its App Lounge come directly via Google’s Play API. But does not discuss the risk of having your account banned by Google if you sign into its store with a Google account and try to download previously purchased apps.</p>
<p>When we asked Murena about this concern it denied there are T&amp;Cs issues with its hybrid store, claiming: “We have ensured that App Lounge T&amp;Cs are compatible with Google’s T&amp;Cs so that users can use the service with confidence.” It also suggested the warning /e/OS serves to users who sign in with a Google Account is just a cautionary step, saying: “Google has hardened its usage policy with Google accounts this year and we have been aware that some people had some restrictions with many different usages or lack of usage. So it’s our role to warn users about this. This is not specific to App Lounge usage, as so far we have not been reported any usage restriction related to the use of App Lounge.”</p>
<p>So, well, the official line from Murena on baked-in risk warnings about Google account restriction is merely that they’re displayed out of an abundance of caution. How reassuring you find that explanation is up to you. But there’s no getting around the fact you will have to use a Google account to get paid Android apps on a device running /e/OS. Which does dent the USP for a “deGoogled” operating system whose headline pitch is that it lets you “escape digital surveillance now”. Evidently, the reality — and the escape — is a bit less clear cut.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the main privacy-focused add-ons to /e/OS include a privacy score for commercial apps that’s shown within the App Lounge. This privacy rating is automated and does not seem to appear for every app. Per Murena it’s based on an assessment of how many trackers are baked into third party apps. Where it is shown, the rating can throw up some major oddities — such as scoring the Facebook app 9/10! Um… ! (Given Meta is the cardinal example of surveillance capitalism it’s obviously a problem if your privacy rating can’t reflect that.)</p>
<p>“This feature is based on tracker detection. Facebook/WhatsApp technically don’t use trackers so they are green flagged regarding privacy,” Murena offered when we queried the high score for the Facebook app, adding: “We will improve this score by adding more information about personal data collection that can be found in apps Terms of Services.”</p>
<p>Murena also bakes a set of “advanced” private browsing features into the OS, including a tracker blocker; a location faking option; and the ability to hide your IP address. This means that a mobile running /e/OS comes preloaded with a suite of anti-tracking tools that users might otherwise have to procure from a number of third parties. Here they are easy to access and enable — so full marks for convenience at least — albeit, again, not without some risk of usability trade-offs.</p>
<p>The tools are displayed in a widget on the /e/OS homescreen that lets you toggle them on or off, with the platform popping up concise explainers about the impact of enabling the features. This includes warnings that some apps may not work properly with the setting enabled. Or — in the case of hiding your IP — the recommendation is to only use it “for specific applications” as enabling the feature is “likely” to reduce your Internet speed.</p>
<p>On the flip side, when all the switches are set to off each one displays a one-word warning — either “Vulnerable” or “Exposed” — giving users a visible nudge to think about how their online activity might be compromising their privacy. And this tension between locking everything down (to achieve perfect privacy) and opening select hatches (to boost utility) remains the core confounder for such an ambitious against-the-mainstream-grain tech endeavour.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s also a balance that every mobile user has to figure out for themselves. And for many, or even perhaps most, mainstream tech users the obvious/best answer to this privacy vs utility conundrum might well be (another compromise step of) locking themselves into Apple’s mobile ecosystem and letting a different tech giant worry about protecting their privacy for them.</p>
<p>Some performance hit with Murena’s anti-tracking flavor of Android does seem unavoidable, even if the hardware you plump for to run /e/OS is a lot beefier than Fairphone’s mid-range fare. And given our test kit was a mid range handset we’re reserving finer judgement on this aspect. But unless you’re willing to not use the baked-in tracker blocking (or other privacy add-ons) then expecting some interference with app performance and/or smooth running elsewhere on the mobile web is probably sensible. (Albeit, if you opt out of those features you will of course be risking more of your privacy when/if you use third party apps and websites.)</p>
<div id="attachment_2594846"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2594846" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eos-advanced-privacy.jpg?w=680" alt="e/OS advanced privacy toggles showing tracker blocking, location-tracker blocking and feature to hide IP" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eos-advanced-privacy.jpg 2272w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eos-advanced-privacy.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eos-advanced-privacy.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eos-advanced-privacy.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eos-advanced-privacy.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eos-advanced-privacy.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eos-advanced-privacy.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eos-advanced-privacy.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eos-advanced-privacy.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2594846"><strong>Imaged Credits:</strong> Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch</p></div>
<p>During testing with the Fairphone 4 web pages did often feel slow and unresponsive. We queried this with Murena — after noticing it seemed to be worse if we had the tracker blocker enabled — but it couldn’t offer a clear diagnosis. It did say that while the tracker blocker feature “can potentially interfere” with browsing it also claimed this is “not something that our users have reported” so we were left to speculate about which particular aspect of this alternative mobile package might be making the web browsing experience feel a bit frustrating. We did also find the touchscreen interface somewhat fiddly/unresponsive at times when swiping/tapping. But, again, it was hard to know how much might be a software issue vs performance issues related to the mid-range hardware.</p>
<p>The look and feel of /e/OS generally is of a pared back Android experience. There’s not much to love or hate. It’s, well, a smartphone OS — with familiar looking icons and widgets. Overall the impression we came away with is a smartphone experience that seemed — at best — boringly normal. Utilitarian, even. If sometimes a bit plodding. But maybe boring is, in itself, an achievement when your business depends on convincing consumers they can safely move away from mainstream software and hardware without giving up essential functionality.</p>
<p>The wider question is how much highly motivated demand there is to put in the small amount of extra effort required (and possibly also shell out some additional cost) to tread an alternative, less feature-rich path — if, at the end of the day, all you get for your effect is a product that won’t look or feel especially thrilling. Even while, yes, beneath the surface, Murena swears there’s a whole lot less data mining going on.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Top notch privacy alone remains a hard to sell unless there’s something tangible to show for it. Which is why Apple’s combo of premium hardware, friction-free software <em>and</em> privacy smarts is so hard to beat.</p>
<p>Murena, meanwhile, has to fly in the face of all this embedded mainstream tech, grappling with the inevitable Big Tech switching inertia while navigating the complexities of supporting a range of hardware-software combos — so the growth challenge is real. It says it’s taking a “pragmatic” approach, which includes building tools to help users migrate off services like Gmail by helping them to transfer their data. And, really, it’s incredible how many apps and services the team has had to build, replicating reams of existing software functionality, just to be in a position to pitch “freedom of choice” to over-surveilled mobile users. Albeit it’s a pitch that’s still not, even now, entirely compromise-free. The scale of the /e/OS endeavour certainly underlines quite how vast is the Big Tech sprawl.</p>
<p><span>Is there a market for Android devices which — out of the box — don’t expose users quite so utterly to Google’s trackers yet do still require a compromising workaround requiring use of Google services to access paid apps? That’s perhaps the trickiest question here. The most tech-savvy Android users won’t be impressed (and will, in any case, know how to flash a custom ROM themselves so aren’t the obvious target for Murena’s privacy hand-holding). </span><span>So </span><span>its conviction of where the mobile puck is headed must be that there’s a growing pool of mainstream Android users with an appetite for iOS-style ‘low friction’ privacy delivered outside Apple’s walled ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span>In short the shot is: Openness plus privacy. F</span><span>or now, though, it’s not disclosing how many users /e/OS has so the bet remains open.</span></p>

<p>Songnan Wang (left) and Lingyin Li (right) found that a protein called ENPP1 acts as an on/off switch for breast cancer metastases. High protein levels lead to a high chance of metastasis (as seen by cells growing in the dish on the left), while low levels lead to no metastasis (as seen by no cells growing in the dish on the right).<span> (Image credit: Lingyin Li and Songnan Wang)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Despite their promise, immunotherapies fail to treat many cancers, including over 80% of some of the most advanced breast cancers. And many of those patients who do respond still experience metastases eventually. New research from Stanford University and the <a href="https://arcinstitute.org/">Arc Institute</a> has revealed a better way to predict and improve patient responses.</p>
<p>A team led by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/lingyin-li">Lingyin Li</a>, associate professor of biochemistry at Stanford and Arc Core Investigator, found that a protein called ENPP1 acts as an on/off switch that controls breast cancer’s ability to both resist immunotherapy and metastasize. The study, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313693120">published</a> on Dec. 20 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, showed that ENPP1 is produced by cancer cells and by healthy cells in and around the tumor, and that high patient ENPP1 levels are linked to immunotherapy resistance and subsequent metastases. The research could lead to new, more effective immunotherapies and help clinicians better predict patient response to existing medicines.</p>
<p>“Our study should offer hope for everyone,” said Li, who is also an institute scholar at <a href="https://chemh.stanford.edu/">Sarafan&nbsp;ChEM-H</a>.</p>
<h2>Thawing cold tumors</h2>
<p>Immunotherapies, like pembrolizumab (Keytruda), work by blocking an immune-dampening interaction between a cancer cell and a T cell, a kind of immune cell. For this to be effective, though, T cells need to permeate the tumor. So-called “hot” tumors, like those in melanoma and a subset of lung cancer, are treatable through immunotherapies, but many others, like breast and pancreatic cancers, are “cold,” devoid of T cell infiltration.</p>
<p>In her quest to turn cold tumors hot, Li started with cGAMP, a molecule that cells produce when their DNA is damaged, which happens when a cell becomes cancerous. If left intact, cGAMP activates an immune response through what is known as the STING pathway, which can help make a tumor hot. Li <a href="https://chemh.stanford.edu/news/chem-h-researchers-work-toward-new-understanding-cancer-camouflage">previously discovered</a> that cGAMP is exported outside the cells but often, before it can trigger a response, a protein called ENPP1 chews up these molecular “danger” signals. ENPP1, she proposed, helped keep cold tumors cold.</p>
<p>High levels of ENPP1 correlate with poor prognosis in many cancers, but the protein can perform many actions in the body, so Li set out to determine if its cGAMP-chewing ability is behind its clinical significance.</p>

<p>Li began collaborating with two professors at the University of California, San Francisco: Hani Goodarzi, also an incoming Arc Institute Core Investigator, and Laura Van’t Veer, a clinician who leads the I-SPY 2 Trial, a groundbreaking breast cancer trial. ENPP1 levels naturally vary across individuals, so the team looked at data from patients in the I-SPY 2 Trial to see how responses to pembrolizumab varied with ENPP1 levels at the time of diagnosis.</p>
<p>The results were astounding. Patients with high ENPP1 levels had low response to pembrolizumab and high chance of metastases. Those with low ENPP1 levels had a high response to pembrolizumab and no metastases. ENPP1 predicted both response to immunotherapy and likelihood of relapse.</p>
<p>Two things were suddenly clear: that ENPP1 was critical in metastases, not just in primary tumors; and that they should be looking at ENPP1 in healthy cells, not only in cancer cells.</p>
<p>“Using the finest molecular scalpels developed in our lab, I was excited to dig deeper and figure out exactly how ENPP1 has such a dramatic influence on clinical outcomes,“ said <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/songnan-wang">Songnan Wang</a>, an MD-PhD student in biochemistry, Arc researcher, and first author on the paper.</p>
<p>In a series of mouse studies, Wang proved that removing ENPP1 entirely or eliminating only its cGAMP-chewing ability in normal and cancer cells yielded exactly the same result: decreased tumor growth and decreased metastases. And the team proved that it resulted directly from suppressing the STING pathway. They found an on/off switch.</p>
<h2>On top of the waterfall</h2>
<p>Immune pathways are often described as “cascades” with a series of signals that trigger downstream actions that eventually lead to a response.</p>
<p>“For cancers to stop the immune system from detecting them, they need to build dams that block the signal from flowing,” said Li. “We have shown that ENPP1 acts like a big dam at the top of the waterfall.”</p>
<p>This means that clinicians can use ENPP1 levels to better determine appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients. It also means that drugs that destroy the ENPP1 dam could make existing therapies more effective – and several ENPP1 inhibitors are already in clinical development.</p>
<p>While this work focused on breast cancer, Li believes that ENPP1 plays a critical role in other kinds of “cold” tumors.</p>
<p>“I hope to inspire clinicians who treat cancers – including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer – to investigate ENPP1’s role in patient outcomes,” said Li.</p>

<p>Li is also a member of <a href="https://biox.stanford.edu/">Stanford Bio-X</a> and the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/cancer.html">Stanford Cancer Institute</a>.

Additional co-authors are from the University of California, San Francisco, and Arc.</p>

            <h2>How iMessage Contact Key Verification works</h2>
            <div><p>When you use iMessage, your messages are end-to-end encrypted so that nobody other than you and the person you’re messaging – not even Apple – can read them while they’re in transit between devices. iMessage Contact Key Verification further protects your iMessage conversations and helps verify that you’re only messaging the people you intend to.<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>iMessage Contact Key Verification verifies that you’re messaging the person you intend to automatically. In iMessage conversations with people who have also turned on iMessage Contact Key Verification, you’ll receive an alert if there’s an error in this verification process. These alerts help ensure even a very sophisticated attacker can’t impersonate anyone in the conversation.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can verify contacts manually by comparing verification codes. When you verify a contact manually, iMessage Contact Key Verification will verify that the code you have saved matches the one provided by the iMessage servers for that contact, and will notify you if the verification code changes.</li>
</ul>
