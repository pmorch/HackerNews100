</p>

<p>My decision to start a capital-B Blog (as opposed to microblogging, which I've been doing since I was a wee one on The Tumbler) was largely spur-of-the-moment and happened roughly two weeks ago. I felt <em>very</em> passionate about mobile web design and disability, wrote a whole bunch of words, and hit that POST button. Yadda yadda.</p>
<p>Since then, I've been at a bit of a loss as to what I should write about next.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> I want to write more frequently about anything and everything, because it's good for you, and I have so many thoughts constantly assailing this brain of mine‚Äîand good god, I should use that BA in Creative Writing I paid tens of thousands of dollars for to write <em>something</em> besides fanfiction. So I consulted my friend Startpage.com with the obvious prompt: "blog post ideas."</p>
<p>What I got was a roaring cascade of capitalist buzzword swill:</p>
<ul>
<li>120 profitable blog niche ideas and how to pick the right one (Write what'll make you money!)</li>
<li>50+ blog post ideas to drive traffic and increase followers (Get those numbers UP, baby!)</li>
<li>60 blog post ideas to fill your content calendar (Gotta push out that ~content~ often enough for the algorithm!)</li>
<li>101 blog post ideas to refresh your content marketing strategy (Writing is a marketing tool!)</li>
<li>35 blogging ideas that are guaranteed to be popular topics (Do what's popular!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even in lists of ostensibly personal, creative, or fun blog topics, these prompts were frequently related to businesses, productivity, and social media:</p>
<ul>
<li>If three people who inspire you collaborated to make a product, what would that be? (The people who inspire me make <em>art,</em> thanks)</li>
<li>How to eliminate your top distractions (Gotta stay on task! Don't ever waste time!!!)</li>
<li>Interview an influencer (This on a list of prompts for "creating content that provides valuable advice"........keep telling yourself that.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>)</li>
<li>Share your daily work routine! (This list is labelled "Fun"! IT'S FUN!!! DON'T YOU LOVE WORKING???)</li>
<li>Blog about your favourite companies and brands (I closed the tab before my head could explode)</li>
</ul>
<p>And if I do all this, I can become a "thought leader" (huh?) and drive organic traffic! Then my readers will follow my ~brand~!</p>
<p>I get that blogging is a big thing for businesses and influencers now, but I didn't realize just <em>how</em> obsessed the blogging landscape is with this corpo nonsense. I checked Google as well just to make sure that my search engine of choice wasn't skewing the results, but the pages I clicked on still overwhelmingly featured business-focused prompts. Or, even when the prompts were personal in nature, the introduction to the page promised me that these ideas would convert my readers into customers, grow my numbers, and get me more traffic than ever before!!! (To rake in that ad money, natch.)</p>
<p>It's just a bit depressing to see how much it's all become a numbers game, whether those numbers are dollars in your pocket or followers on your Instagram. I'm probably saying nothing new to anybody who's been on the blogging scene for some time, but as a newcomer who's just here to write creatively and have fun, it was a stark reminder of how corporate the web has become.</p>
<p>Why is that the end goal of blogging? Of <em>writing?</em> Just to make money and grow our followers? To increase our traffic so we can expose our visitors to 300 repetitive ads that take up their entire phone screen? To "convert" our readers into our customers, because them reading and enjoying what we have to say simply isn't enough? Personally, I want nothing to do with it. I'm sick of everything having to be a hustle now, even something personal like sharing our ramblings with strangers on the internet.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I have little else to say other than that I hate how capitalism ruins everything fun it touches. I'll continue to write about things that make me feel passionate, not how to make money or gain followers. And if the day comes where my blog ever features a sponsored post or sketchy weight loss ad, just shoot me in the face.</p>
<p>...In the end, perhaps I have to give those listicles a little bit of credit. They <em>did</em> give me the idea for my next blog post. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

<li id="fn-1"><p>Well, sort of. I really want to write about Baldur's Gate 3, how it compares to Bioware titles, and how my personal feelings on said titles have changed over the years‚Äîbut it would be pretty silly to do so before I've <em>finished</em> Baldur's Gate 3. I'm 100+ hours in now and just barely got inside the city walls!<a href="#fnref-1">‚Ü©</a></p></li>
<li id="fn-2"><p>Sorry, maybe I'm being mean here. I'm sure there are some influencers with valuable life advice to share.

            <div><h2>Agency finalizing Direct File pilot scope, details as work continues this fall; EITC, Child Tax Credit among projected provisions covered</h2>

<p>IR-2023-192, Oct. 17, 2023</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ‚Äî As part of larger transformation efforts underway, the Internal Revenue Service announced today key details about the Direct File pilot for the 2024 filing season with several states planning to join the innovative effort.</p>

<p>The IRS will conduct a limited-scope pilot during the 2024 tax season to further assess customer support and technology needs. It will also provide a platform for the IRS to evaluate successful solutions for potential operational challenges identified in the <a data-entity-substitution="pup_linkit_media" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4d6a45b8-50d6-4404-b2c3-72ca06b7e843" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5788.pdf" title="0523 Publ 5788                           (PDF)">report the IRS submitted to Congress</a><span title="Download pdf file" aria-label="press enter to download pdf file">PDF</span> earlier this year.</p>

<p>Arizona, California, Massachusetts and New York have decided to work with the IRS to integrate their state taxes into the Direct File pilot for filing season 2024. Taxpayers in nine other states without an income tax ‚Äì Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming -- may also be eligible to participate in the pilot. Washington has also chosen to join the integration effort for the state's application of the Working Families Tax Credit. All states were invited to join the pilot, but not all states were in a position to join the pilot at this time.</p>

<p>"This is a critical step forward for this innovative effort that will test the feasibility of providing taxpayers a new option to file their returns for free directly with the IRS," said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. "In this limited pilot for 2024, we'll be working closely with the states that have agreed to participate in an important test run of the state integration. This will help us gather important information about the future direction of the Direct File program."</p>

<p>People in those 13 states may be eligible to participate in the 2024 Direct File pilot, a new service that will provide taxpayers with the choice to electronically file their federal tax return directly with the IRS for free.</p>

<p>Taxpayer eligibility to participate in the pilot will be limited by the state in which the taxpayer resides and will be limited to taxpayers with certain types of income, credits and deductions ‚Äì taxpayers with relatively simple returns. The IRS today announced it anticipates specific income types, such as wages on a Form W-2, and important tax credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, will be covered by the Direct File pilot.</p>

<p>The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act provided the IRS with long-term funding for the agency to transform its operations and improve taxpayer service, enforcement and technology. It also directed the IRS to study the possibility of a free, direct e-file program, which the IRS submitted in a report to Congress in May 2023. Projects like Direct File represent a goal of the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="06d75d0f-2adc-4e9c-9ac8-3b80edd70e57" href="https://www.irs.gov/about-irs/irs-inflation-reduction-act-strategic-operating-plan" title="IRS Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan">IRS Strategic Operating Plan</a>, to give taxpayers choices in how they interact with the tax agency. This includes choices in how they prepare and file their taxes, whether it's through a tax professional, commercial tax software or free filing options. Direct File is one more potential option from which qualifying taxpayers will be able to choose to file a 2023 federal tax return during the 2024 filing season.</p>

<p>Since the delivery of the Direct File report in May ‚Äì as directed by the Treasury Department ‚Äì the IRS has been working to develop a pilot for the upcoming filing season, paying special attention to issues identified in the report related to customer support and state taxes. This limited-scale pilot will allow the IRS to evaluate the costs, benefits and operational challenges associated with providing a voluntary Direct File option to taxpayers.</p>

<p>"We have more work in front of us on this project," Werfel said. "The Direct File pilot is undergoing continuous testing with taxpayers to identify and resolve issues to ensure its user friendly and easy to understand. We continue to finalize the pilot details and anticipate more changes before we launch for the 2024 tax season. Direct File, if pursued further after the pilot, would be another option eligible taxpayers have to help them prepare their tax returns in addition to existing options such as the use of a tax professional, tax software, Free File or another option. It's consistent with the IRS mission to make sure taxpayers have available options that work the best for their personal situation."</p>

<h3>Direct File pilot basics</h3>

<p>Eligible taxpayers may choose to participate in the pilot next year to file their tax year 2023 federal tax return for free, directly with the IRS.</p>

<p>Direct File will be a mobile-friendly, interview-based service that will work as well on a mobile phone as it does on a laptop, tablet or desktop computer. The service will be available in English and Spanish for the pilot.</p>

<p>The Direct File pilot will be a limited, phased pilot. It will not be available to all eligible taxpayers when the IRS begins accepting tax returns. Because the IRS wants to make sure the program works effectively, Direct File will first be introduced to a small group of eligible taxpayers in filing season 2024. As the filing season progresses, more and more eligible taxpayers will be able to access the service to file their 2023 tax returns.</p>

<p>Direct File does not replace existing filing options like tax professionals, Free File, free return preparation sites, commercial software and authorized e-file providers. Taxpayers will continue to have choices, whether they want to use a tax professional, a software product, Free File, free tax preparation services like Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) as well as a paper tax return or Direct File.</p>

<p>Taxpayers participating in the pilot will have access to help by IRS employees staffing the Direct File customer support function. IRS customer service representatives will provide technical support and provide basic clarification of tax law related to the tax scope of Direct File. Questions related to issues other than Direct File will be routed to other IRS customer support, as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Pilot eligibility is limited</h3>

<p>Eligibility for the pilot is limited by the types of income, tax credits and deductions that the product can initially support. Taxpayers who fall outside the pilot's eligibility limits will be unable to participate in the pilot in 2024.</p>

<p>Direct File will cover only individual federal tax returns during the pilot. Also, Direct File will not prepare state returns. However, once a federal return is completed and filed, Direct File will guide taxpayers who want to file a state return to a state-supported tool that taxpayers can use to prepare and file a stand-alone state tax return. For the pilot in 2024, where taxpayers may have state or local tax obligations, the IRS will limit eligibility to states that are actively partnering with the IRS on the pilot.</p>

<p>Eligibility to participate in the pilot will be limited to taxpayers who reside in certain states where the pilot is available. Taxpayers in Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming may be eligible to participate in the pilot as their states do not levy a state income tax. Washington has also chosen to join the integration effort as a partner for the state's application of the Working Families Tax Credit. For states that do levy a state income tax, Arizona, California, Massachusetts and New York have chosen to partner with the IRS for the 2024 Direct File pilot. The IRS anticipates the pilot will be available in those states as well in 2024.</p>

<p>The IRS and the Departments of Revenue in Arizona, California, Massachusetts, New York and Washington entered into separate Memorandums of Understanding in September for the purposes of collaboration on the IRS's Direct File pilot for filing season 2024.</p>

<p>This approach will test the IRS's ability to successfully integrate with a handful of states and the IRS will continue to work with all states to secure feedback and share what it learns through the course of its work on the pilot.</p>

<h3>2024 Direct File pilot eligibility expected to cover key income, tax credits</h3>

<p>Eligibility to participate in the 2024 pilot will be limited to reporting only certain types of income and claiming limited credits and adjustments. The tax scope for the pilot is still being finalized and is subject to change, but the IRS currently anticipates it will include:</p>

<h4>Income reporting</h4>

<ul><li>W-2 wage income</li>
	<li>Social Security and railroad retirement income&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Unemployment compensation</li>
	<li>Interest of $1,500 or less</li>
</ul><h4>Credits</h4>

<ul><li>Earned Income Tax Credit</li>
	<li>Child Tax Credit</li>
	<li>Credit for Other Dependents</li>
</ul><h4>Deductions</h4>

<ul><li>Standard deduction</li>
	<li>Student loan interest</li>
	<li>Educator expenses</li>
</ul><h3>Evaluating the Direct File Pilot</h3>

<p>The purpose of the Direct File pilot is to test the system the IRS has developed and to learn from that test. This includes testing the technology, customer support, state integration, fraud detection and the overall taxpayer experience. The best way to test a new service offering such as Direct File is in a limited, controlled environment that will allow the IRS to identify issues and make changes prior to any potential large-scale launch in the future.</p>

<p>The 2024 filing season serves as a pilot for Direct File, and the purpose is to learn about the Direct File service itself and the needs of taxpayers who use it. By starting with a pilot, the IRS can efficiently learn about Direct File's effectiveness, identify areas of improvement for future iterations and ensure it meets the needs of taxpayers who want to use it.</p>

<p>The IRS will publicly share the results of the pilot when available.</p>

<p>More information will be available at <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="29183e14-141e-4678-805f-3a9e5e22603e" href="https://www.irs.gov/about-irs/strategic-plan/direct-file" title="Direct File">IRS.gov/directfile</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="435"><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/superlinear-returns-1.gif" width="168" height="18" alt="Superlinear Returns"><span size="2" face="verdana">October 2023<p>One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world
when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance
are superlinear.</p><p>Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear.
"You get out," I heard a thousand times, "what you put in." They
meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half
as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers.
You get no customers, and you go out of business.</p><p>It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear
in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if
we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear
returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact
of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power,
military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all
of these, the rich get richer.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><span color="#dddddd">1</span></a>]</span><p>You can't understand the world without understanding the concept
of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely
should, because this will be the wave you surf on.</p><p>It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with
superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two
fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.</p><p>The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working
on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial
cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're
tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone
who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.</p><p>Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern
there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And
as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies
with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the
ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.</p><p>Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather
than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early
on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them
decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to
tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that
by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows
exponentially.</p><p>YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate "you get
out what you put in," but it's not far from the truth. And if growth
rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance
<i>p</i> over time <i>t</i> would be proportional to <i>p<sup>t</sup></i>.</p><p>Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence
startling.</p><p>Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll
get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare
us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is
surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who
asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double
the amount each successive day.</p><p>What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with,
but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either,
because there have been so few instances of it in human history.
In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you
had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land
was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that
exponentially.</p><p>Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There <i>was</i> a way
to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory
you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier
it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of
empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their
experiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a
remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use
in one's own life.</p><p>The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times
was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to
learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people
were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain
topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires
of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in
preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><span color="#dddddd">2</span></a>]</span><p>That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of
ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But
this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated
it. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from
exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances
of it.</p><p>The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression
"winner take all." In a sports match the relationship between
performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets
one win whether they do much better or just slightly better.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><span color="#dddddd">3</span></a>]</span><p>The source of the step function is not competition per se, however.
It's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need
competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations
where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting
a target.</p><p>It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear
returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential
growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage,
which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential
growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects,
a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.</p><p>Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both
sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because
existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's
so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the
A-list in the average person's head.</p><p>The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns
may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also
thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of
these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read,
you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important
thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge
seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the
boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole
new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new
discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and
Darwin.</p><p>
Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear
returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.</p><p>There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in
the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in
the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure,
or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching
you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting
one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You
may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning
a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.</p><p>This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People
in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only
continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But
if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't
grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should
yield results eventually.</p><p>Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of
learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably
treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields
another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning,
you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.</p><p>But don't overoptimize <i>what</i> you're learning. Don't limit yourself
to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're
learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable,
and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.</p><p>What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the
form "seek thresholds" or "seek competition?" Here the situation
is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the
game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette,
you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the
best case you're no better off. "Seek competition" is similarly
useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently
fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of
the return curve ‚Äî because something that grows fast enough will
grow big even if it's trivially small at first ‚Äî but thresholds
only guarantee the shape.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><span color="#dddddd">4</span></a>]</span><p>A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a
test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if
you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it
could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes
a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd
buy a better alternative if you made one.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><span color="#dddddd">5</span></a>]</span><p>It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual
thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new
fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty,
but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have
predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's
hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research
problem <i>isn't</i> likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems
legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries
tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they
were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open
questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one
heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism
‚Äî to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what
you're supposed to.</p><p>
The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting
one for the ambitious. And there's good news in this department:
this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types
of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns
themselves are growing.</p><p>There are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined
that they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and
the decreasing importance of organizations.</p><p>Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an
organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to
get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and
the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in
most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And
prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of
an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a
handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked
alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even
they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><span color="#dddddd">6</span></a>]</span><p>A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns
for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in
my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists
and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious
projects that don't require much initial funding, and lots of new
ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.</p><p>There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change
has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering
what's at stake. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change
than one in the returns for performance.</p><p>Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more
variation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better
off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly
will do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing
oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people
will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for
superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know
they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher
variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to
risk trying it to find out.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><span color="#dddddd">7</span></a>]</span><p>The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their
current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they'd
never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity
will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural
version the institutions themselves might have cooked up.</p><p>
Not everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. It
threatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies.&nbsp;</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><span color="#dddddd">8</span></a>]</span>
But if you're an ambitious individual it's good news for you.
How should you take advantage of it?<p>The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for
performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of
the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because
there's less competition at the far end ‚Äî and not just for the
obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well,
but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few
even try. Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional
work, but a bargain even to try to.</p><p>There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if
you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right.
For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be
interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with
superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're
interested in, and to find ways to work on it.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><span color="#dddddd">9</span></a>]</span>
It will also be
important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example,
if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure
of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when
you're young and don't yet have children.<p>There's a surprising amount of technique to doing great work.
It's not just a matter of trying hard. I'm going to take a shot
giving a recipe in one paragraph.</p><p>Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in.
Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter
what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work
as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually
bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth
from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and
explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole
new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing
occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the
best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples.
Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep
well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your
curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's
worth paying attention to.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><span color="#dddddd">10</span></a>]</span><p>And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck
is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're
working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And
though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where
preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component
of true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is
to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking
risks early.</p><p>
The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably
science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined
with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance ‚Äî literally at
the limits of knowledge.</p><p>The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery
that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies
seem mild by comparison. Newton's discoveries were arguably greater
than all his contemporaries' combined.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><span color="#dddddd">11</span></a>]</span><p>This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell
it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return
curve, the greater the variation in outcomes.</p><p>In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality
is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of
this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform
everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same
is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.</p><p>What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else?
Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting,
directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing.
In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds;
you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In
politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And
in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven
largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth.
But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a
remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same
as the list of fields where you have to be </p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/think.html"><u>independent-minded</u></a> to
succeed ‚Äî where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel
as well.
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><span color="#dddddd">12</span></a>]</span><p>This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers
saying things that other people have already said. But it's just
as true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that
a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone
else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will
already reflect that, and there's no room to make money.</p><p>What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have
to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at
first. <i>At this rate,</i> you find yourself thinking, <i>I'll never get
anywhere.</i> But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far
end, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.</p><p>In the startup world, the name for this principle is "do things
that don't scale." If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to
your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential
growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything
that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first
start learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the
initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the
easier it will get.</p><p>There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with
superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the
20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a
result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with
having a job. Even now to most people the phrase "your work" means
their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever
they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their
work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they
have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of
their portfolio.</p><p>
It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big
winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately,
but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and
you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one.
Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and
interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns
if they're not already part of one.</p><p>The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed,
the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both
ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity
may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you
climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting
enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>There's a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort,
performance, and return, because they're not sharply distinguished
in fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance
to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry,
they're not meaningless. I've tried to write about them as precisely
as I could without crossing into error.</p><p>[</p><a name="f1n"><span color="#000000">1</span></a>]
Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of
superlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to
empathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns.<p>[</p><a name="f2n"><span color="#000000">2</span></a>]
Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the
Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human
life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad,
gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few
exceptionally learned people.<p>[</p><a name="f3n"><span color="#000000">3</span></a>]
It's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as
superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a
superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort
by a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the
step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after
the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one
would bother.<p>[</p><a name="f4n"><span color="#000000">4</span></a>]
Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that
some people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to
promising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them
promising. But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring
crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by
someone quietly working on another one.<p>[</p><a name="f5n"><span color="#000000">5</span></a>]
Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When
something is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden
reason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete.
Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for
deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things
that exist for such reasons.<p>[</p><a name="f6n"><span color="#000000">6</span></a>]
In my twenties I wanted to be an <a href="http://paulgraham.com/worked.html"><u>artist</u></a> 
and even went to art
school to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial
part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least
at the mercy of organizations.<p>[</p><a name="f7n"><span color="#000000">7</span></a>]
In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning
compounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in
practice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where
the return curve gets really steep.<p>[</p><a name="f8n"><span color="#000000">8</span></a>]
It's unclear exactly what advocates of "equity" mean by it.
They seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is
probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power
to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than
everyone else.<p>It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just
the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction,
but I don't think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it
arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly
increasing variation in performance.</p><p>[</p><a name="f9n"><span color="#000000">9</span></a>]
Corollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something
prestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in
it, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past.<p>[</p><a name="f10n"><span color="#000000">10</span></a>]
The original version of this paragraph was the first draft of
"<a href="http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html"><u>How to Do Great Work</u></a>." 
As soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear
returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its
own. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because
after I finished "How to Do Great Work" I rewrote it based on that.<p>[</p><a name="f11n"><span color="#000000">11</span></a>]
Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually
did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful
and enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist,
by discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people
who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most
advanced economies the ratio has <a href="http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html"><u>shifted dramatically</u></a> toward discovery
just in the last half century.<p>[</p><a name="f12n"><span color="#000000">12</span></a>]
It's not surprising that conventional-minded people would
dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest
drivers of it. But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to
have what they can't. The conventional-minded literally can't imagine
what it's like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great
variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they
encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some
malign external influence.<span color="888888"><b>Thanks</b>

												<p><strong>Amir Golestan</strong>, the 40-year-old CEO of the Charleston, S.C. based technology company <strong>Micfo LLC</strong>, has been sentenced to five years in prison for wire fraud. Golestan‚Äôs sentencing comes nearly two years after he pleaded guilty to using an elaborate network of phony companies to secure more than 735,000 Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from the <strong>American Registry for Internet Numbers</strong> (ARIN), the nonprofit which oversees IP addresses assigned to entities in the U.S., Canada, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<div id="attachment_48758"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48758" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/amirgolestan-image.png" alt="" width="749" height="476"></p><p id="caption-attachment-48758">Amir Golestan, the former CEO of Micfo.</p></div>
<p>In 2018, ARIN sued Golestan and Micfo, alleging they had obtained hundreds of thousands of IP addresses under false pretenses. ARIN and Micfo settled that dispute in arbitration, with Micfo returning most of the addresses that it hadn‚Äôt already sold.</p>
<p>ARIN‚Äôs civil case caught the attention of federal prosecutors in South Carolina, who in May 2019 <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/05/a-tough-week-for-ip-address-scammers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed criminal wire fraud charges against Golestan</a>, alleging he‚Äôd orchestrated a network of shell companies and fake identities to prevent ARIN from knowing the addresses were all going to the same buyer.</p>
<p>Prosecutors showed that each of those shell companies involved the production of notarized affidavits in the names of people who didn‚Äôt exist. As a result, the government was able to charge Golestan with 20 counts of wire fraud ‚Äî one for each payment made by the phony companies that bought the IP addresses from ARIN.</p>
<p>Golestan initially sought to fight those charges. But on just the second day of his trial in November 2021, Golestan changed his mind and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/tech-ceo-pleads-to-wire-fraud-in-ip-address-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleaded guilty to 20 counts of wire fraud</a> in connection with the phantom companies he used to secure the IP addresses. Prosecutors estimated those addresses were valued at between $10 million and $14 million.<span id="more-65335"></span></p>
<p>ARIN says the 5-year sentence handed down by the South Carolina judge ‚Äúsends an important message of deterrence to other parties contemplating fraudulent schemes to obtain or transfer Internet resources.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThose who seek to defraud ARIN (or other Regional Internet Registries) are subject to costly and serious civil litigation, criminal charges, and, ultimately, a lengthy term of incarceration,‚Äù reads <a href="https://www.arin.net/blog/2023/10/16/micfo-golestan-sentencing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> from ARIN on Golestan‚Äôs sentencing.</p>
<p>By 2013, a number of Micfo‚Äôs customers had landed on the radar of <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spamhaus</a>, a group that many network operators rely upon to stem the tide of junk email. Shortly after Spamhaus started blocking Micfo‚Äôs IP address ranges, Micfo shifted gears and began reselling IP addresses mainly to companies marketing ‚Äúvirtual private networking‚Äù or VPN services that help customers hide their real IP addresses online.</p>
<p>Golestan did not respond to a request for comment. But in a 2020 interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Golestan claimed that Micfo was at one point responsible for brokering roughly 40 percent of the IP addresses used by the world‚Äôs largest VPN providers. Throughout that conversation, Golestan maintained his innocence, even as he explained that the creation of the phony companies was necessary to prevent entities like Spamhaus from interfering with his business going forward.</p>
<p>There are fewer than four billion so-called ‚ÄúInternet Protocol version 4‚Äù or IPv4 addresses available for use, but the vast majority of them have already been allocated. The global dearth of available IP addresses has turned them into a commodity wherein each IPv4 address can fetch between $15-$25 on the open market.</p>
<p>This has led to boom times for those engaged in the acquisition and sale of IP address blocks, but it has likewise emboldened those who specialize in&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/the-great-50m-african-ip-address-heist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absconding with</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/feds-allege-adconion-employees-hijacked-ip-addresses-for-spamming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spamming from dormant IP address blocks</a>&nbsp;without permission from the rightful owners.</p>
<p>The U.S Department of Justice says Golestan will serve 60 months in prison, followed by a 2-year term of court-ordered supervision. The Micfo CEO also was ordered to pay nearly $77,000 in restitution to ARIN for its work in assisting federal prosecutors.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I recently built a browser-based word game with my friends called Sqword (sqword.com). I'm proud to say that we've been able to maintain a steady group of daily active users over the past 6 months or so despite not doing any real advertising.</p>
<p>Vultures will even pick at modest success stories.</p>
<p>Yesterday one of my collaborators googled "sqword" and to his surprise, there were tons of first-page results that weren't the sqword.com domain. These sites are "game aggregator" sites that host your app inside of an iFrame so that they can steal ad revenue from your product.</p>
<p>This made me angrier than it should have - not because Sqword is a cash cow - we don't run ads on the site and don't make money from it, it's just for fun - but because it was a passion project with friends, something pure and intentionally free to play WITHOUT ads. It's against my ethos as a developer, there are banners and popups everywhere. If I build an app, I believe it should either be free or it should be up-front about what the subscription or purchase price is (and then not upsell you).</p>
<p>I couldn't abide seeing my code monetized in this way.</p>
<p>The mature and responsible thing to do would have been to add a content security policy to the page. I am not mature so instead what I decided to do was render the early 2000s internet shock image Goatse with a nice message superimposed over it in place of the app if Sqword detects that it is in an iFrame.</p>
<p>It has been one of my greatest achievements as a dev: to live-deploy a massive goatse image to at least 8 domains that aren't mine.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to you - if you are using an iFrame to display a site that isn't yours, even for legitimate purposes, you have no control over that content - it can change at any time. One day instead of looking into an iFrame, you might be looking at an entirely different kind of portal.</p>

<p>It's one of those things that feels obvious when you see it, but until you do, it can be hard to grasp why it's important. The result is that we end up with the wrong abstraction trying to do double duty.</p>
<p>Just as you probably wouldn't use a relational database as a message bus, mixing the concepts of Pricing and Billing can bring disaster.</p>

<p>Most companies approach their pricing implementation in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a billing engine (Stripe, Lago, etc.)</li>
<li>Have a bunch of meetings where they argue about the best pricing model (and hopefully write it down somewhere!)</li>
<li>Configure the billing engine with the model they decided on (or realize it's too complicated, and go back to step 2).</li>
<li>Store all the information that the billing engine needs in their application database (identifiers for prices, products, customer IDs associated with each user, etc.), and add the required reporting logic in the application in the appropriate places.</li>
<li>Pray that no one ever has to touch it again. (Or failing that, hope you've got a new job somewhere else before that happens.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Where does the pricing model live? Typically, it's smeared across a variety of loosely connected components, some of which store it as implicit assumptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The billing engine</li>
<li>The application code</li>
<li>The CFO's spreadsheets</li>
<li>The <code>/pricing</code> page</li>
<li>The terms and conditions of various customer contracts</li>
<li>Feature requests from PMs and PMMs who want to make changes</li>
<li>The fallible human brains of everyone on the team</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of value can be unlocked by separating these two abstractions.</p>
<p>A <strong>Billing Engine</strong> is the component in the stack that <em>bills customers</em>. Its "one job" is to send an invoice at the right time, in the right amount, to the right buyer.</p>
<p>To do this, it needs to know some information about the customer, what thing they bought, the price they should be charged for it, and in the case of metered billing, the amount of that thing that they consumed.</p>
<p>A <strong>Pricing Engine</strong> is the component in the stack that <em>manages and implements the pricing model</em>. You can think of it as "the thing that does <a href="https://priceops.org/">PriceOps</a>". It knows what the various pricing plans are, and where they live in the Billing Engine, and thus can present a clean API surface for application code to create subscriptions and report usage.</p>
<p>To do its job (and prevent other components from trying to take over!) it needs to store the pricing model itself, and present a clean abstraction to the application code, billing engine, and all other technical and business components that need access to price information.</p>
<p>And perhaps most importantly, it must support making <em>changes</em> to the pricing model, without its abstractions leaking out to consumers.</p>

<p>The most tangible immediate benefit of a comprehensive Pricing Engine is that it can simplify the process of setting up a Billing Engine, and reduce the amount of billing-related metadata that needs to be tracked and managed by application code.</p>
<p>While this is enough of a reason to use it, it doesn't always <em>feel</em> like a huge win. Integrating with a whole new component in the stack feels like adding complexity in one place to maybe save it elsewhere. Even if it makes your code cleaner and simpler, it's not <em>that</em> bad, right? Isn't "having too many customers and complicated deals" sort of a problem I can worry about when I'm rich and successful?</p>
<p>However, the trouble with this line of thinking (which all of us at Tier have learned through painful expensive experience) is that it can be very difficult for a company to <em>become</em> successful if they cannot easily iterate on their approach to pricing and packaging.</p>
<p><strong>Streamlining pricing with a comprehensive Pricing Engine lets everyone focus on their specialty.</strong> This unlocks growth that would otherwise be lost to inefficient processes.</p>

<p>What we've found is that the most experienced and insightful practitioners in this space follow exactly this kind of approach. That's how the concept of PriceOps was born.</p>
<p>Tier is a comprehensive Pricing Engine, which drives your billing engine and application code from a single source of pricing model truth, so that everything in your company can work in concert, even as your business changes and grows.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p><em>Welcome to a </em><em>That One Scene</em><em>, a semi-regular series in which Task &amp; Purpose writers wax nostalgic about that one scene from a beloved movie.</em></p>



<p>Hollywood has attempted, time and again with poor results, to portray what happens when an unidentified or unauthorized aircraft or missile threat penetrates friendly airspace. ‚ÄúTop Gun‚Äù and ‚ÄúWar Games‚Äù tried, but wound up giving us classic 1980s cheeseball cinema. There is a noticeable absence of films that capture the pulse-pounding chess game of ground-controlled interception (GCI) ‚Äì a sensation that is only amplified when lives are on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter ‚ÄúPatlabor 2: The Movie,‚Äù an obscure, contemplative anime film from Japanese director Mamouru Oshii of ‚ÄúGhost In the Shell‚Äù fame. In between intricate artwork, a thrilling storyline about a plot to bring civil war to early 2000s Japan, and musings on the ethics of the application of military force, one scene stands out as the single most realistic portrayal of GCI ever put to film.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As tactical displays fill the screen and ominous music plays alongside frantic radio traffic, a scene unfolds that‚Äôs so technically dense and authentic, we at Task &amp; Purpose had to consult several subject matter experts to make sure we understood exactly what was going on.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="PATLABOR 2 Êã¶Êà™F 16ÔºàJSDF Intercepts WyvernÔºâ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnOfNQ9VWo0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The scene takes place in the winter of 2002 in Japan. A rogue F-16J aircraft fires a TV-guided missile ‚Äî meaning a missile that uses a camera feed for steering ‚Äî at the Tokyo Bay Bridge, destroying the middle section and throwing Japan into a state of fear not experienced since Curtis LeMay‚Äôs strategic bombing of the mainland during World War II.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only days later, Fuchu Central Strategic Operations Center (SOC) detects a sortie of three more F-16Js, call sign ‚ÄúWyvern,‚Äù this time armed with bombs, on a direct flight from Misawa Air Base to the heart of Tokyo. With only minutes to spare, and suspecting another attack, four <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhPhxWgpaC8&amp;t=108s">F-15 STOL/MTDs</a> ‚Äî a highly maneuverable F-15 prototype ‚Äî are scrambled to intercept on two separate paths in the hopes that one of the aircraft will make contact with the incoming bogies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fuchu officials guide the F-15s, call signs ‚ÄúWizard‚Äù and ‚ÄúPriest,‚Äù to the incoming F-16Js. The F-15s attempt to make contact, but Wizard cannot see Wyvern or pick them up on radar, despite being nearly on top of them.</p>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/patlabor1.gif" alt="Entertainment photo" width="1024" height="600"><figcaption>(Gif via ‚ÄúPatlabor 2: The Movie‚Äù)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Wizard disappears in a flurry of radio interference, before transmitting via their transponder that they‚Äôd been shot down. Wyvern then pivots into a direct trajectory towards Tokyo central, dropping altitude and accelerating, as if making an attack run, and Priest is given clearance from Fuchu SOC to fire as soon as they make radar contact. In addition, Fuchu SOC alerts the Iruma Air Defense Artillery batteries to prepare to engage, now fully anticipating an airborne attack. Civilian air traffic controllers at Narita International Airport scramble to ensure that the incoming aircraft don‚Äôt harm passenger planes in holding patterns, further driving home the dire implications of this incursion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as Priest prepares to fire, the interference clears, and the targeted aircraft reveal themselves to be Wizard flight, frantically asking for orders. Fuchu SOC immediately calls off the attack, bewildered that the airborne threat has suddenly disappeared, and recalls the interceptors back to base.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entire attack was an elaborate ruse, a hack of the Fuchu SOC radar systems and jamming of their radio communications, in an attempt to cause the responding aircraft to engage each other. At the very least, the digital assailant showed the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force that they had the capability to infiltrate their systems and wreak havoc, sowing further doubt and terror among the ranks.</p>



<p>This scene is extremely dense, so we‚Äôre going to do a breakdown of exactly what the filmmakers got right, because the detail is as close to real life as it gets (despite the film being a cartoon). High-octane aerial combat movies like ‚ÄúTop Gun‚Äù and ‚ÄúBehind Enemy Lines‚Äù do not hold a candle to the precision and attention to detail we see in this film, not to mention the chest-thumping thrill ride of the action as it plays out.</p>



<p>When I interviewed our subject matter expert, a former Navy strike force analyst, he had this to say: ‚ÄúAll of the brevity terms are used properly, nothing feels out of place like the typical Hollywood screenwriter trying to sound like the military by using terms they found on Google like a lot of films and shows. The Ground Control Intercept (GCI) depiction is exactly how that would play out (TREBOR vectors PRIEST and WIZARD into the target; the fighters are very reliant on the controllers view of the battlespace with only targeting capabilities with their radar). The radar screens aren‚Äôt the spinning ‚Äòsonar blip‚Äô bullshit you get in a lot of games, movies, and animation. It‚Äôs very true to the displays you actually see in a control tower, with the IFF/squawk codes identifying each aircraft or flight.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with that in mind, let‚Äôs dive deeper into that one scene.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-technology">The technology</h3>



<p>The film uses period-accurate monochrome radar displays that refresh only when the radar beam makes another circuit. Tracked air assets are marked with their ‚Äúsquawk codes,‚Äù rather than plane names.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/patlabor2.gif" alt="Entertainment photo" width="1024" height="579"><figcaption>(Gif via ‚ÄúPatlabor 2: The Movie‚Äù)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The choice of aircraft is another authentic touch. The F-15 STOL/MTD, was an F-15 variant designed in the 1980s to test the concept of thrust vectoring and super-mobility, and is one that few people aside from those who read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.janes.com/capabilities/defence-equipment-intelligence/air-combat-systems">Jane‚Äôs Fighting Planes</a> books would have known about in 1993.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The radios are harsh, muffled, and staticky, and the pilots‚Äô breathing interrupts their dialogue, which is a <a target="_blank" href="https://taskandpurpose.com/tech-tactics/gulf-war-video-f-16-dodging-missiles/">very real thing.</a> The pilots have to be guided onto their targets due to the fact that features like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aviationtoday.com/2018/09/04/f-35-data-fusion/">sensor data sharing between aircraft</a> were only in their infancy at the time of the film‚Äôs release, meaning the pilots had to manually steer their narrow-view onboard radar onto the target by taking verbal directions from the SOC, whose more powerful 360-degree radar was much better equipped for locating the general position of targets.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-the-dialogue">The dialogue</h3>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="527" src="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV-1024x527.jpg?auto=webp" alt="Entertainment photo" srcset="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV-1024x527.jpg 1024w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV-300x155.jpg 300w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV-768x396.jpg 768w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV-1536x791.jpg 1536w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV.jpg 1897w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>(Screenshot via ‚ÄúPatlabor 2: The Movie‚Äù)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While most movies get radio traffic wrong with amateurish phrases like ‚Äúover and out‚Äù or ‚ÄúI repeat,‚Äù Patlabor characters not only use believable dialogue during radio transmissions, but also speak in heavily accented English.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a huge detail that most aviation films neglect, even ones that depict NATO allies, which often simply feature the pilots speaking their native language despite the fact that English is the universal language of air traffic communication. The pilots and air traffic controllers speak in measured, subdued tones, suggesting a high level of training and preparedness. Even the air battle manager and director speak to each other in a manner that, while grim, is still calm and businesslike, underscoring the fact that while the situation is quite precarious, shots have not yet been fired. This is contrasted with the excited, terrified shouts of the civilian air traffic controllers at Narita International Airport, which add to the tension of the scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pilots and controllers give their headings in degrees magnetic, saying the numbers individually like ‚Äúone-niner-zero‚Äù instead of ‚Äúone-ninety,‚Äù and provide their altitude in angels (thousands of feet) which adds another layer of credibility. The terms used, such as ‚Äúno joy‚Äù (no visual contact) ‚Äúbogey dope‚Äù (request target heading, altitude, and airspeed) and ‚Äúsay again‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúrepeat,‚Äù are spot on, preventing a good deal of cringe from those in the know.</p>



<h3 id="h-tactics-techniques-and-procedures">Tactics, techniques, and procedures</h3>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="550" src="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV-1024x550.jpg?auto=webp" alt="Entertainment photo" srcset="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV-300x161.jpg 300w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV-768x413.jpg 768w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV-1536x825.jpg 1536w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV.jpg 1906w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>(Screenshot via ‚ÄúPatlabor 2: The Movie‚Äù)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Contrast this scene with the hyped-up, Aqua Net-and-cocaine pacing of the air combat scenes of classics like ‚ÄúTop Gun,‚Äù and you‚Äôll immediately see that this is a more measured, authentic approach to how air operations work. For starters, one of the biggest things that military aviation movies often neglect is that the airborne radars of fighter aircraft are very limited, only sweeping in a narrow ray in front of the aircraft to avoid microwaving the pilots and crew. It stands to reason that Wizard and Priest flights would be heavily dependent on the Fuchu Central SOC for guidance as to the general vicinity of the intruders, and the scene illustrates this beautifully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The incoming aircraft are identified, radio hails are sent up, and when there‚Äôs no response, interceptors are launched. Once the aircraft checks in, the air traffic controllers give guidance, and the initial intercept time is revised while the pilots begin to search for the target visually and with their onboard targeting radar. The coordination is continuous, with Fuchu Central SOC feeding Wizard and Priest targeting data while trying to deconflict the situation on the ground, to no avail. When Wizard gets ‚Äúshot down,‚Äù the squawk code ‚Äú7700,‚Äù ‚Äî the international code for ‚Äúmayday,‚Äù or an airborne emergency ‚Äì appears onscreen at their last known position.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-depiction-of-a-cyber-attack">The depiction of a cyber attack</h3>



<p>Cyberspace is an ever-growing domain of warfare on the modern battlefield, and concerns about its role in a conflict with a near-peer adversary are becoming more commonplace. This scene presents three forms of electronic warfare: GPS spoofing, hacking, and signal jamming. The culmination of this multi-pronged cyber attack is when two friendly aircraft come within seconds of firing on one another.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/patlabor5.gif" alt="Entertainment photo" width="1024" height="575"><figcaption>(Gif via ‚ÄúPatlabor 2: The Movie‚Äù)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the film, this is done to try to incite a civil war, but in real life, GPS spoofing has become so common that hackers sell kits for $300 to allow the user to send false GPS data. Iran has already made dubious claims that they have mounted <a target="_blank" href="https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1215/Exclusive-Iran-hijacked-US-drone-says-Iranian-engineer">GPS spoofing attacks on U.S. air assets.</a> The scene demonstrates this when Wizard says ‚ÄúWe had heavy jamming and now lost position,‚Äù indicating that their communications and their GPS systems were being tampered with. The producers of this film weren‚Äôt in possession of any classified information either, since GPS spoofing and jamming was something that even the Iraqis used during Operation Desert Storm in the hopes of defeating GPS-guided bombs aimed at Saddam‚Äôs palace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hacking is another daily reality in the modern world, and cyber attacks against various governments are now common shows of force. While it‚Äôs not officially known whether or not any tactical systems have been hacked, as revealed in this scene, the possibility of this happening is still greater than zero. Signal jamming, however, is one of the oldest electronic warfare tricks in the book, and involves flooding entire swaths of frequencies with signal noise, which not only forces the enemy to limit communications, but also makes decryption easier by reducing the number of usable frequencies to a select few. This scene accurately portrays electronic warfare when the adversary coordinates Wizard getting ‚Äúshot down‚Äù on the hacked radar display with heavy signal jamming that prevents Fuchu SOC from making contact with them via radio or transponder, adding to the illusion of Wizard being killed, and preventing Priest from deconflicting the airspace once they make radar contact with what they think is the intruding Wyvern flight.</p>



<p>Overall, myself and our subject matter expert both agree that this scene is the most authentic portrayal of air operations ever put to film. Additionally, I interviewed several former military air traffic controllers, strike analysts, and aviators, and their opinion was unanimous: This is pretty dang good. It totally abstains from excessive showmanship, replacing spectacle with the terrifying feeling that something like this could really happen. It‚Äôs an outstanding example of how technical detail and thorough authenticity can turn a minor scene, whose only function is to move the storyline forward, into seven minutes of nail-biting suspense.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-content="" data-astro-cid-rnrqlda2="">
<p>This was supposed to be a two-part blog post, but I got inspired to write a part three!</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Building a Collaborative Pixel Art Editor with CRDTs</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/og/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Building a Collaborative Pixel Art Editor with CRDTs | jakelazaroff.com</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">CRDTs sound cool, but how are they actually used? Let's learn by building a collaborative pixel art editor.</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">jakelazaroff.com/words/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts/</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>, we had just that: a fully functional collaborative pixel editor using state-based CRDTs. The drawback to state-based CRDTs is that you need to transmit the full state between peers to sync up. And our CRDT‚Äôs full state is pretty big! For a 100x100 image, it‚Äôs around 648kb. Yikes!</p>
<p>I won‚Äôt bury the lede: we‚Äôre going to reduce that by almost 98% to around 14kb. For context, that‚Äôs around half as big as the uncompressed image without any CRDT metadata. While we‚Äôll never beat PNG, we can still do pretty well.</p>
<p>The benchmarks I‚Äôll cite in this article are all based on this image I drew, which was encoded here using the same format we‚Äôll create by the end of the post:<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-louvre" id="user-content-fnref-louvre" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup></p>
<compression-table foreshadow="true" url="/public/_example.0525116f.crdt"></compression-table>
<p>This playground uses the same pixel editor we built in the last post. You can change the color and brush size by clicking on the buttons below the canvas. The table to the right shows the size of the data in kilobytes. Right now, it just shows the size of the uncompressed data and the final result in our mystery format. As we compress our data further, we‚Äôll add rows to the table showing how each format stacks up against the others, and their relative sizes.</p>
<p>Currently, our data looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"0,0"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"0442197c-8144-47f7-ae64-340a2df3d796"</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>255</span><span>,</span> <span>255</span><span>,</span> <span>255</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It‚Äôs just the JSON state of our LWW Map CRDT.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-minify" id="user-content-fnref-minify" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup> Each key is a string of the pixel‚Äôs <em>(x,y)</em> coordinates, and each value is a LWW Register state: a tuple of a peer ID, a timestamp and an RGB value. If a pixel has been erased, its RGB value is <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a blank canvas so you can see how quickly the size increases as you draw. Pay attention to the different formats as we go through the article: some will actually start out larger than our uncompressed data, but quickly become smaller as more pixels are drawn!</p>
<compression-table rows="1"></compression-table>
<h3 id="hex-codes">Hex Codes</h3>
<p>The easiest change to make is storing colors as hex codes rather than RGB tuples. As a reminder, here‚Äôs the type of each color:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span><span>RGB</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>red<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> green<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> blue<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Each channel has between one and three digits, so our color values look something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>234</span><span>,</span> <span>56</span><span>]</span></code></pre>
<p>That‚Äôs ten characters: six for the numbers, two for the commas and two for the brackets. If each number had three digits, it would take up a whole 13 characters.</p>
<p>Hex codes come in at eight characters, max. By using sixteen digits (A‚ÄìF representing the numbers 10‚Äì15) instead of our usual ten, we can represent each channel with two characters instead of three. Plus, since we know that each channel is two characters long, we can omit the commas.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs one more trick: if both characters in each channel are the same, we can omit one, which takes us down to five characters (including quotes). Here‚Äôs what the data looks like now:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"0,0"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"0442197c-8144-47f7-ae64-340a2df3d796"</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>"fff"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

<p>All in all, using hex codes rather than RGB tuples gets us down from 648kb to 606kb ‚Äî a 6% improvement. It‚Äôs a start, but we‚Äôll need much bigger improvements than that if we‚Äôre going to get all the way down to 14kb.</p>
<compression-table rows="2"></compression-table>
<h3 id="uuid-table">UUID Table</h3>
<p>The next things to look at are the UUIDs. They‚Äôre a whopping 38 characters each (including quotes) and they show up in every single pixel. We could ‚Äî and should! ‚Äî remove the hyphens, but that will only shave off four characters per pixel. We need something more substantial.</p>
<p>Instead of keeping the UUIDs directly in each pixel, we‚Äôll store them in a table. That way, they only appear once in the document. In their place, each pixel will store a table key that maps to the full UUID. When we need the full state back, we perform the same process in reverse, replacing each pixel‚Äôs table key with its corresponding UUID.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what the data looks like now. The 0th element of each array in <code>data</code> represents an index in the <code>uuids</code> array:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"uuids"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"0442197c814447f7ae64340a2df3d796"</span><span>,</span> <span>"4ae8bd76e84c4652bcd8a5e339c574f3"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Our UUID table uses an array rather than a map, which has implied keys: the index of the item in the array. Using numbers as keys also saves two characters every time we reference a UUID, since we don‚Äôt need quotation marks as we would with strings.</p>
<p>This turns out to be a substantial savings, taking us down to 236kb ‚Äî a 63% improvement!</p>
<compression-table rows="3"></compression-table>
<h3 id="palette-table">Palette Table</h3>
<p>We can use the exact same technique for the colors. Rather than storing each color directly in each pixel, we build a table of all the colors used and replace the hex codes in each pixel with table keys.</p>
<p>The last element of each array in <code>data</code> now represents an index in the <code>palette</code> array:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"uuids"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"0442197c814447f7ae64340a2df3d796"</span><span>,</span> <span>"4ae8bd76e84c4652bcd8a5e339c574f3"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Using a table like this seems strictly better, but there are some pathological scenarios in which it actually wastes space. Consider the case in which each color only appears once: we‚Äôd have the same number of colors as we have pixels, <strong>plus</strong> the overhead of mapping each pixel to a color in the table. Our current strategy works for pixel art, which tends to have a limited palette ‚Äî but if we were dealing with photographs, we might want to choose another way to compress the color data.</p>
<p>In this case, the palette table slims us down to 187kb ‚Äî 71% smaller than our uncompressed data.</p>
<compression-table rows="4"></compression-table>
<h3 id="run-length-encoding">Run-Length Encoding</h3>
<p>The next big things are the pixel coordinates ‚Äî the map keys of our data object. With x and y each between one and three digits, these can take up to ten characters each (including the quotes and colon).</p>
<p>Remember how, when we were drawing to the screen, we mapped indices in the buffer to coordinates? We went down the array four bytes at a time, drawing to each pixel in the first row and wrapping around when we reached the end.</p>
<buffer-diagram width="3" height="3"></buffer-diagram>
<p>Here we‚Äôll do the same thing, but in reverse. We‚Äôll make the data an array, setting the pixel at <code>"0,0"</code> as the first element, <code>"1,0"</code> as the second element, etc.</p>
<p>This raises a new issue: how do we represent blank pixels, where no user has drawn yet? Before, they would just be missing from the map. But now we have to represent them ‚Äî otherwise, every pixel after a blank space would be in the wrong place!</p>
<p>We could just put some sort of ‚Äúspacer‚Äù value like <code>null</code> in the array where blank pixels would be. That‚Äôd work, but it would also waste a lot of space.</p>
<p>Instead, we‚Äôll use something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">run-length encoding</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Run-length encoding - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>. It‚Äôs a very simple compression algorithm: when the same item appears consecutively in a sequence, instead of storing each item, store one of the item and the number of repeated instances.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">this weird sentence</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a> as an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There‚Äôs a lot of repetition there. The sentence has 92 characters, and the word ‚Äúhad‚Äù appears eleven times!</p>
<p>With run-length encoding, the sentence might look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1James 1while 1John 11had 1a 1better 1effect 1on 1the 1teacher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is that before each word, we add a number indicating how many consecutive times it shows up. That lets us skip every consecutive occurrence after the first. If we omit the spaces, this sentence has 54 characters ‚Äî a 42% reduction from the original!</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not an all sunshine and lollipops, though. Consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">this classic pangram</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/MetalTypeZoomIn.JPG/1200px-MetalTypeZoomIn.JPG" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sentence is 44 characters and no words repeat consecutively. Here‚Äôs what it might look like with run-length encoding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1The 1quick 1brown 1fox 1jumps 1over 1the 1lazy 1dog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>53 characters ‚Äî a 20% <strong>increase</strong>! What gives?</p>
<p>The issue is that when you compress something, you need to add metadata so that you can figure out what it looked like originally. Compression algorithms make assumptions about what patterns will occur in the original data in order to optimize the metadata. If the assumptions are right, the compressed data (including the metadata) is much smaller than the original data. But if the assumptions are wrong, the ‚Äúcompressed‚Äù data can even end up bigger than it was before!</p>
<p>Our assumption here is that run-length encoding will not be a good fit for LWW Register states, since there are three separate pieces of data that can vary independently. All blank spaces are the same, though, which makes them an excellent candidate for run-length encoding!</p>
<p>Rather than somehow representing each individual blank space in the array, we‚Äôll store a number indicating how many consecutive blank spaces we came across. That lets us know exactly which coordinates the next pixel will be at.</p>
<p>Now that we‚Äôre no longer storing the coordinates of each pixel, we also need to store the width of the image. That way, when we‚Äôre decompressing the data, we know when the pixels should wrap onto the next row.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what the data looks like now. Since we‚Äôre now using a lot of numbers without any labels, I added some comments so it‚Äôs clear what everything is referring to.</p>

<p>Notice how the <code>data</code> array is not homogenous: it contains either a tuple of peer ID, timestamp and color ID <strong>or</strong> a number indicating how many consecutive blank spaces there are.</p>
<p>Using run-length encoding brings us to 129kb ‚Äî just over 80% smaller than our uncompressed data. We‚Äôre doing pretty well, but those last few percentage points are the trickiest ones to eke out. We‚Äôre gonna need to try something new.</p>
<compression-table rows="5"></compression-table>
<h3 id="binary-encoding">Binary Encoding</h3>
<p>So far, we‚Äôre at just more than an 80% decrease. That‚Äôs pretty good, and we could probably get it even smaller if we stopped using JSON. But we‚Äôre running into a fundamental limit: it‚Äôs inefficient to store things as text. To get much further, we‚Äôll need to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">binary encoding</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Wikipedia_favicon_hexdump.svg/1200px-Wikipedia_favicon_hexdump.svg.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Binary file - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>.</p>
<p>When we‚Äôre using a plain text format like JSON, we think in characters. When we‚Äôre using binary encoding, we think in bytes. A byte holds an integer from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>. If we consider groups of bytes as a single unit, it can hold much higher numbers ‚Äî for example, two bytes can hold up to <code>65535</code>.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-uint8array" id="user-content-fnref-uint8array" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The numbers can represent anything we want them to. One common way to interpret them is as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">ASCII</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/USASCII_code_chart.png/1200px-USASCII_code_chart.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">ASCII - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>, meaning each number corresponds to an alphanumeric character. Another way is just as the number they hold, meaning a byte that holds <code>127</code> would represent the number 127. We‚Äôll interpret bytes in a few different ways as we create our format.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll define a format similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">RIFF</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Resource Interchange File Format - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>, which serves as the basis for file types like WAV and AVI. It‚Äôs made up of ‚Äúchunks‚Äù, each of which has two sections: ‚Äúdata‚Äù, which is the actual information we need to store, and a ‚Äúheader‚Äù that identifies the chunk type and tells us how to actually parse the bytes in the data.</p>
<p>First, binary files usually have a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">magic number</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">File format - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico#Magic_number" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a> that identifies the format. Ours will represent the ASCII text <code>CRDT</code>, so the first four bytes of the file will be <code>43 52 44 54</code>.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-base16" id="user-content-fnref-base16" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup> That goes in the ‚Äúinfo‚Äù chunk, along with the width of our artboard.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a diagram of the binary file. The first part contains a human-readable overview; all the data is labeled, and the values are in a format that makes sense to us (for example, you can see that the magic number reads ‚ÄúCRDT‚Äù and that the artboard is 100 pixels wide). The second column contains the raw bytes in the file; each byte shows its index in the file and the hex digits representing its number from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code> (or <code>00</code> to <code>ff</code> in hex). You can hover over data on the left and see the corresponding bytes highlighted, and vice versa.</p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;magic number&quot;, &quot;CRDT&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;artboard width&quot;, 100]], []]]"></binary-visualizer>
<p>After the info chunk, the file has three more chunks: one to hold our UUID table, one to hold our palette table and one to hold our pixel data.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll start with the UUID chunk. The header consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Four bytes that read <code>UUID</code> in ASCII.</li>
<li>Two bytes that represent the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-bounds" id="user-content-fnref-bounds" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">5</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;chunk type&quot;, &quot;UUID&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;chunk length&quot;, 32]], []]]" chunk-start="1"></binary-visualizer>
<p>The UUID chunk‚Äôs data is just all the peer UUIDs, one after the other. These each took up 34 characters (including quotes) in our JSON, but here we can represent each of them in a mere 16 bytes. Just like before, the key will be the index of each UUID ‚Äî so the first one in the chunk will be <code>0</code>, the second will be <code>1</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the full UUID chunk. Each white block represents one item in the chunk data ‚Äî in this case, a UUID:</p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;chunk type&quot;, &quot;UUID&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;chunk length&quot;, 32]], [[&quot;hex&quot;, &quot;uuid 0&quot;, &quot;0442197c814447f7ae64340a2df3d796&quot;], [&quot;hex&quot;, &quot;uuid 1&quot;, &quot;4ae8bd76e84c4652bcd8a5e339c574f3&quot;]]]]" chunk-start="1"></binary-visualizer>
<p>The next chunk is the palette chunk. The header looks similar to the UUID chunk header:</p>
<ol>
<li>Four bytes that read <code>PLTT</code> in ASCII.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-missing" id="user-content-fnref-missing" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">6</a></sup></li>
<li>Two bytes that represent the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes.</li>
</ol>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;chunk type&quot;, &quot;PLTT&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;chunk length&quot;, 9]], []]]" chunk-start="2"></binary-visualizer>
<p>The palette chunk‚Äôs data is also similar to the UUID chunk‚Äôs data: all the colors, one after the other. When we represented these with hex codes, they took up either five or eight bytes, but here we can represent each one in a concise three bytes ‚Äî one for each RGB color channel.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-rgb" id="user-content-fnref-rgb" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">7</a></sup></p>
<p>This chunk has one extra quirk: when writing to the data, we skip the first item‚Äôs place (so the first color starts as the fourth byte of data, or tenth byte including the header). That might not make sense now, but we‚Äôll learn why in a minute.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the full palette chunk:</p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;chunk type&quot;, &quot;PLTT&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;chunk length&quot;, 9]], [[&quot;rgb&quot;, &quot;color 0&quot;, [0,0,0]], [&quot;rgb&quot;, &quot;color 1&quot;, [255,255,255]], [&quot;rgb&quot;, &quot;color 2&quot;, [108,79,255]]]]]" chunk-start="2"></binary-visualizer>
<p>The last chunk is the data chunk. You know the drill by now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Four bytes that read <code>DATA</code> in ASCII.</li>
<li>Two bytes that represent the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes.</li>
</ol>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;chunk type&quot;, &quot;DATA&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;chunk length&quot;, 23]], []]]" chunk-start="3"></binary-visualizer>
<p>That‚Äôs the header. There are two types of items that can appear in the data chunk: pixels and blanks. Each item will start with a single byte ‚Äútag‚Äù indicating which type it is ‚Äî <code>0</code> for blank and <code>1</code> for pixel.</p>
<p>Blank items are easy. After the tag, they have two single bytes indicating how many consecutive blank spaces they represent.</p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[], [[&quot;item&quot;, [&quot;u8&quot;, &quot;blank tag&quot;, &quot;0&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;run length&quot;, 97]]]]]" chunk-start="3"></binary-visualizer>
<p>There‚Äôs a tradeoff here: by using two bytes to indicate the run length, a single blank item can represent up to 65,535 blank spaces. But then every blank item needs to use two bytes to represent the number of spaces ‚Äî even if none of them need the second byte. If we used one byte, it would mean each blank item is more compact, but if there are more than 255 blank pixels in a row we‚Äôd need to use two or more consecutive blank items to represent them.</p>
<p>Pixel items are a bit more complicated. Remember, each pixel is really a LWW Register, which has three pieces of information: the peer ID that last wrote to the register, the timestamp and the value. After the tag, a pixel item has a section for each one:</p>
<ol>
<li>A byte for the peer ID, indicating its index in the UUID chunk.</li>
<li>A byte for the timestamp.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-maxtimestamp" id="user-content-fnref-maxtimestamp" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">8</a></sup></li>

<p>We also need a way to store erased pixels. In the JSON format, we stored <code>null</code> as a way to indicate that the pixel had been added and then erased. In binary, there‚Äôs no <code>null</code> ‚Äî all we have are bytes. That‚Äôs why we skipped the first three bytes when writing the palette chunk: we know that no color will use the <code>0</code> index. If any pixel has <code>0</code> as its index, that pixel was erased.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs our full file. As you hover over pixel data that refers to items in the UUID and palette chunks, you‚Äôll see arrows pointing back to the actual data in those chunks.</p>

<p>This gets us down to just 40kb. An RGB color takes up three bytes, and at this size we‚Äôre representing it with only a single byte of overhead! At an almost 94% reduction from the uncompressed data, we‚Äôve already done a great job and could probably stop here if we wanted. But we can take it even further.</p>
<compression-table rows="6"></compression-table>
<h3 id="run-length-binary-encoding">Run-Length Binary Encoding</h3>
<p>We‚Äôre in the home stretch now. The info, UUID and palette chunks are about as compact as can be, but we can save a bunch of space in the data chunk.</p>
<p>If you recall a couple sections ago, the reason we run-length encoded the only blank spaces was that each pixel had three pieces of information that could vary independently: the timestamp, the peer ID of the last writer and the color. We‚Äôre going to split those up into individual chunks ‚Äî one for each piece of information. Within each chunk, there will be only one single thing that can vary between items, which will let us use run-length encoding on each individual piece of data. So instead of one data chunk, we‚Äôll have three: a writer chunk, a color chunk and a timestamp chunk.</p>
<p>The writer and color chunks are very similar to each other. Their headers have four bytes that read <code>WRTR</code> (for the writer chunk) or <code>COLR</code> (for the color chunk) in ASCII and two bytes for the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes. Each item in these chunks takes up three bytes: one for the index of the corresponding item in the UUID or palette chunk, and two for the length of the run.</p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;,&quot;chunk type&quot;,&quot;WRTR&quot;],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;chunk length&quot;,6]],[[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;uuid index&quot;,0],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run length&quot;,100]],[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;uuid index&quot;,1],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run length&quot;,2]]]],[[[&quot;txt&quot;,&quot;chunk type&quot;,&quot;COLR&quot;],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;chunk length&quot;,9]],[[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;palette index&quot;,1],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run length&quot;,2]],[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;palette index&quot;,0],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run length&quot;,98]],[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;palette index&quot;,2],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run length&quot;,2]]]]]" chunk-start="3"></binary-visualizer>
<p>You might notice that there are two items in the writer data, but three items in the color data. It means that ‚Äî going from the top left pixel to the bottom right ‚Äî the peer who wrote to each pixel changes twice, but the color changes three times. Because we‚Äôre now keeping track of each kind of data separately, we can compress them without worrying about the others.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-confusing" id="user-content-fnref-confusing" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The final chunk is the timestamp chunk. The header has four bytes that read <code>TIME</code> in ASCII, and two bytes for the length of the data items in bytes. Each item in the timestamp chunk starts with a single byte representing the timestamp of that pixel. We can use a clever trick here to disambiguate blank pixels from drawn pixels. When we instantiate a LWW Register, the timestamp is set to <code>1</code>. There will never be a register with a timestamp of <code>0</code>, which means we can use that value to indicate a blank pixel.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll use the same run-length encoding strategy from the previous binary format. If the timestamp is a positive number, the next byte will be the next timestamp. But if the timestamp is <code>0</code>, we‚Äôll interpret the next two bytes as the length of the run of blank pixels.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-porquenolosdos" id="user-content-fnref-porquenolosdos" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">10</a></sup></p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;,&quot;chunk type&quot;,&quot;TIME&quot;],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;chunk length&quot;,8]],[[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,3],[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,4],[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,2],[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,0],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run-length&quot;,97]],[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,2],[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,3]]]]" chunk-start="5"></binary-visualizer>
<p>That also lets us save a bit of space by ignoring runs of blank pixels in the writer and color chunks, by which I mean that a blank pixel doesn‚Äôt end the run of a UUID or color. Only when we see a different UUID or color do we start a new run. We consider the timestamp chunk to be the ultimate authority on whether a pixel is blank: if the timestamp is <code>0</code>, then it doesn‚Äôt matter what we think the UUID or color is.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, even though state-based CRDTs require their whole state to be synced between peers, it‚Äôs possible to for the actual data transferred to be significantly more efficient. We took a CRDT state weighing in at 648kb and reduced its size by almost 98% to only 14kb!</p>

<p>Why do we need to know the length in advance? With binary, we don‚Äôt usually use delimiters like quotes or brackets to indicate when things begin or end.

<p>Using one byte for the timestamp makes each pixel smaller, but limits us to a maximum timestamp of 255.

Since we know the maximum timestamp in advance, we could make an optimization here: use two bytes to store the timestamp if and only if one of the timestamps is above 255.

This means that the trade unions and the employers' organizations determine the rules of the game in the labour market, without interference from the state and politicians. In Sweden, approximately nine out of ten workers are covered by collective agreements. </p><p>The terms of the collective agreement include wages, form of employment, occupational pension, working hours, vacations, and periods of notice. Thus, the employers benefit from industry-specific, long-term, and stable ground rules. </p><p>The collective agreements are negotiated on a sector-by-sector basis, and employees are guaranteed the wages and working conditions that are standard across the sector. This allows for companies to operate on a level playing field, while avoiding the risk of any one employer distorting competition in the sector by imposing poor conditions on their employees. </p><h3>Very few labour market conflicts in Sweden</h3> <p>Once a collective agreement is signed, both employers and employees have the obligation to keep the peace. This applies throughout the term of the agreement and ensures that no one can strike to obtain better conditions than those set out in the agreement. </p><p>As a result, the collective agreement ensures a Swedish labour market with very few industrial actions, conflicts or strikes. It is grounded on a long-standing Swedish tradition of over 100 years of negotiations between the labour market parties. The collective agreement creates a situation of clarity and order for both employees and employers, while avoiding conflicts. </p><h3>We strive for a swift solution</h3> <p>IF Metall signs approximately 200 local collective agreements a year in the industry sector.&nbsp; Very rarely do we end up in conflict. At the most part, we have one conflict a year, usually ending in a signed agreement. </p><p>IF Metall of course want our members at Tesla to have the same decent and safe working conditions as the members at other similar companies in Sweden. </p><p>Even though we have called for industrial action, it is our sincere hope that Tesla will finally start negotiating and sign a collective agreement for their plants in Sweden. </p><p>Tesla is a global leader in the green transition. We hope that they will be willing to express the same level of leadership regarding working conditions for their employees and our members. We strive for and look forward to a swift solution. </p><p><strong>Fact:</strong> IF Metall, Industrial metalworkers in Sweden, is the trade union organizing 300 000 members within the manufacturing and chemical industries, in mining, and in the automotive industry. </p>  </article></div>]]></description>

<p>Several months after Feynman‚Äôs death, while working on what would become <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Life-Science-Richard-Feynman/dp/0679747044/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/genius-the-life-and-science-of-richard-feynman/oclc/25316182&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) ‚Äî the masterly biography plumbing <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/05/11/richard-feynman-genius-james-gleick/">the wellspring of Feynman‚Äôs genius</a> ‚Äî James Gleick discovered something of arresting strangeness and splendor. </p>
<p>‚ÄúMy heart stopped,‚Äù Gleick tells me. ‚ÄúI have never had an experience like that as a biographer, before or since.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a mass of unread papers sent to him by Feynman‚Äôs widow, Gweneth, Gleick found a letter that discomposed his most central understanding of Feynman‚Äôs character. A generation after computing pioneer Alan Turing <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/02/17/alan-turing-morcom-letters/">tussled with the binary code of body and spirit in the wake of loss</a>, Feynman ‚Äî a scientist perhaps <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/01/01/ode-to-a-flower-richard-feynman/">uncommonly romantic</a> yet resolutely rational and unsentimental in his reverence for the indomitable laws of physics that tend toward decay ‚Äî penned a remarkable letter to a physical nonentity that was, for the future Nobel-winning physicist, the locus of an irrepressible metaphysical reality. </p>

<p>In high school, the teenage Richard spent summers at the beach in his native Far Rockaway. There, he grew besotted with a striking girl named Arline ‚Äî a girl he knew he would marry. Both complement and counterpoint to his own nature, Arline met Richard‚Äôs inclination for science with ardor for philosophy and art. (The art class he took just to be near her would lay the foundation for his <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/01/17/richard-feynman-ofey-sketches-drawings/">little-known, lifelong passion for drawing</a>.) By his junior year, Richard proposed. Arline accepted. With the eyes of young love, they peered into a shared future of infinite possibility for bliss. </p>

<p>But they were abruptly grounded when a mysterious malady began afflicting Arline with inexplicable symptoms ‚Äî a lump would appear and disappear on her neck, fevers would roil over her with no apparent cause. Eventually, she was hospitalized for what was believed to be typhoid. </p>
<p>Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Feynman began to glimpse the special powerlessness that medical uncertainty can inflict on a scientific person. He had come to believe that the scientific way of thinking brought a measure of calmness and control in difficult situations ‚Äî but not now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as Feynman began bombarding the doctors with questions that steered them toward a closer approximation of the scientific method, Arline began to recover just as mysteriously and unpredictably as she had fallen ill. But the respite was only temporary. The symptoms returned, still shorn of a concrete explanation but now unambiguously pointing toward the terminal ‚Äî a prognosis Arline‚Äôs doctors kept from her. Richard refused to go along with the deception ‚Äî he and Arline had promised each other to face life with unremitting truthfulness ‚Äî but he was forced to calibrate his commitment to circumstance. </p>
<p>Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>His parents, Arline‚Äôs parents, and the doctors all urged him not to be so cruel as to tell a young woman she was dying. His sister, Joan, sobbing, told him he was stubborn and heartless. He broke down and bowed to tradition. In her room at Farmingdale Hospital, with her parents at her side, he confirmed that she had glandular fever. Meanwhile, he started carrying around a letter ‚Äî a ‚Äúgoodbye love letter,‚Äù as he called it ‚Äî that he planned to give her when she discovered the truth. He was sure she would never forgive the unforgivable lie. </p>
<p>He did not have long to wait. Soon after Arline returned home from the hospital she crept to the top of the stairs and overheard her mother weeping with a neighbor down in the kitchen. When she confronted Richard ‚Äî his letter snug in his pocket ‚Äî he told her the truth, handed her the letter, and asked her to marry him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Marriage, however, proved to be a towering practical problem ‚Äî Princeton, where Feynman was now pursuing a Ph.D., threatened to withdraw the fellowships funding his graduate studies if he were to wed, for the university considered the emotional and pragmatic responsibilities of marriage a grave threat to academic discipline. </p>
<p>Just as Feynman began considering leaving Princeton, a diagnosis detonated the situation ‚Äî Arline had contracted a rare form of tuberculosis, most likely from unpasteurized milk. </p>
<p>At first, Feynman was relieved that the grim alternative options of Hodgkin‚Äôs disease and incurable cancers like lymphoma had been ruled out. But he was underestimating, or perhaps misunderstanding, the gravity of tuberculosis ‚Äî the very disease which had <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/02/17/alan-turing-morcom-letters/">taken the love of Alan Turing‚Äôs life</a> and which, during its two-century heyday, had claimed more lives around the globe than any other malady and all wars combined. At the time of Arline‚Äôs diagnosis in 1941, immunology was in its infancy, the antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections practically nonexistent, and the first successful medical application of penicillin a year away. Tuberculosis was a death sentence, even if it was a slow death with intervals of remission ‚Äî a fact Richard and Arline faced with an ambivalent mix of brave lucidity and hope against hope. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Richard‚Äôs parents met the prospect of his marriage with bristling dread. His mother, who believed he was marrying Arline out of pity rather than love, admonished him that he would be putting his health and his very life in danger, and coldly worried about how the stigma attached to tuberculosis would impact her brilliant young son‚Äôs reputation. ‚ÄúI was surprised to learn such a marriage is not unlawful,‚Äù she scoffed unfeelingly. ‚ÄúIt ought to be.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Richard was buoyed by love ‚Äî a love so large and luminous that he found himself singing aloud one day as he was arranging Arline‚Äôs transfer to a sanatorium. Determined to go through with the wedding, he wrote to his beloved:</p>
<blockquote><p>I guess maybe it is like rolling off of a log ‚Äî my heart is filled again &amp; I‚Äôm choked with emotions ‚Äî and love is so good &amp; powerful ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth preserving ‚Äî I know nothing can separate us ‚Äî we‚Äôve stood the tests of time and our love is as glorious now as the day it was born ‚Äî dearest riches have never made people great but love does it every day ‚Äî we‚Äôre not little people ‚Äî we‚Äôre giants ‚Ä¶ I know we both have a future ahead of us ‚Äî with a world of happiness ‚Äî now &amp; forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>On June 29, 1942, they promised each other eternity. </p>

<p>Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>He borrowed a station wagon from a Princeton friend, outfitted it with mattresses for the journey, and picked up Arline in Cedarhurst. She walked down her father‚Äôs hand-poured concrete driveway wearing a white dress. They crossed New York Harbor on the Staten Island ferry ‚Äî their honeymoon ship. They married in a city office on Staten Island, in the presence of neither family nor friends, their only witnesses two strangers called in from the next room. Fearful of contagion, Richard did not kiss her on the lips. After the ceremony he helped her slowly down the stairs, and onward they drove to Arline‚Äôs new home, a charity hospital in Browns Mills, New Jersey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, WWII was reaching its crescendo of destruction, dragging America into the belly of death with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Now one of the nation‚Äôs most promising physicists, Feynman was recruited to work on what would become <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2011/10/14/richard-feynman-graphic-novel-biography-ottoviani/">the Manhattan Project</a> and soon joined the secret laboratory in Los Alamos. </p>

<p>Arline entered the nearby Albuquerque sanatorium, from where she wrote him letters in code ‚Äî for the sheer fun of it, because she knew how he cherished puzzles, but the correspondence alarmed the military censors at the laboratory‚Äôs Intelligence Office. Tasked with abating any breaches to the secrecy of the operation, they cautioned Feynman that coded messages were against the rules and demanded that his wife include a key in each letter to help them decipher it. This only amplified Arline‚Äôs sense of fun ‚Äî she began cutting holes into her letters, covering passages with ink, and even mail-ordered a jigsaw puzzle kit with which to cut up the pages and completely confound the agents. </p>
<p>But the levity masked the underlying darkness which Richard and Arline tried so desperately to evade ‚Äî Arline was dying. As her body failed, he steadied himself to her spirit:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are a strong and beautiful woman. You are not always as strong as other times but it rises &amp; falls like the flow of a mountain stream. I feel I am a reservoir for your strength ‚Äî without you I would be empty and weak‚Ä¶ I find it much harder these days to write these things to you.</p></blockquote>
<p>In every single letter, he told her that he loved her. <em>‚ÄúI have a serious affliction: loving you forever,‚Äù</em> he wrote. </p>

<p>In early 1945, two and a half years into their marriage, Richard and Arline made love for the first time. He had been too afraid of harming her frail health somehow, she too afraid of infecting him with the deadly bacterium consuming her. But Arline insisted that this pent up desire could no longer be contained and assured Richard that this would only bring them closer ‚Äî to each other, and to the life they had so lovingly dreamt up for themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p>I‚Äôll always be your sweetheart &amp; first love ‚Äî besides a devoted wife ‚Äî we‚Äôll be proud parents too‚Ä¶ I am proud of you always Richard ‚Äì[you are] a good husband, and lover, &amp; well, coach, I‚Äôll show you what I mean Sunday.</p></blockquote>
<p>But heightened as their hopes were by this new dimension of shared experience, Arline‚Äôs health continued to plummet. Her weight dropped to eighty-four pounds. Exasperated by the helplessness of medicine, which Feynman had come to see not as a manifestation but as a mutilation of the scientific method, he invested all hope in an experimental drug made of mold growths. ‚ÄúKeep hanging on,‚Äù he exhorted Arline. ‚ÄúNothing is certain. We lead a charmed life.‚Äù She began spitting blood. </p>
<p>At twenty-seven, on the precipice of a brilliant scientific career, he was terminally in love. </p>
<p>On June 16, 1945, while working at the computing room at Los Alamos, Feynman received a call from the sanatorium that Arline was dying. He borrowed a colleague‚Äôs car and sped to the hospital, where he found her immobile, her eyes barely tracing his movement. Early in his scientific career, he had been animated by the nature of time. Now, hours stretched and contracted as he sat at her deathbed, until one last small breath tolled the end at 9:21PM.</p>
<p>The wake of loss has a way of tranquilizing grief with the pressing demands of practical arrangements ‚Äî a tranquilizer we take willingly, almost gratefully. The following morning, Feynman arranged for his beloved‚Äôs cremation, methodically collected her personal belongings, and on the final page of the small spiral notebook in which she recorded her symptoms he wrote with scientific remove: ‚ÄúJune 16 ‚Äî Death.‚Äù</p>
<p>And so we arrive at Gleick‚Äôs improbable discovery in that box of letters ‚Äî improbable because of the extreme rationality with which Feynman hedged against even the slightest intimation of metaphysical conjectures untestable by science and unprovable by reason. During his courtship of Arline, he had been vexed by her enthusiasm for Descartes, whose ‚Äúproof‚Äù of God‚Äôs perfection he found intellectually lazy and unbefitting of Descartes‚Äôs reputation as <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/03/31/descartes-rules-for-the-direction-of-the-mind/">a champion of reason</a>. He had impishly countered Arline‚Äôs insistence that there are two sides to everything by cutting a piece of paper and half-twisting it into a M√∂bius strip, the ends pasted together to render a surface with just one side. </p>
<p>Everything that appeared mystical, Feynman believed, was simply an insufficiently explained mystery with a physical answer not yet found. Even Arline‚Äôs dying hour had offered testing ground for conviction. Puzzlingly, the clock in the room had stopped at exactly 9:21PM ‚Äî the time of death. Aware of how this bizarre occurrence could foment the mystical imagination in unscientific minds, Feynman reasoned for an explanation. Remembering that he had repaired the clock multiple times over the course of Arline‚Äôs stay at the sanatorium, he realized that the instrument‚Äôs unwieldy mechanism must have choked when the nurse picked it up in the low evening light to see and record the time. </p>
<p>How astonishing and how touchingly human, then, that Feynman penned the letter Gleick found in the box forty-two years later ‚Äî a letter he wrote to Arline in October of 1946, 488 days after her death:</p>
<blockquote><p>D‚ÄôArline,</p>
<p>I adore you, sweetheart.</p>
<p>I know how much you like to hear that ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt only write it because you like it ‚Äî I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.</p>
<p>It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you ‚Äî almost two years but I know you‚Äôll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing.</p>
<p>But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.</p>
<p>I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead ‚Äî but I still want to comfort and take care of you ‚Äî and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you ‚Äî I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together ‚Äî or learn Chinese ‚Äî or getting a movie projector. Can‚Äôt I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the ‚Äúidea-woman‚Äù and general instigator of all our wild adventures.</p>
<p>When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn‚Äôt have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true ‚Äî you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else ‚Äî but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.</p>
<p>I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don‚Äôt want to be in my way. I‚Äôll bet you are surprised that I don‚Äôt even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can‚Äôt help it, darling, nor can I ‚Äî I don‚Äôt understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don‚Äôt want to remain alone ‚Äî but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.</p>
<p>My darling wife, I do adore you.</p>
<p>I love my wife. My wife is dead.</p>
<p>Rich.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, with the sole defibrillator for heartache we have ‚Äî humor ‚Äî Feynman adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>PS Please excuse my not mailing this ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt know your new address.</p></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="dataContent">
                                    <p><span>When Maya Santamaria was opening a Minneapolis club in 2003, a city worker handed her a card for a Minneapolis police officer and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to work with this guy.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>To get a business license, a licensing employee told her she had to hire a certain number of off-duty Minneapolis police officers to provide security.</span></p>
<p><span>Why?</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre racist and we‚Äôre Mexican,‚Äù Santamaria said. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt want to let Mexicans have nightclubs.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>That‚Äôs her conclusion after seeing other similar-sized, white-owned venues escape the same mandate.</span></p>
<p><span>With over a million dollars invested, Santamaria had little choice. ‚ÄúYou gotta do what they say,‚Äù she said.</span></p>
<p><span>Then, MPD ‚Äúsocked it to me,‚Äù she said. She started out paying the officers $40 to $45 an hour, always more than one officer per night. And they didn‚Äôt just work one or two hours; they charged a minimum of four hours no matter how many they actually worked, she said. The pay gradually increased to nearly $60 an hour.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúI spent hundreds of thousands of dollars,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere were many years I wasn‚Äôt making it, and they didn‚Äôt give a damn.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria was later required to come up with security plans outlining the number of officers needed per night. The officers insisted on getting paid cash, she said. She feared if she didn‚Äôt oblige, she‚Äôd lose her license.</span></p>
<p><span>Eventually, another officer helped schedule off-duty work: Derek Chauvin. He worked security at her club for 17 years.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThey were in charge and everybody had to go through them,‚Äù she said.</span></p>
<p><span>El Nuevo Rodeo became Minnesota‚Äôs largest Latino concert venue, and while there were a few brawls, ‚ÄúWe never were a problem property,‚Äù Santamaria said.</span></p>
<p><span>MPD officers would usually sit in their squad cars, fully uniformed, and do crossword puzzles or chat with their girlfriends or spouses. Sometimes they‚Äôd leave to go help MPD with calls.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThey were gone half the time,‚Äù Santamaria said. ‚ÄúThey were on my payroll but they were gone.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>She sold the club in 2019. When Santamaria saw Chauvin pinning George Floyd on the pavement in the video that shocked the world, she recognized both, because Floyd worked as a bouncer inside the club in 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>El Nuevo Rodeo burned to the ground during the subsequent riots.</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria‚Äôs allegations about MPD off-duty work are echoed by the experiences of other business owners, documented in government reports and even remarked upon by the city‚Äôs new police chief, Brian O‚ÄôHara.</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.southwestvoices.news/posts/new-police-chief-candidly-talks-about-youth-violence-police-policies"><span> He </span><span>said</span></a><span> the system is ‚Äúripe for corruption,‚Äù citing a </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nj.com/hudson/2020/12/jersey-city-brings-back-off-duty-jobs-program-for-cops-after-halting-it-over-of-corruption.html"><span>federal investigation</span></a><span> in Jersey City, where a dozen cops were arrested due to widespread corruption of off-duty work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The timing is favorable for more rigorous oversight: MPD is soon to be operating under both state and federal supervision following damning investigative reports about racist policing, and O‚ÄôHara is a newish outsider who speaks the rhetoric of reform.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Changes to off-duty policy face a key obstacle, however: A 1997 court injunction restricts how much the city can manage officers‚Äô side gigs. Given the injunction, the city can only seek major reforms via the collective bargaining process, which means if the city wants to change off-duty policies, it would likely have to give up something in return.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here‚Äôs how the off-duty work program works: Some businesses ‚Äî like large nightclubs ‚Äî&nbsp;are required by the city to have security, which until 2020, sometimes had to be off-duty Minneapolis police officers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The city can also require that organizers of large events and businesses plagued with a lot of 911 calls also hire off-duty MPD officers. Businesses may also voluntarily hire off-duty officers for security and traffic control, and negotiate pay and hours directly with officers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The city doesn‚Äôt keep track of how much officers are working or how much they‚Äôre paid, or even have access to the contracts. Off-duty work often pays a lot more ‚Äî up to hundreds of dollars per hour ‚Äî than working overtime for MPD.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some officers are still paid in cash, increasing the risk of tax evasion. And, several business owners and Minneapolis officials said some small business owners ‚Äî&nbsp;particularly those owned by immigrants ‚Äî have been led to believe they must hire MPD officers, or risk getting ghosted by police.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It was precisely this arrangement that caught the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice in its 2011 report on the New Orleans Police Department.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, the MPD off-duty situation has parallels to NOPD before the feds arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The recent DOJ investigative report about MPD drew only a passing ‚Äî&nbsp;</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/08/16/doj-mpd-off-duty-work-system-undermines-supervision/"><span>but still condemnatory</span></a><span> ‚Äî reference to off-duty jobs. The DOJ was looking for racism. Some business owners of color say look no further.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h4>‚ÄòInstead of helping us, they‚Äôre hurting us‚Äô</h4>

	
<p><span>Basim Sabri, owner of a Somali mall called Karmel Mall and a Latino mall called Plaza Mexico on Lake Street, said he held a Cinco de Mayo party every year for 27 years to encourage people to come to the area and see that ‚ÄúIt really isn‚Äôt a war zone, it is a beautiful place.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>For years, they never had police there, and then about a dozen years ago, he said, there was a shooting a few blocks away from the event. The city began requiring him to hire off-duty police.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúLake Street has been tremendously damaged, and instead of helping us, they‚Äôre hurting us,‚Äù said Sabri, who once </span><a target="_blank" href="https://bringmethenews.com/news/developer-convicted-in-bribery-back-at-minneapolis-city-hall-pushing-reforms"><span>went to prison</span></a><span> for bribing a city council member.</span></p>
<p><span>The officer rates have skyrocketed, he said. He pays officers $150 to $160 an hour, and a ‚Äúscheduler‚Äù also charges $15 to $20.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the big payouts, when he calls the police for help, they don‚Äôt always respond, Sabri said. About six weeks ago, a man came into his office with a gun and said he was going to shoot someone. They called 911, but the police never came, Sabri said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An MPD spokesman said ‚ÄúGoing back to July 1, all calls we found relating to guns at Karmel Mall did have a police response, and none of the calls match the details‚Äù of Sabri‚Äôs account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Jonathan Soto, owner of EME Antro night club at Fifth Avenue and Lake Street, hired MPD officers ‚Äî including Chauvin ‚Äî to monitor his parking lot for a couple of years, but stopped after Floyd‚Äôs murder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The officers wanted to be paid in cash, and would sometimes leave to respond to police calls, which benefited the city, he said.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThe city kind of liked that,‚Äù Soto said.</span></p>
<p><span>The FBI interviewed him after Floyd was killed, asking how much he paid officers.</span></p>
<p><span>Other business owners said the officers don‚Äôt always respond to problems right under their noses.</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria said the club next to her was tiny but ‚Äúhad to have their own cop,‚Äù who she described as an ‚Äúold guy‚Äù who would refuse to help anybody from her club,</span></p>
<p><span>After several East African-owned stores on Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis were vandalized in September 2019, Capitol Caf√© owner Abdirahman Awad called his friend KB Brown, owner of a north Minneapolis print shop and a member of the Main Street Alliance of Minnesota, a group of progressive business owners.</span></p>
<p><span>KB Brown said the detectives were rude and disrespectful to Awad. Awad said MPD later told him he‚Äôd have to pay off-duty officers $145 an hour to provide security. He returned the next night and saw almost no police presence despite the alleged hate crime. In his view, MPD was sending a message that the cafe would only get protection if it hired off-duty officers.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúI felt so angry about it,‚Äù he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Kevin Brown, another member of the Main Street Alliance, said Somali business owners have told him MPD pressured them to hire off-duty officers, but they‚Äôre afraid to go public because they‚Äôve been threatened with being ‚Äúblacklisted‚Äù by MPD ‚Äî or ignored when they call police for help.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThey get to make the rules,‚Äù Kevin Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span>Not all business owners feel that way, however.</span></p>
<p><span>When John Wolf bought his liquor store, Chicago-Lake Liquors, in 2000, he inherited the off-duty officers who did security there and continued hiring them. Some officers preferred to be paid in cash, but he said he didn‚Äôt do that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One officer scheduled all the shifts, which were 5 p.m. to closing. The cops roved around inside and outside the liquor store and sometimes left to respond to MPD calls ‚Äî even though Wolf was paying them. Wolf didn‚Äôt mind.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúI had really, really good people working here,‚Äù said Wolf, who</span><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/nickhaltermpls/status/1295416454880219137?s=20"> <span>appeared</span></a><span> with Donald Trump at an August 2020 campaign stop.</span></p>
<p><span>But after Floyd‚Äôs murder, he made a business decision to stop hiring the officers because they were ‚Äúpricey‚Äù and ‚Äúhard to get.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;‚ÄúThe situation became very complicated after George Floyd,‚Äù Wolf said.</span></p>
    <h4>
Former council member calls off-duty tactics ‚Äòsleazy and illegal‚Äô
</h4>

	
<p><span>In the aftermath of Floyd‚Äôs killing, MPD went under a microscope, including off-duty work.</span></p>
<p><span>Some private businesses and school districts cut ties with the police. Within days, the Minneapolis Orchestra, Minneapolis Institute of Art and iconic club First Avenue said they‚Äôd no longer hire them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One of the few things the city does keep tabs on is sites for off-duty work, which must be approved. </span><span>Officers worked off-duty at about 500 sites in 2018, but that number has dropped to about 100 this year. About 200 officers have worked these gigs this year, according to </span><span>Regulatory Services Director Enrique Velazquez</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2020, the Minneapolis City Council stopped requiring off-duty officers at licensed events, and let them hire private security instead. In August 2020, </span><span>Velazquez </span><span>told the City Council only four businesses were being required to hire off-duty MPD officers. But some businesses were voluntarily hiring them because they were under the impression they had no choice, he said. Others thought if they hired police officers they would get ‚Äúsome level of preferential treatment,‚Äù he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Velazquez said this was discussed with Mayor Jacob Frey‚Äôs</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/01/31/mayor-frey-aims-to-rein-in-off-duty-police-work-creates-task-force/"> <span>off-duty task force</span></a><span>, which was launched in January 2020, met twice, and then dissolved.</span></p>
<p><span>Former Minneapolis City Council Member Cam Gordon said small businesses owned by immigrants told him they were led to believe they wouldn‚Äôt get police service if they didn‚Äôt hire officers. They didn‚Äôt want to speak publicly about it, he said, out of fear of retaliation.</span></p>
<p><span>Some people of color said they were told if they wanted to get police to respond to 911 calls, they would have to hire the cops for security, and it could cost, say, $800 per night in cash.</span></p>
<p><span>That‚Äôs ‚Äúsleazy‚Äù and illegal, Gordon said.</span></p>
<p><span>Gordon said running a business using city resources ‚Äî uniforms, guns, squad cars ‚Äî without city management, should be considered a violation of the city ethics code, even though the city explicitly allows it, even paying insurance for off-duty work.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIt creates this whole system of unaccountability in terms of the money, especially if people are paid under the table in cash,‚Äù Gordon said.</span></p>
<p><span>A</span><a target="_blank" href="https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/Download/File/2859/Police%20Off-Duty%20Work%20Audit%20Report_Revised%2010092019.pdf"> <span>2019 city audit</span></a><span> noted cash payment was preferred by some employers and officers. The audit recommended ending cash payments and putting the city in charge of the program, but like so many other MPD issues, change has been glacial. MPD policy was updated to limit hours ‚Äî including off-duty gigs ‚Äî and prioritize overtime over off-duty work. MPD is instituting a new timekeeping system to track off-duty hours.</span></p>
<p><span>The city‚Äôs insurance liability for officers working side gigs can get expensive: The city was forced to defend Lt. Mike Sauro after he arrested, handcuffed and beat a 21-year-old college student in a kitchen. Sauro was off duty, working at a club on New Year‚Äôs Eve in 1991. A jury awarded the victim over $1 million in damages, the largest civil award in a police misconduct case in the city‚Äôs history at the time, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/police/uspo86.htm"><span>according</span></a><span> to Human Rights Watch.</span></p>
<p><span>After that, former Police Chief Robert Olson vowed to limit officers‚Äô off-duty time, saying the city didn‚Äôt have the responsibility to make sure private businesses run smoothly. But 28 years later, the off-duty work continues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even amid the fury after Floyd‚Äôs police killing, the council made negligible changes to the off-duty program. Off-duty work is part of the police union contract. The Minneapolis Police Federation said during the last negotiation that any change to off-duty work was a non-starter. Now, negotiations are underway again on the next three-year contract.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h4>City may challenge 1997 injunction that ties its hands on off-duty issues</h4>

	
<p><span>Weeks after Floyd‚Äôs death at the hands of his officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo withdrew from labor negotiations, saying the contract would be reviewed with the help of outside experts.</span></p>
<p><span>But even as crime spiked, MPD began hemorrhaging officers, and a judge</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/briefs/order-requiring-minneapolis-to-hire-more-cops-reversed-by-court-of-appeals/"> <span>ordered</span></a><span> the city to hire more cops to comply with the city charter. Negotiations were suddenly focused on recruiting and retaining cops.</span></p>
<p><span>A coalition of police reform groups called Minneapolis for a Better Police Contract formed in 2019 to push city officials to use the police labor contract as a tool for reform.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúOff-duty work is corrupt,‚Äù said Stacey Gurian-Sherman, a lawyer on the group‚Äôs steering committee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The group made 22 recommendations for the contract, including limiting the number of days and hours officers can work, counting overtime and off-duty work. They recommended officers be paid for off-duty work the same way they‚Äôre paid for ‚Äú</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/briefs/downtown-minneapolis-neighborhood-raising-money-for-more-police-patrols/"><span>buyback</span></a><span>‚Äù work in which neighborhoods or organizations pay for extra patrols. Those officers are paid $107 an hour, but payroll is handled by the city.</span></p>
<p><span>Aside from labor negotiations, the group says the City Council could make changes to make off-duty work centralized, fair and not subject to the whims of any one police officer. St. Paul, Duluth, Bloomington and Rochester all have such centralized systems.</span></p>
<p><span>In January, the City Council voted to review off-duty work, including how officers get jobs, how much they‚Äôre paid and how it affects MPD staffing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Council Member Robin Wonsley authored the legislative directive and is working on a policy that would charge businesses fees to recoup city costs, but the city is largely powerless given the 1990s era court injunction against changing the side gigs policy.</span></p>
<p><span>The 1997 injunction and settlement came after former Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton tried to put the system under the city‚Äôs control. The union argued changes to off-duty must be negotiated as part of the union contract, and the agreement says officers have the right to contract with outside employers. It also says officers aren‚Äôt allowed to act as brokers, though police seem to be ignoring the proscription.</span></p>

<p><span>It would be expensive for the city to take over the off-duty program, however, since officers would be paid through the city, at an overtime rate, and the pay would count toward their pension benefit calculation.</span></p>
<p><span>Mayor Jacob Frey told the </span><i><span>Reformer</span></i><span> off-duty work is ‚Äúone of the more difficult and intractable‚Äù issues facing MPD, and the 1997 injunction is a major roadblock to change.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asked whether the city might try to get it revoked, he said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The police contract doesn‚Äôt give the city much authority over off-duty work, but ideally the city would have more managerial oversight, Frey said.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIt will be a topic that is covered,‚Äù during negotiations, he said. ‚ÄúIt would make the process more fair and equitable both to police officers and businesses hiring them. We could better ensure officers aren‚Äôt overworked by factoring off-duty shifts into work scheduling. It would also streamline the process.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Frey said the city needs its officers working more on-duty, rather than off-duty, which he acknowledges will cost more. In other words, pump up their regular pay so they‚Äôre less inclined to take the lucrative off-duty work.</span></p>
<p><span>Minneapolis police officers start out making about $73,000 annually, but many are working mega overtime hours due to short staffing, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/06/15/minneapolis-police-officers-continue-to-rack-up-hefty-overtime-as-understaffing-continues/"><span>pushing their salaries sky-high</span></a><span>; 70% of officers made six figures last year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neither the police union nor MPD responded to multiple requests for comment.</span></p>
    <h4>MPD system mirrors New Orleans, before reforms</h4>

	
<p><span>Many of the concerns about MPD‚Äôs off-duty system mirror those federal investigators found in New Orleans when the U.S. Department of Justice</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2011/03/17/nopd_report.pdf"> <span>found</span></a><span> their off-duty work ‚Äî what they call paid details ‚Äî facilitated abuse and corruption, contributed to officer fatigue and inequitable policing and was a financial drain on the city.</span></p>
<p><span>A vestige of the days when NOPD‚Äôs starting pay was among the lowest in the nation, paid details became so enticing ‚Äî with some cops paid $300 to $500 a night to provide security for professional athletes ‚Äî that some officers were more committed to the side hustles than their actual jobs.</span></p>
<p><span>NOPD Officers would ‚Äúghost‚Äù work after roll call, leave in the middle of an investigation, and double dip or use sick leave to do details, the DOJ found.</span></p>
<p><span>Last summer, the MPD ‚Äî down 300 officers ‚Äî&nbsp;struggled to cover shifts. Some officers were doing off-duty shifts rather than overtime for the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Only a dozen cops were patrolling downtown on weekend night shifts.</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/08/25/policing-minneapolis-amid-a-staffing-shortage/"> <span>One night</span></a><span>, as a police dispatcher tried to find a cop to respond to reports of a man pointing a gun at people, Lt. Kelly O‚ÄôRourke, who was in charge of policing the downtown area,</span> <span>pulled into a parking lot where an off-duty officer was sitting in a squad car, monitoring the lot near nightclubs.</span></p>
<p><span>The officers make two to four times as much pulling an off-duty shift, so they prefer to do that, O‚ÄôRourke</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/08/25/policing-minneapolis-amid-a-staffing-shortage/"> <span>said</span></a><span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span>The DOJ said MPD‚Äôs system</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/08/16/doj-mpd-off-duty-work-system-undermines-supervision/"> <span>undermines</span></a><span> supervision of officers because patrol officers manage disbursement of the gigs, deciding who gets the work ‚Äî including supervisors. That creates a disincentive for supervisors to hold those officers accountable for misconduct, the DOJ said.</span></p>
<p><span>In New Orleans, the officers scheduling off-duty work got extra pay from businesses, making up to $200 per week, the DOJ found. MPD officers also get paid for scheduling off-duty officers.</span></p>
<p><span>And as in Minneapolis, some New Orleans business owners felt pressured to hire the police.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúBusinesses sometimes feel they must pay for details to obtain the police services that should be provided by NOPD as a matter of routine policing,‚Äù the DOJ said. ‚ÄúIn addition, businesses have no way to hold officers accountable when they do not show up for their contracted detail or perform poorly while on detail.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>In 2010, New Orleans banned cash payments and began centralizing the system, with</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.police1.com/local-government/articles/judge-new-orleans-cops-can-work-more-off-duty-details-to-combat-crime-tAg98hZYnlbfFplt/"> <span>mixed results</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If the city of Minneapolis fails to reform off-duty work, Gurian-Sherman, the lawyer pushing for MPD reforms, hopes the DOJ forces its hand.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThis is happening in full view,‚Äù Gurian-Sherman said. ‚ÄúThe city has to stop looking the other way.‚Äù</span></p>
    <h4>‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a racket‚Äô</h4>

	
<p><span>When it became clear that Chauvin and Floyd knew each other because they both worked at El Nuevo Rodeo, the whole world wanted to hear from Santamaria about her two former employees ‚Äî one dead and one a cop charged with killing him.</span></p>
<p><span>Later, Chauvin was charged with evading taxes on what she‚Äôd paid him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Prosecutors said Chauvin failed to pay taxes on $95,920 he earned doing security for El Nuevo Rodeo between 2014 and 2019. In addition to EME Antro Bar, where prosecutors said Chauvin was paid $250 cash for 3.5 hours, he also worked off-duty shifts at Cub Foods and Midtown Global Market.</span></p>
<p><span>Chauvin pleaded guilty to two crimes in March, saying he didn‚Äôt report the payments due to financial problems, and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria ‚Äî who owns a Spanish language radio station, La Raza 95.7FM ‚Äî was interviewed by state investigators about her work with MPD.</span></p>
<p><span>She looks back on those days with disgust. She sensed the city licensing division was in cahoots with MPD to make minority business owners hire the police.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a racket,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou were damned if you did, damned if you didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ you were always having to break the law.‚Äù</span></p>

<p>We‚Äôve just uploaded mypy 1.6 to the Python Package Index (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/mypy/">PyPI</a>). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:


</p><pre>    python3 -m pip install -U mypy
</pre>

<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href="http://mypy.readthedocs.io/">Read the Docs</a>.

</p><h2>Introduce Error Subcodes for Import Errors</h2>

<p>Mypy now uses the error code <tt>import-untyped</tt> if an import targets an installed library that doesn‚Äôt support static type checking, and no stub files are available. Other invalid imports produce the <tt>import-not-found</tt> error code. They both are subcodes of the <tt>import</tt> error code, which was previously used for both kinds of import-related errors. 

</p><p>Use <tt>--disable-error-code=import-untyped</tt> to only ignore import errors about installed libraries without stubs. This way mypy will still report errors about typos in import statements, for example.

</p><p>If you use  <tt>--warn-unused-ignore</tt> or <tt>--strict</tt>, mypy will complain if you use <tt># type: ignore[import]</tt> to ignore an import error. You are expected to use one of the more specific error codes instead. Otherwise, ignoring the <tt>import</tt> error code continues to silence both errors.

</p><p>This feature was contributed by Shantanu (PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15840">15840</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14740">14740</a>).

</p><h2>Remove Support for Targeting Python 3.6 and Earlier</h2>

<p>Running mypy with <tt>--python-version 3.6</tt>, for example, is no longer supported. Python 3.6 hasn‚Äôt been properly supported by mypy for some time now, and this makes it explicit. This was contributed by Nikita Sobolev (PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15668">15668</a>).

</p><h2>Selective Filtering of <tt>--disallow-untyped-calls</tt> Targets</h2>

<p>Using <tt>--disallow-untyped-calls</tt> could be annoying when using libraries with missing type information, as mypy would generate many errors about code that uses the library. Now you can use <tt>--untyped-calls-exclude=acme</tt>, for example, to disable these errors about calls targeting functions defined in the <tt>acme</tt> package. Refer to the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-untyped-calls-exclude">documentation</a> for more information.

</p><p>This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15845">15845</a>).

</p><h2>Improved Type Inference between Callable Types</h2>

<p>Mypy now does a better job inferring type variables inside arguments of callable types. For example, this code fragment now type checks correctly:


</p><pre>    def f(c: Callable[[T, S], None]) -&gt; Callable[[str, T, S], None]: ...
    def g(*x: int) -&gt; None: ...
    
    reveal_type(f(g))  # Callable[[str, int, int], None]
</pre>

<p>This was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15910">15910</a>).

</p><h2>Don‚Äôt Consider None and TypeVar to Overlap in Overloads</h2>

<p>Mypy now doesn‚Äôt consider an overload item with an argument type <tt>None</tt> to overlap with a type variable:

</p><pre>    @overload
    def f(x: None) -&gt; None: ..
    @overload
    def f(x: T) -&gt; Foo[T]: ...
    ...
</pre>

<p>Previously mypy would generate an error about the definition of <tt>f</tt> above. This is slightly unsafe if the upper bound of <tt>T</tt> is <tt>object</tt>, since the value of the type variable could be <tt>None</tt>. We relaxed the rules a little, since this solves a common issue.

</p><p>This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15846">15846</a>).

</p><h2>Improvements to <tt>--</tt><tt>new-type-inference</tt></h2>

                                  <p>For the first time in a long time, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/layoffs-google-microsoft-salesforce-tech-industry-employees-work-family-lesson-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">tech workers are in a funk</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The industry of innovation was long an outlier when it came to employee satisfaction. Sure, the business goals were ambitious and the deadlines were daunting, but the allure of building the future drew eager, educated young people into tech ‚Äî not to mention the high salaries, potential for stock-market riches, laid-back dress codes, and gleaming offices with meals and gyms. This rare combination of generous compensation and a reasonable work-life balance kept tech workers happier than employees in other industries. Before the pandemic, over 80% of tech workers routinely said they would recommend their company to a friend, according to Glassdoor company reviews, higher than almost every other industry we tracked.&nbsp;</p><p>All that changed in 2023: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-industry-fake-work-problem-bad-managers-bosses-layoffs-jobs-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Employee satisfaction among tech workers</a> has plummeted, falling in line with workers in finance and consulting ‚Äî industries that often compete for the same pool of highly educated and in-demand talent. The growing angst among the tech class is palpable in anonymous online communities like<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/apps.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"> Glassdoor's Fishbowl</a>, in work-focused <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-linkedin-got-weird-work-life-blurred-lines-of-oversharing-2023-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">social media like Linkedin</a>, and even in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-slack-channel-for-workers-on-performance-improvement-plans-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">internal Slack groups</a>. Reading through the anonymous and semi-anonymous woes and tips from the Glassdoor community, it's clear that many laid-off techies and new STEM grads are struggling to find work, applying to more open roles, and in some cases, lowering their expectations for pay and job satisfaction.&nbsp;</p><p>One data analyst in Glassdoor's #JobsInTech group recently wrote: "Cannot believe how difficult it has been this year to get a job. Applied for well over 600 jobs since 1st June, had a fair few interviews, but not getting any further. This is killing me." A <a href="https://joinfishbowl.com/post_c1uc1myi35" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">project manager</a> expressed similar frustration: "I have been looking for over a year now. 25 years in IT. Sent out more than 900 applications. Reduced my rate in half. Do I just give up at this point and switch professions." These often raw sentiments stand in sharp contrast to the Goldilocks outlook painted by official labor-market data for the broader economy.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are plenty of explanations for this sudden vibe shift ‚Äî from rising interest rates to stock-market swings ‚Äî an inconvenient truth is that much of the tech sector's problems stem from the fact that the industry strayed from its roots of listening to the front lines. The collaborative culture at tech companies not only kept employees happy but also helped create better products for customers. The buildup of layers of management without also adding tech-savvy workers that build core products has resulted in a sclerotic environment that is weighing on employees. If the tech industry wants to get back to the flow zone of innovation, productivity, and workplace happiness, executives must restart conversations with the front-line workers that make their products ‚Äî or risk losing what made Silicon Valley so desirable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Big tech, big money, big worries</h2><p>The easiest way for tech companies to explain away the sudden <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-job-site-blind-anxiety-burnout-recession-stock-crash-2022-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">sentiment shift</a> among tech workers is to place the blame on the curdling of the broader economic climate.</p><p>For over a decade, low-interest rates, steady consumer confidence, and an increasingly educated workforce created a business ecosystem that encouraged companies to make bold bets on the future. Tech companies, with visions of new ways of connecting the world and living our lives, were uniquely positioned to take advantage of this appetite for growth. To be credible, these bold bets required a patina of scientific innovation ‚Äî Silicon Valley needed a phalanx of smart, savvy knowledge workers to deliver on the underlying promise of their new products. To woo these potential employees, tech companies had to lure them with cash or a better quality of life than the grueling but lucrative workplace culture of Wall Street firms. Over the past decade, the influx of investor cash facilitated by the favorable economic environment made those promises easy to keep.</p><p>That fertile ground was slowly salted over the past two years as the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates higher. By increasing the cost of borrowing money to fund risky ideas, rate hikes forced businesses across the economy to reevaluate the bets on their balance sheets and cut projects deemed unlikely to bring in profits in the short term. In an industry like tech, where companies regularly make multibillion-dollar bets on emerging technology that may not produce real profits for years, that's a lot of reevaluation.&nbsp;</p><p>Several prominent tech companies have taken an uncompromising stance to limit growth in compensation costs and enforce in-office work mandates: Microsoft <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-wont-raise-salaries-for-full-time-employees-this-year-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">announced</a> in May that full-time employees would not receive raises this year, and Amazon has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-andy-jassy-rto-office-policy-employee-jobs-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">notified</a> employees reluctant to return to the office that their jobs might be at stake. Winter and spring layoffs this year stretched some teams thin, and the looming threat of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-ai-technology-end-of-coding-software-developers-jobs-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">generative AI</a> is sparking fears of job insecurity among workers who long viewed themselves as the winners in the enduring race between man and machine.&nbsp;</p><p>This turn in the economy is starting to weigh on the tech job market. Despite largely pristine <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jobs-unemployment-rate-labor-market-september-report-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">headline jobs data</a>, the tech job market has become a distinct pocket of weakness. The labor market has softened sharply in at least two prominent tech communities ‚Äî <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/conversation-starter-tech-metro-recessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">the California Bay Area and Austin, Texas</a> ‚Äî where the local unemployment rate has increased by more than half a percentage point over the past year, a common signal of imminent recession. <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/jobs-report-preview-september-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Unemployment claims</a> from information-sector workers have doubled compared to a year ago ‚Äî and, pandemic aside, are now on par with the highest levels since 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>But the truth is that the pressures of the broader economy are not the main cause of a sag in tech-worker satisfaction. Many other industries have felt the squeeze of higher interest rates and their spillover to consumer spending, but none have seen their employees' satisfaction dip as significantly as Silicon Valley. The underlying reasons for the unhappiness among tech workers have been building for some time ‚Äî and they strike at the very heart of the industry's once-vaunted conventions.</p><h2>From hoodies to neckties</h2><p>At the core of the tech industry's current malaise is an aging corporate culture. Glassdoor employee-satisfaction data reveals two big changes that have been unfolding over the past several years, predating but accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the "<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/jobs-report-preview-february-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">managementization</a>" of tech. Over the past five years or so, the ratio of front-line workers to managers has deteriorated ‚Äî meaning there are more managers for every "maker" in tech than before. Earlier this year, before layoffs aimed to flatten organizational hierarchies, the number of front-line jobs was more or less where it stood on the eve of the pandemic, while the number of managerial jobs was 9% higher. Economy wide, there were on average 6.6 front-line workers per manager in 2018 and 2019, but post-pandemic, the ratio dropped to 6 to 1.</p><p>While the trend is not unique to the tech industry ‚Äî it's also visible in industries like finance and healthcare ‚Äî it's a sharp contrast from the historically flat hierarchies at companies that fueled the 1990s tech boom and a jarring shift for employees who were used to a more direct line to the top. Of course, many tech managers also perform front-line tasks such as coding or data analysis, and some managers manage processes instead of people (for instance, transportation managers). It's possible that as tech companies have grown into more complex organizations, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-managers-great-flattening-organization-meta-tech-layoffs-firing-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">more management layers</a> are necessary. But the underlying result is the same: The people building the products are increasingly removed from the people making strategic decisions.</p><p>Second, it's an open secret that the best jobs in tech aren't necessarily technical. The workers at big tech companies who report the highest job satisfaction in Glassdoor reviews aren't in technical or builder roles like engineering or science. While non-STEM roles ‚Äî for instance, in human resources and marketing ‚Äî can and often do contribute to cutting-edge technological innovations, they are more likely to focus on supporting and enabling the core technology.</p><p>It's worth asking why the employees furthest from the technical frontier are happier in their jobs than those making the actual products. Perhaps it's that they are more grateful for the opportunity, suspecting that their job opportunities might be bleaker in other industries ‚Äî a sentiment suggested by the writer Kristi Coulter in her recently published <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374600907/exitinterview" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">memoir</a> about her decade-long career at Amazon. Or perhaps the rankings reflect overextended and under-resourced technical ranks.&nbsp;</p><p>The unavoidable truth is that working at the most familiar standard-bearers of tech has become a lot like working elsewhere in the economy: High pay is usually justified by a more demanding schedule and longer workdays (and often "work weekends"). This evolution isn't unusual ‚Äî it's the well-trodden path for past generations of industry innovators. With time, they become bigger, more stable, and more routine. The tech titans of prior generations ‚Äî from Ford Motor Company in the 1920s to Intel in the 1990s ‚Äî were once workplace innovators but came to be known as boring, corporate giants as they aged into staples of the global economy.</p><h2>Can tech turn it around?</h2><p>All is not lost for the tech industry, however. Recapturing the spark of innovation among employees will require executives to recalibrate their organizational compass: flatten org structures, focus on the long horizon so that employees have the opportunity to feel stable in their roles, and re-prioritize investment in the core technical talent that drives the development of crucial products.&nbsp;</p><p>Fundamentally, it's about listening to and elevating the voices of front-line employees. When the workers directly involved in creating the technology are allowed to speak up, unconventional, bold ideas tend to bubble up. By asking questions beyond the senior management echo chamber, engaging employees one-on-one, and creating spaces for employees to voice their hopes and hunches in psychologically safe forums, tech companies can not only reignite their workplace culture but also better serve customers.&nbsp;</p><p>This kind of productive communication has perhaps become harder in an era of remote work ‚Äî but we shouldn't pretend that it comes effortlessly in the office either. It's a starkly different, humbler skill set from the TED Talk theatrics and fundraising prowess that drove tech success over the past decade. To shake tech workers out of their recent funk and get the industry back on a path of innovation, companies need to start listening to their builders again and empower them to do what they do best.</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/aaron-terrazas" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Aaron Terrazas</a> is chief economist at Glassdoor, providing research, analysis and commentary on today's evolving workplace and fast-changing labor market.</em></p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>A Medium story first popped in to my feed last year and it got me thinking about the state of how the tech industry interviews and evaluates candidates.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrlschn.dev/img/code-review-as-interview/coderev-1.png" alt="Medium article focused on why many senior devs fail leetcode interviews">
<em><a href="https://medium.com/the-coding-diaries/why-experienced-programmers-fail-coding-interviews-b22210ba343">https://medium.com/the-coding-diaries/why-experienced-programmers-fail-coding-interviews-b22210ba343</a></em></p>
<p>Recently, a friend shared with  me his plans to take some time off to study for common leetcode problems to practice as he was planning his applications for FAANG companies.</p>
<p>Is that really what one wants to select for when hiring for a new member of an engineering team‚Ää-‚Ääthe person that had the most free time to invest in studying leetcode challenges?</p>
<p>Having been on both sides of the coin, I have always had a dislike for leetcode exercises as an evaluation mechanism for technical candidates for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As much as solving algorithmically complex problems is fun and rewarding, the reality is that for most productive developers, most of our coding time isn‚Äôt really focused on this type of work.</li>
<li>Most of us regularly reference StackOverflow, documentation, and other online resources when solving challenging coding problems day-to-day. We‚Äôll chat with peers and whiteboard different ideas. With the explosion of AI coding tools, many devs are already including Copilot and ChatGPT into their workflows.</li>
<li>Many types/classes of complex problems, we may only code once or twice in a blue moon. For example, I have a complex Firestore abstraction layer that I wrote once, that I just keep reusing. The point of writing complex, high-abstraction code is so that you only write this type of code once.</li>
<li>It creates an artificial situation that induces stress. Few of us code while others are watching over our shoulders. And fewer of us are coding against a fixed time constraint in real life. For hard problems, I may go for a walk, talk to a co-worker, research algorithms, build small toy codebases first, etc. Quite honestly, most of us probably create our best code in isolation when we‚Äôre in a flow state; the exact opposite of a high-stakes interview.</li>
<li>Developers code best in their own environments with their own tools. Using an unfamiliar tool can be disorienting and again, add to stress and anxiety as someone watches.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this means that <em>using this approach could end up measuring for all the wrong metrics or measuring for metrics that have very little impact on how well a candidate can productively fit into a team</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, as teams become more reliant on generated code to increase productivity‚Ää-‚Ääwhether Copilot or GPT-I think that the ability to quickly read that code and identify subtle defects in the context of the larger application or domain space becomes more valuable.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrlschn.dev/img/code-review-as-interview/coderev-2.gif" alt="GPT generating a solution to N-Queens">
<em>GPT generating the solution to a common leetcode challenge N-Queens</em></p>
<p>A while back, I had the opportunity to participate in an interview which was structured around <em>reviewing code</em> rather than writing code. It was a revelation. Rather than focus on coding exercises, using code reviews as interview can be a better way to evaluate software engineering candidates.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-reasons-to-consider-code-review-as-interview">8 Reasons to consider code review as interview</h2>
<p>There are a few reasons why I think code reviews make for an inherently better technical interview experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the age of AI, an emerging reason is that using AI generated code is a source of risk in terms of performance, security, and internal best practices (especially important in regulated industries).  Being able to effectively evaluate code in the context of the larger codebase becomes an even more important skill when relying on piecemeal generated code.</li>
<li>It is a better reflection of the day-to-day activities that engineers‚Ää-‚Ääespecially more senior roles‚Ää-‚Ääengage in. Providing effective guidance and quality feedback to peers and especially junior team members can improve overall productivity and output quality in the long run.</li>
<li>It provides a more holistic view of how a candidate reasons, thinks, and communicates; in other words, it provides a better picture of the candidate as a teammate on the whole. This includes insights into the candidate‚Äôs depth of experience.</li>
<li>Code reviews are inherently more collaborative whereas writing code tends to be a more isolated activity (personally, I tend to code best in complete silence in evening hours). Code reviews are perhaps a better indicator of how it feels to work together with a candidate rather than having the candidate solve a technical puzzle.</li>
<li>There is more subjectivity to a code review; it‚Äôs not black or white. It naturally provides more opportunities for discussion and interpretation. It also provides more opportunities to arrive at outliers since there‚Äôs no single ‚Äúsolution‚Äù. For 5 candidates, you‚Äôll get 5 unique variations whereas common algorithmic challenges may have a small number of optimal responses.</li>
<li>It is hard to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù using generative AI or studying for leetcode problems.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is better suited for evaluating technical roles that have a bias towards reading code versus writing code. This includes engineering managers, architects, and support staff.</li>
<li>It better reflects how a candidate is going to be spending their first few days or weeks anyways: learning the existing system by reading through the code. Doesn‚Äôt it make sense to measure how well they can do this rather than how quickly they can solve N-Queens?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="strategies">Strategies</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre convinced, the next step is to think about different strategies to use when setting up your code review. There are a few strategies that you can mix and match to measure the range of a candidate.</p>
<p>A common thread to each of the strategies is that rather than inventing‚Ää-‚Ääor worse finding‚Ää-‚Ääa time-boxed puzzle to solve, an approach focused on code reviews lends itself to using bits and pieces of an existing codebase and actual problems that a team has been working on.</p>
<h3 id="au-naturel">‚ÄúAu naturel‚Äù</h3>
<p>Take actual, relevant and interesting parts of an active codebase as-is and use those as the context for review. Data access, exception handling, input handling‚Ää-‚Ääthese all make for great points of focus to see a candidate‚Äôs feedback on an existing codebase and how quickly they can read and understand your existing code.</p>
<h3 id="bug-hunter">Bug hunter</h3>
<p>Intentionally introduce some logical flaw or defect and see if a candidate can spot it. A good idea is to go back and find recent bugs that were solved and pull the source before the fix was applied. Can the candidate identify the root cause? How would the candidate suggest resolving the defect? How does that response differ from the one that was implemented?</p>
<h3 id="refactor-andredesign">Refactor and&nbsp;redesign</h3>
<p>Recently completed a refactor or planning a refactor? Use the code prior to the refactor as the context and see how the candidate thinks about the code before the refactor and what strategies a candidate would use to plan and execute the refactor. See if the candidate can identify why a refactor would be desired and evaluate the sophistication of their approach; you might be surprised and find an entirely novel alternate approach!</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when a candidate is joining a brownfield project.</p>
<h3 id="performance-oriented">Performance oriented</h3>
<p>Find code that was recently fixed for a performance issue and see if the candidate can spot why a piece of code might be slow. See if the candidate can propose an algorithm, alternate design, or fix to improve the performance of the code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Include existing SQL DDL schema and common natural language queries that the application will perform.  Remove the index definitions and see if the candidate can propose indices or alternate designs to improve performance.</p>
<p>Instead of asking about the principles of Big-O notation, see if the candidate can actually spot some <code>O(n^2)</code> code or <code>N+1</code> issues in data access code!</p>
<h3 id="test-focused">Test focused</h3>
<p>Share a fragment of code and a set of unit tests for the code. Are all the cases covered? Are there cases not covered? How could the unit tests be improved? This perspective may be more important in the coming age of AI generated code: understanding the domain space and use case and how to write high coverage unit tests‚Ää-‚Ääor evaluating the completeness of generated unit tests‚Ää-‚Ääbecomes a key skill.</p>
<h3 id="security-hawk">Security hawk</h3>
<p>Use code that has subtle security flaws and see if the candidate can identify said flaws. Rather than merely asking what an XSS or SQL injection attack is, see if the candidate can identify such flaws in code by using code that lacks protection against said attacks. Again, as teams come to rely on AI-generated code, having the experience to identify potential security flaws in the generated code becomes more important.</p>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best practices</h3>
<p>For more senior positions, focusing on best practices is a great way to find candidates that can identify, communicate, and teach best practices to more junior candidates and direct reports.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="try-coderevapp">Try CodeRev.app</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre sold on the idea like me, check out my new project <a href="https://coderev.app/">CodeRev.app</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrlschn.dev/img/code-review-as-interview/coderev-3.png" alt="CodeRev screenshot">
<em>CodeRev.app candidate workspace.</em></p>
<p>CodeRev.app is a (free) lightweight tool that‚Äôs designed to facilitate code review as interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why use it instead of CodeSandbox, Stackblitz, or GitHub?</p>
<ul>
<li>CodeRev is tightly focused on reading and commenting rather than coding whereas GitHub only has comments on PRs</li>
<li>CodeRev works great with fragments of code and you can mix and match different files without trying to make the project as a whole actually run. Just throw in whatever files make for interesting discussion!</li>
<li>CodeRev eliminates boilerplate that is inherent in modern projects one might be tempted to load into CodeSandbox or Stackblitz. Just pick the interesting source files and put them into CodeRev.</li>
<li>CodeRev lets you quickly toggle between the responses from different candidates so you can compare and see the insights and feedback they provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs still early stage so let me know if you run across bugs or you have ideas!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>In <em>The End of Average</em>, Todd Rose writes:</p>
<blockquote>
Just about any meaningful human characteristic‚Ää-‚Ääespecially talent‚Ää-‚Ääconsists of multiple dimensions. The problem is that when trying to measure for talent, we frequently resort to the average, reducing our jagged talent to a single dimension like a score on a standardized test or grades or a job performance ranking.
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, if we select for a narrow set of problem solving skills, then we end up selecting against an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù of candidates who have simply studied and prepared to achieve against those dimensions and miss out on many candidates whose <em>jagged talents</em> contribute to the character and productivity of a team.</p>
<p>Incorporating code reviews as interview as part of a team‚Äôs repertoire can help better measure a wider range of a candidate‚Äôs skill than leetcode alone.</p>
<p>As our industry shifts and the profession comes to rely more on AI tools like Copilot and GPT to generate code for productivity gains, there is a greater importance on finding ways to identify jagged talent; robotically solving algorithmic puzzles becomes the lesser of the qualities we want in a candidate. Instead, perhaps the key skill is the ability to read and review that code for correctness, best practices, and security.</p>
<p>Replacing leetcode with code reviews as interview can help teams not only better measure candidates on the whole, but also prepare for this shift in how we approach building software by focusing on more relevant skills and those aspects of a candidate that make for a better <em>human</em> teammate.</p>

Most importantly, if such a law ever came into effect you would be morally <em>obliged</em> to disobey, to boycott.</p><p>Under such a law, good people in need of privacy would be at risk.
Whistleblowers, investigative journalists, clinical doctors and psychologists and other health professionals,
lawyers, the courts, the police, the military and spies absolutely need secrecy (to varying degrees, and at different times)
to do their job.
Some scientists and engineers need strong privacy, too (those in charge of vital infrastructure like the electrical grid
or the backbone of the internet, gain-of-function research, nuclear tech, or cybersecurity).
And some people need secrecy to be <em>physically safe</em>: prosecuted minorities, sexual dissidents, opposition leaders,
activists, heterodox thinkers, people who are divergent in many ways.</p><p>Enter the European Commission's <!-- -->‚Äú<!-- -->Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council

Some of its member states, like Hungary and Poland, are still immature barely-liberal regimes with more than

in those two countries.
But not even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#Politics_and_government" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most robust democracy in the world (another European country)</a>
should be trusted with a fundamentally unethical law like Chat Control.</p><p>In light of alarming proposals like Chat Control, everyone should make the effort to escape the opaque protocols and
the convenient Trojan Horses that are popular social networks and messaging services,
and make their daily communication truly private.
We should make strong encryption a staple of our digital life.</p><p>We should all use PGP, SSL or equivalent tools; VPNs, Tor and/or SSH tunnelling; IPFS, or other distributed
file systems<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->‚Äî<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->and ditch proprietary OS's in favour of Linux or truly free Android distros.
We should switch to Protonmail or similar webmail;
to Matrix, Signal or similar messaging.
Ad-blocking, URL cleansing and third-party cookie rejection should be the default for everyone.
Those tools and techniques should cease to be arcane nice-to-haves for nerds:
we must get more non-technical people onboard.</p><p>All this is a moral imperative to those of us who have the ability and the means to follow this strategy and to educate others about it.</p><p>As long as we still have access to computing resources, free software and some form of encrypted tunnelling,
we can resist: those are the minimum requirements for a humanist digital environment to sustain itself.
In the future it might be that by developing and using some software and exchanging certain sequences of bits we will be breaking some law.
Such a law would be wrong and unjust.</p><p>More than twenty years ago, some of us were sprinkling our regular e-mail with words like <!-- -->‚Äú<!-- -->iraq<!-- -->‚Äù<!-- -->,
<!-- -->‚Äú<!-- -->bomb<!-- -->‚Äù<!-- --> and <!-- -->‚Äú<!-- -->attack<!-- -->‚Äù<!-- -->, often on a line appended to the end of messages, in response to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk about <abbr title="Three Letter Agencies">TLAs</abbr> scanning all digital communication</a>
in the wake of the <!-- -->‚Äú<!-- -->war on terror<!-- -->‚Äù<!-- -->.
I don't know if that strategy was effective in the end, but the goal we pursued with it was right.</p><p>In the same spirit, today everyone should communicate safely in private, if only to erect
a collective smoke screen that will confuse the mass surveillance apparatus and protect the most vulnerable among us.</p><p>(For similar reasons, everyone should choose free software when that's feasible;
demand open source and open standards and document formats from all public institutions;
and defend blockchains<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->‚Äî<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->including cryptocurrencies<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->‚Äî<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->and
the <!-- -->‚Äú<!-- -->right to repair<!-- -->‚Äù<!-- -->.
Strategically though, it may be better to stick to a minimum set of common demands for the sake of building
the largest coalition possible now.)</p><p>There is strength in numbers: that's how civil disobedience works.
It would be naive to think that we can get everyone in the EU to understand the imminent threat of (even deeper)
mass surveillance and to act on it.
But if a significant fraction of European citizens recognised the seriousness of the situation and made
the little effort required to secure their data and their communications, there is no way a law like Chat Control
could be enforced.</p><ul><li><abbr title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</abbr>'s <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveillance self-defence guide</a></li><li>Bruce Schneier: <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‚Äú<!-- -->The Value of Privacy<!-- -->‚Äù</a></li><li><a href="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StopChatControl.eu</a> campaign (<code>#StopChatControl</code>)</li></ul><p><a href="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-1-1024x1024.png" alt="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/"></a></p><div><p>Glass building image by Stable Diffusion <!-- -->&amp;<!-- --> tripu</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In August 1996, US president Bill Clinton made a portentous announcement from the White House. He was talking about a rock.</p>
<p>‚ÄòToday, rock 84001 speaks to us across all those billions of years and millions of miles‚Äô, he said. ‚ÄòIt speaks of the possibility of life. If this discovery is confirmed, it will surely be one of the most stunning insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered.‚Äô</p>
<p>The Martian meteorite ALH84001, picked up at Allan Hills in Antarctica in 1984, was then in the process of acquiring notoriety for revealing the Martians that never were. Researchers at NASA claimed in 1996 that inspection of the meteorite under the electron microscope revealed weird, wormlike nodules which could be <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.273.5277.924">‚Äòfossil remains of a past martian biota‚Äô</a>.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In fact, ALH84001 had a different message for us: about the danger of inferring life from morphology. It has never become clear what processes created the peculiar microstructures of the meteorite, but there‚Äôs no strong reason to believe they involved Martian microbes, and plenty of evidence that non-living processes can generate comparable shapes and forms. Perhaps chief among these are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b03018">reaction-diffusion systems</a>, of which the periodic precipitation process discovered in 1896 by German chemist Raphael Eduard Liesegang may be a variant.<sup>2</sup> It‚Äôs now widely believed that some of the oldest putative microfossils on Earth,<sup>3</sup> showing filamentary structures once thought to be fossil bacteria, are also in fact inorganic.</p>
<p>Perhaps a little chastened by the damp squib of ALH84001, NASA scientists began in the late 1990s to develop an artificial-intelligence system that would be able to distinguish the living from the non-living on the basis of morphology. They called it the D‚ÄôArcy Machine, after Scottish zoologist D‚ÄôArcy Wentworth Thompson, whose epic 1917 book <em>On Growth and Form</em> was one of the most comprehensive early efforts to understand how complex morphologies arise in both living and abiotic systems.</p>
<p>The project was led by chemist David Noever of NASA‚Äôs Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. The idea was that a neural network would be trained on all known biological forms on Earth to find features diagnostic of life. ‚ÄòBy repeatedly comparing and contrasting learnable imagery‚Äô, NASA claimed, ‚Äòa D‚ÄôArcy machine would‚Ä¶ give us an interplanetary version of D‚ÄôArcy Thompson‚Äôs classic [book].‚Äô</p>
<p>It seems that nothing notable came from the project. But might that be because there isn‚Äôt really any reliable morphological distinction between the living and abiotic?</p>
<p>That question was raised in a recent meeting in Tokyo, Japan, titled ‚ÄòDiversity of Biological Patterns and Forms in Nature‚Äô and hosted by the Meiji Institute for Advanced Study of Mathematical Sciences. While most of the presentations discussed the dizzying array of forms that the living world produces ‚Äì few are more astonishing than those of South American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehopper">treehoppers</a> ‚Äì chemist <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/4017782.article">Oliver Steinbock</a> of Florida State University offered a reminder of how shape alone is a poor guide.</p>
<h3>In the chemical garden</h3>
<p>Steinbock described the complex and often beautiful forms of chemical gardens, made by precipitating salts within a solution of sodium silicate (water glass). The repeated formation of soft inorganic membranes followed by their breaching due to osmotic pressure gives rise to twisting, bulbous mineral columns. Isaac Newton studied such structures in the 17th century and proclaimed that they had something ‚Äòvegetative‚Äô about them.</p>
<p>Shape is one thing ‚Äì but even the kind of complex motion we might intuitively associate with life doesn‚Äôt necessarily provide clinching evidence. Steinbock showed that short lengths of the tubular structures in manganese chemical gardens can act as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c09088">self-propelled particles</a> ‚Äì active matter ‚Äì in solutions of hydrogen peroxide, catalytically generating oxygen that bubbles out of the tube end and propels it forward.<sup>4</sup> The trajectories of these particles can be surprisingly complicated, especially when several interact hydrodynamically with one another. In particular, the particles, typically a few millimetres long, can appear to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2SM00395C">congregate like microbes</a> into a ring pattern ‚Äì driven by the surface tension and buoyancy of a collective oxygen bubble in the ring‚Äôs centre.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>These little tubules can also show <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2SM01681H">periodic cycles of ascent and descent</a> in the liquid due to the buoyancy of an oxygen bubble and its release at the surface.<sup>6</sup> It‚Äôs tempting to read this motion visually as some kind of purposeful behaviour. The fact is that we seem naturally inclined to infer life and purpose in all manner of complexity: we are prone to what you might call ‚Äòbiotic pareidolia‚Äô, the analogue of our impulse to see faces in non-living structures (including the rocks of Mars!).</p>
<p>Can today‚Äôs immensely powerful deep-learning AI, potentially free from such cognitive biases, do better in identifying what is truly life-like? Given recent developments that have exposed how strongly we project life and thought onto AI itself, I wonder about that. If AI can persuade us that it‚Äôs alive, it might not have much trouble convincing us that something else is.</p></div><div><h3>References</h3><p>1 D S McKay <em>et al.</em>, <em>Science</em>, 1996,&nbsp;<strong>273</strong>, 924 (DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.273.5277.924">10.1126/science.273.5277.924</a>)</p>

US-based Microsoft employees in San Francisco and New York are paid more because they live in higher cost-of-living areas and some fields, like roles within engineering, also fetch higher pay.</p><p>The highest pay package in the guidelines viewed by Insider was $361,500 in salary, $1.2 million as a hiring bonus, and about $1 million in annual stock awards. The lowest was a $42,500 salary, with no hiring bonus and no guaranteed stock award.</p><p>Microsoft uses a system of levels to denote seniority. Higher levels come with higher offers, according to the guidelines. Levels also vary by field and location, but generally, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-microsoft-pays-entry-senior-level-engineers-2021-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">"senior" starts at level 63, "principal" starts at level 65</a>, and "partner" starts at level 68, according to insiders.</p><p>Not all types of roles go up to level 70, but in engineering, an employee at this level would be considered a "distinguished engineer.'" There's also a level 80 for a "technical fellow," which is typically one of the highest-ranking executives at the company.</p><p>In 2022, when the economy was still booming, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-pay-raises-merit-increases-stock-grants-2022-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Microsoft granted an across-the board compensation raise</a> for levels 67 and lower through larger stock grants, in response <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-considering-significant-pay-raises-employee-survey-2022-5?utmSource=twitter&amp;utmContent=referral&amp;utmTerm=topbar&amp;referrer=twitter" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">to growing internal dissatisfaction</a> with compensation compared to competitors, and to stop employees from leaving for better pay, especially to Amazon.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The University of Turku in Finland is developing an artificial language corpus proficient in all European languages, including Estonian, to preserve minor languages in the post-ChatGPT era. The Estonian Language Institute (EKI) supports the initiative but warns that an operational language model requires digitizing substantially more Estonian texts than is currently available.</p><div><p>"The English ChatGPT stunned the world with its ability to comprehend and respond to a person&nbsp;in a manner resembling natural speech. It wasn't a miracle technology; it was given an unprecedented amount of text to identify patterns in and learn to mimic human communication," Eleri Aedmaa, a natural language processing engineer at the Institute of the Estonian Language, said.</p><p>"In the new era of language technologies, the quantity of texts matters. To reach this critical mass with Estonian as many texts as possible must be digitized and made available: the entirety of the National Library, all of its archives, as much current and historical news as possible, including online communication. The more Estonian is readily accessible on the Internet, the more secure the language's future will be," the linguist said.</p><p>University of Turku and language technology company SiloGen <a href="https://www.silo.ai/blog/silo-ai-launches-a-consortium-to-build-the-worlds-largest-open-llm">are spearheading</a> the creation of the largest open language model in the world, covering all official European languages, on one of the pan-European supercomputers, LUMI, is located in Kajaani, Finland. It is the third largest supercomputer in the world and the largest in Europe. The quantity of distinct and original digital Estonian texts that can be made available for this and future language learning models, according to Aedmaa, is a fundamental issue for training the model in Estonian.</p><p><strong>ChatGPT only thinks in English</strong></p><p>Aedmaa said that one of the shortcomings of the increasingly prevalent large language models is that they are trained almost exclusively in English. This implies that although GPT-4 appears to comprehend Estonian, it is still limited to translation. The machine, so to say, thinks in English and translates the conversation at the last moment into Estonian. "This is really dangerous for the Estonian language in the long run," Aedmaa said.</p><p>"The value of these new tools lies in the fact that they comprehend not only individual words and sentences, but also the cultural context as a whole. If a language model is trained solely on the basis of English content, it will inevitably lack cultural knowledge of Estonia," she said.</p><p>"The situation is comparable to when the printing press was invented - what would have become of the Estonian language if books had been printed only in the major languages, but not in Estonian?" She asked. According to Aedmaa, the problem now affects nearly all of the world's languages.</p><p>The language model being developed by the Finns is a GPT-like digital&nbsp;machine that has been trained on a wide range of languages from the ground up. "The objectives are European linguistic sovereignty and the democratization of language technology. Unlike the majority of its predecessors, the new language model will be open source; its logic is transparent and can be utilized by anyone developing new language technology applications," Aedmaa said.</p><p>The Finns' project is supported by Business Finland, a body similar to the Estonian Business and Innovation Agency (EISA). It has also been supported by the EU Horizon program. LUMI provided a number of free training hours to the developers so that they could test the model.</p><p><strong>There are too few sources in Estonian to train a large language model</strong></p><p>Kadri Vare, head of the EKI's language and speech technology department, said the agency&nbsp;is presently exploring additional ways to help Finns. "We intend to work with them and have taken preliminary steps in that regard. Then we will be able to specify more precisely what and how much we can contribute to this endeavor. We have already contributed by making all of our legally permissible language data available to them," Vare told ERR.</p><p>In particular, Vare said, even more data could be digitized and made public to contribute to the success of the initiative. "The large language models use the entirety of the internet and every written word. Right now, we do not know exactly what they have taken and from where; we do not know if they have access to potentially more sensitive data. It would be important to us to find out," she said.</p><p>There is a shortage of available Estonian content for the large language model at present, however. "There are approximately three billion words of Estonian public data in the main language corpora, according to our knowledge. In contrast, English contains over 800 billion words. Three billion may seem like a lot, but in reality it is still insufficient. Training an artificial intelligence to comprehend Estonian language and culture is insufficient. It is simply too little," Vare said.</p><p>At the moment, the EKI is in the process of compiling a large Estonian language corpus. "These datasets are public, and we are pleased to share them. Participating in large open language models and collecting data for them is, in my opinion, one of the most important goals for Estonian language preservation," she concluded.</p><p>--</p><p><em>Follow ERR News on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ERRNews/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/errnews">Twitter</a> and never miss an update!</em></p>									</div></div>]]></description>

                            <p><span>Officials in a small Iowa town twice arrested a young man for criticizing the police department and saying it violates people's civil rights. Now the town is facing a lawsuit for violating <em>his</em> civil rights.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ECF-No.-1-Complaint-and-Jury-Demand-FILE-STAMPED-10.12.23.pdf"><span>federal lawsuit</span></a><span> filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Iowa, Noah Petersen says the town of Newton violated the First, Fourth, and 14th Amendments when the police chief arrested him for speaking during the public comment period of a City Council meeting. Petersen is represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning public interest law firm.</span></p> <p>"The mayor and police chief had Noah arrested, jailed, strip-searched, and criminally prosecuted simply because they didn't like what Noah had to say," the lawsuit states. "This suit is filed to vindicate the fundamental right to criticize the government without fear of retaliation and to ensure the constitutional accountability of all government officials."</p> <p><span>Petersen was prompted to speak at an October 3, 2022, Newton City Council meeting after the release of </span><a href="https://www.kcci.com/article/watch-newton-man-says-police-wrongfully-arrested-him-at-traffic-stop/41069939"><span>body cam footage</span></a><span> showing Newton officers arresting a college football player, Tayvin Galanakis. Galanakis was arrested for driving under the influence, despite blowing a 0.00 on a Breathalyzer and passing roadside sobriety tests. He was taken to the police station for further drug tests, all of which came back negative, before eventually being released.</span></p> <p>Petersen approached the microphone and said:</p> <blockquote><p><span>Hello. This is my public comment for [the] City Council meeting, now October 3rd, 2022. Defund Newton Police Department. They are a violent, civil and human rights‚Äìviolating organization who do not make your community safer. They are also pro‚Äìdomestic abuse because they are currently employing a domestic abuser and choosing to not release the records about that domestic abuser.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>At that point, the Newton mayor ordered Petersen to stop speaking, although his allotted three minutes of time had not expired. When Petersen refused, the mayor ordered the police chief to remove Petersen for violating a council rule forbidding "derogatory statements or comments about any individual."</span></p> <p><span>Petersen was handcuffed, arrested, and jailed until his parents could post bond for him<strong>.</strong> He returned to the next City Council meeting to speak during the public comment period and was once again arrested after calling the police chief and mayor fascists.</span></p> <p><span>Petersen was charged both times with disorderly conduct for disrupting a lawful assembly. However, as </span><i><span>Reason</span></i><span>'s Emma Camp </span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/02/06/an-iowa-town-charged-a-man-with-disorderly-conduct-because-he-called-a-cop-a-domestic-abuser/"><span>reported</span></a><span> in February, those charges did not stick:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Last Wednesday, Petersen was found not guilty of his disorderly conduct charge. Adding to his victory, the judge overturned the rule barring "derogatory" statements about individuals during city council meetings. "As applied in this particular instance, the Newton City Council rule is violative of the First Amendment," the verdict states.</span></p> <p><span>Petersen "did not act in any objectively unreasonable manner," the judge added. "He read a prepared statement relating to the basic city service of policing. While some may not agree with the content of his comments, the Court finds the statements made were not 'derogatory,' nor about an 'individual.' In the event the statements could be found 'derogatory' or a comment about an 'individual'‚Ä¶the Court finds these terms vague and overbroad."</span></p></blockquote> <p>Petersen says the entire mess shows why he stepped up to the podium in the first place.</p> <p><span>"Ironically, the actions of the police department have only proven my point," Petersen said in an Institute for Justice <a href="https://ij.org/press-release/lawsuit-seeks-accountability-for-unconstitutional-silencing-and-arrest-during-city-council-meeting/">press release</a>. "My initial criticism was about the way they treat citizens in our community. They arrested me for exercising my right to free speech‚Äîfor standing up for what I believe is right. Their reaction to my criticism was a clear demonstration of the very issue I was trying to highlight. Their actions underscore the urgent need for the very reforms I was advocating for."</span></p> <p><span>Newton officials simply do not appear to take criticism well. As </span><i><span>Reason</span></i><span>'s Emma Camp </span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/10/06/an-iowa-man-published-body-camera-footage-from-his-arrest-the-cops-are-suing-him-for-defamation/"><span>reported</span></a><span> earlier this month, the two Newton police officers who arrested Galanakis have since filed a defamation suit against him for publishing the body cam footage of his own arrest, as well as claims he made about the officers on social media.

"Anyone with a high school diploma should know that having your political opponents arrested is a textbook example of violating someone's First Amendment rights and we're confident that the courts will agree."</span></p> <p><span>Attorneys for the town of Newton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>                        </div></div>]]></description>

    <p>I‚Äôm excited to share a 3 state, 3 symbol Turing Machine that cannot be proven to halt or not (when starting on a blank tape) without solving a Collatz-like problem. Therefore, solving the \(BB(3, 3)\) problem is at least as hard as solving this Collatz-like problem, a class of problem for which Paul Erd≈ës famously said: ‚ÄúMathematics may not be ready for such problems.‚Äù</p>

<p>Last year, in <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/04/03/mother-of-giants.html">Mother of Giants</a>, I described a family of TMs which require efficient simulation or complete solution of a Collatz-like problem in order to prove if they ‚Äúquasihalt‚Äù or not. These were found in the search for <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2021/03/06/beeping-busy-beaver/">‚ÄúBeeping‚Äù Busy Beavers</a>, a variant of the Busy Beavers introduced by Scott Aaronson in his 2020 <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4916">Busy Beaver survey article</a>. Since then I have been looking for an example in the normal Busy Beaver game.</p>

<p>There have been many wonderful TMs produced by hand over the years which provide such results for the Busy Beaver game. For example, proving:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(BB(745)\) <a href="https://www.ingo-blechschmidt.eu/assets/bachelor-thesis-undecidability-bb748.pdf">requires</a> proving the consistency of ZFC</li>
  <li>\(BB(27)\) <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a64213f391339236c2fe31f8749a0df6">requires</a> proving the Goldbach Conjecture</li>
  <li>\(BB(15)\) and \(BB(5, 4)\) <a href="https://dna.hamilton.ie/2021-08-10-busy-beaver-15.html">require</a> proving an Erd≈ës conjecture (that for all \(n &gt; 8\), the base 3 representation of \(2^n\) has at least one digit 2).</li>
</ul>

<p>However, none of these Busy Beaver values are really within reach of us mere mortals yet. In the last 60 years, we have only been able to prove values \(BB(2), BB(3), BB(4)\) and \(BB(2, 3)\) and it is known that <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/06/21/bb-6-2-t15.html">\(BB(6) &gt; 10 \uparrow\uparrow 15\)</a>. Until I analyzed this TM, I thought that we might have a chance to prove \(BB(3, 3)\)!</p>

<p>I‚Äôll call this TM ‚ÄúBigfoot‚Äù (I‚Äôll explain the name at the end of the article). It is defined by the transition table:</p>

This specific TM was first <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960643023006490684/1084047886494470185/1163168233445130270">shared and analyzed</a> by @savask on 14 Oct 2023 on that same Discord channel.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>Consider the general configuration:</p><p>

\[A(a, b, c) = 0^\infty \; 12^a \; 11^b \; \text{ &lt;A } \; 11^c \; 0^\infty\]

</p><p>We can prove the following rules:</p><p>

\[\begin{array}{l}
  A(a, &amp; 6k,   &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c-1, &amp; 2)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; 8k+c \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+1, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a+1, &amp; 8k+c-1, &amp; 3)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; 8k+c \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+2, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a-1, &amp; 8k+c+3, &amp; 2)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; a \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+3, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c+1, &amp; 5)   \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+4, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a+1, &amp; 8k+c+3, &amp; 2)   \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+5, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c+5, &amp; 3)   \\
\end{array}\]

\[A(0, 6k+2, c) \to \text{Halt}(16k+2c+7)\]

</p><p>In fact, these rules are exhaustive. Once Bigfoot enters such a \(A(a, b, c)\) config (with \(c \ge 1\)), these rules describe the exact behavior it will follow forever (or until it halts).</p>

<p>Looking at the rules above we can see that they are iterating a Collatz-like function on parameters \(b\) and \(c\) while \(a\) keeps a sort of running total. Every time \(b \equiv 1 \pmod{6}\) or \(b \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\), \(a\) is incremented and every time \(b \equiv 2 \pmod{6}\), \(a\) is decremented. Bigfoot only ever halts if \(a\) would be decremented below 0.</p>

<h3 id="trajectory-from-blank-tape">Trajectory from Blank Tape</h3>

<p>Starting from a blank tape, Bigfoot reaches config \(A(2, 1, 2)\) at step 69. Simulating this forward, \(a\) appears to grow steadily over time. After 24 million iterations, we have \(a = 3\,999\,888\).</p>

<h3 id="pseudo-random-walk">Pseudo-Random Walk</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs consider the sequence of remainders of \(b\) mod 6. If we imagine that this sequence is uniformly randomly distributed, then this process is simulating a biased random walk on the number line where (for each step) the chance of stepping right is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the chance of stepping left is \(\frac{1}{3}\).</p>

<p>This is a famous problem in the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chains</a> and it can be proven that if you are at position \(a = n\), there is a \((\frac{1}{2})^{n+1}\) chance you will ever reach the position \(a = -1\) in the future.</p>

<p>Of course, the sequence of remainders of \(b\) are not random, they are completely deterministic. (In fact, they even follow the consistent pattern of odd, odd, even, even, ‚Ä¶) However, on a broad scale they do appear to follow a trajectory roughly like the random Markov chain. We can see that in the trajectory listed above where after 24 million steps, the Markov chain would be expected to move to the right 8 million times and to the left 4 million leading to a value very close to the actual \(a\) around 4 million.</p>

<h3 id="probviously-not-halting">Probviously Not Halting</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, the random Markov chain would have about a \((\frac{1}{2})^{4\,000\,000}\) chance of ever reaching \(a = -1\) at this point which is a number so small that any scientist would happily declare this guaranteed to fail. Likewise, this is where I will say that Bigfoot ‚Äúprobviously‚Äù never halts (using the <a href="https://doi.org/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.03.192">words of John Conway</a>). Meaning that if it operates anything close to the Markov Chain it will never halt.</p>

<p>Of course, this sort of statement says nothing in a rigorous Mathematical sense. Instead it is sort of an experimental heuristic which I am using to guide my intuition in this case. There is always the chance that after a googolplex iterations Bigfoot will halt. In fact, Conway coined this term to describe the heuristic argument for why the Collatz conjecture should be ‚Äúprobviously‚Äù true and yet a proof of Collatz is nowhere in sight.</p>

<h2 id="two-worlds">Two Worlds</h2>

<p>We live in one of two worlds, either Bigfoot halts or it runs forever. If it halts, then that could be proven by accelerating iterations of this Collatz-like function enough that it is tractable to simulate it to completion. If it runs forever, then proving that requires proving that this Collatz-like function will never reach the \(a = 0\) halting transition.</p>

<p>Based on the Markov chain argument above, I believe we are living in this second world and it seems to me that this is the much harder case to prove.</p>

<h2 id="cryptids">Cryptids</h2>

<p>What do we call these sorts of machines? Ones whose behavior has been distilled into a relatively simple Mathematical rule that falls into a class of open Mathematical problems. These machines seem to be a sort of legendary creature, rumors have it that they either halt or do not, but nobody has been able to provide any concrete evidence to support either conclusion. I propose calling them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids">‚ÄúCryptids‚Äù</a>, drawing parallels to the legendary creatures like the Loch Ness Monster or Chupacabra. And well, since this TM appears to randomly walk about, I thought Bigfoot would be an apt name.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-collatz-like-behavior-really-hard">Is This Collatz-like Behavior Really Hard?</h2>

<p>I imagine that some of you might be wondering: Is the behavior of this specific Collatz-like function really hard to analyze? Am I overselling this behavior simply by it‚Äôs association with the famously difficult Collatz problem? I think it is safe to say that nobody aside from me has ever looked at the dynamics of this specific problem. So perhaps with a little bit of number theory and elbow grease, someone will be able to find a clever Mathematical property that applies to this problem (but not to the broader set of Collatz-like problems). This is certainly possible and I am excited to hear if anyone has any ideas as to how to attack this problem. It would be lovely to know that proving \(BB(3, 3)\) remains within reach!</p>

<p>However, in my (limited) experience analyzing and reading about Collatz-like problems there seem to be only two types of questions that one can ask: (1) Ones that are relatively trivial to prove and (2) Ones which no Mathematician knows how to prove. In the first category we have patterns like the fact that \(b\) repeats consistently through the pattern (odd, odd, even, even, ‚Ä¶) in Bigfoot‚Äôs Collatz iterations or that every time you apply the traditional \(3n+1\) Collatz rule you always end up with an even number which will then be divided by 2 on the next step. Examples of the second category include basically all other questions we might ask about the behavior of these Collatz systems.</p>

With a way to store ideas permanently and externally, they would no longer need to memorise. It is tempting to dismiss him as an old man complaining about change. Socrates did not have a stack of peer-reviewed science to make his case about the usefulness of learning concepts by heart.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Today a different debate is raging about the dangers of another technology‚Äîcomputers‚Äîand the typing people do on them. As primary-school pupils and <small>P</small>h<small>D</small> hopefuls return for a new school year in the northern hemisphere, many will do so with a greater-than-ever <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2014/06/07/taking-the-learning-tablets">reliance on computers</a> to take notes and write papers. Some parents of younger students are dismayed that their children are not just encouraged but required to tote laptops to class. University professors complain of rampant distraction in classrooms, with students reading and messaging instead of listening to lectures.</p><p data-component="paragraph">A line of research shows the benefits of an ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù that predates computers: <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2012/10/08/handwriting-an-elegy">handwriting</a>. Studies have found that writing on paper can improve everything from recalling a random series of words to imparting a better conceptual grasp of complicated ideas.</p><p data-component="paragraph">For learning material by rote, from the shapes of letters to the quirks of English spelling, the benefits of using a pen or pencil lie in how the motor and sensory memory of putting words on paper reinforces that material. The arrangement of squiggles on a page feeds into visual memory: people might remember a word they wrote down in French class as being at the bottom-left on a page, <i>par exemple</i>.</p><p data-component="paragraph">One of the best-demonstrated advantages of writing by hand seems to be in superior<b> </b>note-taking. In a study from 2014 by Pam Mueller and Danny Oppenheimer, students typing wrote down almost twice as many words and more passages verbatim from  lectures, suggesting they were not understanding so much as rapidly copying the material.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Handwriting‚Äîwhich takes longer for nearly all university-level students‚Äîforces note-takers to synthesise ideas into their own words. This aids conceptual understanding at the moment of writing. But those taking notes by hand also perform better on tests<i> </i>when students are later able to study from their notes. The effect even persisted when the students who typed were explicitly instructed to rephrase the material in their own words. The instruction was ‚Äúcompletely ineffective‚Äù at reducing verbatim note-taking, the researchers note: they did not understand the material so much as parrot it.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Many studies have confirmed handwriting‚Äôs benefits, and policymakers have taken note.<b> </b>Though America‚Äôs ‚ÄúCommon Core‚Äù curriculum from 2010 does not require handwriting instruction past first grade (roughly age six), about half the states since then have mandated more teaching of it, thanks to campaigning by researchers and handwriting supporters. In Sweden there is a push for more handwriting and printed books and fewer devices. England‚Äôs national curriculum already prescribes teaching the rudiments of cursive by age seven.</p><p data-component="paragraph">However, several school systems in America have gone so far as to ban most laptops. This is too extreme. Some students have disabilities that make handwriting especially hard. Nearly all will eventually need typing skills. And typing can improve the quality of writing: being able to get ideas down quickly, before they are forgotten, can obviously be beneficial. So can slowing down the speed of typing, says Dr Oppenheimer.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Virginia Berninger, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Washington, is a longtime advocate of handwriting. But she is not a purist; she says there are research-tested benefits for ‚Äúmanuscript‚Äù print-style writing, <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2016/09/06/the-comeback-of-cursive">for cursive</a> (which allows greater speed) but also for typing (which is good practice for composing passages). Since students spend more time on devices as they age, she argues for occasional ‚Äútuning up‚Äù of handwriting in later school years.</p><p data-component="paragraph">And perhaps even into adulthood.

            <p>Computational approaches are emerging as powerful tools for the discovery of antibiotics. A study now uses machine learning to discover abaucin, a potent antibiotic that targets the bacterial pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.</p>
            

                
                    
                
            
                
                <p>Traditionally, antibiotics were discovered by the screening of soil microorganisms, seeking secondary metabolites. From these initial molecules, numerous derivatives were synthesized, showing improved bioactivities and greater potential to meet clinical standards. Until recently, discovery efforts relied on the painstaking screening of large compound libraries for antibiotic activity<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Wright, G. D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 34, 694‚Äì701 (2017)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01448-6#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d8857608e293">1</a></sup>. Phenotypic screening approaches do not require advanced knowledge of the mechanism of action; however, the extensive and unexplored chemical space in the search for drug-like molecules poses considerable challenges, as the screening of numerous potential combinations (of both compounds and different bacterial strains) is both expensive and time-consuming. Thus, the discovery process of a new antibiotic has consistently depended on chance and serendipity. Recent advances that incorporate cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and other computational approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in accelerating the identification of new drugs with desired properties<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Porto, W.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As a reminder: <strong>Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust.</strong> Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), isort, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.</p>
<p>Ruff is used in production by tens of thousands of
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff#whos-using-ruff">open source projects</a> and major enterprises.
In the last year, we've been working to expand Ruff's feature set and improve stability for those
that depend on Ruff in their daily workflows.</p>
<p>Today, we're excited to announce that <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff">Ruff v0.1.0</a> is out! This

<h2><span id="a-growing-feature-set"></span>A growing feature set<!-- --> <a href="#a-growing-feature-set">#</a></h2>
<p>Earlier this year, Charlie looked back on
<a href="https://notes.crmarsh.com/ruff-the-first-200-releases">the first 200 releases of Ruff</a>, at which
point 376 lint rules were supported. <strong>Ruff now supports over 700 rules</strong>, with new rules being
added in every release. In case you missed it, we've released some exciting features this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.285#stabilized-support-for-jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter notebook support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.292#support-for-pep-701">Python 3.12 f-string syntax support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.283#ruff-supports-pep-695">Python 3.12 type alias and generics syntax support</a></li>

<li>Improvements to the <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/">Ruff playground</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We also <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/7310">released an alpha version</a> of our
Black-compatible code formatter. Expect more news on that front soon!</p>
<h2><span id="introducing-preview-mode"></span>Introducing preview mode<!-- --> <a href="#introducing-preview-mode">#</a></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.289">v0.0.289</a>, we added a new preview mode
to enable the use of unstable features when running Ruff.</p>
<p>Since new rules often benefit from a trial period, we want to be able to release them in a staged
manner. Previously, we used a "nursery" rule category to do this, a concept taken from Clippy,
Rust's linter.</p>
<p>However, the nursery required opt-in for each rule using their exact code, e.g., if you'd selected
<code>F</code> and we released an unstable rule <code>F999</code>, you'd need to update your selection to <code>[F, F999]</code>.
Requiring opt-in for each rule reduced exposure of new rules and could be tedious for users to
update. Furthermore, as Ruff grows, we want a global concept for use of unstable features ‚Äî the
nursery concept doesn't scale beyond rule selection.</p>
<p>Preview mode will be used to enable new rules, unstable fixes, and experimental code analysis.
Releasing these features ‚Äî but gating them to users who opt-in ‚Äî will allow us to collect community
feedback and gain confidence that changes are a net-benefit.</p>
<p>Preview mode can be enabled per-invocation with the <code>--preview</code> flag or by updating your
configuration file:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[</span><span>tool</span><span>.</span><span>ruff</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>preview</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/">docs</a> for preview mode and give it a try!</p>
<h2><span id="respecting-fix-safety"></span>Respecting fix safety<!-- --> <a href="#respecting-fix-safety">#</a></h2>
<p>Ruff's ability to automatically fix violations is one of its most powerful features. However, given
Python's dynamic nature, it's not always possible to guarantee that a fix is "safe". Since May,
we've been labeling a subset of Ruff's fixes as unsafe. When applying safe fixes, the meaning and
intent of your code will be retained; when applying unsafe fixes, the meaning could change.</p>
<p>For example,
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-iterable-allocation-for-first-element"><code>unnecessary-iterable-allocation-for-first-element</code></a>
is a rule which checks for potentially unperformant use of <code>list(...)[0]</code>. The fix replaces this
pattern with <code>next(iter(...))</code> which can result in a drastic speedup:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-m</span><span> </span><span>timeit</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>head = list(range(99999999))[0]</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>1 </span><span>loop,</span><span> </span><span>best</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.69</span><span> </span><span>sec</span><span> </span><span>per</span><span> </span><span>loop</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-m</span><span> </span><span>timeit</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>head = next(iter(range(99999999)))</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>5000000 </span><span>loops,</span><span> </span><span>best</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>70.8</span><span> </span><span>nsec</span><span> </span><span>per</span><span> </span><span>loop</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, when the collection is empty, this fix changes the raised exception from an <code>IndexError</code> to
<code>StopIteration</code>:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-c</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>list(range(0))[0]</span><span>'</span></span>
<span><span>Traceback (most </span><span>recent</span><span> </span><span>call</span><span> </span><span>last</span><span>):</span></span>
<span><span>File </span><span>"</span><span>&lt;string&gt;</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>line</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>modul</span><span>e</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>IndexError: </span><span>list</span><span> </span><span>index</span><span> </span><span>out</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>range</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-c</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>next(iter(range(0)))[0]</span><span>'</span></span>
<span><span>Traceback (most </span><span>recent</span><span> </span><span>call</span><span> </span><span>last</span><span>):</span></span>
<span><span>File </span><span>"</span><span>&lt;string&gt;</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>line</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>modul</span><span>e</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>StopIteration</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since this could break error handling, this fix is categorized as unsafe.</p>
<p>Previously, the safety of a fix was only an internal note, but in v0.1.0, Ruff will only use safe
fixes by default to increase confidence when applying fixes and highlight fixes that need additional
review.</p>
<p>Unsafe fixes can be enabled by passing the <code>--unsafe-fixes</code> flag to <code>ruff check</code>:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span># Show unsafe fixes</span></span>
<span><span>ruff </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>--unsafe-fixes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Apply unsafe fixes</span></span>
<span><span>ruff </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>--fix</span><span> </span><span>--unsafe-fixes</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or by setting
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#unsafe-fixes"><code>unsafe-fixes</code></a> in your configuration file:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[</span><span>tool</span><span>.</span><span>ruff</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>unsafe-fixes</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When working with Ruff in an IDE (via our LSP), we will no longer apply unsafe fixes with the "Fix
all" action. Instead, unsafe fixes can be applied individually with the "Quick fix" action allowing
review of each fix. If you opt-in to unsafe fixes, they'll be applied during "Fix all". See the
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp#fix-safety">LSP docs</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The safety of fixes can be adjusted per rule using the
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#extend-safe-fixes"><code>extend-safe-fixes</code></a> and
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#extend-unsafe-fixes"><code>extend-unsafe-fixes</code></a> settings, allowing
you to customize safety levels for your use-case.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#fix-safety">docs</a> for more details on fix
safety.</p>
<h2><span id="ruffs-versioning-policy"></span>Ruff's versioning policy<!-- --> <a href="#ruffs-versioning-policy">#</a></h2>
<p>Thus far, Ruff releases have only involved incrementing the patch version number. This versioning
scheme suffers from a few core problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no documented policy and little room for a meaningful policy</li>
<li>Rules are added in most releases, resulting in significant new violations for users on upgrade</li>
<li>Users cannot get bug fix upgrades with confidence that they will not need to do other work</li>
<li>Ruff is not perceived as stable</li>
</ul>
<p>With the promotion to v0.1.0, Ruff can adopt a meaningful rules around versioning to ensure that
users know what to expect from each release. With the addition of a minor version number, we hope
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the frequency of large changes</li>
<li>Give rules a period for stabilization before enabling</li>
<li>Differentiate between breaking and non-breaking releases</li>
<li>Move towards stronger stability guarantees</li>
</ul>
<p>With the release of 0.1.0, Ruff includes a full versioning policy. Briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>minor</strong> version will be used for stabilization of <strong>preview</strong> features, changes to
<strong>stable</strong> behavior, and breaking changes.</li>
<li>The <strong>patch</strong> version will be used for bug fixes and <em>any</em> changes to rules or fixes in
<strong>preview.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/versioning/">docs</a> for a full description of the policy.</p>

Look south-east, towards Canada, and you see a skyline thick with cranes. New towers are shooting up, old ones being rebuilt, and the pavements below are thick with pedestrians. Cross to the other bedroom, however, and you get quite a different view. Right up to the edge of a highway entire city blocks are occupied by nothing but tarmac. At 11am an ocean of surface parking is uninterrupted by even a single car.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Just over a decade ago Detroit became the biggest American city to go bankrupt. Since then its city centre has made a remarkable recovery. The Book Tower, which was completely derelict in 2009, has been rebuilt at a cost of over $300m by Bedrock, a property firm owned by Dan Gilbert, Michigan‚Äôs richest man. Yet though downtown is humming, huge parts of the city remain blighted.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The city now has a more ambitious plan to reduce the amount of vacant land. It intends to tax it. A lot. Will it work?</p><p data-component="paragraph">The idea, proposed by Mike Duggan, the city‚Äôs pugnacious mayor, is to replace Detroit‚Äôs current property tax with a split tax. In essence, assessors will distinguish between the value of its land and of the buildings on it. This done, the city‚Äôs property tax will be reduced from 2% for every $1 of assessed value (which is less than market value) to 0.6%. To make up for the revenues lost, land will be taxed at a new rate of 11.8%, whether or not it has anything built on it. In Michigan changes to property-tax rates have to be approved by voters. A law to allow that cleared its first hurdle in the state House in late September. A referendum could happen in February.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The principle of taxing land instead of buildings has a long history. Over a century ago Henry George, a liberal economist, argued that the rich used land ownership to hoard the wealth being created by progress. His most dedicated fans adopted the slogan ‚ÄúDo you see the cat?‚Äù (based on a convoluted metaphor), to refer to his ideas that land ownership underpinned high inequality. Yet George‚Äôs proposal‚Äîa single tax on land value‚Äîhas barely been tried. If Mr Duggan‚Äôs scheme becomes law, Detroit will be one of the first big cities anywhere in the world to implement one.</p><p data-component="paragraph">How come Detroit is able to try something so radical? One advantage, says Jay Rising, the city‚Äôs chief financial officer, is that the city now raises very little from its current system. In 1959, according to a study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a think-tank in Massachusetts, the city‚Äôs property tax raised over $1bn, adjusted for inflation. By 2019, after decades of economic decline, the figure had fallen to just $119m. ‚ÄúIf this was 80% of our revenues, we‚Äôd be a lot more nervous,‚Äù says Mr Rising. In fact it is just 16%. Moreover, the value of residential land is very low, which makes it an easier sell to voters.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The hope is that taxing land more will in fact spur development. Right now, says Alex Alsup of Regrid, a data firm, Detroit has ‚Äúa very pure version of speculation‚Äù. As downtown booms, people who bought land nearby years ago‚Äîsuch as the owners of the car parks‚Äîmerely have to wait for investment nearby to raise the value of their own land. Higher taxes might force them to sell up to people who will build on it. ‚ÄúIt is entirely possible that this land tax has the ability to free up properties,‚Äù says Kofi Bonner, the <small>ceo</small> of Bedrock.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The bigger immediate benefit, though, comes from reducing taxes on most residents. The city argues that 97% of homeowners will get a tax cut. Lower tax rates on improvements ought to encourage people to invest in properties‚Äîand help some avoid falling behind on their taxes. Though they raise little, Detroit‚Äôs property taxes are punishing to poor homeowners. Between 2011 and 2015, according to a study published in 2019, one in four city properties went into tax foreclosure, their owners having fallen behind on payments.</p><p data-component="paragraph">But Bernadette Atuahene, one of the authors of that study, suggests that high rates were not the only problem. What mattered more was that after the great financial crisis, Detroit‚Äôs assessor systematically overvalued the homes of the poorest residents. When people could not pay, Wayne County, which includes the city, added interest at 18%. Homes ended up auctioned, with any excess over the tax owed banked by the county. Ms Atuahene worries that the proposed new tax does nothing to fix this problem‚Äîand if residential land ends up overvalued, may exacerbate it. ‚ÄúWe currently have an assessment division that‚Äôs not doing its job,‚Äù she says.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Getting assessments right is one of the long-standing challenges of land-value taxes, and explains why they are so rare. Still, if the city can do that well, there will be real gains. Gabriel McNeil, a 61-year-old former chef who now lives on disability benefits, says that even a small tax cut would help him a lot. Having bought his home for just $8,000 in 2013, he struggles with tax payments of thousands of dollars each year. ‚ÄúThe property tax is not designed for lower-income people at all,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy to keep up.‚Äù For some, any cut is better than nothing. <span>‚ñ†</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>Stay on top of American politics with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance" target="_blank">Checks and Balance</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which&nbsp;examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p></div><p>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "By George!"</p><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/">United States</a> <span>October 7th 2023</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/04/the-sacking-of-kevin-mccarthy-will-make-supporting-ukraine-harder"><span>Kevin McCarthy‚Äôs sacking deepens the chaos in American government</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/travelling-to-and-from-america-has-become-a-waiting-game"><span>Travelling to and from America has become a waiting game</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/republican-parties-in-important-swing-states-are-falling-behind"><span>Republican parties in important swing states are falling behind</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/the-post-title-42-lull-in-border-crossings-is-over"><span>The post-Title-42 lull in border crossings is over</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/detroit-wants-to-be-the-first-big-american-city-to-tax-land-value"><span>Detroit wants to be the first big American city to tax land value</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/what-america-should-really-learn-from-dianne-feinstein"><span>What America should really learn from Dianne Feinstein</span></a></li></ul></div><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="Are free markets history?
