            Chile’s president has declared a state of emergency after an electricity blackout plunged most of the country into darkness on Tuesday, including the capital Santiago.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7la3gss00003b6mx9o89pe9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The outage – in the middle of Chile’s summer, when temperatures in Santiago are around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) – has affected some 8 million homes, President Gabriel Boric said in an address to the nation on Tuesday evening.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7kwu8cj0000356mkqux9263@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The National Disaster Prevention and Response Service said 14 of the country’s 16 regions were impacted by the blackout, which began Tuesday afternoon.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lbaa0t0004356m99jetuiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Internet and mobile phone services were down across much of the nation and parts of Santiago’s transport network was suspended, stranding commuters, as officials scrambled to restore power.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lyiya300003b6mrj1y1l8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            By Wednesday, the government said that 90% of homes and businesses affected by the blackout had had their electricity restored, according to the Chilean National Electric Coordinator.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lyjoen00043b6m8e2vwdwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            But Chilean Interior Minister, Carolina Tohá, acknowledged in a news conference that the service still had ongoing problems and that 220,000 customers remain without power. She also added that 100% of public transport services had been restored, and that the state of emergency would be lifted later.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lyjoen00053b6mna3zw6av@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Tohá also said an investigation had been opened to establish what caused the outage. “One thing is the original failure that the company had (…) and another thing is how that system responds once the incident occurs.”
    </p>

  


    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lb2da90000356msg8281zu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The National Electrical Coordinator, Chile’s grid operator, earlier said a high-voltage backbone transmission line, that carries power from the Atacama Desert of northern Chile to Santiago in the country’s central valley, had been disrupted, leading to the blackout. It did not say what caused the disruption.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3rp9k0000356me6rmm4f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The president said the state of emergency aimed to “guarantee the safety” of citizens as the outage may last into the night. Authorities also announced a curfew in effect from 10 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7laa42000043b6mg01ey6uw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Boric blamed the debacle on the electricity companies, saying “it is not tolerable” that millions of people have been affected.
    </p>

            “We are not going to let this pass and we are going to act firmly against companies that have not risen to the occasion. For this reason, all the necessary investigations will be carried out,” he said.
    </p>

            Tohá said hospitals, prisons and government buildings were switching to backup generators to keep essential services running and that the national gendarmerie force had been deployed on the streets, to maintain security and support the flow of traffic.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lc4tfa000b356muhzxclwu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “Our first concern, and the reason for this announcement, is to ensure people’s safety,” she said. “Obviously, this was something no one planned for.”

            <span>Abstract:</span>Conventional self-attention mechanisms incur quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences. We introduce FFTNet, an adaptive spectral filtering framework that leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve global token mixing in $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time. By transforming inputs into the frequency domain, FFTNet exploits the orthogonality and energy preservation guaranteed by Parseval's theorem to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. A learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation dynamically emphasize salient frequency components, providing a rigorous and adaptive alternative to traditional self-attention. Experiments on the Long Range Arena and ImageNet benchmarks validate our theoretical insights and demonstrate superior performance over fixed Fourier and standard attention models.

<p>A venture capital-backed “AI performance monitoring system for factory workers” is proposing what appears to be dehumanizing surveillance of factories, where machine vision tracks workers’ hand movements and output so a boss can look at graphs and yell at them about efficiency.</p><p>In a launch video demoing the product, Baid and Mohta put on a skit showing how Optifye.ai would be used by factory bosses.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The YC deleted video for sweatshop startup Optifye <a href="https://t.co/vCJvm2HTce?ref=404media.co">pic.twitter.com/vCJvm2HTce</a></p>— Adam Lerman (@AdamLerman5) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamLerman5/status/1894215433366245457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">February 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>“Ugh, it’s workspace 17. Workspace 17 is the bottleneck. The worst performing workspace here,” one of the bosses says, while watching a video of a man making clothing in a factory. “Hey number 17, what’s going on man? You are in red,” he says. “I have been working all day,” the person playing the worker says. “Working all day?” the line boss replies. “You haven’t hit your hourly output even once today. And you have 11.4% efficiency, this is really bad!”&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s just been a rough day,” the “worker” replies. “Rough day?” the boss says, looking at a calendar full of red days. “More like a rough month.”&nbsp;</p><p>Optifye.ai, launched by Duke University computer science students Vivaan Baid and Kushal Mohta, is backed by Y Combinator, <a href="https://archive.is/GtuTi?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">according to the company’s site</a>. On their <a href="https://archive.is/Qu09c?ref=404media.co"><u>Y Combinator company profile</u></a>, they write that both of their families run manufacturing plants, where they’ve been exposed to factory working conditions since they were children. “I've been around assembly lines for as long as I can remember,” Baid wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Mohta wrote, “My family also runs several manufacturing plants in various industries, which has given me unrestricted access to assembly lines since I was 15.”&nbsp;</p><p>They hope to sell cameras to factory owners to use on assembly lines, their website says, and “use computer vision to tell supervisors who's working and who's not in real-time.”</p><p>Y Combinator deleted its recent Linkedin and X posts congratulating the company on launching.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXex26pUs8TaRaVO2vdq6klwTPae_pOM-aPnusQ-7taTTHHXcV3knsBxpl1boHfEFumrOfXZigYa0kti6H4K0JPvkpEpC3IOlHXj-SnYvPhf1RQ2lSmW0zOxFIo-rv8snT7FOLJF?key=Yrtm75ZzgcMcjAeui5ZPpzJb" alt="" loading="lazy" width="444" height="553"></figure><p>On their Y Combinator profile, Baid and Mohta outline who gets what out of installing micromanaging AI surveillance on assembly lines. Owners gets “accurate real-time factory, line, and worker productivity metrics,” production heads get “line-wise and worker-wise metrics,” shopfloor supervisors get to “identify who/what is causing inefficiency in the line and fix the problem on the go.” For the workers? They get the tantalizing benefit of being “held accountable for good or bad performance.”&nbsp;</p><p>Worker surveillance is already happening across industries. After the rise of remote work, companies started tracking workers’ productivity based on mouse movements, so <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mouse-mover-jiggler-app-keep-screen-on-active/?ref=404media.co"><u>workers started using “mouse jigglers”</u></a> so they could walk away from their computers and use the bathroom in peace. In Amazon warehouses, workers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/internal-documents-show-amazons-dystopian-system-for-tracking-workers-every-minute-of-their-shifts/?ref=404media.co"><u>are tracked and punished</u></a> for not meeting grueling expectations and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64384287?ref=404media.co"><u>bathroom breaks are timed</u></a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/press/press-releases/amazon-and-walmarts-excessive-warehouse-surveillance-erodes-workers-rights-seriously-harms-worker-health-and-safety/?ref=404media.co"><u>more injuries and less safe working conditions</u></a>. Optifye.ai’s approach and pitch, however, stands out because of the way its founders seem to embrace cruelty to workers in the name of productivity.</p><p>Optifye.ai and Y Combinator did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A demo from Optifye.ai, a member of Y Combinator’s current cohort, sparked a social media backlash that ended up with YC deleting it off its socials.</p>

<p>Optifye says it’s building software to help factory owners know who’s working — and who isn’t — in “real-time” thanks to AI-powered security cameras it places on assembly lines, according to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/MsF-optifye-ai-ai-performance-monitoring-for-factory-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its YC profile</a>.</p>







<p>On Monday, YC posted an <a href="https://www.optifye.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Optifye</a> demo video <a href="https://x.com/ycombinator/status/1894115085087297921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on X</a> (and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7300050840852086786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>), according to a snapshot saved by TechCrunch.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfTMq-ODhXLtY2JDWikMdXdp6o4jlLkHg5xXTYDREiRWqkcSWBGIgLdQCgQYjZKd2V8GcrW3of_qFAGFUa2We8LRxxKuHu6YHhDqkFZGVPf-Ff3qR5gg3rk4cpOeip04-U_WOMuMA?key=C-bSOu1zTaIchlPR-5L0iKfx" alt=""></figure>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AdamLerman5/status/1894215433366245457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The video</a> shows Optifye co-founder Kushal Mohta acting as the boss of a garment factory, calling a supervisor — in reality his co-founder Vivaan Baid — about a low-performing worker known only as “Number 17.”</p>

<p>“Hey Number 17, what’s going on man? You’re in the red,” Baid asks the worker, who responds that he’s been working all day.</p>

<p>“Working all day? You haven’t hit your hourly output even once and you had 11.4% efficiency. This is really bad,” Baid retorts.</p>

<p>After checking Optifye’s dashboard, the supervisor looks at the output of “Number 17” for 15 days, decides that the worker has been underperforming and calls the worker out on it.&nbsp;</p>


<p>“Rough day? More like a rough month,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clip was heavily criticized on X, where @VCBrags <a href="https://x.com/vcbrags/status/1894454286370709858?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">called it</a> “sweatshops-as-a-service” and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/miranda_nover/status/1894197679447838954">another</a> deemed it “computer vision sweatshop software.” It also <a href="https://x.com/miranda_nover/status/1894197679447838954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sparked criticism</a> on Y Combinator’s own link sharing site Hacker News.</p>

<p>Not everyone was critical, though. Eoghan McCabe, the CEO of customer support startup Intercom, <a href="https://x.com/eoghan/status/1894412092415017270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted that</a> anyone complaining better stop buying products made in China and India.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Indeed, it’s not too difficult to find tech companies in China <a href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1816116508256549836&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">touting</a> a “sleep detection” camera that uses computer vision to spot sleeping workers, for example.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Either way, YC ended up deleting the demo video from its socials, but not before it was <a href="https://x.com/archiexzzz/status/1894285551064285449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saved</a> by <a href="https://x.com/cdolan92/status/1894216778126959027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several</a> accounts.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Neither YC nor Optifye.ai responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video’s likely unintended virality showcases growing anxieties over the rise of AI, especially in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most Americans oppose using AI to track workers’ desk time, movements, and computer use, a Pew poll <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/04/20/americans-views-on-use-of-ai-to-monitor-and-evaluate-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found in 2023</a>. This is a segment of surveillance products sometimes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/20/ai-mistakes-bossware/">called “bossware.”</a></p>

<p>That hasn’t stopped VCs from funding the space, though. Invisible AI, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/invisible-ai-raises-15m-to-stick-worker-monitoring-cameras-in-factories/">raised $15 million in 2022</a> to stick worker-monitoring cameras in factories, too. </p>

<p>Protests at Tesla stores are gaining momentum across the US as people are fighting back against Elon Musk’s government takeover, and the hate is spreading to owners.</p>



<p>Last week, we reported on a new effort to organize protests at Tesla stores worldwide, but primarily in North America.</p>



<p>There were significant turnouts to disrupt Tesla operations by picketing in front of dozens of stores.</p>



<p>But the movement is ongoing, and there were protests against this weekend and <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/teslatakedown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more planned for the coming weeks</a>:</p>	
	



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-2.58.27%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>Many of the protests from this weekend appeared to be bigger than the last ones.</p>



<p>There was a big turnout at a Tesla store in Seattle that reportedly ended up closing the location:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There were reportedly as many as 200 people who gathered to protest Elon Musk at the Fort Lauderdale store in Florida:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-3.15.24%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>There are dozens of similar examples at Tesla stores all around the US and Canada, and the movement is now spreading to Europe.</p>



<p>These protests have been peaceful, and people are justifying going after Tesla for being Elon Musk’s piggy bank.</p>



<p>However, the growing negative sentiment against Tesla also attracts criminal activities like vandalism, and sometimes against Tesla owners rather the company itself.</p>



<p>Tesla owners, especially Cybertruck owners, have been increasingly reporting animosity from other road users, and in some cases, Tesla vehicles are getting tagged by anti-fascism graffiti.</p>



<p>In one case in California, a vandal put isolating foam into the charge connectors of a few charging stalls, rendering them useless.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-3.36.51%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=837" alt=""></figure>




	<p>A couple of Supercharger stalls in Utah were graffitied—pictured above. Tesla said that it would remove the graffiti today and that it will “press charges for vandalism at Superchargers.”</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>The blowback is more significant than I thought it would be. I thought things would end last weekend, but not only was this weekend’s protest bigger, but it sounds like now there are more being planned.</p>



<p>I couldn’t confirm if they were indeed able to close the store in Seattle, but if that’s true, that’s also a direct impact on Tesla’s operation.</p>



<p>It’s just sad that some vandals are going after Tesla owners. That’s just stupid to me. A</p>

<p dir="auto">DeepGEMM is a library designed for clean and efficient FP8 General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) with fine-grained scaling, as proposed in <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3">DeepSeek-V3</a>. It supports both normal and Mix-of-Experts (MoE) grouped GEMMs. Written in CUDA, the library has no compilation need during installation, by compiling all kernels at runtime using a lightweight Just-In-Time (JIT) module.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, DeepGEMM exclusively supports NVIDIA Hopper tensor cores. To address the imprecise FP8 tensor core accumulation, it employs CUDA-core two-level accumulation (promotion). While it leverages some concepts from <a href="https://github.com/nvidia/cutlass">CUTLASS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/include/cute">CuTe</a>, it avoids heavy reliance on their templates or algebras. Instead, the library is designed for simplicity, with only one core kernel function comprising around <strong>~300 lines of code</strong>. This makes it a clean and accessible resource for learning Hopper FP8 matrix multiplication and optimization techniques.</p>
<p dir="auto">Despite its lightweight design, DeepGEMM's performance matches or exceeds expert-tuned libraries across various matrix shapes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h2><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We test all shapes potentially used in DeepSeek-V3/R1 inference (including both prefilling and decoding, but without tensor parallelism) on H800 with NVCC 12.8. All speedup metrics are calculated in comparison to our internally and carefully optimized implementation based on CUTLASS 3.6.</p>

<p dir="auto">This library exclusively contains GEMM kernels. It requires the LHS scaling factor to be TMA-aligned and transposed, and it only supports the NT format (non-transposed LHS and transposed RHS). For transposition or other FP8 casting operations, please implement or fuse them into prior kernels independently. While the library provides some simple PyTorch utility functions, these may result in slower performance, but our primary focus is on optimizing the GEMM kernels themselves.</p>

<p dir="auto">To perform a basic non-grouped FP8 GEMM, call the <code>deep_gemm.gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt</code> function. For more details, please refer to the function documentation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout)</h4><a id="user-content-grouped-gemms-contiguous-layout" aria-label="Permalink: Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout)" href="#grouped-gemms-contiguous-layout"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike traditional grouped GEMMs in CUTLASS, DeepGEMM groups only the M-axis, while N and K must remain fixed. This design is tailored for scenarios where experts in an MoE model share the same shape.</p>
<p dir="auto">For training forward passes or inference prefilling, where each expert may process a varying number of tokens, we concatenate these tokens into a single tensor, referred to as the "contiguous" layout. Note that each expert segment must be aligned to the GEMM M block size (<code>get_m_alignment_for_contiguous_layout()</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information, please refer to the <code>m_grouped_gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt_contiguous</code> function documentation.</p>

<p dir="auto">During the inference decoding phase, when CUDA graph is enabled and the CPU is unaware of the number of tokens each expert receives, we support masked grouped GEMMs. By providing a mask tensor, the kernel computes only the valid portions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>m_grouped_gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt_masked</code> for this purpose and consult the relevant documentation. An example usage is to use the output of low-latency kernels from <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP">DeepEP</a> as input.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Utilities</h4><a id="user-content-utilities" aria-label="Permalink: Utilities" href="#utilities"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The library provides some utility functions besides the above kernels:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>deep_gemm.set_num_sms</code>: set the maximum SM count to use</li>
<li><code>deep_gemm.get_num_sms</code>: get the current SM maximum count</li>
<li><code>deep_gemm.get_m_alignment_for_contiguous_layout</code>: get the group-level alignment requirement for grouped contiguous layout</li>

<li><code>deep_gemm.get_col_major_tma_aligned_tensor</code>: get a column-major TMA-aligned tensor</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The library also provides some environment variables, which may be useful:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>DG_CACHE_DIR</code>: string, the cache directory to store compiled kernels, <code>$HOME/.deep_gemm</code> by default</li>
<li><code>DG_NVCC_COMPILER</code>: string, specified NVCC compiler path; will find in <code>from torch.utils.cpp_extension.CUDA_HOME</code> by default</li>

<p dir="auto">DeepGEMM employs a fully <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM/blob/main/deep_gemm/jit">Just-In-Time</a> (JIT) design, with no compilation required at installation. All kernels are compiled at runtime using a lightweight JIT implementation. This approach offers several advantages:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>GEMM shapes, block sizes, and the number of pipeline stages are treated as compile-time constants
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Saving registers</li>
<li>Compilers may do more optimizations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automatic selection of block sizes, number of warpgroups, optimal pipeline stages, and TMA cluster size
<ul dir="auto">
<li>But without auto-tuning, the optimal one is deterministically selected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full unrolling of the MMA pipelines, providing compilers with more optimization opportunities
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Very important for small shapes</li>
<li>Refer to <code>launch_k_iterations</code> in <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM/blob/main/deep_gemm/include/deep_gemm/fp8_gemm.cuh">the kernel file</a> for details</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Overall, JIT significantly improves performance for small shapes, similar to the approach of the <a href="https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/">Triton</a> compiler.</p>

<p dir="auto">For certain shapes, block sizes aligned to powers of 2 can lead to underutilized SMs. For instance, with <code>M=256, N=7168</code>, a typical block size assignment of <code>BLOCK_M=128, BLOCK_N=128</code> results in only <code>(256 / 128) * (7168 / 128) = 112</code> out of 132 SMs being utilized. To address this, we support unaligned block sizes like 112, enabling <code>(256 / 128) * (7168 / 112) = 128</code> SMs to work in such scenarios. Implementing this technique alongside fine-grained scaling requires careful optimization but ultimately delivers performance gains.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FFMA SASS interleaving 🐳</h4><a id="user-content-ffma-sass-interleaving-" aria-label="Permalink: FFMA SASS interleaving 🐳" href="#ffma-sass-interleaving-"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We observe a performance improvement in <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/examples/54_hopper_fp8_warp_specialized_gemm">the CUTLASS FP8 kernel</a> between NVCC 12.2 and 12.3. By comparing the compiled SASS, we discover that one bit in <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/eefa171318b79cbe2e78514d4cce5cd0fe919d0c/include/cutlass/gemm/collective/fp8_accumulation.hpp#L73">a series of <code>FADD</code> instructions</a> is flipped in an interleaving pattern.
After referencing some open-source <a href="https://github.com/cloudcores/CuAssembler/blob/master/CuAsm/CuControlCode.py#L46">CUDA assembler</a> implementations, we identified that this bit controls <code>yield</code>, which may enhance warp-level parallelism (just a guess, yielding the current warp and let other warps work).</p>
<p dir="auto">To leverage this, we develop <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM/blob/main/deep_gemm/jit/interleave_ffma.py">a similar script</a> to modify the <code>FFMA</code> instructions in the compiled binary. Besides simply modifying the <code>yield</code> bit, we also flip the <code>reuse</code> bit (registers cannot be reused if the warp is yielded). This adjustment improves performance (10%+ in some cases) for fine-grained scaling FP8 GEMMs by creating more opportunities to overlap MMA instructions with promotion <code>FFMA</code> instructions.</p>

<p>Check out the discussion of this post on
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43177931">Hacker News</a>.</p>
<p>We have news! <b>EdgeDB</b> is rebranding as Gel, more on that below.</p>
<p>Let's talk about something else first.</p>
<p>Something fascinating has been happening recently.  PostgreSQL seems to be
            quietly <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies-database">eating</a> the <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/106">database world</a>.
            It's not just topping the charts, its adoption momentum is accelerating.
            What's going on?  The answer is right there in the PostgreSQL.org's tagline:</p>
<div><p>The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database</p></div>
<p>It's not just an empty marketing boast.  It's <b>meaningful</b>.  Let's unpack,
            starting with what I think is the most important and consequential bit:
            <b>Open Source</b>.</p>
<p>Regardless of source availability, most database systems on the market today
            (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB">MySQL</a>) are developed by a commercial entity.
            Postgres is <em>different</em>.  It got bootstrapped at Berkeley as a
            <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/postgres.html">research project</a> and released under a very liberal
            MIT-like license.  A decently-sized user base formed and after the university
            stopped making new releases, the project (newly-renamed as PostgreSQL) was
            picked up by a group of motivated hackers and that's how Postgres as we know
            it still gets developed and released today.</p>
<p>Arguably, this makes PostgreSQL the <em>only</em> mainsteam database system that is
            truly open-source.  It can't be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/16/sun-picks-up-mysql-for-1-billion-open-source-is-a-legitimate-business-model/">bought</a> or
            <a href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/">license-rug-pulled</a> and this creates a kind of <em>trust</em>
            that can't be emulated in any other way.</p>
<p>I'm aware that the above might sound a bit funny coming from a
                co-founder of a VC-backed startup.  Gel is Apache-licensed and
                we're about to future-proof that, stay tuned for a blog post.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the <b>Advanced</b> bit.</p>
<p>When the POSTGRES project was begun at Berkeley in 1985, extensibility and
            modularity were made the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/16856.16888">cornerstones of its design</a>.
            This is possibly one of the main factors that made PostgreSQL successful.
            Custom data types, index types and operators were there since the inception.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL is a relational database at it's core, but with the ability to store
            (and index) JSON, spatial data, time series, vectors, it's arguably multimodal.
            Postgres might not be the <em>best</em> tool in any given use case, but it's <em>good
                enough</em>.  Being able to run just one DBMS instead of 10 and do all the things
            you want to do is great! (Which is why, I think, most vector database startups
            are probably not going to make it in the long run.)</p>
<p>Also, building Postgres extensions is fun and nowadays you can even do it in
            <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">Rust</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to actually running queries, PostgreSQL's query planner/optimizer
            is decidedly state-of-the-art.  Given how much more compressed and expressive
            EdgeQL (Gel's query language) is compared to SQL, it's quite easy to write
            queries that translate to hundreds of kilobytes of SQL and Postgres usually
            chews through that without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL is the cleanest and most documented C project of this scale, and the
            sheer quality of the codebase is what gives Postgres all of the powers mentioned
            above while also keeping it extremely stable and secure.</p>
<p>So, yes, Postgres <em>is</em> the world's most advanced open source relational database
            (sorry, Sam!).  What's even more fascinating is that Postgres seems to have been
            elevated to a sort of a <em>de-facto standard</em>.  Have you noticed how almost every
            recent database startup claims or strives for PostgreSQL wire-protocol and SQL
            dialect compatibility?  CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, TiDB, and even <a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/postgresql-interface">Google Spanner</a> all either speak PostgreSQL exclusively or as an option.
            Oh, and you don't even need to build a whole new database from scratch to
            achieve compute and storage elasticity, just replace Postgres' storage layer
            like AWS Aurora or Neon did and you're good!</p>
<div data-section-id="supercharged-postgres-is-the-future" id="supercharged-postgres-is-the-future">

<p>OK, so Postgres is awesome (and that is likely not news for you), but why such
                a long intro to a rebrand announcement?  It's because this is not just a
                rebrand, but also a good moment to reflect on what Gel really _is_ and where
                it fits in the Postgres ecosystem and the larger market of software
                infrastructure.</p>
<p>Where Aurora and Neon replace PostgreSQL's storage layer, Gel replaces the
                <em>frontend</em> layer.  To oversimplify, Gel to Postgres is what TypeScript is to
                JavaScript, and our business is that we write intelligent compilers for data
                schemas and queries and run the outputs in Postgres efficiently.</p>
<p>Here lies an important point: TypeScript has been very successful in initial
                adoption because it provided full compatibility with vanilla JS and allows
                for incremental adoption.  On the other hand, Gel historically required
                complete buy-in.  We are changing this today.</p>
<p>In Gel 6.0 we are introducing full support for SQL—not just in PostgreSQL
                protocol mode, but natively in the Gel protocol as well!  Additionally, Gel is
                now fully supported in Drizzle (thanks, guys!). Guides will be available
                shortly on how to use Prisma and SQLAlchemy with Gel.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the future of Gel?  More compilers, more Postgres,
                more ecosystem integration.</p>
<p>OK, a quick Q&amp;A on the rebrand is also in order.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="why-the-rebrand" id="why-the-rebrand">
<h2 id="why-the-rebrand">Why the Rebrand?</h2>
<p><b>Clarity</b></p>
<p>The name "EdgeDB" is cool, but it carries some misleading connotations. "Edge"
                has led some to believe we are an edge computing database or a pure graph
                database—when in fact, EdgeDB is neither.</p>
<p><b>Simplicity</b></p>
<p>We wanted something short, memorable, and frictionless.  Gel is easy to say,
                easy to type, and, most importantly, embodies how we see our platform:
                flexible, cohesive, and built to allow integrating software with databases
                seamlessly.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="what-s-changing-and-what-s-not" id="what-s-changing-and-what-s-not">
<h2 id="what-s-changing-and-what-s-not">What's Changing (and What's Not)?</h2>
<p>Nothing changes aside from the name, we're still the same company, same team,
                same mission.</p>
<p>All tools and libraries are now available under the new name (just
                substitute <code>edgedb</code> with <code>gel</code>).  For compatibility we are shipping
                shims, symlinks and transition packages under the old name, so nothing
                should break.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="wrapping-up" id="wrapping-up">

<p>This week is release week, keep an eye out for some more cool announcements

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>In Framework's first-party case, the PC starts at $1,099, which gets you a Ryzen AI Max 385 (that's an 8-core CPU and 32 GPU cores) and 32GB of RAM. A fully loaded 128GB with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 configuration (16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores) will run you $1,999. There's also an in-between build with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and 64GB of RAM for $1,599.&nbsp;If you just want the mini ITX board to put in a case of your choosing, that starts at $799.</p>
<p>None of these are impulse buys, exactly, but they're priced a bit better than a gaming-focused mini PC like the Asus ROG NUC, which <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1860500-REG/asus_rnuc14srku7169aui_republic_of_gamers_nuc.html?ap=y&amp;smp=y&amp;msclkid=665d398fca4517ecc9d75e33332b247f">starts at nearly $1,300 as of this writing</a> and comes with half as much RAM. It's also priced well compared to what you can get out of a DIY mini ITX PC based on integrated graphics—the Ryzen 7 8700G, an AM5 ITX motherboard, and 32GB of DDR5 can all be had for around $500 collectively before you add a case, power supply, or SSD, but for considerably slower performance.</p>
<p>The volume of the Framework Desktop's first-party case is just 4.5 liters—for reference, <a href="https://ssupd.co/products/cases-meshroom-s-v2">the SSUPD Meshroom S</a> is 14.9 liters, a fairly middle-of-the-road volume for an ITX case that can fit a full-size GPU. An Xbox Series X is about 6.9 liters, and the Xbox Series S is 4.4 liters. Apple's Mac Studio is about 3.7 liters. The Framework Desktop isn't breaking records, but it's definitely tiny. </p>

          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      Despite the non-upgradeability of the main components, Framework has tried to stick to existing standards where it can by using a flex ATX power supply, ATX headers on the motherboard, regular 120 mm fans that can be changed out, and of course the mini ITX form factor itself.

<p>So the pitch for the system is easy: You get a reasonably powerful 1440p-capable gaming and workstation PC inside a case the size of a small game console. "If the Series S could run Windows, I'd buy it in a second" is a thought that has occurred to me, so I can see the appeal, even though it costs at least three times as much.</p>
<p>But it does feel like a strange fit for Framework, given that it's so much&nbsp;<em>less</em> upgradeable than most PCs. The CPU and GPU are one piece of silicon, and they're soldered to the motherboard. The RAM is also soldered down and not upgradeable once you've bought it, setting it apart from nearly every other board Framework sells.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          

<p>Should public bodies in Illinois, like cities and school districts
and sheriff’s departments, be allowed to hide information from Freedom
of Information requests by keeping them in databases? That question is
before the 104th Illinois General Assembly, thanks to a bill sponsored
by Donald P. DeWitte, elected state senator by the wise citizens of
Batavia and Elgin (motto: “The City In The Suburbs”; indeed), and
prompted in part by my friend Matt Chapman.</p>
<p>I play a very small part in this story, so I get to tell it.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Illinois has an <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=85">excellent,
toothy FOIA statute</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://casetext.com/statute/illinois-compiled-statutes/government/chapter-5-general-provisions/subchapter-freedom-of-information/act-140-freedom-of-information-act/section-5-ilcs-1407-exemptions">very
few exceptions</a>, any information collected by an Illinois public body
is public property. Anybody is entitled to ask for it. You can’t
generally be charged for asking. Public bodies can’t really limit the
number of requests you make. They get just 5 days to respond, with 5
additional extension days if requested in writing. Improper denials can
get you legal fee recovery if you sue over them, so there are lawyers
that will take these cases on contingency. It’s pretty neat!</p>
<p>I think people are too shy about making FOIA requests. It’s easier
than it looks! You just need to send an email to the public body you
want information from. Put “FOIA” in the subject line. By law, there’s
no more ceremony to it than that. And you’ll find that the people
responding to those emails are generally kind and happy to help.</p>
<p>The one big limitation of Illinois FOIA (with FOIA laws everywhere, really)
is that you can’t use them to compel public bodies to create new
records. Often, what you’ll be looking for is some kind of report about
some issue of public policy. If that exact report exists, you’re golden.
But if it doesn’t, you have to find and request the raw data for that
report, and you have to assemble it yourself. This limitation is about
to matter a lot.</p>
<p>To understand what’s happening in this story, I’m going to have to
explain a technical concept: the idea of a “database schema”. More and
more of the information tracked by public bodies now lives in databases,
rather than filing cabinets or shared drives. Databases are organized
according to schemas.</p>
<p>Think of a modern database as a huge Excel spreadsheet file, with
many dozens of tabs. Each tab has a name; under each of those tabs is a
separate spreadsheet. Each spreadsheet has a header row, labeling the
columns, like “price” and “quantity” and “name”. A database schema is
simply the names of all the tabs, and each of those header rows.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You now understand databases. 

</p><h2>Matt Chapman vs. City of Chicago</h2>
<p>My friend Matt is a self-styled “<a href="https://mchap.io/">civic
hacker</a>” and a national expert at performing data journalism with
large-scale FOIA requests. Matt’s love language is pushing FOIA statutes
to their limits, sniffing out buried data and bulk-extracting it with
clever requests.</p>
<p>A good example of the kind of stuff Matt does is this <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chicago-ticket-data-chi-hack-night">ProPublica
collaboration</a> about how Chicago issues parking tickets. After Matt
was towed over a facially bogus ticket and successfully took the city to
court over it, he got curious about the patterns of towing for things
like compliance violations. As it turns out, parking tickets have pushed
thousands of Illinoisans into bankruptcy, and, once you <a href="https://mchap.io/parking-ticket-visualization-in-chicago.html">get
your hands on the ticket data</a>, it turns out there’s a very clear
pattern of majority-Black neighborhoods being systematically targeted
for higher enforcement.</p>
<p>In the course of this reporting work, Matt learned about a system
Chicago operates called CANVAS. CANVAS is the central repository for all
parking ticket data in the city. It’s a giant database, and Matt would
very much like to know what’s in it. So he filed a FOIA request for the
CANVAS database schema.</p>
<p>The city flatly refused. To do so, they relied on a specific
exemption in the statute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“(o) Administrative or technical information associated with
automated data processing operations, including but not limited to
software, operating protocols, computer program abstracts, file layouts,
source listings, object modules, load modules, user guides,
documentation pertaining to all logical and physical design of
computerized systems, employee manuals, and any other information that,
if disclosed, would jeopardize the security of the system or its data or
the security of materials exempt under this Section.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain English, this exemption says that public bodies aren’t
required to reveal information that might jeopardize the security of
their systems. You obviously can’t FOIA logins and passwords. You also
generally can’t FOIA the source code of programs they run. Chicago
claimed that Matt was a “hacker”, and that the CANVAS schema could in
the wrong hands put the city at risk.</p>
<p>With the help of Merrick Wayne and Matt Topic of Loevy and Loevy,
Matt sued the city. Here’s where I come in.</p>
<h2 id="they-put-me-on-the-stand">They Put Me On The Stand</h2>
<p><img src="https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2025/02/09/fixing-illinois-foia/dresscode.png"></p>
<p>Is the CANVAS schema too scary to give Matt Chapman? To decide that,
we have to answer a bunch of questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does disclosure of a database schema really jeopardize the security
of the system?</li>
<li>How plausible or likely does that jeopardy need to be?</li>
<li>Does a database schema constitute “source code”?</li>
<li>Is a SQL schema a “file format”?</li>
<li>And, finally, does the “would jeopardize” language apply to
everything in the exemption, or just to the nearest noun “any other
information”?</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve spent the last 25 years of my life doing software vulnerability
research, which is a stuffy way of saying that I’m a software developer
who looks for bugs in software that would let people do scary things.
Matt retained me as his expert witness for his trial, which took place
in Cook County Chancery Court. Lined up against me was Bruce Coffing, the
Chief Information Security Officer of the City of Chicago.</p><p> The trial
would revolve mostly around questions 1-3.</p>
<p>At this point, I need to read you in to another technical concept:
“SQL Injection”. “SQL” is the language most programs use to talk to
databases. “SQL Injection” is a security vulnerability that programs
that use SQL can have. It’s the primary way databases get attacked, and it’s
straightforward to explain.</p>
<p>Applications that use databases include in their code “SQL queries”,
which are form-letter templates of questions they might need to ask the
database; for instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Retrieve the dates of every parking ticket issued to <span>‘[INSERT
NAME]’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, let's say it comes time to pull tickets for “Dave Arnold”. Simple: stick
his name in the template:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Retrieve the dates of every parking ticket issued to <span>‘Dave
Arnold’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But now imagine we need to look up “Bob O’Connor”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Retrieve the dates of every parking ticket issued to <span>‘Bob
O’</span><span>Connor’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve confused the database: the name in our query is surrounded by
quotes, but our name includes a quote. Normally, when your program has
this bug, it just generates an error message. But attackers look for
this bug, and do things like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Retrieve the data of every parking ticket issued to <span>‘Bob O’</span><span> and also
all the rest of the information in the database including everyone’s
passwords.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This works because the quote the attacker supplied cuts off the text
placeholder in the template; all the rest of the attacker’s input gets
interpreted as code, which the database executes.</p>
<p>Most of the people who will read this post are annoyed with me for
taking the time to explain SQL injection. But that is the experience of
getting on the stand in Chancery Court and making an argument that the
CISO of Chicago was wrong about database vulnerabilities: trying to
ensure that a judge shares your understanding of how software
vulnerabilities work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re one of my non-nerd readers,
congratulations, you now know how to hack the Internets. If anybody
asks, I didn’t tell you any of this.</p>
<p>The bench trial for Matt’s case came down to the question of whether
releasing the CANVAS schema would enable this attack. Specifically,
Bruce Coffing argued: </p>
<ol>
<li>The schema makes it possible to spot
vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Further, it makes it easier for attackers to be
sneaky about probing for vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Finally, it helps attackers
pick which applications are most profitable to attack.</li></ol>
<p>Coffing seems like a perfectly lovely and well-qualified person. <strong>But
no, no to all of this.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2025/02/09/fixing-illinois-foia/slowdown.png"></p>
<p>To Coffing’s first point: you don’t find SQL injection
vulnerabilities by reading database schemas. You find them instead in
the application’s source code, where those database template queries
live. Matt isn’t asking for source code. He just wants the header rows
from the tables.</p>
<p>Here I want to point out that <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6746618-Matt-Chapman-v-Department-of-Finance-XX-1092020/?q=file+layout&amp;mode=document#document/p131">I
fucked up in multiple ways</a> expert-witnessing for Matt. For example,
in <a href="https://youtu.be/pPC9Bntrsew?feature=shared&amp;t=28">my affidavit</a>, I wrote that SQL schemas would provide “only marginal
value” to an attacker. Big mistake. Chicago jumped on those words and
said “see, you yourself agree that a schema is of some value to an
attacker.” Of course, I don’t really believe that; “only marginal value”
is just self-important message-board hedging. I also claimed on the
stand that “only an incompetently built application” could be attacked
with nothing but it’s schema. Even I don’t know what I meant by
that.</p>
<p>I recovered my footing when I came up with this argument: “Attackers
like me use SQL injection attacks to recover SQL schemas. The schema is
the product of an attack, not one of its predicates”. This, too, is
self-important puffery. But I’ll tell you who loves “products” and
“predicates”, especially used in relation to each other in a single
sentence: a Chicago Chancery Court judge.</p>
<p>To Coffing’s second argument, about the schema helping attackers stay
off his radar when they try attacks, the problem is that every computer
system connected to the Internet is being attacked every minute of every
day. The noise is deafening.</p>
<p>Thousands of people have built scanner bot programs that probe every
computer system they can find and fire batteries of well-known attacks
(almost none of them ever work, but bots don’t get bored and give up,
and eventually the teenager in Malaysia who launched the bot gets
lucky). Chicago has no operational response to people turning the
doorknobs of their various applications. They can’t; if they did, they’d
spend all their time responding to kids in Kuala Lumpur goofing
around.</p>
<p>Finally, Coffing argued that having the schema might help an attacker
decide whether or not an attack would be profitable. A schema might tell
you, for instance, that an application deals in credit card data. The
thing is, CANVAS already tells you it’s dealing in sensitive
information: it’s the backend for processing parking tickets. You don’t
need a schema to know that CANVAS is interesting to attackers.</p>
<p>The judge bought my arguments. I think my attire gave me
salt-of-the-earth credibility; Coffing wore a suit.</p>
<p>Providing testimony was a lot of fun. I’d like to do it again
sometime. Litigation is super fascinating to watch! For example: we
wanted me to testify after Bruce Coffing, so we’d have some idea of what
arguments we needed to rebut. But we brought the FOIA case, so the
burden was ostensibly on us, and our witnesses went first. But, a-ha!
Invoking an exemption in Illinois FOIA is an affirmative defense, and
the burden of those arguments shifts to the defendant. But wait: to get
fee recovery under the law, we want to assert a willful violation of
FOIA; to make that claim, Chicago argues, the burden shifts back to us.
Ultimately, Matt Topic and Chicago compromised; Topic dropped
“wilfullness” and we got to go second.</p>
<p>I’m not saying this is the most interesting thing ever to have
happened, but only that if someone works out a way to use AI to make a
home version of Chancery Court trials that you can play on a
Playstation, I will rack up 10,000 hours playing that game easily.</p>

<p><img src="https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2025/02/09/fixing-illinois-foia/iwin.png"></p>
<p>We won. But Chicago immediately appealed. Matt Chapman didn’t get the
CANVAS schema. Two years later, <a href="https://ilcourtsaudio.blob.core.windows.net/antilles-resources/resources/5ff80f52-17df-4b2a-ba91-4b977f150c6f/Chapman%20v.%20Chicago%20Department%20of%20Finance,%202022%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20200547.pdf">the
case came before the First District Appellate Court</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the appeals court is that the original trial court
is the primary “trier of fact”. You appeal legal conclusions, but the
facts determined in the original case generally stand. Our bench trial
took care of questions 1 and 3. That left 2, 4, and 5. Here’s what the
appeals court found:</p>
<p><em>In considering the danger of disclosing information under FOIA,
how likely does an attack need to be?</em></p><p> Answer: it has to be very
likely.</p><p>The statute says “information that, if disclosed, would
jeopardize”.</p><p> Believe it or not, there’s case law on “would” versus
“could” with respect to safety. “Could” means you could imagine
something happening. But the legal standard for “would” is “clear
evidence of harm leaving no reasonable doubt to the judge”. The statute
set the bar for me very low and I managed to clear it.</p><p> Doesn’t this just
make you want to immediately drop everything and become a litigator? I
want to litigate!</p>
<p><em>Is a SQL schema a “file layout”?</em></p><p>
If a schema isn’t source code and it isn’t a file layout, the exemption
doesn’t appear to apply at all. The verdict: “shrug emoji”. The appeals
court didn’t reach this question, because:</p>
<p><em>Does the “would jeopardize” language in the statute apply to
everything in the exemption, or just to the nearest noun “any other
information”?</em></p><p> Ladies and gentlemen it is time for some legal
mumbo-jumbo.</p>
<p>Here’s the FOIA exemption Chicago relies on: <img src="https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2025/02/09/fixing-illinois-foia/statute.png"> To what does
the qualifying language at point (4) in this text refer? Is it “any
other information” (3)? Os is it “Administrative or technical
information”, meaning everything in the exemption?</p>
<p>If it’s the former, “any other information”, Matt has a problem. That
interpretation means things like file layouts (and
employee manuals and “load modules”, whatever those are) are <em>per
se</em> exempt; that the Illinois legislature meant them as examples of
things that would jeopardize security.</p><p> If it’s the latter, Matt has
already won: whether or not a SQL schema is a “software” or a “file
layout” or a “load module”, we’ve already proven that it won’t
jeopardize security.</p>
<p>The court decides it’s the latter. Also, that I am very charming. We
win on appeal. Chicago immediately appeals again. Whatever’s in CANVAS,
they really don’t want you and I to know about it.</p>
<p>A year and change later, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/il-supreme-court/2201134.html">the
case is decided before the Illinois Supreme Court</a>. And, on the
question of how to read the FOIA statute, the Supreme Court disagrees
with the appeals court. The qualifying language in the statute applies
only to “any other information”. Everything else is “per se” exempt.</p>
<p>We started this legal process, of challenging Chicago’s attempt to
exempt CANVAS from FOIA, with 5 questions. What happens now is that the
4th question, of whether a schema is a “file layout”, finally becomes
very important. The Illinois Supremes have just decided that “file
layouts” are <em>per se</em> exempt under Illinois FOIA.</p>
<p>Is a SQL schema a file layout? Of course not. The same SQL schema can
be used by multiple database engines, and each will use a different
underlying file layout to manage the resulting data.</p>
<p>The McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms, 6E —
which the Illinois Supreme Court cites — describes a “file layout” as “A
description of the arrangement of the data in a file.” <strong>A SQL schema is
almost the exact opposite thing: it’s an abstraction of the data in a
file, invented specifically so you don’t have to think about how the
data is actually arranged.</strong> Checkmate!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Illinois Supreme Court had at their disposal a
second dictionary. In the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, a “schema”
is defined as “a structured framework or plan: outline”. “This is a
difference in name only”, said the court. Argh. Schemas are now file
layouts. We lose.</p>
<h3 id="where-this-leaves-us">Where This Leaves Us</h3>
<p>Obviously, <a href="https://www.bettergov.org/2023/05/19/better-government-association-statement-supreme-court-foia-ruling-limits-transparency-significantly-broadens-exemptions-to-foia/">we
should have won on appeal to the Illinois Supremes</a>. If you sit on
that court, call me, we can straighten this out.</p>
<p>That said: today, Illinois public bodies can refuse to divulge
database schemas.</p>
<p>This is problematic, because more and more data is finding its way
out of file cabinets and shared drives and Word documents and into
specialized applications, where the only way to get at the underlying
data is to FOIA a database query.</p>
<p>Databases shouldn’t be a safe harbor for municipalities to conceal
information from the public.</p>
<p>But, thanks to the good people of Elgin, and also Crystal Lake
(motto: “No, Not The One From Friday the 13th”), the Illinois
legislature has an opportunity to fix this. <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=114&amp;GA=104&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=226&amp;GAID=18&amp;LegID=157537&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session=">SB0226</a>
would add the following language to the statute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Public bodies] shall provide a sufficient description of the
structures of all databases under the control of the public body to
allow a requester to request the public body to perform specific
database queries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>⚡️<strong>Hell yes</strong>.⚡️</p>
<p>My understanding is that this bill was proposed in no small part
because Matt Chapman has steadfastly refused to shut up about this
issue, and so I’ll conclude this long piece by saying (1) obviously the
bill should pass, and (2) it should be called “The Chapman Act”.</p>
<p>Call your reps!</p>

		<h3>My Dad and the Cold War</h3>


<p>On the occasion of the public unveiling of the XB-70 Valkyrie, brigadier general Fred Ascani stood at his podium and began addressing the crowd at North American Aviation’s plant no. 42 in Palmdale, California.
General Ascani was the Air Force’s program director for the project and knew as much as anyone about the plane, but as the massive delta-winged XB-70 was towed out of the hangar he stopped his prepared speech, turned to look,
 and, like everyone else in attendance that afternoon, 
simply stared in disbelief.</p>

<p>The XB-70, conceived during the height of the Cold War as a replacement for the B-52, was perhaps the most audacious plane ever commissioned by the Air Force.
It was designed to fly higher and faster than any enemy fighter, drop thermo-nuclear bombs over targets in the Soviet Union, outfly the blast radius, 
and then return home without ever refueling. It was intended to be the ultimate display of American technological prowess; the ultimate weapon of mass destruction. The plane wasn’t simply an evolution of any current design, 
but a leap in technology so advanced that it seemed to come from a science-fiction movie.
“She is so unlike other aircraft that comparisons are almost meaningless,” wrote Mel Hunter.
</p>

<p>But by the time that first XB-70 rolled out onto the tarmac in the California desert it had already been replaced by a new weapon of mass destruction—the ballistic missile. 
The plane became a political pawn and was eventually reduced to a just a test program.</p>

<p>By this time my dad had spent six years working on the XB-70 project. So this is the story of my dad’s brush with the Cold War and, as best as I can piece together, the story of my dad before he was my dad.</p>


<p>I.</p>

<p>My dad was the oldest son of a family of tenant farmers in Nothern Indiana. He grew up during the Depression and was so poor, at least according to the family story, that after the farm was 
electrified by Roosevelt in the mid-1930s, my grandfather had to choose between buying him a baseball glove or buying lightbulbs for the farmhouse. 
Obviously, my dad couldn’t make a living on a farm that could barely support my grandfather, so after high school he went to work; first in a hatchery (a job he hated), then for a company that built 
<a href="https://amusementparkives.com/2017/01/31/miniature-train-company/" title="Amusement Parkives">miniature trains</a> for amusement parks (a job he liked).</p>

</figure>

<p>In November, 1952—when my dad was 22—it became clear that he was going to be drafted into the Army and sent to fight in Korea. Instead he enlisted in the Navy,
trained as an aviation structural mechanic, and, among other things, spent time aboard the escort carrier <i>USS Sitkoh Bay.</i>
“It was the best thing that ever happened to him,” my mom said, “If it weren’t for the Navy he would have ended up back on a farm in Indiana.”</p>

</figure>

<p>After he was discharged in 1956, my dad didn’t return to the farm, but, with the help of a friend, got a job with the Flight Propulsion Division of General Electric in Evendale (just outside of Cincinnati), 
initially working night shift in the Controls and Accessories department. This is when he met my mom, who was a secretary in a different department.
“He would bring me lunch after working all night,” she told me. They were married within a year.</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>While my dad was fixing airplane hydraulic systems at the tail end of the war, Eisenhower, the newly-elected president, was working on something a little bigger: a national security policy to counter the growing Soviet military threat in Europe.
This “<a href="http://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/a-new-look-at-the-new-look/" title="A New Look at New Look - CRB">New Look</a>” policy, as it was called, relied on a nuclear deterrent with the Strategic Air Command as its’ centerpiece.
The idea was that America didn’t need to match the Soviets’ perceived superiority in conventional forces, but instead, could develop the 
capability to deliver an overwhelming retaliatory nuclear strike anywhere in the world on just a few hours notice.</p>

<p>At the time, the only way to reliably deliver that nuclear strike was by aircraft; first the B-47 Stratojet, then the massive B-52 Stratofortress.
But in 1955, the same year the B-52 was put into service, the Soviets introduced the MiG-19, a supersonic fighter capable of intercepting any American bomber.
Realizing the problem now at hand, the Air Force issued General Operational Requirement No. 38, calling for a next-generation strategic bomber.
After several different design proposals, the contract for this new plane, designated the B-70 and nicknamed the “Valkyrie,” was finally awarded to North American Aviation.
The engine contract was given to General Electric.</p> 

<p>GE was accustomed to adjusting their workforce based on their military and civilian contracts and the XB-70 contract was huge—potentially hundreds of engines. They soon put together a team, including my dad, to design, 
build and test this new engine-the 30,000-lb class YJ93-3. </p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Although North American’s chief engineer Harrison Storms was credited with the overall design of the plane—a box fuselage with forward canards and large, foldable wing tips that allowed the plane to literally surf atop its own 
shockwave—the XB-70 was the result of thousands of nameless engineers and technicians.
Among other things, it required new stainless steel-aluminum honeycomb wing and fuselage panels (and new particle-beam welding techniques), more than 200 high-pressure hydraulic devices (including 17 different filters),
a novel anti-lock brake system, and even a new type of heat-ablative paint.
In all, North American reported that 14 <em>million</em> engineering hours were spent on the project.</p>

<p>Like the airframe, the engine required the efforts of hundreds of engineers to design everything from a new turbofan and compressor, to new fire-suppression systems, to a special high-temperature fuel. Exactly what part my dad worked on is unclear; 
I always thought it was an oil pan, but my older brother was sure it was an oil pump. Whatever it was, it was a small contribution to something much bigger and something he was always proud of.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>After the Soviets tested their first thermonuclear bomb in 1953, Eisenhower made research into missile technology his highest defense priority.
Land-based Atlas ICBMs were put into service in 1959 and submarine-based Polaris ICBMs the next year. Missiles were now a much cheaper and more effective way to deliver nuclear weapons
than any plane, and the very idea of a supersonic bomber now seemed obsolete. 
Then, in October 1960, Gary Power’s U2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union and it became clear that no plane,
regardless of how fast or high it could fly, was safe from surface-to-air missiles.</p>

<p>During secret meetings in November, 1959, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended downsizing the XB-70 to a bare minimum R&amp;D project, but 
during the 1960 presidential campaign both Kennedy and Nixon supported the XB-70 to court California voters. After Kennedy was elected, however, he again
cancelled the project, calling it “unnecessary and economically unjustifiable.” Finally, in March, 1961 a production order for three XB-70s was placed.
All of the weapon systems were cancelled and the program was reduced to a study of high-speed aeronautics.</p>

<p>GE delivered the first engines, which included my dad’s oil pan or pump or whatever, in early 1962, but it took North American another two years to complete the first plane: Air Vehicle 1 was delivered on May 7th, 1964 and Air Vehicle 2 five months later.
The third plane was cancelled before it was completed.</p>

<p>While congress was debating the future of the B-70 project my parents started a family (older brother, 1960), lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis, bought the only 
<a href="http://www.codex99.com/design/greenhills.html" title="Greenhills">house</a> they ever lived in, experienced the collective shock of the Kennedy Assassination,
then watched the Beatles on Ed Sullivan (although they never liked the Beatles; they liked the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EPsuOEH1fY" title="Youtube - The Irish Rovers">Irish Rovers</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vur0033a-U" title="Youtube - Danny Boy">Vivian Della Chiesa</a>). 
During all of this my dad continued to work on the J93 project during the day and began studying engineering at night. I was born just a week after the first XB-70 was rolled out.
</p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p>On September 21st, 1964, AV-1 took its maiden flight from Palmdale to Edwards AFB. One engine failed during the flight and the rear wheels locked on landing, causing a fire.
Later problems included honeycomb panels that separated, landing gear that wouldn’t retract, loss of hydraulic pressure and even peeling paint.
Eventually the mechanical problems were fixed and the program began achieving its operational goals: the plane reached Mach 1 on October 12th and Mach 2 on March 24th, 1965. Then, on 14 October 14th, 1965—exactly 17 years to the day after Chuck Yeager first broke the 
sound barrier—it surpassed mach 3. AV-2, an updated design that solved many of the problems with the first airframe, first flew in July, 1965, and eight months later reached Mach 3.08.

</figure>


<p>In 1966 the AV-2 was outfitted with sensors for a joint USAF/NASA program to study sonic boom signtures. Then on June 8th, 1966, GE requested a publicity photoshoot of the AV-2 in formation with four other aircraft, all using GE engines. After the photos, an F-104 Starfighter, piloted by NASA’s Joe Walker, collided with the XB-70’s right wing, 
flipped over and damaged the wing and rear stabilizers on the AV-2 before it went down in a fireball, killing Walker. The AV-2 went into an uncontrollable spin. Pilot Al White managed to eject and survived, albeit with serious injuries, but
co-pilot Carl Cross was killed. The AV-2 was destroyed, creating a debris field near Barstow, California.</p>

	<figcaption>Engine postmortem, July 22nd, 1966</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>Despite the loss of the more capable AV-2, the joint test program continued with the AV-1, which was now speed-limited to Mach 2.5. In 1967 the XB-70 was chosen for its last research program—a NASA study of supersonic aircraft control.
Finally, on February 4th, 1969, the AV-1 took its last flight from Edwards AFB to Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, where it was destined to become a museum piece.</p>

<p>In all, the AV-1 flew 83 test flights and the AV-2 flew 46 flights, for a combined total of 235 hours (including 108 minutes above Mach 3).
The Air Force learned that pushing the technological envelope resulted in plane that was difficult to build, difficult to maintain, difficult to fly, and perhaps even more importantly, was incredibly 
expensive; the program cost nearly 1.5 billion dollars, or around 11 million dollars per flight.</p>

<p>The data from the program, which took years to analyze, was used in the design of the Boeing SST project, the French/British Concorde and the B-1 bomber. The data was even used by the Soviets, through old-fashioned espionage, 
in the design of the Tu-144.

</figure>

<p>GE built only 38 engines for the XB-70, and as the project winded down most involved with the engine were reassigned to other projects or were laid off. My dad, however, remained on the J93 project to the very end. 
He even went to California to watch a test flight. Then, after five years of night school, he finally completed an undergraduate degree in engineering and became the first person on either side of the family to ever graduate from college.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p>After the J93 project my dad, now a licensed mechanical engineer, worked on a technical manual (a job he hated), then the gas turbine LM2500 engine (a job he liked).
Eventually, however, he tired of the constant reassignments and worried about his job security, so in 1972 he left GE to work at Nixon’s newly-created National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.
At the age of 41 he reinvented himself as an industrial hygenist,
and became, of all things, an international expert in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047322X.1990.10389612" title="An Overview of Push—Pull Ventilation Characteristics">push-pull</a> ventilation.
There’s now even an <a href="https://www.acgih.org/membership/other/awards/robert-t-hughes-memorial-award" title="ACGIH Robert T. Hughes Memorial Award">award</a> given out in his name.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, when my dad was nearing retirement, we would take a yearly trip to Dayton and the 
<a href="https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/" title="National Museum of the USAF">Air Force Museum</a> (usually on the day after Christmas—it became something of a family tradition). In the back hanger was the only remaining XB-70, 
a monster dwarfing the aircraft displayed around it.
 My dad would point to the engine on a yellow dolly under the wing and said to his grandsons, “You know I worked on that, right?”</p>
 
 <p>Although my dad didn’t live long enough to see it, he now has great-grandchildren. In a few years—when their old enough to understand—I’ll take them to the Air Force Museum (hopefully on the day after Christmas), 
 show them the engine under the XB-70
 and tell them the story of their great-grandpa.</p>

<p>A venture capital-backed “AI performance monitoring system for factory workers” is proposing what appears to be dehumanizing surveillance of factories, where machine vision tracks workers’ hand movements and output so a boss can look at graphs and yell at them about efficiency.</p><p>In a launch video demoing the product, founders Vivaan Baid and Kushal Mohta put on a skit showing how Optifye.ai would be used by factory bosses.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The YC deleted video for sweatshop startup Optifye <a href="https://t.co/vCJvm2HTce">pic.twitter.com/vCJvm2HTce</a></p>— Adam Lerman (@AdamLerman5) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamLerman5/status/1894215433366245457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>“Ugh, it’s workspace 17. Workspace 17 is the bottleneck. The worst performing workspace here,” one of the bosses says, while watching a video of a man making clothing in a factory. “Hey number 17, what’s going on man? You are in red,” he says. “I have been working all day,” the person playing the worker says. “Working all day?” the line boss replies. “You haven’t hit your hourly output even once today. And you have 11.4% efficiency, this is really bad!”&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s just been a rough day,” the “worker” replies. “Rough day?” the boss says, looking at a calendar full of red days. “More like a rough month.”&nbsp;</p><p>Optifye.ai, launched by Duke University computer science students Baid and Mohta, is backed by Y Combinator, <a href="https://archive.is/GtuTi" rel="noreferrer">according to the company’s site</a>. On their <a href="https://archive.is/Qu09c"><u>Y Combinator company profile</u></a>, they write that both of their families run manufacturing plants, where they’ve been exposed to factory working conditions since they were children. “I've been around assembly lines for as long as I can remember,” Baid wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Mohta wrote, “My family also runs several manufacturing plants in various industries, which has given me unrestricted access to assembly lines since I was 15.”&nbsp;</p><p>They hope to sell cameras to factory owners to use on assembly lines, their website says, and “use computer vision to tell supervisors who's working and who's not in real-time.”</p><p>Y Combinator deleted its recent Linkedin and X posts congratulating the company on launching.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXex26pUs8TaRaVO2vdq6klwTPae_pOM-aPnusQ-7taTTHHXcV3knsBxpl1boHfEFumrOfXZigYa0kti6H4K0JPvkpEpC3IOlHXj-SnYvPhf1RQ2lSmW0zOxFIo-rv8snT7FOLJF?key=Yrtm75ZzgcMcjAeui5ZPpzJb" alt="" loading="lazy" width="444" height="553"></figure><p>On their Y Combinator profile, Baid and Mohta outline who gets what out of installing micromanaging AI surveillance on assembly lines. Owners gets “accurate real-time factory, line, and worker productivity metrics,” production heads get “line-wise and worker-wise metrics,” shopfloor supervisors get to “identify who/what is causing inefficiency in the line and fix the problem on the go.” For the workers? They get the tantalizing benefit of being “held accountable for good or bad performance.”&nbsp;</p><p>Worker surveillance is already happening across industries. After the rise of remote work, companies started tracking workers’ productivity based on mouse movements, so <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mouse-mover-jiggler-app-keep-screen-on-active/"><u>workers started using “mouse jigglers”</u></a> so they could walk away from their computers and use the bathroom in peace. In Amazon warehouses, workers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/internal-documents-show-amazons-dystopian-system-for-tracking-workers-every-minute-of-their-shifts/"><u>are tracked and punished</u></a> for not meeting grueling expectations and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64384287"><u>bathroom breaks are timed</u></a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/press/press-releases/amazon-and-walmarts-excessive-warehouse-surveillance-erodes-workers-rights-seriously-harms-worker-health-and-safety/"><u>more injuries and less safe working conditions</u></a>. Optifye.ai’s approach and pitch, however, stands out because of the way its founders seem to embrace cruelty to workers in the name of productivity.</p><p>Optifye.ai and Y Combinator did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

  <div><p>There are two claims I’d like to make:</p>
<ol>
<li>LLMs can be used effectively<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for listwise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank#Approaches">document ranking</a>.</li>
<li>Some complex problems can (surprisingly) be solved by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(complexity)">transforming</a> them into document ranking problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve primarily explored both of these claims in the context of using patch diffing to locate N-day vulnerabilities—a sufficiently domain-specific problem that can be solved using general purpose language models as comparators in document ranking algorithms. I demonstrated at <a href="https://youtu.be/IBuL1zY69tY?si=l27sUOaECO-o9QFW&amp;t=1846">RVAsec ‘24</a> that listwise document ranking can be used to locate the specific function in a patch diff that actually fixes a vulnerability described by a security advisory, and later wrote on the <a href="https://bishopfox.com/blog/raink-llms-document-ranking">Bishop Fox blog</a> in greater defense of listwise ranking by publishing a <a href="https://github.com/noperator/raink">command-line tool implementation (<code>raink</code>)</a> to prove the idea.</p>
<p>The key insight is that instead of treating patch diffing as a complex problem requiring specialized security engineering knowledge, you can reframe it as ranking diffs (documents) by their relevance to a security advisory (query), applying proven document ranking techniques from information retrieval.</p>

Using this technique, I proved at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/aQyBRlu-cA4?si=3V79VdVmPO9D5WVW&amp;t=260">DistrictCon ‘25</a> that GPT-4o mini could locate a fixed vulnerability in a haystack of over 1600 changed (and stripped!) functions in a patch—costing only 5 minutes and 30 cents to do so<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Document ranking can be applied to other offensive security problems, like identifying candidate functions for fuzzing targets (in addition to using them for <a href="https://blog.oss-fuzz.com/posts/introducing-llm-based-harness-synthesis-for-unfuzzed-projects/">auto-generating harnesses</a>), or prioritizing potential injection points in a web application for deeper testing. A few potentially powerful improvements to this technique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze the top N ranked results, and then apply the same ranking algorithm to the analyses.</li>
<li>Make the ranked results verifiable; e.g., for N-day vulnerabilities, use an LLM to generate an automatically testable proof-of-concept exploit<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following Thomas Dullien’s FUZZING ‘24 keynote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd1hItbf52k&amp;t=95s">“Reasons for the Unreasonable Success of Fuzzing”</a>, I’m inclined to give a similar talk—“Reasons for the Unreasonable Success of LLMs.”</p>
