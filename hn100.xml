Next it may slip into your bloodstream and flow into your heart, or past the blood-brain barrier. Most of us inhale some of these tiny particles every day. But inhaling enough can turn the act of breathing into an existential hazard, prompting or worsening asthma, COPD, respiratory infections, and permanent lung damage. In the heart, the specks can trigger heart disease, heart attacks, and most of the cardiovascular disorders you can think of. Air pollution is also associated with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5332196/">depression and </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4373600/">anxiety</a>, and with higher <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30626">rates</a> of suicide. It can trigger strokes and is linked to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2827124">dementia</a> or—even at average levels in this country—<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207871">Parkinson’s disease</a>.</p></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">These particles <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11654-3">can also cross the placenta</a>, where they can reduce an infant’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://environhealthprevmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12199-021-00995-5">lung function</a> before birth. A pre-polluted baby is also more likely to arrive <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/pediatrics/divisions/environmental-pediatrics/research/policy-initiatives/air-pollution-preterm-births">prematurely</a>, and at a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935122014918">lower weight</a>. Exposure to bad air in utero is associated with a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP9509">higher risk of autism</a>, and exposure in childhood has been linked to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP10248">behavioral</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32889949/">cognitive</a> problems, including lower IQ. A person’s lungs can develop until age 25, and as Alison Lee, a pulmonologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, put it to me, “once you’ve lost lung function, you can’t get it back.” Persistent exposure to air pollution can cause permanent harm, creating health problems for children and setting them up to become sicker adults.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It’s hard to picture a person dropping dead from air pollution, yet it happens all the time. In the United States, particulate matter is estimated to kill more than twice as many people as vehicular accidents do—in total, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/identifying-sources-deadly-air-pollution-us">some 100,000</a> to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.mit.edu/2013/study-air-pollution-causes-200000-early-deaths-each-year-in-the-us-0829">200,000</a> people a year, as an underlying factor of chronic disease or by way of heart attacks, asthma attacks, and other sudden events. Even as air quality in America has improved, researchers have found that relatively low concentrations of particulate matter can cause major hazards.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">All of this stems from a toxic and mostly invisible danger, largely the product of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-27/as-wildfires-rage-the-pyrocene-age-is-upon-us?sref=OVk78rkt">burning things</a> for fuel and letting the remnant drift into the air and then into us—which is what happens unless the government regulates that process. The Trump administration, however, has shown little interest in doing so. Through new policies and aggressive cuts, the administration is taking steps that will encourage more pollution while muffling the science that shows the harms. The very air that Americans breathe will likely become less safe.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">So far, the EPA has announced that it will pursue <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history">a suite of rollbacks</a> of environmental rules, among them a Joe Biden–era update to standards <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-announces-path-forward-national-air-quality-standards-particulate-matter">for particulate matter</a> that were meant to be fully in force by 2032 and that the Biden EPA <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-finalizes-stronger-standards-harmful-soot-pollution-significantly-increasing">projected</a> would, in that year alone, prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 cases of asthma, reaping up to $46 billion in health benefits. It also plans to reassess a rule limiting the amount of airborne mercury and arsenic that power plants can release. In a statement <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-announces-path-forward-national-air-quality-standards-particulate-matter">announcing</a> one of these rollbacks, the EPA said that the U.S. has already made major gains in air quality, implying that these are enough. In response to a request for comment, an agency spokesperson told me that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s priority is “clean air, land, and water for EVERY American.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The air in the U.S. certainly is cleaner than it was when industrial air pollution billowed into the skies unmitigated. Over the past 25 years alone, particulate air pollution in the country has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gispub.epa.gov/air/trendsreport/2023/#introduction">dropped</a> by more than 30 percent. Yet at least one in three Americans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/24/1246729103/unhealthy-dangerous-air-hurts-130-million-americans">lives</a> in a place where the air is still a health hazard. The particulate-matter standard that Zeldin intends to roll back is still nearly twice as high as the limit the World Health Organization recommends to protect health.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Rolling back rules will take time, but America’s air quality could worsen in the interim. The EPA told businesses last month that they can simply <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/climate/epa-air-pollution-exemption-mercury-coal-ash.html">email the agency</a> if they want an exemption from certain pollution regulations and that “the president will make a decision.” However they address those pleas, this opens a back door. The recent cuts to EPA personnel almost certainly mean that enforcement will suffer too. Meanwhile, worsening wildfire seasons, fueled by climate warming, are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/02/air-pollution-life-cost-great-recession/677523/">reversing</a> decades of air-quality progress in this country. And ignoring and even stoking climate change, as Donald Trump’s administration is doing, will produce worse wildfire seasons. The country’s slide back toward its more polluted past “will become a steeper trajectory,” Joan Casey, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Washington whose work helped expose the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39585704/">connection</a> between wildfire smoke and dementia risk, told me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The administration’s cuts to scientific research mean, too, that the impact of its deregulation may never be fully understood. In recent months, the government has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-stops-reporting-air-quality-levels/">pulled down</a> some air-quality data and canceled grants; it also plans to dissolve a whole <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/climate/trump-eliminates-epa-science.html">EPA division</a> dedicated to studying how the environment affects public health. These actions create a sort of purposeful naivete: You can’t regulate what you can’t prove is harmful, and you can’t prove harm without research.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">And you certainly can’t solve for what you don’t yet know is a problem. Newer findings about how air pollution may addle a body—by worsening mental health or triggering more cases of neurodegenerative disease, for example—haven’t yet been included in the EPA’s risk-benefit assessments of air-quality regulations, Casey added. “I think often we’re underestimating the true impact,” she said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When I called Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, she had just learned that the Trump administration had canceled her grant to study how impacts of climate change, including air pollution, alter cognitive function in aging people. (Earlier this year, too, she was dismissed from her appointment to the EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, along with the rest of the panel.) Even so, the basics on air pollution have been studied enough that Kioumourtzoglou knows how current rollbacks will affect Americans: There will be “more heart attacks, more respiratory adverse health outcomes for sure,” she told me. “Our cognitive functions are going to be worse—the progression of Alzheimer’s, the progression of Parkinson’s.” Pollution-related depression and anxiety may go up. Even slightly increasing the risk or rate of any of these at the population level can diminish quality of life and, ultimately, productivity, she said. A sicker country is a poorer one.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Compared with smoking, for example, an individual’s risk of inhaling a dangerous amount of air pollution and then having their health affected because of it is relatively small, she told me—but “the problem is that few people smoke, and everybody breathes.” If a portion of the population’s cognitive function is diminished, even a little bit, the overall impact is enormous.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Kioumourtzoglou wonders, too, how much further the Trump administration will push the idea that air pollution should not be a concern to Americans. When the Heritage Foundation published a report in December that made the radical case that no definitive link exists between air pollution and poor public-health outcomes, she disregarded it. But after watching <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2025/trump-executive-orders-project-2025/">other Heritage Foundation goals</a> be enacted, she is concerned that its rationale could be taken seriously by the current administration. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.heritage.org/climate/report/air-quality-and-public-health-there-link">The Heritage report</a> attempts to cast doubt on the validity of decades of science by, in part, arguing that studies linking air pollution to health effects fail to prove causation, because they’re not randomized or controlled. (After this story was published, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, the director of Heritage’s Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment, said that the report was intended to guide federal policies and that it showed that “no causal link between particulates and heart attacks and deaths.”)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This is an attack not just on air-pollution research but on an entire scientific approach. Most public-health research is observational by necessity, because exposing people to air pollution in a lab setting to see how sick they get, say, wouldn’t be ethical. Instead, scientists gather data from already-exposed populations and try to parse out how different variables affected people’s health. Over decades, researchers have developed biostatistical methods to determine causal relationships from large groups of studies.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When EPA scientists and regulators link a pollutant and a health outcome, “they’re not making that assessment on one or two or three studies. It’s decades of scientific publications,” Corwin Zigler, a biostatistician at Brown University who served on an EPA scientific advisory panel on air pollution under the Biden administration, told me. He wasn’t surprised by the logic behind the Heritage Foundation report: The leader of the previous Trump administration’s air-pollution advisory panel had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://revealnews.org/article/trumps-air-pollution-adviser-clean-air-saves-no-lives/">begun to sow doubt</a> about basic air-pollution research. In response, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine undertook a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26612/advancing-the-framework-for-assessing-causality-of-health-and-welfare-effects-to-inform-national-ambient-air-quality-standard-reviews">major review</a> of the way the EPA assesses causal relationships, and though it recommended that the EPA’s process be more transparent, it found its methods scientifically robust. Zigler said he has no doubt that particulate matter is causing harm at current levels in the United States: “That’s the scientific consensus. That takes very seriously all of the limitations of any given scientific study.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Studies about how entire populations are harmed by air pollution are framed in probabilities and percentages, but they represent a multitude of individuals for whom daily living has been made tangibly worse. For Lee, the Mount Sinai pulmonologist, work became personal a few years ago, when her son, now 5, began having asthma attacks that would send him to the emergency room. Asthma is a common-enough ailment that an attack might seem like a routine and manageable health issue. But anyone who’s had a severe one will tell you differently. Over years of reporting on air pollution, I’ve had asthma attacks described to me as feeling like someone is stepping with their full weight on your ribcage, or as though you are suddenly a fish out of water, suffocating on land. It’s a traumatic event. Lee, knowing what she does about air pollution, decided to move her family from New York City to the suburbs a year and a half ago; they haven’t been to the emergency room since.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Clearly, we know that where you live determines your health,” Lee told me, but few people can make a choice like she did, to upend their life to breathe cleaner air. The Trump administration is also cutting the programs intended to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/03/trump-environmental-justice/681958/">address exactly these geographic disparities, while working to make the air worse for everyone. </a>EPA Administrator Zeldin has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-announces-path-forward-national-air-quality-standards-particulate-matter">said</a> these rollbacks are part of the administration’s plan to “unleash the Golden Age of American prosperity.” But prosperity does not mean choking to death in one’s own home or depriving a child of cognitive capacity. Whatever wealth is promised here is narrowly disbursed at others’ expense.</p></section><div data-event-module="footer"><p><h3>About the Author</h3></p><div><address id="article-writer-0" data-event-element="author" data-event-position="1"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zoe-schlanger/" data-event-element="image"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/u8S5JVOtiftKFSYJUPgPfsZK710=/468x9:2384x1925/120x120/media/img/authors/2023/10/Sten_SSENSE_ZoeSchlanger_18_hi_res_version/original.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zoe-schlanger/" data-label="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zoe-schlanger/" data-action="click author - name">Zoë Schlanger</a> is a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>.

</blockquote>
<p>
  About three years ago, I set up a tiny <code>netcat</code> loop on
  one of my Debian servers to accept arbitrary connections from the
  Hacker News (HN) community.  The loop ran for 24 hours and did
  exactly three things whenever a client connected:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Send a simple <code>ok</code> message to the client.
  </li>
  <li>
    Close the connection immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make my terminal beep four times.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  That's it!  It was a playful experiment in response to a thread
  about quirky, do-it-yourself alerting systems for friends and
  family.  See
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30146019#30146451">this
  HN thread</a> for the original discussion.  Here is the exact
  command I ran on my server:
</p>
<pre><code>while true; do (echo ok | nc -q 1 -vlp 8000 2&gt;&amp;1; echo; date -u) | tee -a beeper.log; for i in 1 2 3 4; do printf '\a'; sleep 1; done &amp; done</code></pre>
<p>
  The <code>nc</code> command closes the connection immediately after
  sending the <code>ok</code> message and runs an
  inner <code>for</code> loop in a background shell that
  asynchronously prints the bell character to the terminal four times.
  Meanwhile, the outer <code>while</code> command loops back quickly
  to run a new <code>nc</code> process, thus making this one-liner
  script instantly ready to accept the next incoming connection.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after I shared this, members of the HN community began
  connecting to the demo running on <code>susam.net:8000</code>.
  Anyone on the Internet could use any client of their choice to
  connect.  Here's how I explained it in the HN thread:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Now anytime someone connects to port 8000 of my system
    by <em>any</em> means, I will hear 4 beeps!  The other party can
    use <em>whatever client</em> they have to connect to port 8000 of

  In the next 24 hours, I received over 4761 connections, each one
  triggering four beeps.  That's a total of 19044 terminal beeps
  echoing throughout the day!

  Now, 4761 isn't a huge number in the grand scheme of things, but it
  was still pretty cool to see people notice an obscure comment buried
  in a regular HN thread, act on it, and make my terminal beep
  thousands of time.

  At the end of the day, this was a fun experiment.  Pointless, but
  fun!  Computing isn't always about solving problems.  Sometimes,
  it's also about exploring quirky ideas.  The joy is in the
  exploration, and having others join in made it even more enjoyable.
  Activities like this keep computing fun for me!

The effects for this movie were originally being done at Richard Edlund's Boss films and nearly five months of miniature submarine construction was undertaken under the supervision of Greg Jein. The original methodology was to shoot all the models mounted on model movers with motion control and matte them into backgrounds shot separately. At some point during the testing phase, there was a falling out between the production and the visual effects facility over the look of the test shots and the entire project and the existing models were moved to ILM leaving them around three months to complete the 50 or so effects shots required to complete the movie.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr0fHNWqXQp5OhrONYtpTuF7WVoKGdGxA9Nvs03MDH8kxd5CdFw0fW-V6MPCmA1IN2vtIlZABS-8dhQRQjjrEsKr4v_LsE9PYoat4WBqzW-MeUgjMMHpQ-aBl-wPTgX0PN3WKA3j1cIyw/s1600/kg_red-october_002.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="1003" data-original-width="1455" height="440" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr0fHNWqXQp5OhrONYtpTuF7WVoKGdGxA9Nvs03MDH8kxd5CdFw0fW-V6MPCmA1IN2vtIlZABS-8dhQRQjjrEsKr4v_LsE9PYoat4WBqzW-MeUgjMMHpQ-aBl-wPTgX0PN3WKA3j1cIyw/s640/kg_red-october_002.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

At ILM, due to the short deadline, it was decided to similarly shoot the models using motion control but for the most part in a smoke environment thus capturing the background at the same time. This was done to limit the amount of optical compositing that would otherwise be needed.</p><p>

The miniature submarine line up consisted of a 21 ft (6.4 m) and a 4 ft (1.2m) Red October model, a 9ft (2.7m) Kronolov sub, two 10ft (3m) dallas subs, a 2ft (0.6m) rescue submersible and a 6 ft (1.8m) torpedo.&nbsp; ILM then added an inbetween sized 11ft (3.3m) Red October, a bottom section of a 21ft Red October for some new shots that had been added and a 2ft (0,6m) torpedo.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh67vNFy8oxlGqKqEcR-dkGE5Ox8hMJ-YQhtpJXVjrTnquMhmOtHPAFcl8eQqwwfA8Z35eDQSsi104hWWsaaF3zVpJ1PIhRWtA1Xtz8xQUUmO60TWw5kUyfgVvSOpOEnOaXJkqzM7RDSIQ/s1600/Hunt_002.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="390" data-original-width="782" height="319" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh67vNFy8oxlGqKqEcR-dkGE5Ox8hMJ-YQhtpJXVjrTnquMhmOtHPAFcl8eQqwwfA8Z35eDQSsi104hWWsaaF3zVpJ1PIhRWtA1Xtz8xQUUmO60TWw5kUyfgVvSOpOEnOaXJkqzM7RDSIQ/s640/Hunt_002.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

Most of the time the larger red October model was mounted on a rigid pylon which allowed for motorised pitch and yaw action and was framed out of shot. The other models in shot were generally hung from a wire rig, developed by Tad Krzanowski originally for Batteries not included and also used for some of the submersible&nbsp; shots in the Abyss. This consisted of a 12 wires running down to one of 4 points on the model, 3 wires to each of the 4 mount points. The wires were controlled by something like the swash plate of a helicopter and allowed for yaw and pitch motion of the model. The 3 wires to each point plus gravity, effectively created a cross braced support and a relatively rigid structure. The models were hung from this rig which was mounted on a camera crane arm adapted for motion control that ran on a track that was atop a 25 foot (7.6m) long scaffold structure 12 ft high (3.6m). For a few shots the 250 pound (113kg) Red October model was also hung from this rig. The other relatively light weight models averaged 40 -45 pounds (18-20kg).</p><p>

A smaller 16ft long motion control track and crane was mounted on a mobile scaffold that could be re-positioned relatively easily. This was mostly used when a second submarine needed to be seen maneuvering in the background.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhc-XV08jteOqdhP2uPtpOAdl0uSBhtPIdpFH41xYUzVcHNbPkJ-1rl24XoVkud9p4zdBZZl2urhvidr29UdCxvr5e_jKcaRb_OyCXc3C2dPTte6CP09FUyYLt2Js6TdLzvrVrbakw2FAk/s1600/Hunt_003.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="390" data-original-width="768" height="325" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhc-XV08jteOqdhP2uPtpOAdl0uSBhtPIdpFH41xYUzVcHNbPkJ-1rl24XoVkud9p4zdBZZl2urhvidr29UdCxvr5e_jKcaRb_OyCXc3C2dPTte6CP09FUyYLt2Js6TdLzvrVrbakw2FAk/s640/Hunt_003.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

One of the tricks to getting the smoke to look like it was deep underwater was to light a curtain of smoke in the background. These lights were on dimmers and as the subs moved through the space the background lights would be slowly faded up and then down as they entered and left the frame. Without this the background density would be too bright. The lighting also had to be very soft and indirect as obvious delineated shafts of light would not be correct for the deep ocean. Each shot was a very difficult and time consuming choreography of moving models, camera and dimming lights. The camera framing had to ensure that all the lights and support rigs were out of frame or at least hidden in the smoky gloom. This meant that the output was around 1 shot per day.</p><p>

In order to achieve the really close passes on the model mirrors were used in a periscope like arrangement, where the bulky Vistavision camera body would have grazed the hull. Various grades of Super frost filters were used on the lenses to enhance the murky underwater effect.</p><p>

The smoke was generated using a cracker system which is a method of atomising mineral oil using compressed air. A sensor would turn on and off the smoke automatically to maintain the right density.</p><p>

About 40 miniature rock spires were built to represent an underwater trench. These ranged from 3 ft (1m) to 22 ft (6.7m) high and could be arranged in various formations to suit each shot in the sequence.</p><p>

The miniature work in the film and the simulation of the underwater environment is pretty convincing however in a few shots, the optical compositing, particularly the shots concerned with the counter measures and the torpedo trail, is less successful.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7FxJEdIHtphtTN4pS2raj-X60W2A9txXLVaUP_c8IO6-Fhs4e3le67gFIEMnfRxqD2V6a3pYN4BWP1bNxFcrUtqlaJnstIpm_riD9TlSdUiDkIJsHrHXOfyV33Svv-hvZvsro5KN9-KM/s1600/DSRV_2.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7FxJEdIHtphtTN4pS2raj-X60W2A9txXLVaUP_c8IO6-Fhs4e3le67gFIEMnfRxqD2V6a3pYN4BWP1bNxFcrUtqlaJnstIpm_riD9TlSdUiDkIJsHrHXOfyV33Svv-hvZvsro5KN9-KM/s1600/DSRV_2.jpg"></a></p>

One other miniature of note is the Russian Bear bomber aircraft, seen in one really quick shot flying over the ocean. It looks to me as if it is supported at its tail which is just out of shot, and filmed against a real sky and ocean, possibly from the deck of a boat or a truck driving along a coast road.

Enjoy!</p><p><a href="https://www.lulu.com/search/?adult_audience_rating=00&amp;contributor=Jon+Yoder">Learning to Program with Haiku at Lulu.com</a></p><h2>Lesson 1</h2><p>Have you ever wanted to learn to program for Haiku (or something else) but
never had the money or the chance? Has something else gotten in the way?
This is quite an opportunity for someone who wants to learn to code. To
kick things off, here's the first one.</p><h2>Lesson 2</h2><h2>Lesson 3</h2><p>In this lesson, we examine the different types of data we can use, a more
in-depth look at how to print to the screen, and more!</p><h2>Lesson 4: If, For, And, Not, Or</h2><p>Decision-making and repeating instructions are on the agenda for this one,
expanding the repetoire of basic skills for writing code.</p><h2>Lesson 5: Arrays, Strings, and Pointers</h2><p>This lesson marks the end of the first unit and is somewhere around
halfway from complete neophyte to writing -- and understanding -- our
first program for Haiku which uses windows and buttons.</p><h2>Unit Review: 1 - 5</h2><h2>Lesson 6: More Loops and Conditions</h2><p>Here marks the beginning of the second unit in my series, "Learning to
Program With Haiku." Lesson #6 expands on our knowledge of loops and
decision-making constructs.</p><h2>Lesson 7: Losing My Memory</h2><p>This one covers two major topics: memory management and binary math,
nothing terribly exciting, but really useful and necessary nonetheless</p><h2>Lesson 8</h2><h2>Lesson 9</h2><h2>Unit Review: 6 - 9</h2><h2>Lesson 10: More Pointers and the Command Line</h2><p>Now we're starting to tie up loose ends before moving on to just C++. In
this lesson, we learn more about pointers and kinda-sorta pointers called
references, and we examine the basics of getting information from the
command line.</p><h2>Lesson 11: More Data Structures and Types</h2><p>This time around, we will be examining some important kinds of data
structures and ways to create custom data types, a critical stepping
stone in getting to understanding the Haiku API. This is the last C / C++
lesson -- the rest will be C++ only. A couple more lessons and we'll
finally be ready to write GUI programs for Haiku!</p><h2>Lesson 12: OOPs I Did It Again!</h2><p>This lesson introduces us to the wonderful world of C++ and Object
Oriented Programming. It's not terribly code-heavy, so this might be a good
time to look over past lessons to make sure you understand concepts pretty
well -- it only gets bigger from here. :-)</p><h2>Lesson 13: Programming With Class(es)</h2><p>Today we'll be diving headlong into the murky depths of C++ programming:
classes and inheritance -- struct's with fancy tricks aplenty. It's also
our last lesson before writing our first windowed Haiku program, so get
ready and study well. Enjoy!</p><h2>Unit Review: 10 - 13</h2><h2>Lesson 14: Our First GUI Program</h2><p>It's about time: our first program which does more than print stuff to the
Terminal! Now the real fun begins!</p><h2>Lesson 15: The Haiku API at 10,000 Feet</h2><p>Lesson 15 delves further into what writing basic applications are all
about, looking at the API and its organization and focusing on an
essential: messaging. Also included in this lesson are the finished
sources for those who don't want to mess around with typing the project
out.</p><h2>Lesson 16: Locked and Overloaded</h2><p>This lesson takes a break from hacking the Haiku API to learn a few C++
language concepts needed to continue progress as an aspiring developer.
Function overloading and operator overloading are examined in detail.</p><h2>Lesson 17: What's on the Menu</h2><p>We are back to learning about hacking on the Haiku GUI after taking a short
C++ language break. Today's topic? Menus. Also in this lesson is some
expansion of what we know about messaging and BViews.</p><h2>Lesson 18: Working With Lists</h2><p>We're starting to get closer to the end of this Learning to Program series.
After toying with menus and interface colors in the last lesson, we apply
some of the concepts used with menus to get the hang of using list boxes
and discover along the way a few bizarre sports that really exist. Games
people play. Sheesh.</p><h2>Lesson 19: Resources and Pictures</h2><p>Ten years ago when I first started to learn to write code using BeOS, I had
a lot of questions that I couldn't any documentation to give me the
answers. Luckily, there was the Be Code Talk mailing list and kindhearted
members of the community, like David Sowsy (Animaxo, Vesa Accepted).
Resources are one of those things that eluded me. Eventually I figured them
out, but Lesson 19 lays some of it out in plain conversation.</p><h2>Lesson 20: All About Storage</h2><p>Moving on from exploring the Interface Kit, we turn our attention to the
Storage Kit in this lesson. We take a look at the kit from a broad
perspective and also begin using some of its many of the classes. We take
a break from writing GUI applications and, instead, write a console
directory-listing program using C++.</p><h2>Lesson 21: Reading and Writing Files</h2><p>This lesson continues with delving into the Storage Kit,
reading and writing files. We also start writing code for
the final project of the Learning to Program With Haiku
series which will be developed over the course of several lessons.</p><h2>Lesson 22: Designing a GUI</h2><p>Usability is one of my pet topics. Although less so now that in years past, it is all-too-often ignored or not given enough priority. This lesson scratches the surface from a developer's point of view. I'm no usability expert, but I do know a thing or two. This lesson is a must-read for any budding developer, and by the end of it, we will have a good real-world program to show off which is just shy of being ready for a release.</p><h2>Lesson 23: Polish and Packaging Our Project</h2><p>This lesson finishes up the project that the last two have been about:
HaikuFortune, a program which randomly chooses and displays a fortune in a
window. It's not a very complicated one, but it exemplifies a reasonably
well-coded real-world project. Although it was code complete as of the end
of Lesson 22, it was not finished, missing icons and other resources. This
concludes the project with adding resources, a basic discussion on source
code licensing, and packaging a program for Haiku.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This also concludes the Learning to Program With Haiku lesson series. It's
been a good run. Rest assured, though, that this is not the last lesson on
Haiku programming that I will write. This series has been intended to turn
a motivated power user into a developer using Haiku. It's been a lot of fun
and many people have encouraged me with their kind words regarding it.</p><p>Later this summer I will start another yet-to-b e-named series which will
continue where Learning to Program With Haiku is leaving off and introduce
novice and intermediate developers to real coding specifically for Haiku and
its nuances, such as multithreaded programming, add-on coding, queries and
attributes, Tracker and more.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
              

              
              <article>
                  <p><em>Little elephant company</em> — <em>7 people working out of a random house</em> — <em>2013</em></p>
<p>I know we haven’t paid you for 30 days, but would you be willing to float another month?</p>
<p>No, sorry, I’m out.</p>
<p>Ok, sad to see you are not loyal to the company.</p>
<p>No pay, no work</p>
<p>It was the end of 2013; I’d gone two paychecks without pay. The client still hadn’t paid, I wasn’t about to start working for free.</p>
<p>I resigned. I told my boss at the time: <em>“no pay, no work”</em>.</p>
<p>Walking away wasn’t easy. They gave me my first shot as a professional coder. I was genuinely sad to leave the office, going with my coworkers to the nearby Subway restaurant, and especially the cat that roamed our office/house workspace.</p>
<p>Before the payment drama, this had been an objectively awesome job for a 17 year-old. This was a company that did AR, and other super cool projects for the time. When I started, this company focused in a project for one of Mexico’s efforts for renewable energy. A page for companies to apply for their energy savings grants for commercial builders.</p>
<p>If companies met the requisites, they would be awarded money which had to be closely tracked with reciepts/invoices and other kinds of controls. This meant we had to do a lot of stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex business rules that changed frequently</li>
<li>Multi-stage application processes with interdependent fields</li>
<li>Calculation-heavy rebate formulas</li>
<li>Document verification workflows</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="domain-specific-languages-and-form-wizardry">Domain-Specific Languages and Form Wizardry</h2>
<p>Due to the complicated nature of these web controls, my manager developed a domain-specific language (DSL) for PHP. We’d encode business rules into this DSL, and the framework would automatically generate the appropriate web form fields. It was quite impressive to see a real-world example of meta-programming that I’d only read about in forums.</p>
<p>I’d then modify the forms with JavaScript to make it nicer to fill (add calendars, autohide if there are dependencies/constraints etc. some jQuery magic). I got hired to implement the magic toggles with jQuery/JavaScript, but you have to understand this is 2013 JavaScript. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq4FpMe6cRs">ECMAScript wasn’t even a thing back then, types, Typescript wasn’t yet invented. Zero. Zilch.</a> At that time we used Firefox and Firebug to test our code. &nbsp;I’d load the things with JavaScript/jQuery, and test them in an early incantation of the chrome debugging tools called Firebug. I’d augment the UI of the fields that were created with our business logic with some nice JavaScript on top.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$('#project_type').on('change', function() {
&nbsp; &nbsp; var selectedType = $(this).val();

&nbsp; &nbsp; if (selectedType === 'renewable') {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#solar_panels_section').show();
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#efficiency_section').hide();
&nbsp; &nbsp; } else if (selectedType === 'efficiency') {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#solar_panels_section').hide();
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#efficiency_section').show();
&nbsp; &nbsp; } else {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#solar_panels_section').hide();
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#efficiency_section').hide();
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
</code></pre><p><em>Welcome to FUN kids. React or Angular didn’t exist.</em></p>
<p>We also did nice calculators/calculations for the rebates people would get in JavaScript (oh god, the horror). At that time, JQuery was the boom, it was amazing for not having to manage the DOM directly. I still remember the <code>$.on( "click")</code> monster functions I’d used to do. They still haunt me till this day.</p>
<p><img src="https://danielsada.tech/images/blog/career/firebug.png" alt="">
<em>Firebug: The developer’s best friend in 2013. CSS debugging had never been so… adequate.</em></p>
<p>Maybe advanced for its time, but for a kid that only had pushed through FTP his websites using version control with SVN was state of the art. The wonky part is that we coordinated which files people had checked out by literally yelling across the office: “Hey, I’m going to check out the rebate calculator, please don’t touch it, k thanks bye!”</p>
<p><em>No pull requests. No code reviews. No branches. Just a shared understanding that if someone yelled about a file, it was temporarily “theirs.” It wasn’t until years later that I understood how important proper version control workflows were for project success.</em></p>
<h2 id="mobile-first-the-promise-that-never-came-until-react-native">Mobile First? The promise that never came until React Native.</h2>
<p>This also got me to write my first android app in PhoneGap. Performance was terrible, and UI was clunky. Sadly, this would not be the last time I would face PhoneGap. There was so much attractiveness in writing your app once in a web server and then automatically reflect everything in an app. For people that don’t know PhoneGap ~was~ is a technology that allows creating a web server and setting up a cross platform app. It’s an early incantation of react native but really bad. There was so much attractiveness in the write-once-run-everywhere promise, but the reality was significantly more painful.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The end?</h2>
<p>Despite the technical challenges and the somewhat chaotic development environment, I grew a lot. The small team meant I got exposure to the entire stack: backend PHP, frontend JavaScript, mobile development, and even some system administration.</p>
<p>But after several months, the cracks started to show. Our main client delayed payments, and the company started running out of cash. First, it was “payment might be a few days late.” Then, “We’ll pay you next week for sure.” Finally, “I know we haven’t paid you for 30 days, but would you be willing to float another month?”</p>
<p>That’s when I learned one of the most important lessons of my career: <strong>No pay, no work.</strong></p>
<p>The guilt trip about “loyalty” didn’t work on me, even at 17. I understood that employment is a two-way-deal. I provide value through my skills and time, and the company provides value through compensation. When one side stops fulfilling their end, the deal ends.</p>
<p>As I packed up my things and said goodbye to the office cat, I wasn’t bitter. I was grateful for the experience and the lessons learned. And for getting the chance to work for an actual development shop at 17.</p>
<p>Thank you, little elephant company.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a “No pay, no work moment?” Comment below or in HN.</p>

<p><strong>Pathways on Cloud:</strong><span> Pathways, developed by Google DeepMind, is the distributed runtime that powers Google’s internal large-scale training and inference infrastructure, now available for the first time on Google Cloud. For inference, it includes features like</span><strong> </strong><span>disaggregated serving, which allows dynamic scaling of the prefill and decode stages of inference workloads on separate compute units, each independently scaling to deliver ultra-low latency and high throughput. It is available to customers through </span><a href="https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/JetStream" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>JetStream</span></a><span>, our high-throughput and low-latency inference library. Pathways also enables elastic training, allowing your training workloads to automatically scale down on failure and scale up on recovery while providing continuity.

<h3><strong>Train models with high performance and reliability</strong></h3>
<p><span>Training workloads are highly synchronized jobs that run across thousands of nodes. A single degraded node has the potential to disrupt an entire job, resulting in longer time-to-market and higher costs. To provision a cluster quickly you need VMs tuned for specific model architectures located in close proximity. You also need the ability to predict and troubleshoot node failures quickly and ensure workload continuity in the event of a failure.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cluster Director for GKE and Cluster Director for Slurm. </strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/hypercompute-cluster"><span>Cluster Director</span></a><span> (formerly Hypercompute Cluster)</span><strong> </strong><span>lets you deploy and manage a group of accelerators as a single unit with physically colocated VMs, targeted workload placement, advanced cluster maintenance controls, and topology-aware scheduling. Today we are announcing new updates for Cluster Director, coming later this year:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cluster Director for Slurm, </strong><span>a fully-managed Slurm offering with simplified UI and APIs to provision and operate Slurm clusters, including blueprints for common workloads with pre-configured software to make deployments reliable and repeatable.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>360</strong><strong><span>°</span></strong><strong> observability features </strong><span>including dashboards for visibility over cluster utilization, health, and performance, plus advanced features like AI Health Predictor and Straggler Detection to proactively detect and remediate failures, down to individual nodes.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Job continuity capabilities </strong><span>like</span><strong> </strong><span>end-to-end automated health checks that continuously monitor the fleet and preemptively replace unhealthy nodes. The result is uninterrupted training even in degraded clusters, with multi-tier checkpointing for faster save and retrieval.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Cluster Director for GKE will natively support new Cluster Director features as they become available.</span><span> Cluster Director for Slurm will be available in the coming months, including support for both GPUs and TPUs. </span><a href="https://forms.gle/RESDPyrFmRajQQym7" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Register</span></a><span> for early access</span><span>.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Run inference workloads efficiently at any scale</strong></h3>
<p><span>AI inference has evolved rapidly over the last year. Longer and highly variable context windows are resulting in more sophisticated interactions; reasoning and multi-step inferencing is shifting the incremental demand for compute — and therefore cost — from training to inference time (test-time scaling). To enable useful AI applications for end-users, you need software that can efficiently serve today’s and tomorrow’s interactions.</span></p>
<p><strong>Announcing AI inference capabilities in GKE: </strong><span>Inference Gateway and Inference Quickstart.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GKE Inference Gateway </strong><span>offers intelligent scaling and load-balancing capabilities,</span><strong> </strong><span>helping you handle request scheduling and routing with gen AI model-aware scaling and load-balancing techniques. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>With </span><strong>GKE Inference Quickstart</strong><span>, you can choose an AI model and your desired performance, and GKE will configure the right infrastructure, accelerators, and Kubernetes resources to match.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Both features are available in preview today, together reducing serving costs by over 30%, tail latency by 60%, and increasing throughput by up to 40% compared to other managed and open-source Kubernetes offerings.</span></p>
<p><strong>vLLM support for TPUs: </strong><a href="https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>vLLM</span></a><span> is well known for being a fast and efficient library for inference. Starting today, you can easily run inference on TPUs with vLLM and get their price-performance benefits without changing your software stack, with only a few configuration changes. vLLM is supported in Compute Engine, GKE, Vertex AI, and Dataflow. And with GKE </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/about-custom-compute-classes"><span>custom compute classes</span></a><span>, you can use TPUs and GPUs in tandem within the same vLLM deployment. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Making consumption even more flexible</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/provisioningrequest"><strong>Dynamic Workload Scheduler</strong></a><span> (DWS) is a resource management and job scheduling platform that helps you get easy and affordable access to accelerators. Today we’re announcing expanded accelerator support in DWS, including for TPU v5e, Trillium, A3 Ultra (NVIDIA H200), and A4 (NVIDIA B200) VMs in preview via Flex Start mode, with Calendar mode support for TPUs coming later this month. Additionally, Flex Start mode now supports a new provisioning method in which resources can be provisioned immediately and scaled dynamically, making it suitable for long-running inference workloads and a wider range of training workloads. This is in addition to the queued provisioning method of Flex Start mode that requires all nodes to be provisioned simultaneously.</span></p>

                <p>
Someone online was solving Advent of Code problems, and had a question about
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3">last years’ day 3</a>. They had a working solution using regular expressions
(regexes) on <code>String</code> values, but they wanted to use <code>ByteString</code> values instead
for performance reasons. They were surprised, however, that there seems to be a
lack of community cohesion around regex libraries in Haskell.
</p>

<p>
There’s a reason for that. We generally don’t use regexes in Haskell. We use
parser combinators instead, because they are almost always better. In other
languages, it would be considered overkill to write a full parser when a simple
regex can do the same thing. In Haskell, writing a parser is no big deal. We
just do it and move on with our lives.
</p>
<section id="outline-container-the-regex-solution">
<h2 id="the-regex-solution">The regex solution</h2>
<div id="text-org923fa84">
<p>
The first part of the Advent of Code problem is well suited for a regex-based
solution. Here’s what such a solution might look like in Haskell. It uses the
<i>pcre-heavy</i> Haskell library which in turn calls out to the system-wide <abbr>pcre</abbr>
C library for actually compiling and running the regex.
</p>

<p><label>In[1]:</label></p><div>
<pre><span>{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}</span>

<span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>

<span>import</span>           <span>Data.ByteString</span>       (<span>ByteString</span>)
<span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> <span>Data.ByteString.Char8</span> <span>as</span> <span>Char8</span>
<span>import</span>           <span>Data.Monoid</span>           (<span>Sum</span> (<span>..</span>))
<span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> <span>Text.Regex.PCRE.Heavy</span> <span>as</span> <span>Re</span>
<span>import</span>           <span>Text.Regex.PCRE.Heavy</span> (re)

<span>test_input</span> <span>=</span> Char8.pack <span>"xmul(2,4)%&amp;mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))"</span>

<span>regex_matches</span> <span>::</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>regex_matches</span> input <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span>
    <span>-- </span><span>Get a list of regex matches with numbers extracted.</span>
    <span>-- </span><span>The 're' quasi-quoter compiles the regex at compile</span>
    <span>-- </span><span>time, avoiding the runtime cost of that.</span>
    hits <span>=</span> Re.scan [re<span>|mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)|</span>] input
    <span>-- </span><span>Take one hit and compute its product, converting the</span>
    <span>-- </span><span>stringified numbers into actual numbers, then wrapping</span>
    <span>-- </span><span>it up as a term in a sum.</span>
    compute (<span>_</span>, [a, b]) <span>=</span>
      <span>Sum</span> (read (Char8.unpack a) <span>*</span> read (Char8.unpack b))
  <span>in</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  print (regex_matches test_input)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This does the job and returns the expected sum of 161. If we run this on just
under a megabyte of input data, it takes 19 seconds on my machine, spending
almost all of that time inside the <abbr>pcre</abbr> library.<label for="fn.1">1</label><span><sup>1</sup> Though this is a little
strange, because if I do the same thing in Perl, it takes 0.02 seconds. I wish I
had time to investigate what goes wrong.</span>
</p>

<p>
But the main thing I dislike about this is that there’s a very strong implicit
contract between the regex and the <code>compute</code> function. The <code>compute</code> function
assumes that there were exactly two capturing groups and that they are strings
that can safely be converted to integers. This is true, but there’s nothing in
the code making that guarantee. If those assumptions become violated a year from
now, that would not be a compiler error but an exception that interrupts the
production service at 3 <abbr>am</abbr> the day before an important customer meeting.

</div>
</section>
<section id="outline-container-the-parser-solution">
<h2 id="the-parser-solution">The parser solution</h2>
<div id="text-orgbc5cd54">
<p>
For the sort of problem we are facing here, the parser-based solution does look
more complicated at first glance. Part of the reason is that the regex library
comes with a method that gets all matches, regardless of their position in the
input. Parser combinators are meant to be written to consume all of the input,
so we have to manually write the parser code that iterates the input and finds
the next match.
</p>

<p>
This solution uses the <i>attoparsec</i> library, which is made to work with
<code>ByteString</code> values specifically, since the person who asked the question seemed
to care about performance.

<p>
This is written in what one might call <i>direct, monadic</i> style, doing just what
was requested in the first part of the Advent of Code puzzle, using <code>do</code>
notation for sequencing. We could rewrite it to be neater, but we will resist
refactoring for now; we never know what twist in the requirements will be
introduced in the second part of an Advent of Code puzzle. (The curious can
check the refactoring out in the appendix.)
</p>

<p>
This did involve more up-front writing, but there are some benefits. Granted, we
use <code>Either.fromRight</code> to throw away all the useful error reporting we could get
from <i>attoparsec</i>, but if we didn’t do that we would get more useful error
messages when things went wrong. We also didn’t have to manually convert strings
to integers, or blindly hope that the right number of integers were parsed. The
compiler checks all those assumptions for us.
</p>



<p>
When we run this on the same megabyte of input, it takes 0.07 seconds. This is
within a magnitude of the Perl regex, but we get all the benefits of a more
expressive language too. As we will see shortly, another big benefit of parsers
is that they are more flexible to adapt to future requirements.

<div id="text-org5596867">
<p>
The next part of the Advent of Code puzzle involves interpreting instructions
called <code>do()</code> and <code>don't()</code> which turn on and off the contributions of <code>mul</code>
instructions to the sum. As we parse, we now need to keep track of one bit of
state. This is a nightmare for regexes to deal with, because they recognise
regular languages, and regular languages are literally stateless
languages.<label for="fn.2">2</label><span><sup>2</sup> There’s more nuance, of course, but as a first approximation.
Technically regular languages are those that can be recognised by a finite state
automaton, and if there are a finite number of states (as there are in this
case) then all of them can be encoded in an <abbr>fsa</abbr> but let’s not get pedantic
here.</span>

But with the parser-based solution, we can lift it into a state transformer, and
we get a stateful parser.<label for="fn.3">3</label><span><sup>3</sup> Note that in a serious application, we might have
lexing and parsing as separate steps, but parser combinators give us the freedom

<p>
One has to be a little careful when making specifically <i>attoparsec</i> parsers
stateful, because attoparsec is very happy to backtrack in the input on failure,
but it will not undo the state changes that were caused by the initial parsing
attempt. Thus, when making attoparsec parsers stateful, we have to write them
such that they never backtrack past a state change.<label for="fn.4">4</label><span><sup>4</sup> One could imagine an
attoparsec primitive called something like <code>cut</code> (inspired by Prolog) which
stops backtracking past a certain point. This could be used in combination with
state changes to make sure the parser never backtracks past that change. Such a
primitive would be fairly easy to write but it needs to be supplied by the
library – it cannot be written by library users.</span> On the positive side, avoiding
long sequences of backtracking is also good for memory usage and performance, so
we should do that anyway.
</p>

<p>
The alert reader might notice that we used the parser result to store the value
of the sum, but stored the contribution bit in the state. We could have done it any
other way. We could store both sum and bit in state, or both in the result, or
the other way around with the sum in the state and the bit in the result. This
was just the quickest way I could think of to get it up and running. Haskell
makes it cheap and safe to refactor later.
</p>

<p>
The above runs in 0.12 seconds on about a megabyte of input. I won’t even try to
write a regex-based solution for the second part, but I’m fairly confident it
would be slower, less flexible, and more difficult to maintain.

</div>

<p>
This takes three parsers for the opening sequence, separator, and closing
sequence, and then a parser for the actual values, and constructs a parser that
returns a pair of values. We can use this to parse the <code>mul</code> instruction, but
also any other instruction based on a pair of values.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, we were missing a function that returns all matches for a parser,
regardless of where in the input they were located. The regex library had that
function, but it does not come out of the box with <i>attoparsec</i>. We can make that.
</p>

<p><label>In[5]:</label></p><div>
<pre><span>scan_all</span> <span>::</span> <span>Parser</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Parser</span> [a]
<span>scan_all</span> p <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> next <span>=</span> p <span>&lt;|&gt;</span> Parser.anyChar <span>*&gt;</span> next
  <span>in</span> Parser.many1 next
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With these parts of the code broken out into their own functions, the final
parser can be written in a more <i>applicative</i> style as
</p>

<p><label>In[6]:</label></p><div>
<pre><span>parser_matches</span> <span>::</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>parser_matches</span> input <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span>
    mul <span>=</span> uncurry (<span>*</span>) <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> pair
      (Parser.string (Char8.pack <span>"mul("</span>))
      (Parser.char <span>','</span>)
      (Parser.char <span>')'</span>)
      Parser.decimal

    result <span>=</span> sum <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> scan_all mul
  <span>in</span>
    Either.fromRight (error <span>"Failed to parse input."</span>)
      (Parser.parseOnly result input)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This reads quite nicely: the result parser is the sum of all <code>mul</code> instructions,
which are specified as the product of a pair of values with specific delimiters.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
           
            <p>It's a pedagogical pet peeve of mine when technical concepts are simply listed in their fully developed state, with little in the way of motivation, derivation, or historical context. This, I think, is like publishing a cookbook filled with beautiful pictures of cakes, but no recipes.</p><p>My aim with the "Baking &lt;x&gt; from scratch" series is to describe not only <em>what</em>, but <em>how</em> and <em>why</em>, with the hope that this will lead to a richer and more durable understanding.</p><hr><h3 id="the-famous-y-combinator">The Famous Y combinator</h3><p>This post is about the Y combinator. Not Y Combinator the accelerator, but the mathematical construct that it's named after - <em>the</em> Y combinator.</p><p>The Y combinator looks like this:</p><p>$$ Y = \lambda f. \enspace (\lambda x. \enspace f(x \enspace x)) \enspace (\lambda x. \enspace f(x \enspace x)) $$</p><p>Confronted with this definition, you might ask yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why does it look like that?</li>
<li>What is it used for?</li>
<li>Why do people still talk about it?</li>
<li>(What the heck is a combinator?)</li>
</ol>
<p>The one-line answer to all of these is: "the Y combinator implements recursion in functional languages that don't allow for explicit self-reference", but it's worth going a little deeper than that. In my opinion, the easiest way to understand what the Y combinator <em>is</em>, at a fundamental level, is to focus on how it produces fixed points. The easiest way to understand why it's <em>important</em> is to focus on how it can be used to implement recursion. In Part 1 we'll do the former (answering 1. and half of 2. in the process) and in Part 2 we'll do the latter (answering 3. and the other half of 2.)</p>
<p>(We'll answer bonus question 4 later in this article!)</p>
<p>The Y combinator was devised by Haskell Curry, an influential logician who has the unique distinction of lending his name to both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying?ref=the-nerve-blog.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">programming technique</a> and a <a href="https://www.haskell.org/?ref=the-nerve-blog.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">programming language</a>. It is also known as the "Fixpoint Combinator" (for reasons we'll soon discuss) and the "Paradoxical Combinator" (for reasons we'll investigate in the second half of this post.)</p><hr><h3 id="the-lambda-calculus">The Lambda Calculus</h3><p>This post presumes that you're at least familiar with the lambda calculus - you don't have to be an expert, but if it's completely new to you you may have some trouble knowing what's going on. <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~gupta/courses/apl/lambda.pdf?ref=the-nerve-blog.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">This</a> is a good introduction if you need it (this article only draws on the material in Section 1.)</p><p>Two things about the lambda calculus that you should understand before reading this:</p><p>1) <em>everything </em>in the lambda calculus is a function (I'll also call these functions 'terms'.) When you "run" a program in the lambda calculus, you're basically plugging functions into other functions over and over until you can't do it anymore. This may seem like it severely limits the expressive power of the lambda calculus, but consider that we can encode different kinds of data and operators in the lambda calculus by representing them using suitable functions (the linked paper shows how to represent booleans and natural numbers in the lambda calculus, and demonstrates how to do arithmetic and some boolean algebra.) The lambda calculus is Turing Complete, so using this type of encoding you can replicate the behavior of any program written in any language. </p><p>2) There are no names besides variable names in the lambda calculus. You can't assign a name to a function and you can't call any functions by name. For the sake of readability I'll sometimes cheat and give a name to a function just to make it easier to explain. For example, I might write </p><p>$$id = \lambda x. x$$</p><p>and then later:</p><p>$$myCoolTerm = \lambda x. x \enspace id(x)$$</p><p>Just remember that you technically can't do \(name = term\) or \(name(argument)\) in the real lambda calculus; you have to write everything out. For example, \(myCoolTerm\) can only legally be written as:</p><p>$$ \lambda x. x \enspace ((\lambda x. x) (x)) $$</p><hr><h3 id="ythe-fixpoint-combinator">Y - the Fixpoint Combinator</h3><p>A fixed point (or fixpoint) of a function \(f\) is a point that doesn't change when you apply \(f\) to it. In other words, \(x\) is a fixpoint of \(f\) if and only if</p><p>$$f(x) = x$$</p><p>Y is a <em>fixpoint</em> <em>combinator</em> (notice I didn't say <em>the</em> fixpoint combinator - the Y combinator is one of the oldest and simplest fixpoint combinators, but there are many others!) A fixpoint combinator takes a (one-argument) function and returns some fixpoint of that function (some functions have more than one fixpoint - consider, for example, that every<em> </em>value returned by an idempotent function is a fixpoint! If the function has <em>no</em> fixpoints \(Y(f)\) doesn't terminate.) So we know Y must satisfy: </p><p>$$ f(Y(f)) = Y(f)$$</p><p>but that also means:</p><p>$$Y(f) = f(Y(f))$$</p><p>From a computational perspective, this second equation says that the action of \(Y\) is to take a function and <em>nest itself</em> in a call to that function. </p><p>Because the two equations above are equivalent, finding a \(Y(f)\) that satisfies the second equation means that - <em>by definition</em> - \(Y(f)\) is a fixed point of \(f\). </p><blockquote>Now is a good time to remember that everything in the lambda calculus is a function. So \(Y\) is a function that takes another function \(f\) and returns a fixed-point, which is also a function itself.</blockquote><p>At first glance \(Y\) looks trivially easy to implement. Can't we just say that</p><p>$$Y = \lambda f. f \enspace (Y\enspace f)$$</p><p>? Well, if we were using another language, we could, but in the lambda calculus we can't refer to \(Y\) by name. Remember, functions technically don't have names at all in the lambda calculus; the formal calculus uses only lambdas and variables. So, if we want \(Y\) to be a valid term, we have to write everything out. Let's substitute that occurrence of \(Y\) in the function body with its explicit definition:</p><p>$$Y = \lambda f. f \enspace (Y\enspace f)$$</p><p>$$Y = \lambda f. f \enspace (\lambda f. f \enspace (Y \enspace f)\enspace f)$$</p><p>Hmm....let's try again:</p><p>$$Y = \lambda f. f \enspace (\lambda f. f \enspace (\lambda f. f \enspace (Y\enspace f) \enspace f)\enspace f)$$</p><p>Okay, it's becoming clear we can't write out \(Y\) explicitly: this process will continue forever, and terms in the lambda calculus are not allowed to be infinitely large.</p><p>Since we can't get away with having \(Y\) refer to itself in its own definition, we need it to be somehow <em>self-replicating</em>. \(Y(f)\) must manufacture a copy of itself at runtime and then wrap that copy in another \(f\). But now we have a nasty chicken-and-egg problem: it's not clear how to replicate \(Y(f)\) without knowing its structure, and we won't know its structure until we figure out how to do the replication!</p><p>Let's forget about the outer \(f\) for now and consider how we could make the simplest possible self-replicating term (call it \(R\)). The first thing to notice is that we want something that <em>reduces</em> - an \(R\) that just sits there will always be trivially equal to itself, but that's not interesting or useful to us. We want a term that changes, but somehow ends up right back where it started. To make any progress, we need to make <em>some</em> claim about the structure of \(R\) (even if it ends up being wrong.) Let's start with the simplest structure that will reduce - a single function application:</p><p>$$R = M N$$</p><p>Let's see if we can make this work. We need to figure out what \(M\) and \(N\) should be. We're trying to replicate \(R\) by applying \(M\) to \(N\), so if \(R\) is a single function application, the inner structure of \(M\) should probably be a single application too. In other words, \(M\) should look something like:</p><p>$$M = \lambda x. ((f_1\space x) (f_2\space x))$$</p><p>where \(f_1\) and \(f_2\) are...something. What should they be? What should \(N\) be, for that matter? </p><p>We're ready to try and crack the nut of the problem. At this point you should try Messing Around for a while and see what you come up with; experiment with different terms for \(f_1\), \(f_2\), and \(N\) and see what the results are. Remember that <em>everything</em> in the lambda calculus is a function - there are no other types of values! When you've figured it out (or you're just ready to move on), keep reading.</p><hr><p>The key to this one is noticing that \(f_1\space x\) <em>must</em> equal \(M\) if we want \(MN\) to reduce to itself. We can't set \(f_1\) itself to \(M\); we'll end up with the infinite nesting we saw earlier and we'll never be able to write \(M\) down at all. Our other option is to pass \(M\) in as an argument, i.e. \(x = M\), which means \(N = M\), which means \(f_1\) and \(f_2\) are simply the identity functions (which means we can omit them altogether.) Put this all together and you get:</p><p>$$M = N = \lambda x.(x  x)$$</p><p>$$R = \lambda x.(x  x)\enspace\lambda x.(x x)$$</p><p>This works! It only takes a single step for \(R\) to replicate (you can do it in your head if you want - just substitute for \(x\) on the left-hand side.)</p><p>We have rediscovered the <em>Omega combinator</em>, or \(\Omega\), which is one of the simplest terms that can reproduce itself like this (you'll notice that it will keep reducing forever!)</p><p>Looking back at how we derived the Omega combinator, we can see what the trick to self-replication is. We got things working with \(\Omega\) because we passed a copy of M in as an <em>argument</em>, instead of directly nesting it inside of its own definition. This may just seem like semantics, but it allows us to do the nesting one step at a time during reduction instead of having to write down everything at once - which means we don't end up with infinitely large terms!</p><p>Time to put the pieces together. Let's tweak our Omega combinator to turn it into the Y combinator.</p><hr><p>Last time, we structured \(M\) based on the structural assumptions we made about \(\Omega\). The only different between \(\Omega\) and \(Y f\) is that \(\Omega\) turns into \(\Omega\), and we want \(Y(f)\) to turn into \(f(Y(f))\). So we'll update the structure of \(M\) - instead of a single function application, it'll be a single function application <em>wrapped in an \(f()\)</em>:</p><p>$$ M = \lambda x.f (x x) $$ </p><p>Setting \(M = N\) as before, we get:</p><p>$$ Y(f) = M N = \lambda x.f (x x) \enspace \lambda x.f (x x) $$</p><p>$$ Y = \lambda f. \enspace (\lambda x. \enspace f(x  x)) \enspace (\lambda x. \enspace f(x  x)) $$</p><p>Does this work? Let's see:</p><p>$$ Y(f) = \lambda x.f (x x) \enspace \lambda x.f (x x) $$</p><p>$$ Y(f) = f (\lambda x.f (x x) \enspace \lambda x.f (x x))$$</p><p>Yes! It works. In a single substitution step, \(Y(f)\) nests itself inside of \(f\). That bizarre structure we saw at at the beginning of this post is indeed a fixpoint combinator! </p><hr><h3 id="ythe-paradoxical-combinator">Y - the Paradoxical Combinator</h3><p>So far we've learned what the Y combinator does, and we've <em>kind of</em> learned why it's useful, but perhaps not in a very convincing way. So the Y combinator self-replicates without referring to itself by name...why do we care? What do we get by prohibiting self-reference, or by writing programs in such an unwieldy style? Isn't this all a bit abstruse (and while we're at it, how on earth is the Y combinator "paradoxical"?) I can give you a more satisfying answer, but you'll have to allow me a brief detour into the history of math.</p><p>The lambda calculus was created in the early 20th century, when mathematics was re-orienting itself around the idea of <em>formalism</em>. Formalism, in a nutshell, is a philosophy that says mathematics is "just" the act of manipulating symbols according to well-defined rules. This may seem tautological, but it's not - it represented a significant shift in attention towards the symbols and rules themselves and away from the things mathematics is "about" (numbers, shapes, functions, etc.)</p><p>This new formalist perspective led to a proliferation of <em>formal systems.</em> At its most basic, a formal system is a set of symbols that can be arranged into formulas, a set of rules for manipulating symbols to make new formulas, and a set of <em>axioms</em> - formulas that are assumed to be true. You're probably familiar with a couple of formal systems already, such as the predicate calculus, set theory, or Peano arithmetic.</p><p>Formal systems featured prominently in 20th century mathematics, and new ones are still being created today. A well-constructed formal system can serve a wide variety of purposes. For example:</p><ul>
<li>Many formal systems have been proposed as potential <em>foundations of mathematics</em> - systems in which every area of mathematics can, in theory, be re-derived. A suitable foundational system a) unifies separate areas of mathematics, making it easier to port insights and techniques between them, and b) provides a rock-solid underpinning for concepts that may have been accepted as true without being fully understood. Today it is widely accepted that Zermelo-Frankel set theory is the most suitable foundation for mainstream mathematics, but other systems could potentially work as foundations as well, such as (some variants of) category theory, and even (some variants of) the lambda calculus!</li>
<li>Formal systems can be used to learn things about a particular style of reasoning, deduction, or calculation (a formal system might be proposed simply so that mathematicians can study its capabilities and limitations - not because it's ever intended to be used in practice.)</li>
<li>On the flip side, some formal systems <em>are</em> just easier to do mathematics in (this is a matter of taste, of course.) For example, many proponents of category theory maintain that certain results are much more natural to derive categorically than in other systems.</li>
<li>As computer science matured into its own field of inquiry, there was a lot of work done on <em>functional</em> programming languages (functional languages you may have heard of include LISP, Haskell, and OCaml.) While an imperative program is (loosely) a series of instructions, a functional program is (loosely) a collection of terms and a set of rules for turning terms into other terms. Existing formal systems like the lambda calculus provided a natural jumping-off point for the designers of these new functional languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Some systems are referred to as formal systems and others are referred to as formal systems <em>of logic</em> (or formal logics, for short), but the criteria that distinguish these are blurry and a point of contention among some mathematicians. They also aren't relevant to the aims of this article, so for now we'll treat both of these terms as equivalent.)</p><p>All of this is to say that Haskell Curry was (probably!) thinking about the lambda calculus as it was first presented - that is, as a formal system, and not as a programming language. </p><p>A few other things that are important to understand about the lambda calculus before we move on:</p><ol><li>it was created to be <em>small</em>. It has variables, abstraction, application, and two reduction rules. That's <em>it</em> - that is the complete language. This minimality serves an aesthetic goal (to capture the "essence" of computation), but it also makes the lambda calculus easy to reason about (take, for example, the Church-Rosser Theorem, which says that regardless of the order in which you reduce terms in an expression you'll always end up with the same value at the end. You would not want to try and prove this fact about a more complicated language.) </li><li>it was first described Church in 1930, more than six years before Alan Turing (Church's doctoral student at the time) would publish his work on Turing machines. At the time there was a broad and ongoing investigation into the nature of computation, but there were no physical computers to speak of and certainly no programming languages. The closest analogues to Church's system were systems of formal logic - it's doubtful anyone imagined or assumed that the lambda calculus itself would be directly used to give instructions to a computer.</li><li>A big theme in 20th century computer science is that computation and formal logic are two sides of the same coin, in a few important ways (we'll look at this more in a bit.)</li></ol><p>That said - whence the Y combinator? Well, Curry needed it in order to create a <em>paradox </em>within the lambda calculus.</p><p>In the parlance of formal logic, a paradox is a proof that doesn't break any rules, but still ends in a contradiction (i.e. it proves a proposition and its opposite at the same time.) You may be familiar with the famous Russel paradox; the informal version goes like this: "there is a barber who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves. Does this barber shave himself?" On the one hand, the barber <em>must </em>shave himself - if he didn't, he'd fit the criteria for people he shaves, so he'd end up shaving himself anyway. On the other hand, the barber <em>cannot</em> shave himself - if he did, he would no longer fit his own criteria, and would be unable to take himself on as a customer.</p><p>Proving a contradiction is usually a knife through the heart for a system of logic. If you can prove a proposition and its opposite are both true, you can often find a way to prove <em>any</em> statement - and a system that can prove anything is not very useful (logicians refer to this kind of system as <em>trivial.</em>) You're only supposed to be able to prove things that are actually true!</p><p>Paradoxes are important tools to probe the flaws and limitations of formal systems. The discovery of Russel's Paradox, for example, led to many augmented systems of logic containing various mechanisms to ensure the paradox could no longer occur (fun fact: among these efforts were the first incarnations of type theory!) In particular, since Russel's Paradox has negation at its core (the barber shaves people who <em>don't</em> shave themselves), many logicians hoped they could dodge it by constructing systems that had a modified concept of negation, or no concept of negation at all.</p><p>Curry's Paradox shot those hopes down. It's a variant of Russel's Paradox that doesn't depend on negation. Curry constructed his paradox to prove the triviality of a bunch of different logics - among them, the famous lambda calculus and Moses Schönfinkel's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic?ref=the-nerve-blog.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">combinatory logic</a>.</p><blockquote>
<div><p>Combinatory logic was invented by Moses Schönfinkel in a 1924 paper (it was one of the two papers he published in his whole life.) Schönfinkel's goal was to create a form of logic that did not include the notion of a variable. Instead, it uses a fixed set of <em>combinators</em> - which are functions that take other combinators and apply them to each other in various ways. Just as everything in the lambda calculus is a function, an expression in combinatory logic <em>only</em> consists of combinators - it's combinators all the way down. </p><p>
Combinatory logic got a boost when Haskell Curry began studying it in 1927, but the lambda calculus was always more popular.  Until a resurgence of interest in the 60s, Curry basically carried the torch alone, doing the bulk of the work on the subject either himself or with his students. Curry created the Y combinator to construct his paradox in combinatory logic, which is why it's called the Y <strong>combinator</strong> and why it's named after a single letter. In combinatory logic, the Y combinator is implemented like this:<br>
$$Y = SSI(S(S(KS)K)(K(SII)))$$</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, enough preamble - let's examine Curry's Paradox in all its glory.</p><p>Take a look at this:</p><p>"If this sentence - the very one I'm speaking now - is true, then all birds are government spies."</p><p>It turns out that using this sentence alone you can prove the fact that all birds are government spies - or anything else you wish to prove, including a contradiction like "1 = 1 and also 1 = 0". This paradox is not quite as intuitive as Russel's Paradox, so we probably need to look at it more formally before it starts to make sense.</p><p>Consider the following statement:</p><p>\(S\): If statement \(S\) is true, proposition \(P\) is true.</p><ul>
<li>The standard way to prove an implication \(X =&gt; Y\) is to assume that the first part is true and then deduce that the second part must be true, given that the first part is. So, let's take "\(S\) is true" as a hypothesis.</li>
<li>\(S\) is true, so \(S =&gt; P\) is true, since \(S\) states directly that \(S =&gt; P\). <p> (This is where the problems start, by the way. If \(P\) were something provably false, like \(1 + 1 = 3\), \(S =&gt; P\) should also be false, but the rules of logic compel us to permit \(S =&gt; P\) anyway, since by hypothesis we're assuming \(S\) is true. As with many paradoxes, the issue is that \(S\) references itself.)</p></li>
<li>\(S\) is true by hypothesis, and \(S\) says \(S =&gt; P\) is true. Taken together, this means \(P\) must be true.</li>
<li>We just proved that if you assume \(S\) is true, \(P\) must be true as well. In other words, we proved \(S =&gt; P\).</li>
<li>\(S\) states directly that \(S =&gt; P\), and we just proved that \(S =&gt; P\) is true. So, \(S\) is true as well!</li>
<li>Finally, since \(S\) is true and \(S =&gt; P\) is true, \(P\) is true as well - <strong>no matter what \(P\) is</strong>. Paradox!!</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, the key here is thay \(S =&gt; P\) refers to itself via its own antecedent, \(S\). As we saw before, we'll need the Y combinator to make this happen in systems that don't permit explicit self-reference.</p><hr><h3 id="currys-paradox-in-the-lambda-calculus">Curry's Paradox in the Lambda Calculus</h3><p>In this section we're going to put together everything we've learned so far to implement Curry's Paradox in the lambda calculus. This might seem nonsensical to you - what does it mean to <em>implement</em> a paradox? How could a logical paradox be put into a system of computation?</p><p>In the last section we learned about the concept of a <em>formal system,</em> and I gave a few examples. Some of these are logical systems, in which you manipulate symbols to make logical deductions, and some are computational systems, in which you manipulate symbols to perform computations and come up with a result. Using a computational system to prove things or do logical deduction doesn't seem to make any sense - it wasn't built for that, right?</p><p>The Curry-Howard Correspondence was a slow-motion realization by Haskell Curry and the logician William Alvin Howard (and a few other mathematicians, at various times) that these two "types" of systems are actually, in a deep and important sense, intertwined! In other words, we <em>are</em> writing proofs when we write programs - they're just <em>constructive</em> proofs. </p><blockquote>
<div><p>The term "constructive proof" takes its name from constructivism, which, like formalism, is a philosophy of mathematics that was the topic of some debate in the early 20th century. There's a lot to say about constructivism, but the part that's relevant to us is the belief that the only way to prove a certain class of mathematical objects exists is to construct an example and present it. </p><p>
In particular, this means that constructivists reject proof by contradiction, which is a technique used in "classical" mathematics. A proof by contradiction says "this type of object must exist, because if it didn't, that would lead to a contradiction." You'll notice that the object itself is never described, even though it's been proven to exist; i.e. we know it's "out there" but we don't know what it looks like! For constructivists, this is impermissible. </p><p>
Proof by contradiction is an important and widespread technique, and outlawing it makes it - frankly - pretty difficult to do mathematics (David Hilbert compared it to "prohibiting the boxer the use of his fists.") For this reason constructivism never quite caught on with mainstream mathematicians the way that formalism did.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>To understand what it means for a program to represent a constructive proof, consider the value "hello". This is a value of type \(String\), which means it is an example of a \(String\), which means it is a <em>constructive proof that at least one value of type \(String\) exists</em>. </p><p>Now consider the following (pseudocode) function:</p><p>$$ firstChar(myString: String) = myString[0] $$</p><p>This accepts a \(String\) and returns a \(Char\). In other words, it accepts a constructive proof that a \(String\) exists and returns a constructive proof that a \(Char\) exists. In other words, it is a constructive proof that says "if at least one value of type \(String\) exists, at least one value of type \(Char\) exists"<em>.</em></p><p>This extends to higher order functions as well. For example, this function:</p><p>$$ firstDigit(firstChar: (String) =&gt; Char, toString: (Number) =&gt; String, num: Number) = firstChar(toString(num))$$ </p><p>is a constructive proof that says "if the existence of a \(String\) implies the existence of a \(Char\), and the existence of a \(Number\) implies the existence of a \(String\), and at least one \(Number\) exists, then at least one \(Char\) exists".</p><p>For typed languages, the Curry-Howard correspondence implies that types can be seen as propositions, and terms of a particular type can be seen as proofs of the proposition that type represents. This is often referred to as the "propositions as types" perspective.</p><p>(The "proofs" embodied by a lot of business software are usually not very interesting - e.g. "if we have a proof that a list of numbers exists, we can prove that a list of strings exists", etc.  People can and do write full, mathematically useful proofs using programs, but these programs generally look very different than the ones written by professional software developers.)</p><p>The full statement and context of the Curry-Howard Correspondence is more technical than this, but this is the general idea, and enough of a start for us to work with.</p><hr><p>Now let's think of another term - a number that is both odd and even at the same time. We'll refer to this kind of number as an \(Evil\) number, i.e. our number is a term of type \(Evil\). This term functions as a constructive proof that there exists at least one \(Evil\) number (which, of course, we know isn't true!) We'll refer to this term as \(evil\) - and since it proves something that isn't true, it can't be constructed directly. But is there a way to express it nonetheless? (spoiler: in the naive lambda calculus, there is)</p><p>We can't create \(evil\) directly, but we <em>could</em> return it from a function, if the function had some way to get an \(evil\) from its arguments. It doesn't make sense to directly accept \(evil\) as an argument (how would the caller construct it?) but we could accept a <em>function</em> that returns it. But what should <em>that</em> function accept? Well...<em>another</em> function that also returns \(evil\)! The naive lambda calculus doesn't have types, but if it did, the type of our new function would (informally) look like:</p><p>$$ createEvil: createEvil \rightarrow Evil $$</p><p>To get \(evil\) from \(createEvil\), we supply it with a function that creates \(evil\) - and our only option is \(createEvil\) itself. The non-lambda-calculus version of this looks like:</p><p>$$ createEvil(f) = f(f) $$</p><p>and we call it like so:</p><p>$$ evil = createEvil(createEvil) $$</p><p>(Note that what we've done is to <em>express</em> a term that represents \(evil\). Were we to actually try to run this function, it would run forever. This is not unexpected - paradoxes and nontermination are two sides of the same "things are breaking" phenomenon.)</p><p>Let's stop and consider for a second. If you screw up your eyes a little you can see that this weird function is analogous to Curry's Paradox. Consider:</p><ul><li>a function that takes a proof object for \(A\) and turns it into a proof object for \(B\) is a constructive proof of \(A \Rightarrow B\)</li><li>a function that takes <em>that</em> function and turns it into \(evil\) is a constructive proof of \((A \Rightarrow B) \Rightarrow evil\)</li><li>consider a function that takes <em>itself</em> and turns it into \(evil\). If we refer to the proposition this function proves as \(S\), it directly follows that this function <em>also</em> proves \(S \Rightarrow evil\)</li></ul><p>This should look familiar to you - it's exactly the structure that caused so much trouble in our earlier example! Let's go through the rest of the paradox to see how it lines up with \(createEvil\)</p><table>

</table>
<p>Hopefully now it's clear that \(createEvil\) is the computational manifestation of Curry's Paradox. We're exploiting self-reference here to produce a function that "proves" \(evil\) exists (it can also prove that any other value exists, just like the "regular" version of Curry's paradox can prove any \(P\).) Yet, since this function never terminates, running it will break your program, just as proving a contradiction will break your logical system.</p><p>Now for the coup de grace - let's rewrite \(createEvil\) in the lambda calculus. Remember, we can't do \(createEvil = createEvil(createEvil)\) directly because the lambda calculus technically doesn't allow for named functions. We need some way to pass \(createEvil\) to itself at runtime. This is where the Y combinator (finally) enters the picture. Recall that:</p><p>$$ Y(f) = f(Y(f)) $$</p><p>if we let \(f = \lambda x. (x x)\), we get:</p><p>$$ Y(f) = f(Y(f))$$</p><p>$$ Y(f) = (\lambda x.(x x)) \space Y(f) $$</p><p>$$ Y(f) = Y(f) \space Y(f) $$</p><p>We can see that if we let \(createEvil = Y \enspace \lambda x. (x x)\), we end up with \(createEvil = createEvil \space createEvil\), like we wanted. Thus, the final form of \(createEvil\), fully written out in the lambda calculus, is:</p><p>$$  (\lambda f. \enspace (\lambda x. \enspace f(x  x)) \enspace (\lambda x. \enspace f(x  x))) (\lambda x. \enspace (x x)) $$</p><hr><p>What does it mean that we've implemented Curry's Paradox in the lambda calculus? It means that the (naive) lambda calculus has some pretty notable issues as a formal system. How do we deal with that? By adding types, thus upgrading the naive lambda calculus to the simply typed lambda calculus. We'll cover this topic more in Part 2!</p>

<!-- TODO! ping Matthew Berman about this post -->

<p>I gotta say – <em>I love it living in exponential times</em>. I can just wish that something existed and then within a month it does! This time it happened with <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">OpenAI's 4o image generation release</a>. In this blog post I'll briefly cover the release and why I think it's pretty cool. Then I'll dive into a new opportunity that I think is even more exciting – <em>visual reasoning</em>.</p>

<h2 id="why-image-manipulation-with-llms-stinks">Why Image Manipulation with LLMs Stinks</h2>
<p>Working with images in Multimodal LLMs has been a mostly one-sided affair. On one hand, it's really cool that you can drop an image into an LLM conversation and get the model to reason about it. But when you ask the model to generate an image, there is a disconnect, because all the model can do is describe the image in text and then call out to an external image generation tool to generate the image based on that text. Text is a poor communication medium for images, and the resulting image is often quite disconnected from the expected result because the short description that the LLM provides to the image generation tool will rarely capture the full context of the conversation.</p>
<p>The problem is most pronounced when attempting to go back and forth working on an idea for an image. You can show the LLM an image of your cat and then say "make this cat wear a detective hat and a monocle". The best the model can do is to put a detective hat and monocle on <em>some</em> cat, not the one in your image. To make matters worse, the model can't even see the image that it has just created. So if you ask for a modification to first generation attempt, then the subsequent generations are really just starting over from scratch and hoping that a more detailed description to the image generation tool will make things better... it won't.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2 id="openais-release-brings-true-image-manipulation-to-llms">OpenAI's Release Brings True Image Manipulation to LLMs</h2>
<p>OpenAI's image generation release changes all of this. OpenAI's newest GPT-4o model carries the full context of the conversation into the image generation, and rather than call out to an external model, it is the very same GPT-4o model that does the image generation. By carrying the full context of the conversation – <em>including the previous images</em> – into the generation of the new image you can generate much more consistent imagery.</p>
<p>Thus, stealing OpenAI's example, you can show it a photo of your cat, tell it to give <em>your cat</em> a detective hat, et voila! It works!</p>

  <figcaption>Left: OpenAI's pet cat. Right: GPT-4o's generation when asked to give the same cat a detective hat and monocle. Much more consistent!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now if all we could do with this technology is stick silly costumes on our cats, then this would honestly be a pretty lame achievement. But think about what we're angling for here. You'll be able to turn hand-drawn garbage into sophisticated infographics and marketing material. You'll be able to take crappy matplotlib charts and reformat them as professional-looking plots that go into slides. You'll be able to try on clothes virtually before you buy them. You'll be able to create photo collages from your photos, game assets, and 3D models. You'll be able to edit your vacation photos to remove that one person who blinked. You'll be able to take a photo of your living room and try out different furniture arrangements and color schemes. You'll be able to take a photo of your garden and get suggestions for where to plant new flowers. The possibilities are endless when you can manipulate images with the full context of a conversation.</p>
<h2 id="visual-reasoning-will-be-the-real-innovation">Visual Reasoning will be the Real Innovation</h2>
<p>All of the above is but prologue for what will come next. Models perform better when they take time to reason. This is because models have no internal monologue. Whereas humans pause and think about a question prior to answering, models have to generate tokens in order to think. But to this point models have only been able to reason in the space of words, and words are ill-suited for reasoning through many types of real world problems. But soon the models' new image manipulation capabilities will power a new form of reasoning. Right now, this ability is mostly useful for image editing. Soon, models will have the ability to visualize different scenarios and visually reason about the world around them.</p>
<h3 id="demoing-visual-reasoning">Demoing Visual Reasoning</h3>
<p>Let's try out an example right now and get a glimpse of how visual reasoning will work. For our experiment we'll use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoikSxHXBYw&amp;t=546s">Matthew Berman's marble in a cup problem</a> – it's one of his go-to reasoning challenges when playing around with a new model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've put a marble in a glass. The glass is then turned upside down and put on a table. Then the glass is picked up and put into the microwave. Where is the marble?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a great problem because it requires common sense knowledge of how objects work in the world, and it's especially suited for this post because it requires spatial reasoning to extrapolate to a new scenario. I asked the new GPT-4o a variant of this problem in text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I set a plate on a table, and glass next to it. I set a marble on the plate. Then I pick up the marble, drop it in the glass. Then I turn the glass upside down and set it on the plate. Then, I pick up the glass and put it in the microwave. Where is the marble?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've added an extra item, a plate, for just a bit more complexity. Here's the answer it gave me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The marble is <strong>in the microwave, inside the glass.</strong></p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what happened:</p>
<p>You placed a <strong>marble on the plate.</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>picked up the marble and dropped it in the glass</strong> — now the marble is <strong>in the glass.</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>turned the glass upside down and set it on the plate</strong> — unless the glass is sealed or the marble is somehow stuck, the marble would <strong>fall out onto the plate.</strong></p>
<p>Then you <strong>picked up the glass (now empty) and put it in the microwave.</strong></p>
<p>So at this point:</p>
<p>The <strong>glass is in the microwave.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>marble is on the plate, outside</strong> the microwave.</p>
<p>But you asked: Where is the marble? You didn't say you picked it up again, so based on what you said, the marble is <strong>on the plate, not in the microwave.</strong></p>
<p>Want to run it back or add any twists?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's actually a pretty weird answer. It immediately answers – <em>incorrectly</em> – then performs post-hoc chain-of-thought reasoning and comes to the correct answer but ignores the fact that it completely contradicted itself.</p>
<p>Let's now do a vision-enhanced version of this chain-of-thought reasoning and demonstrate how spatial reasoning will improve the model's reasoning capabilities.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Problem Statement" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/real_image.png" width="600px">
  <figcaption>Problem Statement Image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I prompted it with the following (including extra requirements to think visually):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to pick up the marble, put it in the glass, turn the glass over onto the plate, pick the glass up, and then put the glass in the microwave. </p>
<p>The question is, where is the marble?</p>
<p>Solve this one step at a time using images to imagine what happens at each step. For each step, first state the step, and then generate an image corresponding to what the scene will look like after that step. And then summarize the image in English, highlighting the important aspects for solving the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the reasoning responses from the model:</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Step 1" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/step1.png" width="600px">
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Step 1: Pick up the marble.</p>
<p>In the image, the marble has not yet been moved, but we are about to pick it up and place it in the glass.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
  <img alt="Step 2" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/step2.png" width="600px">
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Step 2: Put the marble in the glass.</p>
<p>In the image, the marble is now inside the glass, and the plate is empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
  <img alt="Step 3" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/step3.png" width="600px">
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Step 3: Turn the glass over onto the plate.</p>
<p>In the image, the glass is now upside down on the plate, trapping the marble inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
  <img alt="Step 4" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/step4.png" width="600px">
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Step 4: Pick the glass up.</p>
<p>In the image, the hand is lifting the glass off the plate. The marble remains on the plate, as it is no longer contained.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
  <img alt="Step 5" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/step5.png" width="600px">
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Step 5: Put the glass in the microwave.</p>
<p>In the image, the glass is now inside the microwave with the marble at the bottom.</p>
<p>Final answer: The marble is inside the microwave, at the bottom of the glass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So... uh... notably, we made some amazingly consistent images, and then <em>completely</em> got the answer wrong. And we were so close! At Step 4, the model acknowledged that the marble was no longer contained in the glass. Unfortunately, by the time the glass was in the microwave, the model imagined that the marble had somehow followed it.</p>
<h3 id="training-models-to-think-visually">Training Models to Think Visually</h3>
<p>I think the failure to correctly use visual reasoning is because the model hasn't yet been <em>trained</em> for visual reasoning.</p>
<p>Who knows how OpenAI trained these models, but based on their <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">debuting post</a>, the training to date is almost certainly unrelated to visual reasoning. The examples in that post – while extremely impressive – are about better rendering for text, and better instruction following. But all the instructions follow examples related to image manipulation rather than reasoning. Instead, we need to start training models <em>specifically</em> to perform visual reasoning.</p>
<p>For visual reasoning practice, we can do supervised fine-tuning on sequences similar to the marble example above. For instance, to understand more about the physical world, we can show the model sequential pictures of Slinkys going down stairs, or basketball players shooting 3-pointers, or people hammering birdhouses together. We can make the model become more socially aware by letting it see sequences of text and images from social interactions, and having it predict body language and facial expressions for the next scene. We can train for spatial reasoning by having models solve tangrams or having them visualize what a contraption will look like when rotated by 90 degrees. If you think for very long it's easy to can come up with tons of ideas like these – visual reasoning is central to most of our lives.</p>
<p>But where will we get all this training data? For spatial and physical reasoning tasks, we can leverage computer graphics to generate synthetic data. This approach is particularly valuable because simulations provide a controlled environment where we can create scenarios with known outcomes, making it easy to verify the model's predictions. But we'll also need real-world examples. Fortunately, there's an abundance of video content online that we can tap into. While initial datasets might require human annotation, soon models themselves will be able to process videos and their transcripts to extract training examples automatically. Consider all the how-to videos online - creators typically explain what they're going to do before demonstrating it. We can use these to create training pairs: given the current scene and verbal description, have models predict what happens next.</p>
<p>As an aside – I think that videos are going to be our richest source of new training data, and we're just now starting to really tap into it. But who owns the all of the video content on the web? YouTube... Google. I'd say that bodes really well for the future of the Gemini models. Wouldn't you?</p>
<h3 id="from-chain-of-thought-to-reasoning-models">From Chain-of-Thought to Reasoning Models</h3>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">As early as 2022</a> we had recognized that LLMs profited from chain-of-thought reasoning. If a model was making a snap judgment and rushing to an incorrect solution, it was commonplace to add a "let's think step by step", hope for a better output, and often get it. Soon, deeper reasoning approaches were discovered. In particular, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601">Tree of Thoughts</a> encouraged the model to think through multiple possible approaches for solving a problem, rank them according to perceived feasibility, and then the application would help direct the model optimally through the paths and toward the problem solution.</p>
<p>With OpenAI's o1 model and several models that followed soon thereafter, the ability to do this sort of tree-of-thoughts reasoning is baked into the model. Prior to providing a final solution, the model may now think through the problem within special "thinking" tags. According to DeepSeek (who has been much more transparent than OpenAI), their R1 model has been trained through a form of reinforcement learning with verifiable problems so that the model can be rewarded for efficiently thinking its way to the <em>verifiable</em> correct solution. Interestingly, and reminiscent of tree-of-thoughts, the models can think themselves into a corner – <em>recognize that they have messed up</em> – backtrack, and get back to a better course toward solving the problem.</p>
<p>Enter visual reasoning. In the coming year, models will undergo supervised fine-tuning to develop scene prediction abilities - given a current scene and a proposed change, they'll learn to visualize the outcome. For example, they'll be able to mentally rotate objects in 3D space or anticipate how people might react in social situations. As training progresses using scenarios with verifiable outcomes, models will develop more sophisticated reasoning capabilities. They'll be able to observe their environment, formulate plans, mentally simulate the consequences of different actions, and learn from comparing their predictions to real-world results. This advancement will be particularly transformative for robotics, where physical interaction with the environment requires robust visual understanding and planning.</p>
<p>Currently, there is one obvious problem with visual reasoning – image creation is a very slow process. However, like everything else in our world right now, this will soon become faster and more feasible. But even if the visual processing remains slow, the very act of training the models to reason about images will improve the text reasoning for visual/spatial problems. What's more, the internal representation of the images seems to be created at several levels of granularity – a small blurry image, and then a refined high-def image. The image you see when playing with ChatGPT is the latter, high-def image. Perhaps visual reasoning can make use of the blurry image – it will be quicker to generate and will help with the reasoning process.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm excited about what's coming! Just like every moment for the past 4 years, we're on the cusp of a radical discovery that will change our world – a radical discovery which is soon realized. I don't think this one is going to let us down. The ever-more capable <em>visual</em> reasoning models will be able to make better sense of our work – not only in terms of understanding the mechanics of physical objects, but also in reading social cues, and really in anything else that we do where vision is of use to us! And then 2026 will be the year of the robots...</p>
