<p>Gentoo Council has voted on 2024-04-14 on the following policy:
</p>
<blockquote><p>It is expressly forbidden to contribute to Gentoo any content that has been created with the assistance of Natural Language Processing artificial intelligence tools.

</p>
<h2><span id="Rationale">Rationale</span></h2>
<ol><li><b>Copyright concerns.</b>  At this point, the regulations concerning copyright of generated contents are still emerging worldwide.  Using such material could pose a danger of copyright violations, but it could also weaken Gentoo claims to copyright and void the guarantees given by copyleft licensing.</li>
<li><b>Quality concerns.</b>  Popular LLMs are really great at generating plausibly looking, but meaningless content.  They are capable of providing good assistance if you are careful enough, but we can't really rely on that.  At this point, they pose both the risk of lowering the quality of Gentoo projects, and of requiring an unfair human effort from developers and users to review contributions and detect the mistakes resulting from the use of AI.</li>
<li><b>Ethical concerns.</b>  The business side of AI boom is creating serious ethical concerns.  Among them:
<ul><li>Commercial AI projects are frequently indulging in blatant copyright violations to train their models.</li>
<li>Their operations are causing concerns about the huge use of energy and water.</li>
<li>The advertising and use of AI models has caused a significant harm to employees and reduction of service quality.</li>
<li>LLMs have been empowering all kinds of spam and scam efforts.</li></ul></li></ol>

    </div><p>Cannabis use is linked to an almost quadrupling in the risk of developing diabetes, according to an analysis of real-world data from over 4 million adults, being presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (<a href="https://www.easd.org/annual-meeting/easd-2025/" target="_blank">EASD</a>) held in Vienna, Austria (15–19 Sept).</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    <p>Cannabis use is increasing globally with an estimated 219 million users (4.3% of the global adult population) in 2021, but its long-term metabolic effects remain unknown. While some studies have suggested potential anti-inflammatory or weight management properties, others have raised concerns regarding glucose metabolism and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+resistance/" rel="tag">insulin resistance</a>, and the magnitude of the risk of developing diabetes hasn't been clear.</p>
<p>To strengthen the evidence base, Dr. Ibrahim Kamel from the Boston Medical Center, Massachusetts, U.S. and colleagues analyzed <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag">electronic health records</a> from 54 health care organizations (TriNetX Research Network, with centers from across U.S. and Europe) to identify 96,795 outpatients (aged between 18 and 50 years, 52.5% female) with cannabis-related diagnoses (ranging from occasional use to dependence, including cases of intoxication and withdrawal) between 2010 and 2018.</p>
<p>They were matched with 4,160,998 healthy individuals (with no record of substance use or major chronic conditions) based on age, sex, and underlying illnesses at the start of the study, and followed for five years.</p>
<p>After controlling HDL and LDL cholesterol, uncontrolled high blood pressure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cocaine use, alcohol use and several other lifestyle risk factors, the researchers found that new cases of diabetes were significantly higher in the cannabis group (1,937; 2.2%) compared to the healthy group (518; 0.6%), with statistical analysis showing cannabis users at nearly four times the risk of developing diabetes compared to non-users.</p>

                                                                                                        
    
                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>While the authors note that more research is needed to fully explain the association between cannabis and diabetes, it may come down to insulin resistance and unhealthy dietary behaviors. Nevertheless, the study's results have immediate implications for metabolic monitoring practices and public health messaging.</p>
<p>"As cannabis becomes more widely available and socially accepted and legalized in various jurisdictions, it is essential to understand its potential health risks," said lead author Dr. Kamel.</p>
<p>"These new sights from reliable real-world evidence highlight the importance of integrating diabetes risk awareness into substance use disorder treatment and counseling, as well as the need for health care professionals to routinely talk to patients about <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cannabis+use/" rel="tag">cannabis use</a> so that they can understand their overall diabetes risk and potential need for metabolic monitoring."</p>
<p>The authors note that more research is needed on the long-term endocrine effects of cannabis use and whether diabetes risks are limited to inhaled products or other forms of cannabis such as edibles.</p>
<p>Despite the important findings, this is a retrospective study and cannot prove that cannabis use causes <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag">diabetes</a>, and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced the results despite efforts to reduce confounding bias via propensity score matching. This study has limitations due to a lack of detailed cannabis consumption data and potential misclassification.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that the inherent limitations of real-world data often result from inconsistent patient reporting in electronic medical records.</p>
<p>They also note that there is a risk of bias because of imprecise measures of cannabis exposure and the reliance on participants to accurately report any cannabis use, even when they lived in places where the drug is illegal.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p><strong>A new study from South Dakota State University reveals how grapevine canes can be converted into plastic-like material that is stronger than traditional plastic and will decompose in the environment in a relatively short amount of time.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote><p>The need for biodegradable packaging material has never been higher.</p><p>Currently, most packaging is "single use" and is made with plastic materials, derived from nonrenewable sources like crude oil that take hundreds of years to decompose in the environment. On top of this, only 9% of plastic is recycled. This has resulted in the formation of floating piles of plastic garbage in the ocean, called the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch."</p><p>But maybe even more concerning is the discovery of micro- and nano-plastics in the environment. Research has found that plastic breaks down into tiny particles, which are being ingested or inhaled by both humans and animals, and are found literally everywhere, including in the human body — according to recent research studies. Worse, little is known about the long-term health effects of microplastics.</p><p><a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/srinivas-janaswamy">Srinivas Janaswamy</a> is an associate professor in South Dakota State University's <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/dairy-food-science">Department of Dairy and Food Science</a>. His research has focused on developing value-added products through biowaste and agricultural byproducts. One of the overarching goals of Janaswamy's research is to tackle the plastic waste crisis.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Perhaps the biggest contributor to plastic waste, at least in the United States, is plastic bags, the kind found at most retail stores. These bags, while sometimes recycled, are often only used once and can be found littered throughout the environment.</p><p>To address this problem, Janaswamy is working toward developing a plastic-like bag that will decompose in the environment.</p><p>"That is my dream," Janaswamy said.</p><p>The key ingredient to Janaswamy's work? Cellulose. This biopolymer is the most abundant organic substance on Earth and is found, primarily, in the cell walls of plants. Cellulose, thanks to strong hydrogen bonds and a chain of glucose molecules, gives plants structural strength and rigidity along with other biopolymers such as mannan, xylose, hemicellulose and lignin.</p><p>Humans have long used cellulose to create products. Cotton, the material used to make a majority of the world’s clothing, is primarily composed of cellulose. Wood is rich in cellulose as well.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In previous research, Janaswamy has extracted cellulose from agricultural products like <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2023/06/can-avocado-peels-help-curb-plastic-waste-problem">avocado peels</a>, <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2025/02/extending-shelf-life-fruits">soyhulls</a>, alfalfa, <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2023/12/sdsu-researcher-turning-switchgrass-bioplastics">switchgrass</a>, <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2023/09/could-spent-coffee-grounds-provide-alternative-plastic-packaging">spent coffee grounds</a>, corncob and <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2024/02/save-peels-how-bananas-can-be-used-fight-plastic-waste-crisis">banana peels</a>. He uses the extracted cellulose to develop films — materials that look and feel similar to traditional plastic wrapping.</p><p>"By extracting cellulose from agricultural products, value-added products can be created," Janaswamy said.</p><p>Each of Janaswamy's films has different characteristics and properties. Some are more transparent than others. Some are stronger. But thanks to a unique collaboration with a fellow SDSU faculty member, Janaswamy may have created his best value-added product yet.</p><h2><strong>Grapevine canes</strong></h2><p>Janaswamy had just finished presenting “Ag Biomass – A Holy Grail to Clean up the Plastic Mess” at SDSU's Celebration of Faculty Excellence when he was approached by <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/anne-fennell">Anne Fennell</a>, a Distinguished Professor in the <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/agronomy-horticulture-plant-science">Department of Agronomy, Horticulture and Plant Science</a>.</p><p>After listening to Janaswamy's presentation, Fennell became interested in the research and had an idea. A leading researcher in the study of grapevines, she knew that grapevine canes — the woody plant material that grapes grow on — were rich in cellulose. She also knew that grapevine canes were abundant and had limited use after harvest.</p><p>"Every year we prune the majority of yearly biomass off the vine," Fennell said. "The pruned canes are either mowed over, composted and reapplied to the soil, or burned in some areas. &nbsp;Research in Australia showed that prunings could be removed from the field in alternate years without effecting soil health. &nbsp;My thought was why not use this for value added films. Several of the materials that Janaswamy previously used had a high-water content, in contrast the winter pruning yields a cellulose-dense material with low water content, making them an abundant ideal material to work with."</p><p>Fennell's idea led to a collaboration, and soon Janaswamy was extracting cellulose — which looks almost like cotton — from the canes of grapevines. The resulting films were eye-opening.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/fb/d5fb00211g">recent study</a> published in the academic journal Sustainable Food Technology, Janaswamy's grapevine cane films are transparent and strong and biodegrade within 17 days in the soil — leaving behind no harmful residue.</p><p>"High transmittance in packaging films enhances product visibility, making them more attractive to consumers and facilitating easy quality inspection without the need for unsealing," Janaswamy said. "These films demonstrate outstanding potential for food packaging applications."</p><figure role="group">

<p>The grapevine canes were harvested from SDSU's research vineyard. The research team, which includes doctoral candidates <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/sandeep-paudel">Sandeep Paudel</a> and <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/sumi-regmi">Sumi Regmi</a>, and Sajal Bhattarai, an SDSU graduate and a doctoral candidate at Purdue University, followed a published protocol in developing the films, which includes drying and grinding the canes and extracting the cellulosic residue. The residue was then solubilized and cast onto glass plates to create the films.</p><p>Testing revealed the grapevine cane-derived films were actually stronger than traditional plastic bags — in terms of tensile strength.</p><p>"Using underutilized grapevine prunings as a cellulose source for packaging films enhances waste management in the field and addresses the global issue of plastic pollution," Janaswamy said. "Developing eco-friendly films from grapevine cellulose represents a practical approach to sustainability, helping to conserve the environment and its resources and contributing to the circular bioeconomy."</p><p>The results of this work move Janaswamy one step closer to his dream of developing a bag made from a plastic-like material that will quickly decompose in the environment.</p><p>Funding for this research was provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the National Science Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Carla Rover once spent 30 minutes sobbing after having to restart a project she vibe coded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rover has been in the industry for 15 years, mainly working as a web developer. She’s now building a startup, alongside her son, that creates custom machine learning models for marketplaces.&nbsp;</p>







<p>She called vibe coding a beautiful, endless cocktail napkin on which one can perpetually sketch ideas. But dealing with AI-generated code that one hopes to use in production can be “worse than babysitting,” she said, as these AI models can mess up work in ways that are hard to predict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had turned to AI coding in a need for speed with her startup, as is the promise of AI tools.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“Because I needed to be quick and impressive, I took a shortcut and did not scan those files after the automated review,” she said. “When I did do it manually, I found so much wrong. When I used a third-party tool, I found more. And I learned my lesson.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She and her son wound up restarting their whole project — hence the tears. “I handed it off like the copilot was an employee,” she said. “It isn’t.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rover is like many experienced programmers turning to AI for coding help. But such programmers are also finding themselves acting like AI babysitters — rewriting and fact-checking the code the AI spits out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent report by content delivery platform company Fastly <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/senior-developers-ship-more-ai-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found that at least 95%</a> of the nearly 800 developers it surveyed said they spend extra time fixing AI-generated code, with the load of such verification falling most heavily on the shoulders of senior developers.</p>

<p>These experienced coders have discovered issues with AI-generated code ranging from hallucinating package names to deleting important information and security risks. Left unchecked, AI code can leave a product far more buggy than what humans would produce.</p>

<p>Working with AI-generated code has become such a problem that it’s given rise to a new corporate coding job known as “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7370912703231574016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vibe code cleanup specialist</a>.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>TechCrunch spoke to experienced coders about their time using AI-generated code about what they see as the future of vibe coding. Thoughts varied, but one thing remained certain: The technology still has a long way to go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Using a coding co-pilot is kind of like giving a coffee pot to a smart six-year-old and saying, ‘Please take this into the dining room and pour coffee for the family,’” Rover said.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Can they do it? Possibly. Could they fail? Definitely. And most likely, if they do fail, they aren’t going to tell you. “It doesn’t make the kid less clever,” she continued. “It just means you can’t delegate [a task] like that completely.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-you-re-absolutely-right-nbsp">“You’re absolutely right!”&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Feridoon Malekzadeh also compared vibe coding to a child.</p>

<p>He’s worked in the industry for more than 20 years, holding various roles in product development, software, and design. He’s building his own startup and heavily using vibe-coding platform Lovable, he said. For fun, he also vibe codes apps like one that generates Gen Alpha slang for Boomers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He likes that he’s able to work alone on projects, saving time and money, but agrees that vibe coding is not like hiring an intern or a junior coder. Instead, vibe coding is akin to “hiring your stubborn, insolent teenager to help you do something,” he told TechCrunch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“You have to ask them 15 times to do something,” he said. “In the end, they do some of what you asked, some stuff you didn’t ask for, and they break a bunch of things along the way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Malekzadeh estimates he spends around 50% of his time writing requirements, 10% to 20% of his time on vibe coding, and 30% to 40% of his time on vibe <em>fixing </em>— remedying the bugs and “unnecessary script” created by AI-written code.&nbsp;</p>







<p>He also doesn’t think vibe coding is the best at systems thinking — the process of seeing how a complex problem could impact an overall result. AI-generated code, he said, tries to solve more surface-level problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“If you’re creating a feature that should be broadly available in your product, a good engineer would create that once and make it available everywhere that it’s needed,” Malekzadeh said. “Vibe coding will create something five different times, five different ways, if it’s needed in five different places. It leads to a lot of confusion, not only for the user, but for the model.”</p>







<p>Meanwhile, Rover finds that AI “runs into a wall” when data conflicts with what it was hard-coded to do. “It can offer misleading advice, leave out key elements that are vital, or insert itself into a thought pathway you’re developing,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also found that rather than admit to making errors, it will manufacture results.</p>

<p>She shared another example with TechCrunch, where she questioned the results an AI model initially gave her. The model started to give a detailed explanation pretending it used the data she uploaded. Only when she called it out did the AI model confess. </p>

<p>“It freaked me out because it sounded like a toxic co-worker,” she said.</p>

<p>On top of this, there are the security concerns.</p>

<p>Austin Spires is the senior director of developer enablement at Fastly and has been coding since the early 2000s.&nbsp;</p>







<p>He’s found through his own experience — along with chatting with customers — that vibe code likes to build what is quick rather than what is “right.” This may introduce vulnerabilities to the code of the kind that very new programmers tend to make, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“What often happens is the engineer needs to review the code, correct the agent, and tell the agent that they made a mistake,” Spires told TechCrunch. “This pattern is why we’ve seen the trope of ‘you’re absolutely right’ appear over social media.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>He’s referring to how AI models, like Anthropic Claude, tend to respond “you’re absolutely right” when called out on their mistakes.</p>

<p>Mike Arrowsmith, the chief technology officer at the IT management software company NinjaOne, has been in software engineering and security for around 20 years. He said that vibe coding is creating a new generation of IT and security blind spots to which young startups in particular are susceptible.</p>

<p>“Vibe coding often bypasses the rigorous review processes that are foundational to traditional coding and crucial to catching vulnerabilities,” he told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>NinjaOne, he said, counters this by encouraging “safe vibe coding,” where approved AI tools have access controls, along with mandatory peer review and, of course, security scanning.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-the-new-normal">The new normal</h2>

<p>While nearly everyone we spoke to agrees that AI-generated code and vibe-coding platforms are useful in many situations — like mocking up ideas — they all agree that human review is essential before building a business on it.</p>

<p>“That cocktail napkin is not a business model,” Rover said. “You have to balance the ease with insight.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>But for all the lamenting on its errors, vibe coding has changed the present and the future of the job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rover said vibe coding helped her tremendously in crafting a better user interface. Malekzadeh simply said that, despite the time he spends fixing code, he still gets more done with AI coders than without them.</p>







<p>“‘Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress,” Malekzadeh said, quoting the French theorist Paul Virilio, who spoke about inventing the shipwreck along with the ship.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The pros far outweigh the cons.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The Fastly survey found that senior developers were twice as likely to put AI-generated code into production compared to junior developers, saying that the technology helped them work faster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vibe coding is also part of Spires’ coding routine. He uses AI coding agents on several platforms for both front-end and back-end personal projects. He called the technology a mixed experience but said it’s good in helping with prototyping, building out boilerplate, or scaffolding out a test; it removes menial tasks so that engineers can focus on building, shipping, and scaling products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems the extra hours spent combing through the vibe weeds will simply become a tolerated tax on using the innovation.</p>

<p>Elvis Kimara, a young engineer, is learning that now. He just graduated with a master’s in AI and is building an AI-powered marketplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many coders, he said vibe coding has made his job harder and has often found vibe coding a joyless experience.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“There’s no more dopamine from solving a problem by myself. The AI just figures it out,” he said. At one of his last jobs, he said senior developers didn’t look to help young coders as much&nbsp;— some not understanding new vibe-coding models, while others delegated mentorship tasks to said AI models.</p>

<p>But, he said, “the pros far outweigh the cons,” and he’s prepared to pay the innovation tax.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“We won’t just be writing code; we’ll be guiding AI systems, taking accountability when things break, and acting more like consultants to machines,” Kimara said of the new normal for which he’s preparing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Even as I grow into a senior role, I’ll keep using it,” he continued. “It’s been a real accelerator for me. I make sure I review every line of AI-generated code so I learn even faster from it.”</p>

      <p>Today we turned off our Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service, as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/05/ending-ocsp/">announced</a> in December of last year. We stopped including OCSP URLs in our certificates more than 90 days ago, so all Let’s Encrypt certificates that contained OCSP URLs have now expired. Going forward, we will publish revocation information exclusively via Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).</p>
<p>We ended support for OCSP primarily because it represents a considerable risk to privacy on the Internet. When someone visits a website using a browser or other software that checks for certificate revocation via OCSP, the Certificate Authority (CA) operating the OCSP responder immediately becomes aware of which website is being visited from that visitor’s particular IP address. Even when a CA intentionally does not retain this information, as is the case with Let’s Encrypt, it could accidentally be retained or CAs could be legally compelled to collect it. CRLs do not have this issue.</p>
<p>We are also taking this step because keeping our CA infrastructure as simple as possible is critical for the continuity of compliance, reliability, and efficiency at Let’s Encrypt. For every year that we have existed, operating OCSP services has taken up considerable resources that can soon be better spent on other aspects of our operations. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2022/09/07/new-life-for-crls/">Now that we support CRLs</a>, our OCSP service has become unnecessary.</p>
<p>At the height of our OCSP service’s traffic earlier this year, we handled approximately 340 billion OCSP requests per month. That’s more than 140,000 requests per second handled by our CDN, with 15,000 requests per second handled by our origin. We’d like to thank <a href="https://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a> for generously donating CDN services for OCSP to Let’s Encrypt for the past ten years.</p>

<p>I recently implemented a minimal proof of concept time-sharing operating system kernel on RISC-V. In this post, I’ll share the details of how this prototype works. The target audience is anyone looking to understand low-level system software, drivers, system calls, etc., and I hope this will be especially useful to students of system software and computer architecture.</p>
<p>This is a redo of an exercise I did for my undergraduate course in operating systems, and functionally it should resemble a typical operating systems project. However, this experiment focuses on modern tooling, as well as the modern architecture of RISC-V. RISC-V is an amazing technology that is easy to understand more quickly than other CPU architectures, while remaining a popular choice for many new systems, not just an educational architecture.</p>
<p>Finally, to do things differently here, I implemented this exercise in Zig, rather than traditional C. In addition to being an interesting experiment, I believe Zig makes this experiment much more easily reproducible on your machine, as it’s very easy to set up and does not require any installation (which could otherwise be slightly messy when cross-compiling to RISC-V).</p>

<p>The final code for this experiment is on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/popovicu/zig-time-sharing-kernel">here</a>. We’ll be referencing the code from it as we go.</p>
<p>GitHub should be the source of truth and may be slightly out of sync with the code below.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-reading">Recommended reading</h2>
<p>The basic fundamentals of computer engineering and specifically computer architecture are assumed. Specifically, knowledge of registers, how the CPU addresses memory, and interrupts is all necessary.</p>
<p>Before diving deep into this experiment, it’s recommended to also review the following background texts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/bare-metal-programming-risc-v">Bare metal programming on RISC-V</a></li>
<li><a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-sbi-and-full-boot-process">RISC-V boot process with SBI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-interrupts-with-timer-example/">RISC-V interrupts with a timer example</a></li>
<li><em>Optional</em> - <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/making-a-micro-linux-distro">Making a micro Linux distro</a> - mainly for the brief philosophy on the kernel / user space split</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="unikernel">Unikernel</h2>
<p>We’ll be developing a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel">unikernel</a>. Simply put, this setup links the application code directly with the OS kernel it depends on. Essentially, everything is bundled into a single binary executable, and the user code is loaded into memory alongside the kernel.</p>
<p>This bypasses the need to separately load the user code at runtime, which is a complex field in itself (involving linkers, loaders, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="sbi-layer">SBI layer</h2>
<p>RISC-V supports a layered permissions model. The system boots into machine mode (M), which is completely bare-metal, and then supports a couple of other less privileged modes. Please check the background texts for more details; below is a quick summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>M-mode can do pretty much anything; it is fully bare-metal.</li>
<li>In the middle is S-mode, supervisor, which typically hosts the operating system kernel.</li>
<li>At the bottom is U-mode, user, where application code runs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lower privilege levels can send requests to higher privilege levels.</p>
<p>We’ll assume that at the bottom of our software stack is an SBI layer, specifically OpenSBI. Please study <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-sbi-and-full-boot-process">this text</a> for the necessary background, as we’ll use the SBI layer to manage console printing and control the timer hardware. While manual implementation is possible, I wanted to add more value to this text by demonstrating a more portable approach with OpenSBI.</p>
<h2 id="goal-for-the-kernel">Goal for the kernel</h2>
<p>We want to support a few key features for simplicity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Statically define threads ahead of execution; i.e., dynamic thread creation is not supported. Additionally, for simplicity, threads are implemented as never-ending functions.</li>
<li>Threads operate in user mode and are able to send system calls to the kernel operating in S-mode.</li>
<li>Time is sliced and allocated among different threads. The system timer will be set to tick every couple of milliseconds, at which point a thread may be switched out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, development is targeted for a single-core machine.</p>
<h2 id="virtualization-and-what-exactly-is-a-thread">Virtualization and what exactly is a thread</h2>
<p>Before implementing threads, we should decide what they really are. The concept of threads in a time-sharing environment enables multiple workloads to run on a single core (as noted above, we’re focusing on single-core machines), while the programming model for each thread remains largely the same as if it were the sole software on the machine. This is a loose definition, which we will refine.</p>
<p>To understand time-sharing, let’s briefly consider its contrast: cooperative scheduling/threading. In cooperative scheduling/threading, a thread voluntarily yields CPU time to another workload. Eventually, the expectation is that another thread will yield control back to the first.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>function thread():</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_1();</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_2();</span></span>
<span><span>  YIELD();</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_3();</span></span>
<span><span>  YIELD();</span></span>
<span><span>  ...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>To be clear, this isn’t an “outdated” technique, despite being older. In fact, it’s alive and well in many modern programming languages and their runtimes (often abstracted from programmers). One good example is Go, which uses Goroutines to run multiple workloads on top of one operating system thread. While programmers don’t necessarily add explicit yield operations, the compiler and runtime can inject them into the workload.</p>
<p>Now, it should be clearer what it means for the programming model to remain largely the same in a time-sharing context. The thread would naturally look like this:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>function thread():</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_1();</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_2();</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_3();</span></span>
<span><span>  ...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>There are simply no explicit yield operations; instead, the kernel utilizes timers and interrupts to seamlessly switch between threads on the same core. This is precisely what we’ll implement in this experiment.</p>
<p>When multiple workloads run on the same resource, and each retains the same programming model as if it were the only workload, we can say the resource is virtualized. In other words, if we’re running 5 threads on the same core, each thread “feels” like it has its own core, effectively running on 5 little cores instead of 1 big core. More formally, each thread retains its own view of the core’s architectural registers (in RISC-V, <code>x0-x31</code> and some CSRs, more on this below) and… some memory! Let’s look deeper into that.</p>
<h3 id="the-stack-and-memory-virtualization">The stack and memory virtualization</h3>
<p>To begin, a thread has its own stack for reasons we’ll analyze shortly. The rest of the memory is “shared” with other threads, but this requires further investigation.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that hardware virtualization exists on a spectrum, rather than as a few rigid options. Here are some of the options for virtualization:</p>
<ol>
<li>Threads: virtualizes architectural registers and stacks, but not much else; i.e., different threads can share data elsewhere in memory.</li>
<li>Process: more heavyweight than threads, memory is virtualized such that each process “feels” like it has a dedicated CPU core and its own memory untouchable by other processes; additionally, a process houses multiple threads.</li>
<li>Container: virtualizes even more - each container has its own filesystem and potentially its own set of network interfaces; containers share the same kernel and underlying hardware.</li>
<li>VM: virtualizes everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many more shades in between, and each of these options likely has different subtypes. The point here is that all these approaches enable running different workloads with varying isolations, or more intuitively, different <em>views</em> of the machine and their environment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you examine the Linux kernel source code, you won’t find a construct explicitly called a <em>container</em>. What we popularly call containers isn’t a mechanism baked into the kernel, but rather <strong>a set of kernel mechanisms</strong> used together to form a specific view of the environment for our workload. For example, the <code>chroot</code> mechanism restricts filesystem visibility, while <code>cgroups</code> impose limits on workloads; together, these form what we call a container.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe (though don’t quote me on this) that the boundaries between threads and processes in Linux are somewhat blurred. To the best of my knowledge, both are implemented on top of <em>tasks</em> in the kernel, but when creating a task, the API allows different restrictions to be specified.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is all to say that we’re always defining a workload with varying restrictions on what it can see and access. When and why to apply different restrictions is a topic for another day. Many questions arise when writing an application, ranging from the difficulty of an approach to its security.</p>
<h3 id="virtualizing-a-thread">Virtualizing a thread</h3>
<p>In this experiment, we’ll implement minimal virtualization with very basic, time-sharing threads. Therefore, the goals are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The programming model for a thread should remain mostly untouched. As long as a thread doesn’t interact with memory contents used by other threads, its programming model should remain consistent, powered by time-sharing.</li>
<li>A thread should have its own protected view of architectural registers, including some RISC-V CSRs.</li>
<li>A thread should be assigned its own stack.</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be obvious why a thread needs its own view of the registers. If other threads could freely touch a thread’s registers, the thread wouldn’t be able to do any meaningful work. All (I believe) RISC-V instructions work with at least one register, so protecting a thread’s register view is essential.</p>
<p>Furthermore, assigning a private stack to a thread is necessary, though slightly less obvious. The answer is that different stacks are needed to manage different execution contexts. Namely, when a function is invoked, by convention, the stack is used to allocate function-private variables. Additionally, registers like <code>ra</code> can be pushed to the stack to retain the correct return address from a function (in case another function is invoked within it). In short, there are various reasons, per RISC-V convention, why the stack is needed to maintain the execution context. The details of RISC-V calling conventions will not be described here.</p>
<h3 id="interrupt-context">Interrupt context</h3>
<p>It’s crucial to understand how interrupt code runs and what it should consist of, as this mechanism will be heavily exploited to achieve seamless time-sharing between threads. For a detailed, practical example, please check out <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-interrupts-with-timer-example/">this past text</a>.</p>

<p>This assembly was obtained by writing a C function tagged as an S-level interrupt in RISC-V. With this tag, the GCC compiler knew how to generate the <em>prologue</em> and <em>epilogue</em> of the interrupt routine. The prologue preserves architectural registers on the stack, and the epilogue recovers them (in addition to specifically returning from S-mode). All of this was generated by correctly tagging the C function’s invoking convention.</p>
<p>This somewhat resembles function calling, and that’s essentially what it is. Interrupts can be thought of (in a very simplified sense) as functions invoked by some system effect. Consequently, utilized registers must be carefully preserved on the stack and then restored at the routine’s exit; otherwise, asynchronous interrupts like timer interrupts would randomly corrupt architectural register values, completely blocking any practical software from running!</p>
<h2 id="implementation-high-level">Implementation (high-level)</h2>
<p>We’ll explore the implementation by first describing the high-level idea and then digging into the code.</p>
<h3 id="leveraging-the-interrupt-stack-convention">Leveraging the interrupt stack convention</h3>
<p>Adding an interrupt is, in a way, already introducing a form of threading to your application code. In a system with a timer interrupt, the main application code runs, which can occasionally be interleaved with instances of timer interrupt invocations. The core jumps to this interrupt routine when the timer signals, and it carefully restores the architectural state before control flow returns to the “main thread”. There are two control flows running concurrently here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Main application code.</li>
<li>Repetitions of the interrupt routine.</li>
</ol>
<p>This interleaving of the timer interrupt can be leveraged to implement additional control flows, and the main idea is outlined below.</p>
<p>The core of the interrupt routine is sandwiched between the prologue and the epilogue. That’s where the interrupt is serviced before control returns to the main application thread by restoring registers from the stack.</p>
<p>However, <strong>why must we restore the registers from the same stack location</strong>? If our interrupt logic swaps the stack pointer to some other piece of memory, we’ll end up with a different set of architectural register values recovered, thus entering a whole different flow. In other words, we achieve a <strong>context switch</strong>, and this is precisely how it’s implemented in this experiment. We’ll see the code for it shortly.</p>
<h3 id="kerneluser-space-separation">Kernel/user space separation</h3>
<p>We can now delineate the kernel space and user space. With RISC-V, this naturally translates to kernel code running in supervisor (S) mode and user space code running in U-mode.</p>
<p>The machine boots into machine (M) mode, and since we want to leverage the SBI layer, we’ll allow OpenSBI to run there. Then, the kernel will perform some initial setup in S-mode before starting the U-mode execution of user space threads. Periodic timer interrupts will enable context switches, and the interrupt code will execute in S-mode. Finally, user threads will be able to make system calls to the kernel.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-code">Implementation (code)</h2>
<p>Please refer to the GitHub repository for the full code; we will only cover core excerpts below.</p>
<h3 id="assembly-startup">Assembly startup</h3>
<p>As usual, a short assembly snippet is needed to start our S-mode code and enter the “main program” in Zig. This is in <code>startup.S</code>.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>...</span></span>

<span><span>...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The rest of the assembly startup primarily involves cleaning up the BSS section and setting up the stack pointer for the initial kernel code.</p>
<h3 id="main-kernel-file-and-io-drivers">Main kernel file and I/O drivers</h3>
<p>We’ll now examine <code>kernel.zig</code>, which contains the <code>main</code> function.</p>
<p>First, we probe the OpenSBI layer for console capabilities. We’ll only consider running on a relatively recent version of OpenSBI (from the last few years) that includes console capability. Otherwise, the kernel will halt and report an error.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>export fn main() void {</span></span>

<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>        unreachable;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span></code></pre>
<p><code>main</code> is marked as <code>export</code> to conform to the C ABI.</p>
<p>Here, we have a lightweight implementation of a couple of I/O drivers. As you can see, writing can occur in one of two ways: either we go through the SBI layer (<code>sbi.zig</code>) or, if that fails, we use direct MMIO (<code>uart_mmio.zig</code>). The SBI method should theoretically be more portable, as it delegates output management details to the M-level layer (essentially what we do with MMIO), freeing us from concerns about exact memory space addresses.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly look at <code>sbi.zig</code>:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// Struct containing the return status of OpenSBI</span></span>
<span><span>pub const SbiRet = struct {</span></span>
<span><span>    sbi_error: isize,</span></span>

<span><span>};</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>pub fn debug_print(message: []const u8) SbiRet {</span></span>
<span><span>    var err: isize = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    var val: isize = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    const msg_ptr = @intFromPtr(message.ptr);</span></span>
<span><span>    const msg_len = message.len;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    asm volatile (</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv a0, %[len]</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv a1, %[msg]</span></span>
<span><span>        \\li a2, 0</span></span>
<span><span>        \\li a6, 0x00</span></span>
<span><span>        \\li a7, 0x4442434E</span></span>
<span><span>        \\ecall</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv %[err], a0</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv %[val], a1</span></span>
<span><span>        : [err] "=r" (err),</span></span>
<span><span>          [val] "=r" (val),</span></span>
<span><span>        : [msg] "r" (msg_ptr),</span></span>
<span><span>          [len] "r" (msg_len),</span></span>
<span><span>        : .{ .x10 = true, .x11 = true, .x12 = true, .x16 = true, .x17 = true, .memory = true });</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    return SbiRet{</span></span>
<span><span>        .sbi_error = err,</span></span>
<span><span>        .value = val,</span></span>
<span><span>    };</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is very straightforward; we’re simply performing the system call exactly as described in the OpenSBI documentation. Note that when I first wrote this code, I wasn’t fully familiar with Zig’s error handling capabilities, hence the somewhat non-idiomatic error handling.</p>
<p>However, this can be considered a first driver in this kernel, as it directly manages output to the device.</p>
<p>Next is <code>uart_mmio.zig</code>:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// UART MMIO address (standard for QEMU virt machine)</span></span>
<span><span>pub const UART_BASE: usize = 0x10000000;</span></span>
<span><span>pub const UART_TX: *volatile u8 = @ptrFromInt(UART_BASE);</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>// Direct UART write function (fallback when SBI is not available)</span></span>
<span><span>pub fn uart_write_string(message: []const u8) void {</span></span>
<span><span>    for (message) |byte| {</span></span>
<span><span>        UART_TX.* = byte;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is straightforward and self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Returning to <code>kernel.zig</code> and the <code>main</code> function, we create 3 user threads, each printing a slightly different message (the thread ID is the varying bit). At this point, the kernel setup is almost complete.</p>
<p>The final steps involve setting up and running the timer interrupt. Once that is done, kernel code will only run when the timer interrupts the system or when user space code requests a system call.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>interrupts.setup_s_mode_interrupt(&amp;s_mode_interrupt_handler);</span></span>
<span><span>_ = timer.set_timer_in_near_future();</span></span>
<span><span>timer.enable_s_mode_timer_interrupt();</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We could request a context switch immediately, but for simplicity, we’ll wait until the timer activates and begins the actual work in the system.</p>
<h3 id="s-mode-handler-and-the-context-switch">S-mode handler and the context switch</h3>
<p>While the Zig compiler could generate the adequate prologue and epilogue for our S-mode handler, we will do it manually. The reason is that we also want to capture some CSRs in the context that otherwise wouldn’t have been captured by the generated routine.</p>
<p>That’s why we use the <code>naked</code> calling convention in Zig. This forces us to write the entire function in assembly, though a quick escape hatch to this limitation is to call a Zig function whenever Zig logic is needed.</p>
<p>I won’t copy paste the whole prologue and epilogue here because they are very similar to what was done in the previous C experiment with RISC-V interrupts. Instead, I’ll just focus on the bit that is different:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>...</span></span>

<span><span>...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, a couple more registers were added to the prologue and epilogue in addition to the core architectural registers.</p>
<p>Next, within this prologue/epilogue sandwich, we invoke the <code>handle_kernel</code> Zig function. This routes to the correct logic based on whether the interrupt source is a synchronous system call from user space or an asynchronous timer interrupt. The reason is that we land in the same S-level interrupt routine regardless of the interrupt source, and then we inspect the <code>scause</code> CSR for details.</p>
<p>To successfully work with the <code>handle_kernel</code> function, we need to be aware of the assembly-level calling conventions. This function takes a single integer parameter and returns a single integer parameter. Since the function signature is small, it works as simply as this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sole function parameter is passed through the <code>a0</code> architectural register.</li>
<li>The same register also holds the function’s result upon return.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is pretty easy. Let’s quickly look at the signature of this function:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>export fn handle_kernel(current_stack: usize) usize {</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>It is slightly awkward but gets the job done. The input to this Zig logic is the stack top before invoking the Zig logic (which inevitably leads to some data added to the stack). The function’s output is where the stack top should be <em>after</em> the Zig logic is done. If it differs from the input, then we’re performing a context switch. If it’s the same, the same workload thread will continue running after the interrupt.</p>
<p>The rest of the logic is very simple. It inspects the interrupt source (system call from user space or timer interrupt) and performs accordingly.</p>
<p>In the case of a timer interrupt, a context switch is performed. The <code>schedule</code> function from <code>scheduling.zig</code> is invoked, and it potentially returns the other stack we should switch to:</p>

<p>The code from the <code>thread</code> module is very simple, serving as boilerplate for a basic queue that manages structs representing threads. I won’t copy it here, as it’s mostly AI-generated. It is important to note, however, that the stacks are statically allocated in memory, and the maximum number of running threads is hardcoded.</p>
<p>The <code>thread</code> module also includes logic for setting up a new thread. This is where data is pushed onto the stack before the thread even runs. If you wonder why, it’s because when returning from the S-level trap handler, we need <em>something</em> on the stack to indicate where to go. The initial data does precisely that. We can seed the initial register values here as desired. In fact, in this experiment, we demonstrate passing a single integer parameter to the thread function by seeding the <code>a0</code> register value (per calling convention) on the stack, which the thread function can then use immediately.</p>
<h3 id="the-user-space-threads">The user space threads</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll bundle the user space and kernel space code into a single binary blob to avoid dynamic loading, linking, and other complexities. Hence, our user space code consists of regular functions:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>/// Example: Create a simple idle thread</span></span>
<span><span>pub fn createPrintingThread(thread_number: usize) !*Thread {</span></span>
<span><span>    const thread = allocThread() orelse return error.NoFreeThreads;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    // Idle thread just spins</span></span>
<span><span>    const print_fn = struct {</span></span>
<span><span>        fn print(thread_arg: usize) noreturn {</span></span>
<span><span>            while (true) {</span></span>
<span><span>                var buffer: [256]u8 = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>                const content = std.fmt.bufPrint(&amp;buffer, "Printing from thread ID: {d}\n", .{thread_arg}) catch {</span></span>
<span><span>                    continue;</span></span>
<span><span>                };</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>                syscall.debug_print(content);</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>                // Simulate a delay</span></span>
<span><span>                var i: u32 = 0;</span></span>
<span><span>                while (i &lt; 300000000) : (i += 1) {</span></span>
<span><span>                    asm volatile ("" ::: .{ .memory = true }); // Memory barrier to prevent optimization</span></span>
<span><span>                }</span></span>
<span><span>            }</span></span>
<span><span>            unreachable;</span></span>
<span><span>        }</span></span>
<span><span>    }.print;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    initThread(thread, @intFromPtr(&amp;print_fn), thread_number);</span></span>
<span><span>    return thread;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Additionally, as mentioned above, we pre-seeded the stack such that when <code>a0</code> is recovered from the stack upon the first interrupt return for a given thread, the function argument will be picked up. That’s how the <code>print</code> function accesses the <code>thread_arg</code> value and uses it in its logic.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the user/kernel boundary, we have <code>syscall.debug_print(content);</code>. This conceptually behaves more or less as <code>printf</code> from <code>stdio.h</code> in C. It performs prepares the arguments to the kernel and runs a system call with these arguments which should lead to some content getting printed on the output device. Here’s what the printing library looks like (from <code>syscall.zig</code>):</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// User-level debug_print function</span></span>
<span><span>pub fn debug_print(message: []const u8) void {</span></span>
<span><span>    const msg_ptr = @intFromPtr(message.ptr);</span></span>
<span><span>    const msg_len = message.len;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    // Let's say syscall number 64</span></span>
<span><span>    // a7 = syscall number</span></span>
<span><span>    // a0 = message pointer</span></span>
<span><span>    // a1 = message length</span></span>
<span><span>    asm volatile (</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv a0, %[msg]</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv a1, %[len]</span></span>
<span><span>        \\li a7, 64</span></span>
<span><span>        \\ecall</span></span>
<span><span>        :</span></span>
<span><span>        : [msg] "r" (msg_ptr),</span></span>
<span><span>          [len] "r" (msg_len),</span></span>
<span><span>        : .{ .x10 = true, .x11 = true, .x17 = true, .memory = true });</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    // Ignore return value for simplicity</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>System call 64 is served from the S-mode handler in <code>kernel.zig</code>. This is self-explanatory, and we won’t go into further details here.</p>
<h3 id="running-the-kernel">Running the kernel</h3>
<p>We will deploy the kernel on bare-metal, specifically on a virtual machine. In theory, this should also work on a real machine, provided an SBI layer is present when the kernel starts, and the linker script, I/O “drivers,” and other machine-specific constants are adapted.</p>
<p>To build, we simply run</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-sbi-and-full-boot-process">previous text on OpenSBI</a> for details on building OpenSBI. It is strongly recommended to use a freshly built OpenSBI, as QEMU may use an outdated version if no <code>-bios</code> flag is passed.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many educational OS kernels exist, but this experiment combines RISC-V, OpenSBI, and Zig, offering a fresh perspective compared to traditional C implementations.</p>
<p>The resulting code runs on a QEMU virtual machine, which can be easily set up, even by building QEMU from source.</p>
<p>To keep the explanation concise, error reporting was kept minimal. Should you modify the code and require debugging, sufficient clues are provided, despite some areas where the code is simplified (e.g., anonymous results after SBI print invocations like <code>_ = ...</code>). Much of the code in this example was AI-generated by Claude to save time, and it should function as intended. While some parts of the code are simplified, such as stack space over-allocation, these do not detract from the experiment’s educational value.</p>
<p>Overall, this experiment serves as a starting point for studying operating systems, assuming a foundational understanding of computer engineering and computer architecture. It likely has plenty of flaws for a practical application, but for now, we’re just hacking here!</p>
<p>I hope this was a useful exploration.</p>

<p>Say you’re a senior member of your team at work. You’re 12 minutes late to the weekly staff Zoom. Once you’ve “joined audio,” the first thing you hear is your old friend’s voice. “There you are! So glad you could fit us in.” You laugh and explain the disastrous traffic, difficult drop-off at your kids’ school, or whatever it was that messed up your morning. The moment passes and the conversation moves on. You turn to the job at hand, focused and ready to go.</p>



<p>But what if you’re a junior staffer, still feeling your way. Same thing happens: You’re 12 minutes late to the weekly staff Zoom. Once you’ve “joined audio,” the first thing you hear is the boss’s voice. “There you are! So glad you could fit us in.” A few colleagues chuckle. You consider making excuses—about traffic, drop-off, whatever it was—but the moment passes, and the conversation moves on.</p>

<p>Your mind doesn’t, though. It’s still ruminating. <em>Was that snark in my boss’s voice? Were they talking about me before I logged on? Do I fit in here? Am I any good at this job? </em>You might not be fully aware of these questions. Your mind works quickly on multiple tracks at the same time. And those questions are nasty; they threaten your sense of belonging, your worth, and your value, at least at work. So you try to push them away, to suppress them. But they’re still there. And once they’ve been triggered, it might feel like the evidence keeps pouring in.</p>



<p>Someone makes an inside joke in the chat. You don’t get it. <em>I don’t belong here. </em>Someone rolls their eyes while you’re talking. <em>They don’t respect me.</em> The boss ignores you for the rest of the meeting. <em>No one sees me.</em> Again, these thoughts may not be fully conscious. But there’s no mistaking the fact that your motivation to get back to work has waned by the time you log off. What was it you were supposed to look into?</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Was that snark in my boss’s voice? Were they talking about me before I logged on? Do I fit in here? Am I any good at this job?</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Next thing you know, you’re idly messing around online when a text comes in from the person who rolled their eyes. “You okay? You seemed out of it at the meeting.” You ignore it. But your mind doesn’t. It’s busy composing possible replies. The full spectrum from passive-aggressive to career imperiling. Eventually you pick up your phone. What will you text back?</p>



<p>This is how self-defeating spirals start and how they gather speed. Let’s break down the moving parts:</p>



<ol start="1">
<li>A circumstance places a big question on the table—about identity, belonging, or adequacy: <em>You’re new at work. You want to succeed and belong, but you wonder . . . </em>That question looms, latent and inactive, but present.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2">
<li>A “bad” thing happens: <em>Your boss is a little snarky.</em></li>
</ol>



<ol start="3">
<li>That question gets triggered: <em>You read the room for answers, drawing negative inferences from ambiguous evidence. You’re distracted from the task at hand. Your pessimistic hypothesis becomes more entrenched.</em></li>
</ol>



<ol start="4">
<li>You act on that pessimistic hypothesis, making matters worse.</li>
</ol>



<p>Maybe you send that colleague a snarky text back. And what do you know: When you see them a few days later, they’re cold to you.</p>



<p>Now you aren’t talking. Maybe you flub that assignment your boss gave you, and they lose confidence in you. Fast-forward a year and you’re at a new job. Tensions are emerging with the new coworkers. Or are they? How will this story end? Do you have any control over it?</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>When a core question is unsettled, it functions like a lens through which you see the world.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yes, you do. We all do. Negative spirals or feedback loops like these aren’t inevitable. In fact, there are small things we can do both for ourselves and for others to nip them in the bud—and prevent catastrophic outcomes months and years into the future. Better yet, there are ways we can launch positive spirals—dramatically increasing our chances of future happiness, success, and flourishing. The very same processes can either propel us upward or pull us down.</p>



<p>To understand how all this is possible, let’s get more precise about sequences like 1–4 above. There are three key concepts at play: “core questions” (number 1), meaning making or “construal” (numbers 2 and 3), and “calcification” (number 4). Think of these as “the three Cs” of spirals—whether positive or negative.</p>

<p><strong>Core questions. </strong>There are the fundamental questions all of us face, at one time or another. For example: <em>Who am I? Do I belong? Am I enough?</em> I think of these questions as “defining” because they help define you and your life: your sense of self, what relationships you’ll have, and whether you’ll be able to do and be the things you aspire to. There might be long stretches when you don’t think about a given question much because it’s settled for you then. But at critical junctures specific questions flare up, unsettle and preoccupy you. Then they begin to shape what you see and how you act.</p>



<p><strong>Construal. </strong>It’s natural to think that we have an unfiltered view of the world. That light hits your eyes and you just see what’s out there. But it’s more that we read the world, interpret it, drawing inferences based on what’s already in our heads. We pick up on themes that seem relevant or important to us, not noticing or screening out other details.</p>



<p>A friend once told me of an ingenious class demonstration that helped her begin to understand this process. A professor split the class in two and then spoke to the first half alone, telling them of his love for travel and a recent trip to Libya. Next, he spoke to the second half about shopping and how hard it was to find the right size shoe. Last, he brought the class together and said a single word. He asked the students to write it down. Students in the first group wrote, “Tripoli.” Those in the second wrote, “Triple E.”</p>



<p>Construal is like a kind of focus. As you look out at the social scene, what snaps to attention? If you’re anything like me, one of the most powerful guides is whatever could pose a risk to you, could threaten you. If you’re walk­ing through a forest where a tiger is said to prowl, you might hear that tiger in every rustle of leaves, see it in every sway of reeds. But in the social world, we don’t all face the same threats. That’s why when you’re new at work and nervous about your place you might hear snark in your boss’s voice, but not if it’s your old friend.</p>



<p>When a core question is unsettled for a person, it functions like a lens through which you see the world. We seek answers that can help us resolve that question. <em>Is it true?</em> we ask. <em>Are my doubts and fears well founded? </em>Then, if a “bad” thing happens, it can seem like proof of your negative hypothesis. We aren’t neutral observers on the lookout for evidence one way or the other. We’re in the grip of confirmation bias, attuned to evidence that corroborates our preconceived theory, even if it’s the tiniest thing.</p>



<p><strong>Calcification. </strong>Calcification happens when our negative thoughts and feelings get entrenched—often as a consequence of our own actions. You have a bad date and think, <em>Am I unlovable? Will I be alone forever? </em>Pretty soon your next date isn’t going well either. Rinse and repeat long enough, and you’re stuck in a romantic rut.</p>



<p>When you start to look, you can see spirals everywhere. You fail an important math test. You think you can’t succeed, and stop going to class. You feel sick from a treatment designed to help you overcome an illness. You think it means your illness is especially strong and resistant and so avoid treatment. You have a fight with your kids. You think you’re a “bad parent,” and then yell at them even more the next time. This is self-sabotage, and one step at a time it costs us our achievements, our health, our relationships, and our well-being.</p>



<p><strong>Spiraling up</strong></p>



<p>Yet if our struggles arise, in part, from the inferences we draw, we have an opportunity. In my work, my colleagues and I identify early moments where people could go one way or the other. By understanding the questions that come up at critical junctures, we can offer people better ways to think through challenges—ways that can help them spiral up, instead of down. </p>



<p>That’s what we call “wise” interventions: graceful ways to offer people good answers to the questions that define our lives. It sure can seem like magic that 21 minutes could <a href="https://www.gregorywalton.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/finkelslotterluchieswaltongross_psci.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve marriage</a> a year later; that a one-page letter could <a href="https://www.gregorywalton.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/waltonokonofuaetal_2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep kids out of jail</a>; that a string of postcards could <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.52.6.828" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut suicide rates by half</a> over two years; or that an hour-long <a href="https://www.gregorywalton.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/bradycohenjarviswalton2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reflection on belonging</a> in the first year of college could improve life satisfaction and career success a decade later. But this—this is ordinary magic.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Negative spirals or feedback loops aren’t inevitable. There are things we can do both for ourselves and for others to nip them in the bud</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In my first year of college, I was biking back through campus one lovely fall day when I saw a large group of fellow students gathered enthusiastically around a truck from the California burger chain In-N-Out. Maybe they craved a taste of home. But in Michigan, where I was from, there are no In-N-Outs. I’d never heard of it. Feeling excluded from the burger party, I biked off in a huff to eat my lunch in the dining hall alone. I remember thinking, I’m not standing in line for a burger!</p>



<p>What was my problem?</p>



<p>As an 18-year-old, I certainly didn’t want to think of myself as feeling that I did not belong in college. And I definitely didn’t want to think that an In-N-Out truck could trigger that feeling. How ridiculous that would be. Who thinks they don’t belong because of a burger truck?</p>



<p>It was ridiculous. After my brother experienced a particularly mysterious romantic disaster, it’s something we christened a “tifbit”—tiny fact, big theory. Of course not knowing about In-N-Out didn’t mean I didn’t belong in college. But that’s the point. For looking back now, I know the truth is I was homesick. I felt so far from home and all the people I knew and loved. So I wondered, <em>Will I make friends in California? Will I fit in?</em> Seeing all those classmates crowded together, eager to get lunch from a place I’d never even heard of, just triggered those anxieties.</p>



<p>With wisdom and kindness and a little distance, we can laugh at ourselves in situations like these. But we should pay attention. For beneath every tifbit is a real question, and it’s almost always a reasonable one. Big responses to small experiences can help us see what lies beneath the surface. For a tifbit is never just a tiny fact. It’s a clue to the bigger questions that define our lives.</p>



<p>With a little prompt, I could have known that almost everyone feels homesick at first in college, that we’re all in some sense far from home, even the kids from California, that everyone was trying to find new communities. Maybe then I would have joined the line at the In-N-Out truck. I could have asked someone to tell me what In-N-Out was. Why do they love it? What is “animal style”?</p>



<p>I’m sure they would have been glad to share. I know I would have had a better lunch. And maybe I would have made a friend, too.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-node="flmx62i75nea">
	<p><span>Washington, D.C.</span> — </p><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it will no longer defend rules that protect people from unsafe levels of PFAS “forever chemicals” in drinking water, seeking to reverse legal protections put into place last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://earthjustice.org/document/epa-motion-for-partial-vacatur-in-pfas-case">In its motion filed in federal court yesterday</a>, EPA asked the court to axe its determinations to regulate and enforceable standards for four PFAS chemicals – GenX, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFBS. Separately, EPA previously announced that it will seek to extend the compliance deadline for PFOA and PFOS standards by two years from 2029 to 2031. PFAS have contaminated the drinking water for approximately <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00713">200 million people nationwide</a>.</p>
<p>Environmental lawyers said EPA’s course of action is an attempt to evade limits that Congress imposed on the agency. The Safe Drinking Water Act has a strong anti-backsliding provision that prohibits the EPA from weakening any drinking water standard once it is set. In essence, EPA is asking the court to do what EPA itself is not allowed to do.</p>
<p>“Administrator Zeldin promised to protect the American people from PFAS-contaminated drinking water, but he’s doing the opposite,” said <strong>Katherine O’Brien, Earthjustice attorney</strong>. “Zeldin’s plan to delay and roll back the first national limits on these forever chemicals prioritizes chemical industry profits and utility companies’ bottom-line over the health of children and families across the country.”</p>
<p>“The EPA’s request to jettison rules intended to keep drinking water safe from toxic PFAS forever chemicals is an attempted end-run around the protections that Congress placed in the Safe Drinking Water Act. It is also alarming, given what we know about the health harms caused by exposure to these chemicals. No one wants to drink PFAS. We will continue to defend these common-sense, lawfully enacted standards in court,” said <strong>Jared Thompson, a senior attorney with NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council)</strong>.</p>
<p>Earthjustice is representing the following community groups: Buxmont Coalition for Safe Water, Clean Cape Fear, Clean Haw River, Concerned Citizens of WMEL Water Authority Grassroots, Environmental Justice Task Force, Fight for Zero, Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water, and Newburgh Clean Water Project. Working alongside NRDC,<a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/community-members-condemn-epas-lack-of-drinking-water-protections"> the organizations have intervened to defend the nation’s first-ever drinking water standards for PFAS</a> in ongoing litigation brought by chemical companies and water utility associations, who are asking the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., to overturn the standards.</p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong>:</h2>
<p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-to-know-about-pfas">PFAS</a>) are a class of thousands of synthetic chemicals that are widely used in an array of consumer, commercial, and industrial products due to their ability to withstand heat and repel water and stains. Also known as “forever chemicals,” PFAS are extremely persistent in the environment and can accumulate in humans or animals. PFAS exposure is linked to many negative health effects at extremely low levels of exposure, including but not limited to kidney and testicular cancer, liver and kidney damage, changes in hormone and lipid levels, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.</p>
<p>After decades of advocacy on the part of environmental and public health advocates, the EPA proposed in March 2023 to regulate six PFAS chemicals in drinking water. PFAS can be removed from drinking water with existing technologies. In April 2024, the agency concluded there is no safe level of PFOA or PFOS exposure, and the <a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2024/epa-finalizes-first-drinking-water-standards-for-toxic-pfas">final rule</a> covered six PFAS chemicals in total, and set individual limits for five PFAS chemicals and a limit on mixtures of four PFAS chemicals. The rule also requires water systems to monitor for the six regulated PFAS chemicals and publicly communicate their compliance with the new limits, while giving them the law’s maximum compliance time of five years to comply by April 2029. The rule was a long overdue step to address a public health crisis that threatens millions of people nationwide.</p>

    <p>I read to forget. Even when studying or working on papers for a PhD, I approach texts with the same mindset: I'm not a storage device that needs to save all bits of information. I am more of a system of Bayesian beliefs, constantly evolving and updating in small, incremental steps.</p>
<p>I remember co-workers highlighting large chunks of text, sometimes 40%. That doesn't make sense to me. We can only read a text once, given the number of compelling works and the limited time available to us.
So, I read to forget. When I start reading, I'm prepared to lose 98% of what's in front of me. From most texts, I only want two things: First, I want it to subtly alter my thinking, an incremental update that moves me towards a refined world model. Second, I want to pull out a few key pieces of information that I might use later in my writing. For instance, if I come across a well-written methodology section in a paper, I’ll save that.
Reading should stimulate my thinking and produce new ideas. I've found myself reading a paper, pausing midway, and immediately experimenting with some variation of the algorithm described, leading to new ideas or even a new paper.</p>
<p>If a non-fiction text doesn't spark new thoughts or actions, it may not even be worthwhile reading. Anything beyond that clutters my note-taking system. You can't possibly keep track of everything, nor can you work with hoarded pieces of information.</p>

But mechanisms on the effect of psychological disorder on cognitive function is inconclusive. Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a core symptom of a number of common psychological disorders and may be a modifiable process shared by many psychological risk factors that contribute to the development of cognitive impairment. RNT may increase the risk of cognitive impairment. However, there are fewer studies related to RNT and cognitive function, and there is a lack of epidemiological studies to explore the relationship between RNT and cognitive function.</p><h3 data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>A cross-sectional study of 424 older adults aged 60 years or over was performed form May to November 2023 in hospital. To investigate the RNT level by using the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ), and investigate the cognitive function level by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA). Multivariable linear regression and subgroup analyses were used to explore the relationship between RNT and cognitive function.</p><h3 data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>We categorized the total RNT scores into quartiles. The multivariable linear regression analysis showed that after adjusting for all covariates, the participants in the Q3 and Q4 groups exhibited lower cognition scores (Q3:β = -0.180, 95%CI -2.849~-0.860; Q4:β = -0.164, 95% -2.611~-0.666) compared to the Q1 group. The results of the subgroup analyses showed that individuals aged 60 ~ 79 years, junior high school and above are more prone to suffer from cognitive impairment with a high RNT score.</p><h3 data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusion</h3><p>The study reveals a negative association between RNT and cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults. However, multi-center and a longer time span cohort studies on the relationship between RNT and cognitive function should be carried out to further explore the mechanisms involved.</p></div></div>

Consistent with previous studies, our data demonstrates that higher level of RNT is related to worsecognitive function. In addition to this, this study found RNT was associated with cognitive domains except language skills. When participants were stratified by age and education level, a notable negative correlation was observed between RNT and cognitive function among older adults aged 60~69 years or junior high school and above. There are reasons why RNT does not correlate with cognitive function in older adults who are 80 to 90 years of age or have elementary school or below as follows. Increased brain aging in this age group may have altered the relationship between cognition and mood, or it may have weakened the association. The limited ability of older adults with low education level to perceive and express RNT resulted in a non-significant correlation between RNT and cognitive function.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms linking psychological disorder to cognitive function remain vague. One study found that increased level of RNT was closely related to gray and white matter structures in the brain, particularly in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, the arcuate fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 31" title="Demnitz-King H, Göehre I, Marchant NL.

Increased level of RNT may lead to changes in the brain’s structural functions related to cognitive control, leading to further cognitive decline.

RNT as a common trait of many types of psychology disorder, can be initiated and maintained without external triggers or awareness and narrows the scope of attention to repeatedly activated negative thoughts, thus provoking the individual to repeatedly experience physical and psychological distress, leading to the onset of psychology disorders, which in turn may increase the risk of cognitive impairment.

Firstly, in examining the association between RNT and cognitive function, the study eliminated as many bias-inducing factors as possible to ensure more reliable results through previous research and by conducting in-depth analyses that took into account a variety of possible potential confounders. Secondly, the study investigated the relationship between RNT and cognitive function through regression and subgroup analysis suggesting a negative association between RNT and cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults. In the future, the assessment of mental health can be incorporated into the health screening of older adults to comprehensively evaluate their health status. Health professionals and carers can enhance the assessment of RNT in older adults and identify problems promptly. By developing interventions to avoid further exacerbation of psychological problems in the elderly and increased risk of other diseases such as cognitive impairment.</p><p>However, there were limitations in the present study. First, a definitive causal relationship between RNT and cognitive function could not determine in this study since this study was a cross-sectional design. Secondly, since convenience sampling method was used in this study and all the participants in our study were selected only from Wuchan District and Hongshan District in Wuhan city, which suffered short time span, small sample size, and bad representativeness. In the future, multi-center and a longer time span cohort studies on the relationship between RNT and cognitive function should be carried out to further explore the mechanisms involved. Nonetheless, these findings have implications that are crucial to interventions that promote cognitive function in older adults.</p></div></div><div id="Sec14-section" data-title="Conclusion"><h2 id="Sec14">Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between RNT and cognitive function in Chinese older adults. After adjusting for a range of confounders, RNT is associated with cognitive function decline in older adults. The assessment of RNT levels in older adults can be enhanced, and psychological interventions and other measures can be taken to reduce RNT levels and further prevent cognitive decline.</p></div>

  In the contaminated area around Fukushima, Japan, scientists are studying the impact of radioactivity on the cognitive abilities of pollinating insects such as honeybees and giant hornets.       </p><div>
      
  <p><span><span>Bees and hornets are known to have a wide range of cognitive skills, including the ability to recognise colours and navigate in space. However, pollution by substances released into the environment by humans, such as pesticides, can impair their performance.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Olivier Armant, from the radionuclide ecology and ecotoxicology laboratory at the French ASNR nuclear safety and radiation protection authority, and Mathieu Lihoreau, an ethologist from the Research Centre on Animal Cognition at the Centre for Integrative Biology<a id="footnoteref1_022ysiz" title="CRCA-CBI (CNRS / Université de Toulouse III – Paul Sabatier - EPE)." href="#footnote1_022ysiz">1</a> wondered what effect ionising radiation might have on these pollinators. Armant works on the ecological impact of such radiation, carrying out long-term studies on the fauna and flora around Chernobyl (currently inaccessible, due to the war in Ukraine) and <span><a href="https://news.cnrs.fr/articles/learning-from-the-fukushima-decontamination">Fukushima, Japan,</a></span> while Lihoreau focuses on <span>bee intelligence</span> and the factors that may interfere with it.</span></span></p>
<h2><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Assessing cognitive performance</span></span></span></span></span></h2>
<p><span><span> <em>"A few years ago, a researcher in my lab came up with the idea of deploying various types of sensor to monitor, preferably automatically, the biological activity of certain species in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster," </em>Armant explains. "<em>We had three projects in mind: connected nest boxes, a system that measured the biotic parameters of water and – the one we chose – the method developed by Mathieu Lihoreau."&nbsp;</em><a id="footnoteref2_ky8e4dl" title="This work is the result of a joint call for projects between the CNRS, via its Mission for Transversal and Interdisciplinary Initiatives (MITI), and the former IRSN institute of radiation protection and nuclear safety, which has since merged with the ASN nuclear safety authority, forming the ASNR." href="#footnote2_ky8e4dl">2</a> For several years, the ethologist has been working on an automated system to assess the cognitive performance of these social insects. The device they use was designed in partnership with the Toulouse-based start-up BeeGuard, which manufactures connected beehives that enable real-time monitoring.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><em>"I study the learning and memory abilities of bees," </em>Lihoreau explains. <em>"Although this is primarily a fundamental research topic, it also has very concrete applications in ecotoxicology: if bees exhibit learning deficits in certain locations, it means there's a problem. For example, although many pesticides are used in doses that are low enough not to kill these insects, they end up as residues in the nectar they feed on and can have a neurotoxic effect. This results in cognitive disturbances that are difficult to observe, such as the inability to associate a reward with a specific colour or smell. Our system can measure these effects, which, although not lethal, are nonetheless serious, because they have a knock-on effect on the survival of colonies and, more generally, on pollination services."</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When disturbed in this way, bees begin to forage on flowers of different species, instead of focusing on just one. As a result, they no longer bring the right pollen to the right plants, which affects the entire ecosystem. The device developed by Lihoreau's team (made up of biologists, engineers, modellers and ecologists) had until now only been tested near Toulouse (southwestern France), rather than in the extreme conditions of an area like Fukushima, which the scientists were able to enter with the help of their Japanese colleagues.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"<em>We started collaborating with Japan just after the Fukushima disaster, in 2011,"</em><em> </em>Armant explains.<em> "We work in particular with Fukushima University's Institute of Environmental Radioactivity (IER), which help us to access the contaminated area. Our Japanese colleagues have extensive knowledge of the site and its forests, and they were able to direct us to the most interesting locations. This enabled us to carry out two field investigations in 2023 and 2024."</em></span></span></p>
<h2><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">How do you go about testing bees?</span></span></span></span></span></h2>
<p><span><span>The sites where the beehives were set up<a id="footnoteref3_wlqsdsc" title="As part of the BEERAD project to assess the effects of ionising radiation on bees, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR)." href="#footnote3_wlqsdsc">3</a> were selected on the basis of the soil contamination gradient for caesium-137. Local hornets, already present on the sites, were also included in the cognition study. Although it isn't clear whether these species are pollinators, they are worth studying, as they are descended from many generations of insects exposed to radiation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But just how do you carry out cognitive tests on an insect? <em>"The system is based on conventional experimental protocols developed in the laboratory over the past 50 years," </em>Lihoreau says. It uses a Y-shaped maze, in which the insect can choose between two branches illuminated by coloured LEDs, either blue or yellow. The insect needs to understand that it will be rewarded with sugar water, dispensed by a pump at the end of the branch, only if it chooses the right colour (blue or yellow, depending on the tests).</span></span></p>

</div>
  </div>
<p><span><span>A healthy bee needs 10 tests on average to find the correct path by following the right colours. <em>"This figure enables us to establish learning curves, which can then be compared to see if there is an impact on their ability to solve the problem," </em>Lihoreau adds.</span></span></p>
<h2><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Bees equipped with a QR Code</span></span></span></span></span></h2>
<p><span><span>The protocol used at Fukushima is automated. Each bee is equipped with a 2-mm-wide QR Code which is read by a camera, activating the opening of the maze. This customisation makes it possible to test the learning process of each insect, whose behaviour is filmed, analysed and sent in real time to a server. The whole operation is powered by solar panels.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Giant hornets, which are too big to enter the system, were tested manually in more traditional mazes. <em>"Our Japanese colleagues initially tried to dissuade us from handling them, because they are so dangerous," </em>Lihoreau recalls. <em>"However, the hornets are extremely useful for understanding the environmental impact of radioactive contamination, because these predators are at the top of the food chain and, unlike our honeybees, have always been present in the area, since well before the nuclear accident."</em></span></span></p>

          </div><div id="llista_com">
            <div id="com_Alicante"> 
                <h5>Alicante</h5>
                <p>Alicante's rapid transit system is called TRAM, which is a train-tram and is operated by FGV, owned by the Valencian regional government. This system has an underground line in the city center, with three stations on it. The layout consists with one or two mezzanines on level -1 and two side or one island platforms at level -2. Luceros and Mercado stations have direct connection with the underground parking lots, which are located above the TRAM tunnel.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Amsterdam"> 
                <h5>Amsterdam</h5>
                <p>Metro services in Amsterdam can be grouped in two groups. The North-South line (in Dutch, <i>Noord/Zuidlijn</i>) opened recently and M52 services run on it. The central part of the line is underground, running at a considerable depth with two parallel tunnels. The other group of lines consists of services M50, M51, M53 and M54. This line runs mostly overground or elevated, parallel to the Dutch Railways lines. In the city center this line goes underground but at a small depth.</p>
                <p>Most of the underground stations consist of a mezzannine at level -1 and a island platform at level -2. The vast majority of overground and elevated stations also have island platforms, but the hall where the turnstiles and ticket machines are found is located on the ground level.</p>
                <p>Taking into account that most of the metro network runs parallel to rail lines, transfers between these two modes of transport are quick and easy.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Antwerp"> 
                <h5>Antwerp</h5>
                <p>The Antwerp premetro (underground tramway) opened in 1975. One of the achievements consisted in linking both banks of the Scheldt river.</p>
                <p>Despite the tram network being huge, the Premetro is short but complex. Lines can be grouped in two. The first group consists in an east-west line with two branches on the eastern side. However, there is a tunnel allowing services between both branches, thus forming a triangle. The second group of lines consists in a tunnel opened in 2015, connecting the city center with the eastern suburbs with a fast service, since most of stations are not opened yet.</p>
                <p>The Central railway station is linked with Astrid and Diamant premetro stations, and together with an underground bike parking, they form a hub. The rail triangle is located in between those two stations. Since the premetro tunnels were built with metro standards, same-level track crossings are not allowed, therefore Astrid and Diamant stations had to be built with platforms at two different levels.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Barcelona"> 
                <h5>Barcelona</h5>
                <p>Barcelona is the queen of the long passageways. Until 1995, all transfer stations consisted of corridors with lenghts over 100 m, except for Sagrera and Catalunya.</p>
                <p>Among the reasons for having such long corridors there is the lack of planning or the vision of the metro network as a bunch of individual lines. As an example: line 1 and line 4 were extended to Urquinaona in 1932, but both lines were not connected until 1972, as they were originally operated by different companies. In Plaça de Sants station, the L5 platforms were built as close as possible to the existing ones from L1, which opened 43 years before. However, there is a gap of 150 m, with the national rail tracks located in between.</p>
                <p>Moreover, since the extension of the metro network was slower than the growth of the city, during the 60s and 70s, transfer stations were built 100-150 m apart, in order to increase the accessibility to the metro. Verdaguer is a good examples of this practice.</p>
                <p>Right after 1980, transfer stations were designed in a more proper way, being the L2 stations the best example. A new type of transfer appeared 15 years ago with the extension of the metro towards hilly areas of the city: the vertical transfers. In those stations (eg: Vall d'Hebron, Fondo, Zona Universitària, Collblanc), a big shaft was built in order to fit either high-capacity lifts or series of escalators to reach the platforms.</p>
                <p>The classic layout of metro stations in Barcelona is simple: on level -1 there is one or two mezzanines and in level -2 there are two side platforms, but since 2000 the new stations tend to have a central plafrom instead. In transfer stations, there is tipically a corridor linking the mezzanines of both lines.</p>
                <p>Mandatory to mention the so-called Barcelona solution or Spanish solution: stations with two tracks and three platforms, where passengers alight using one platform and board using the opposite one, improving the flow of passengers and reducing the dwell time. Barcelona was not the first city to implement it, but it was named after most of the stations built in the 30s, 40s and 50s were designed with such layout.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Berlin"> 
                <h5>Berlin</h5>
                <p>The U-Bahn and the S-Bahn are the two rapid transit systems of Berlin. The city-state owns the first and the German railways own the second. The S-Bahn normally runs overground or elevated and the U-Bahn does it underground, as the name suggests in German, but this is not a norm since some parts of the U-Bahn are elevated and vice versa.</p>
                <p>The oldest lines were built either in elevated sections or underground, but very close to the surface, creating a direct connection between the street and the platforms in most of the cases. The lines built after World War I are a bit deeper, in order to fit mezzanines and corridors between the street and the platform levels.</p>
                <p>Transfer stations have a very easy tolopolgy, since stations are located close to the ground level and island platforms are predominant.</p>
            </div>
			<div id="com_Bilbao"> 
                <h5>Bilbao</h5>
                <p>Despite the metro opened in 1995, its layout follows former metric-gauge rail lines that were converted to metro, such as the Bilbao - Plentzia line. Metro Bilbao operates lines 1 and 2 and Euskotren operates line 3, together with other suburban and regional services.</p>
                <p>Due to the orography of the city, stations may have different layouts. The stations located in the city center are deep, since the Nerbion river is located nearby and there are plenty of hills located in the meanders of the river. The stations of the line 1 branch are located on surface, since they were part of the former Plentzia railway. </p>
                <p>Line 3 benefits from having already existing stations, such as Bilbao-Aduana (currently called Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo) and Matiko, both part of the former Plentzia line, despite the connection between those two stations is made through a new double-track tunnel.</p>
				<p>Some transfer stations have effective designs, such as Lutxana or the former Bolueta station.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Boston"> 
                <h5>Boston</h5>
                
                <p>All the rapid transit lines in Boston are centenary. Three of them originally opened as underground tramway tunnels in downtown Boston, but only two were converted to pure metro lines. The Green line is still an underground tram line.</p>
                <p>Most of the downtown stations are quite unusual, as they were built using early construction methods and most were designed to serve as tram stations. For instance, some stations in the Orange line have offset platforms. At State station, the Orange line platforms are in different levels.</p>
                <p>Underground stations tend to be located close to the surface. This can be appreciated at Government Center, where the Green line platform has a very particular shape because the streets located above ground were quite narrow when the line was constructed, and therefore impossible to dig wider tunnels.</p>
                <p>Despite being a city where the rapid transit lines were built without a network plan, transfer stations have a good layout, providing short and quick connections.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Brussels"> 
                <h5>Brussels</h5>
                <p>The Brussels metro is a good example of a planned system. It was planned in the 60s, and the four existing lines were built following this criteria: if for practical reasons, the section to be opened was not long enough to be operated as a metro line, the section would open provisionally as a premetro (underground tram), with temporary low floor platforms and temporary ramps connecting the streets with the tunnel. Once the construction of the line is advanced, the premetro operation is cut and the line is converted into a full metro line, removing the ramps and elevating the platforms to metro standards. Currently lines 1, 2, 5 and 6 are fully metros and lines 3, 4 and 7 are premetros.</p>
                <p>The whole network has been built following the same plan. Transfer stations have a good design as well, with the notable exception of Dè Brouckère, where there is a long corridor. Cross-platform transfers can be found in Beekkant and Gare du Midi. Arts-Loi, Montgomery and Rogier have crossing interchanges.</p>
                <p>Most stations have side platforms located at level -2, whilst level -1 is reserved for mezzanines. Stations on line 6 have island platforms because trains run on the left side instead. Stations on lines 3/4 were built using the Spanish solution, where passengers board using the island platform (except in Gare du Midi).</p>
                <p>In order to reduce fare evasion, most stations have been equipped with turnstiles during the last decade, replacing the existing honor system which is still present in some stations due to the complexity of its layout.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div id="com_Budapest"> 
                <h5>Budapest</h5>
                <p>Budapest was the first city in continental Europe to have a metro. Line 1 opened in 1896. Similar to other systems opened around 1900, tunnels have a narrow profile. Trains are only 2.60 m high and 30 m long.</p>
                <p>Lines 2 and 3 have a similar style to other Eastern European metros, despite the decoration has nothing to do. Line 4 was built recently. In these three lines, tracks are laid in two parallel tunnels that cross Budapest at a considerable depth. Stations have island platforms in two parallel galleries, which are connected with the ticket hall through a long escalator. The ticket hall can either be located at ground level or just underground. In the latter case, there are direct staircases connecting the hall with the tramway platforms or bus stops.</p>
                <p>The northernmost and southernmost parts of line 3, tracks run underground but at a very little depth. Here stations have side platforms, which are located at level -2 (and a mezzanine at level -1) or directly at level -1, together with an independent booking hall for each direction.</p>
                <p>Transfers differ, depending on the station. In Deák Ferenc Tér and Kálvin Tér, transfers consist in a quick connection through two escalators and a short corridor. In other stations, transfers may be longer since one line might be running close to the surface while the other may be running very underground (eg: Keleti pályaudvar, Batthyány tér)</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Bucharest"> 
                <h5>Bucharest</h5>
                <p>The Bucharest metro consists of 5 lines, despite lines M1 and M3 share their tracks and line M5 has two branches. The original plan from the 70s consisted of three lines: a east-west line (M3 and southern section of M1), a north-south line (M2) and a circle line circa 40 km long.</p>
                <p>Unlike other Eastern European metros, the Bucharest one was not built at a considerable depth but using cut-and-cover methods. The platforms are typically located at level -2 or -1 and tend to be central, despite some stations in line M1 have side platforms. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Buenos Aires"> 
                <h5>Buenos Aires</h5>
                
                <p>The Subte is the oldest metro network in Latin America. It consists of 6 lines. 4 of them run east-west (A, B, D, E) and the other two are north-south (C, F).</p>
                <p>The entire network runs underground and except for line H, the tunnels were build close to the surface. Most of the stations have side platforms but those stations that are or had been terminus usually have island platforms.</p>
                <p>The lower level of an average station comprises the platforms. If there is enough space between the platform level and the street level, a mezzanine can be found, containing the ticket booths and turnstiles. In the opposite case, each platform has independent accesses and turnstiles are located at the platform level and there are no overpasses or underpasses.</p>
                <p>The Subte applies a bizarrenaming criteria. Station names are independent for each line. So, a transfer station will have multiple names, one for each line calling at it (eg: Pueyrredón (B) and Corrientes (F) are part of the same station). But there is also the opposite situation, where there are stations with the same name in different lines: Callao and Pueyrredón are four stations located in lines B and D, but they have nothing to do.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Copenhagen"> 
                <h5>Copenhagen</h5>
                <p>Copenhagen has a modern and automatic metro. Both the Metro and the S-tog have an honor system and most underground stations look like the same: mezzanine with vending machines at level -1, a landing at level -2 and island platforms at level -3. The connection between the platform and the mezzanine is provided by lifts and escalators. Upbound escalators are separated from the downbound ones.</p>
                <p>Transfer corridors are connected to mezzanines in Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv, but not in Nørreport, where the corridor heading to the S-tog starts at the end of the Metro platform.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Frankfurt"> 
                <h5>Frankfurt</h5>
                <p>Despite Frankfurt has officially a U-Bahn (<em>pure</em> metro), technically is a Stadtbahn (light rail), despite the platform level is high even for stops located at the street. The S-Bahn is also part of the basic rail network of the city.</p>
                <p>The main transportation hubs were desinged to provide quick transfers between the rail lines. Most transfer combinations involve passing through a staircase or an escalator, but in Hauptwache, a cross-platform is provided for transfers between S-Bahn and U-Bahn lines U6 and U7.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Glasgow"> 
                <h5>Glasgow</h5>
                <p>Glasgow has a very peculiar subway. It opened in 1896 as a circle line powered by cable, like the San Francisco cable cars. The subway was fully renovated between 1977 and 1980 in order to change its operation to electric power, build new workshops, relocate stations and refurbish the rest of stations.</p>
                <p>Before the renewal, all stations had a very narrow island platform. A staircase located at the end of one platform lead to the ticket hall and the exit, typically located inside the station building. Most of the stations retain this layout today. However, escalators have been installed in some stations, to connect the ticket hall with the street. The stations with the highest patronage were completely rebuilt: Buchanan Street has a central and a side platform nowadays. In St Enoch, two side platforms replace the former island platform. Partick station was built during the renewal works in order to allow transferring from the Subway to ScotRail.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Hannover"> 
                <h5>Hannover</h5>
                <p>Hannover has a <i>Stadtbahn</i>, which is a mixture of a tramway that runs in a metro-like tunnel in the city centre.</p>
                <p>There are three trunk tunnels in Hannover (A, B, C) that meet in Kröpcke station. Tunnels B and C run overlapped between Kröpcke and Aegidientorplatz.</p>
                <p>The layout of an average station is simple and similar to the ones in other cities: a mezzanine at level -1 and side platforms at level -2.</p>
                <p>Kröpcke station is a huge complex with lots of accesses, escalators, staircases and mezzanines, since is the only point where the three tunnels meet. Hauptbahnhof station (main station) has elevated rail platforms and an underground station for the Stadtbahn, composed of two island platforms and four tracks. Aegidientorplatz station has a peculiar layout, since the mezzanine is at level -1, the northbound platform is at level -2 (with 2 tracks) and the southbound platform is at level -3 (with 2 tracks as well).</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Lyon"> 
                <h5>Lyon</h5>
                <p>The four lines of the Lyon metro are technically different. Lines A and B and D are rubber tired. Line A has manual conduction and line D was already opened with automatic trains. Line B switched from manual driving to automatic operation in 2022.</p> 
                <p>Line C partially follows the route of a former funicular that had a pent of 176‰. Therefore it operates as a rack railway between Hôtel de Ville and Croix Rousse, since normal metro lines have a maximum pent of 40‰.</p>
                <p>Lines A and B run at a very little depth. Even line A crosses the Rhone using the box girder of Pont Morand. The stations of this line only have one underground level, with side platforms and turnstiles on it. Some stations have underpasses, connecting both platforms. Line D tunnels are not located deep either, but most stations have a mezzanine between the street and platform levels. The latter situation also occurs in the eastern section of line A.</p>
                <p>Lyon had an honor system until two decades ago. Since some staion have secondary accesses connecting the streets with the platform, it is common to find turnstiles in the platforms.</p>
                <p>Most of the transfer stations have an efficient layout, such as Hôtel de Ville, Saxe-Gambetta or Charpennes. However, the links between at the two main railway stations (Part-Dieu and Perrache) are long.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Lisbon"> 
                <h5>Lisbon</h5>
                <p>Currently the Lisbon metro consists of four lines. Until the mid-90s, the network had a Y-shaped single line. This line was split into three (Blue, Yellow and Green) and the Red line was built as a completely new line. Therefore, all the internal metro transfers are less than 25 years old.</p>
                <p>The layout of the stations differs slightly: Baixa-Chiado and Campo Grande have parallel platforms for the two lines serving the stations. Saldanha, São Sebastião or Oriente allow quick transfers that involve climbing stairs or elevators. However, in Alameda or Entre Campos the transfer consists in a long passageway.</p>
                <p>The standard layout for the stations built before the Carnation Revolution consisted in two side platforms at level -2 and a mezzanine at level -1. These stations featured short platforms, that were extended years later to allow 6-car trainsets. Together with these platform extensions, secondary mezzanine and accesses were added. The stations built recently tend to have a single mezzanine and are located at deeper, since they were built in hilly areas.</p>

            <div id="com_London"> 
                <h5>London</h5>
                
                <p>The London Underground (or the Tube) is the oldest in the world and it consists of two different networks: the sub-surface lines (running close to the surface) and the deep tube lines (runing deep, with tunnels that ressemble a tube).</p>
                <p>The sub-surface lines are the ones inherited from the Metropolitan Railway and from the District Railway, two lines built using cut-and-cover methods or running elevated or at ground level, which were steam operated until the early 20th century. Stations consists in a building located at ground level, containing the ticket offices and fare gates, and the platforms placed at level -1. The stations were located inside a block of houses whenever possible and most of them had a canopy (still in place in Paddington, Bayswater or Earl's Court). With the electrification of the tracks and real estate speculation, most of the stations have been covered with concrete labs (such as in Gloucester Road or Mansion House).</p>
                <p>The deep tube lines began to be built in the last decades of the 19th century, when the boring methods were a bit developed. They were already planned to be operated with electric trains. The tunnels were bored at a depth of 20 m and until the construction of the Victoria Line, they followed the streets. Stations consists of a building hosting the ticket offices and the fare gates, which are connected with the platforms (most of them are island platforms) via lifts and spiral staircases located inside of shafts. In 1913 an escalator was installed at Earl's Court as part of a test to replace lifts. Since the result was favorable, the practice of building stations with lifts and spiral staircases in shafts was abandoned. From this moment on, the new stations were built with escalators, and the existing ones (especially those with a high ridership) were transformed.</p>
                <p>Initially each line was operated by a different company, so transfers between lines weres not granted. This was corrected after the nationalisation of the Tube.</p>
                <p>Some stations host huge flows of passengers. This obligated the local authorities to build wider or newer passageways and escalators in some transfer stations. That is the reason some transfer stations have one-way corridors as well, such as in Oxford Circus or Victoria.</p>

            <div id="com_Madrid"> 
                <h5>Madrid</h5>
                <p>technically, the Madrid metro lines can be divided into two: the narrow profile lines (1-5 and the Ramal) and the wide profile lines (6-12). The narrow profile lines were the first to be built and were inspired by the Paris metro. That is why old stations have side platforms located at level -2 and one mezzanines at level -1. Decades after the opening, lines 1 and 3 got their platforms extended from 60 m to 90 m long and secondary mezzanines and accesses were added.</p>
                <p>The lines with a wider profile were built with the aim of fitting larger trains and larger stations. Moreover, these lines were built a highest depth in comparison to the narrow profile lines, at a depth of 15 to 25 m below surface level. The streets and the platforms are connected through 3 to 5 series of staircases and escalator, with the ticket hall in between. Therefore, access times are longer compared to narrow gauge lines.</p>
                <p>Since the 90s, the design and layout of new stations have been standadrised, with stations being built using cut-and-cover methods with slurry walls.</p>
                <p>Madrid has plenty of different layouts for transfer stations. In comparison with other cities, Madrid has a great amount of stations containing long corridors, but not at the level of Barcelona.</p>
                <p>Possibly the most prominent stations are the macrohubs built in the first decade of the 2000s, with huge mezzanines, wide staircases and lots of lifts and escalators, allowing quick connections between metro, commuter train and interurban buses as well. The best example is Nuevos Ministerios, but Chamartín, Sol, Príncipe Pío, Plaza de Castilla or Moncloa also need to be mentioned.</p>

            <div id="com_Marseille"> 
                <h5>Marseille</h5>
                <p>The Marseille metro is formed by two lines that cross themselves in Saint-Charles and Castellane, both located in the city centre. The links between lines in these two stations are quick, since in Saint-Charles line 2 is between the two tracks of line 1 and in Castellane both lines have their platform very close to the intersect point.</p>
                <p>There are three kinds of stations, according to their layout: the suburban, which are elevated (eg: Bougainville, Ste-Margueritte, La Rose); the underground ones close to the surface, with the ticket hall at level -1 and side platforms at level -2 (eg: Baille, Périer); and the deep centric stations, which have island platforms and a single access consisting of long escalators connecting the street level with the mezzanine (eg: Cinq Avenues, Estrangin).</p>
                <p>Noailles station is the most particular since the former tram tunnel was diverted when metro line 2 was built. Currently the former tunnel serves as a passageway, and the former tram terminus is a ticket hall.</p>

            <div id="com_Milan"> 
                <h5>Milan</h5>
                <p>Line 1 opened in 1964 and was the first metro line in the world to be built using slurry walls. Line 2 opened four years, following the same design standards for line 1. Stations have a very functional layout, since passenger flows were seriously taken into account. Almost all stations have one-way staircases connecting the side platforms (located at level -2) and mezzanines (at level -1): one for passengers entering and another for passengers alighting.</p>
                <p>The same concept was latter aplied to lines 3 and 5, opened decades later, despite both having a radically different design in their stations, compared to lines 1 and 2. Most of their stations also have mezzanines at level -1 and side platforms at level -2.</p>
                <p>Engineers opted to superimpose the tracks in the central section of line 3, where tracks follow the narrow streets of the old city. As a result, the stations of this sections are a maze of lifts, one-way staircases and escalators, combined with a peculiar decoration.</p>
                <p>The transfers are typically short and quick, especially in Loreto, Centrale, Cadorna and Repubblica. The only two stations having long corridors are Lotto and Porta Venezia.</p>

                <h5>Paris</h5>
                <p>The Paris Metro has the most labyrinthine interchanges in Europe.</p>
                <p>Almost all the metro network was opened before World War 2. The first transfer stations, opened in the early 1900s, had simple transfers, with bidirectional passageways. Since 1920, the company responsible for the metro began to install <em>portillons automatiques</em> (automatic doors) in some stations. The <em>portillons automatiques</em> are doors located at the entrance of a platform, that blocks the access to it once a train enters the station, in order to reduce the dwell time and prevent last-second passenger boarding the trains. Therefore, in order to limit the access to platforms but not the exits, they decided to build two-directional corridors and staircases. That is how the stations began being underground mazes.</p>
                <p>In the 1970s the RER (suburban railway) was opened. This meant that some metro stations had to be partially rebuilt.</p>
                <p>Taking the advantade that the spacing between stations is one of the lowest in the world, some RER stations were placed between two metro stations, so both could be connected with the RER. The most extreme case is that 6 metro and RER stations are connected underground (St-Augustin, St-Lazare, Haussmann-St-Lazare, Havre-Caumartin, Auber and Opéra).</p>
                <p>The average metro station in Paris consists of a mezzanine at level -1 and two side platforms at level -2. The termini of the oldest lines used to have a loop (Place d'Italie M5, Étolie M6, Nation M6, Porte Dauphine M2). Some of these stations were actually doubled, since there was a station for the trains that terminate there and another one for the trains (and passengers) beginning their journey.</p>

                <p>The New York subway combines an extensive network of elevated trains (in Brooklyn and in the Bronx) with an underground train network that was built in the first half of the 20th century, especially in Manhattan. The subway links Manhattan with the other boroughs with tunnels or via the well known bridges, such as the Williamsburg Bridge or the Manhattan Bridge</p>
                <p>A characteristic feature of this subway is the existence of local and express services in separate but parallel tracks, so a tunnel can have 4 tracks (2 per direction and 2 for each type of service). The express trains run in the central tracks and the local trains run in the side ones. </p>
                <p>The elevated sections have stations placed above the streets and they can be accessed via staircases located in the sidewalks. Ticket halls are located at level +1, inside the viaduct, and platforms are at level +2, partially covered by shelters. The stations with express services tend to have central two platforms.</p>
                <p>The underground lines run very close to the surface and they have plenty of piles of steel between the tracks and in the platforms. The stations that are served only by local services have side platforms at level -1, together with the ticket halls. Platforms are not linked via an underpass or an overpass. Express stations have two island platforms at level -2, allowing cross platform transfers between the local and express trains. In this kind of stations, mezzanines with the fare gates are located at level -1.</p>

                <p>The three lines of the Prague metro form a radial network. All the lines cross at three selected stations in the city center. Almost the totality of the network is underground. The first line that was built (C) is the one running closer to the surface, especially at the city center and in the southern section. Lines A and B run much deeper.</p>
                <p>The deep stations have island platforms at the deepest point of the station. The ticket hall, which is located beneath the street level, is connected with the platforms through escalators. A few stations even have two mezzanines, one at each end of the station.</p>
                <p>Line C has not very deep stations at the southern part. They are composed of a island platform at level -1 and two ticket hall buildings located at ground level, each one at a different end of the platform.</p>
                <p>At Můstek i Florenc, both metro lines run at a considerable depth, so both stations are linked through a rather short corridor, located at a level between both metro lines. Hoewever, Muzeum station has line C located close to the surface, whilst line A station is deep. Both lines are connected through a series of escalators.</p>

                <p>The Rome metro has few lines compared to the extent of the city. Until a few years ago, there were only two lines that intersected at Termini station, which is the central railway station as well. Because of it, Termini station is the one with the highest ridership of the city and most of the times it gets crowded. This station has one-way corridors for entering, exiting and even for transferring. A decade ago, the city had to build an extra set of escalators and corridors to decongest the existing link connecting lines A and B.</p>
                <p>The other interchange station is San Giovanni. Line C opened in 2018 but the final passageway between both lines is not completed yet. Currently, passengers need to exit through the faregates and enter again.</p>
                <p>The stations of the southern section of line B were opened in the 1950s and are very simple. The construction of the northeastern section of line B and the entire line A is much more recent and their stations were designed with one-way staircases and passageways.</p>

There are some stations with a different layout compared to the others, especially in lines 3 and 5: Bailén, Avinguda del Cid, Àngel Guimerà and Colón have island platforms. Alameda has four tracks and three platforms (2 for the Rafelbunyol line and 2 for the Marítim line).</p>
                <p>Xàtiva station has a radically diferent layout, as the platforms are overlapped because there is the juntion of the line towards Bailén and Jesús just 20 m after the platform end (on the eastern side).</p>

                <h5>Vienna</h5>
                <p>Part of the current metro network (U-Bahn) is inherited from a primitive urban rail network known as Stadtbahn that was steam-powered until the 1920s. Once the network was electrified, the rolling stock used was similar to the ones used for the tramways. Most of its network was elevated or ran at a street level, but without level crossings.</p>
                <p>During the 60s, the municipal government decided to build a couple of tram tunnels. At the same time, they also planned a metro network consisting of a basic network, with parts of it coming both from the Stadtbahn (U4) and from the newly tram tunnels (part of current U2), asides from the construction of line U1. In the 1980s the second phase took place: line U3 was built and line U6 was integrated from the Stadtbahn.</p>
                <p>The layout of the stations depends on the time they were built. The non-underground stations that were part of the Stadtbahn have side platforms and the access is made via the station buildings, which are in the Art Nouveau style. The stations that were part of the tram tunnel are located under street level and are quite simple: offset side platforms at level -1. The new stations built from the 1970s on typically have a island platform at the lower level and two mezzanines at the upper level, which can be either on street level or below, and is connected with the platforms via escalators or elevators. The depth of the latter stations is variable, but the ones located in the city center may be very deep.</p>
                <p>All the transfer stations have been built after 1970 and their layout reflects the idea of having efficient links. Except for Praterstern, all stations have quick transfers.</p>

                <p>The current Oslo T-bane system originated from an old network of suburban trams that developed in the western suburbs of the city during the first half of the 20th century, and a modern metro system built from the 1960s onwards in the eastern part of the city. Both networks were progressively merged and unified between the 1970s and the 2010s.</p>
                <p>The Oslo metro runs mostly elevated or on the surface, but there are also shallow underground sections. Surface stations usually have two side platforms. Access to the platforms is open, using an honor system, and access to the platforms is performed directly from street level through ramps. In some places, there is a Narvesen kiosk that serves as both a ticket reseller and a convenience store.</p>
                <p>The underground stations are located either in the city center or in the northeastern suburbs. Most stations are situated at a shallow depth and have two side platforms at the deepest level. At the immediately higher level, there is a lobby that can be either at street level or underground. The connection between levels is made through ramps and staircases.</p>
                <p>There are a few stations that are situated at considerable depth: Romsås, Ellingsrudåsen, Stortinget, Nydalen, and Vestli. Access to the first two is only possible through large-capacity elevators that connect the street to the concourse, in addition to a ramp of over 200 meters in length that also links the street to the concourse level.</p>

                <h5>Hamburg</h5>
                <p>Hamburg has two rapid transit systems: the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn. The U-Bahn, which is the proper metro system, is one of the oldest in Europe. The first circular line was constructed combining elevated, at-grade and shallow underground sections. Subsequent extensions have also been built alternating these three typologies. However, the central section of U2 and the branch of U4 were constructed at a greater depth.</p>
                <p>In general, the underground stations are quite shallow and have a island platform (side platforms in the original U3 stations). Some stations have an intermediate level serving as a lobby. On the other hand, the elevated stations have a street-level building (where the lobby is located) and a island platform or two side platforms at level +1.</p>
                <p>The S-Bahn uses sections of the German railway network. The construction of the City S-Bahn (an underground line through the city center) started in the 1960s. Their stations have large island platforms located at level -2, generally with lobbies at level -1, standing at the ends of the platforms.</p>
                <p>As for interchanges, some have been designed to facilitate cross-transfer connections (Barmbek for U3-U3 connections, Wandsbek-Gartenstadt, Berliner Tor, Altona, Hauptbahnhof between S-Bahn trains, Norderstedt Mitte), with parallel platforms (Ohlsdorf, Barmbek for U3-S1 connections, Hauptbahnhof Süd, Elbbrücken) or with direct transfers via a single flight of stairs (Schlump, Jungfernstieg).</p>
                <p>There are other transfers that were poorly designed, such as the long passageway between Rathaus and Jungfernstieg, or the street-level transfer at Wandsbeker Chaussee, Dammtor/Stephansplatz, or Sternschanze.</p>

                <p>There are two stations with a particular layout: Hauptbahnhof and König-Heinrich-Platz, which are the transferring points for the north-south and east-west lines. These stations have two parallel platforms, stacked on different levels (-2 and -3). Different combinations of escalators and staircases allow for transfers, access, and exit from the station.</p>

            <div id="com_Düsseldorf">
                <h5>Düsseldorf</h5>
                <p>Düsseldorf has two Stadtbahn main lines (north-south and northeast-southeast), as well as an underground tram main line. Both Stadtbahn lines share tunnels between the central station (Hauptbahnhof) and the city center (Heinrich-Heine-Allee), with tracks running parallel to each other. At Hauptbahnhof and Heinrich-Heine-Allee, the platforms serving the four tracks are located at the same level. However, at the intermediate stations, platforms are overimposed, being the northbound one on the upper level.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the underground tram stations have low side platforms at level -2 and a mezzanine at level -1.</p>

            <div id="com_Turin">
                <h5>Turin</h5>
                <p>Almost all metro stations in Turin follow a standard design consisting of two side platforms at level -3 and a lobby at level -1. The connection between the lobby and the platforms is made through escalators that go directly from the platforms to the lobby, elevators, or two flights of stairs.</p>
                <p>Porta Nuova is the central rail station and has a different layout: the lobby is located at level -1 and platforms are at level -2, which can be reached by stairs or an elevator. There is a direct connection from the metro mezzanine to the railway station original hall, which is now part of a shopping center.</p>
                <p>Porta Susa station has metro platforms at level -4, an intermediate level at -3, and an open hall located inside the large canopy that constits the railway station building. The railway station itself consists of three levels, with the eastern part of the station featuring a huge glass roof canopy measuring 380 meters long by 30 meters wide. Level -2 also contains the four rail platforms. On level -1 there are four passageways that connect the western accesses to the station and act as an intermediate level to connect crowds coming from the different platforms.

            <div id="com_Lausanne">
                <h5>Lausanne</h5>
                <p>The Lausanne metro consists of a light metro line (m1) and an automated rubber-tired metro line (m2), which originated from a funicular that was later converted to rack railway operation.</p>
                <p>The stations on the m1 are either locatred underground or at street level. Some stations have only one platform with direct access to the street, as the track is single-track. Stations with passing loops usually have two side platforms. The terminal station at Renens CFF is part of the Swiss Federal Railways station.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the stations on the m2 line are more varied. All stations have side platforms, except Sallaz. Some have platforms are located at street level, like Ouchy or Grancy. Others are very swallow and can be accessed via a staircase or ramp, such as Délices or CHUV.</p>
                <p>Finally, some stations have a unique layout due to the topography of the old town, particularly the deep and narrow Flon Valley. Flon station is a main hub. It is located at Place de l'Europe. The m1 station is at the same level as the square, while the LEB (railway) and m2 stations are at level -2. From level -2, five elevators ascend to the height of the Grand Pont, located about twenty meters above.</p>
                <p>Similarly, the Riponne station is situated in the Flon River Valley. The station is located at an intermediate level between the street following the valley and the Riponne Bridge. Four elevators (two per platform) connect the three levels.</p>

            <div id="com_Porto">
                <h5>Porto</h5>
                <p>The Porto metro is a newly constructed light metro. It has two trunk lines: one north-south and another east-west, with a section that follows the path of the former narrow-gauge lines that departed from Trindade, which now serves as a transfer station between the two trunk lines.</p>
                <p>The surface stations have the typical design of a modern tram station, with shelters and pedestrian crossings at the ends of the platforms to switch platforms or exit the station.</p>
                <p>The underground stations have side platforms at the deepest level, but there are differences in the layout of intermediate levels and the location of the booking hall.</p>

            <div id="com_Munich">
                <h5>Munich</h5>
                <p>The Munich U-Bahn is a metro system formed by 6 different lines, plus two that only operate during rush hours. The network has lots of spurs, but in the city center all those lines merge and form 3 trunk lines, in addition to an east-west trunk line of the S-Bahn, which, due to its frequency and performance, can be considered a metro, just like in Berlin and Hamburg.</p>
                <p>Most stations have island platforms located at level -2 and a couple of lobbies located at level -1, just above the ends of the platforms. Any station has turnstiles: a honor system is used instead. In some specific stations the platforms may be located at a greater depth, which has required the installation of long escalators, like the ones in the central part of the U4 and U5.</p>
                <p>One of the characteristics of the Munich metro is the presence of cross-platform transfers at many stations, with coordination on the arrivals and departures. Some examples include Scheidplatz, Innsbrucker Ring or Neuperlach Süd. Additionally, some other stations with terminating trains usually have three or four tracks, such as Hauptbahnhof (U1-U2), Münchner Freiheit, Olympiazentrum, Kolumbusplatz, Fröttmaning, or Implerstraße. Some of these stations have elevators that provide direct access between the platforms and the street.</p>
                <p>The most centric S-Bahn stations use the Barcelona solution. At Hauptbahnhof and Karlsplatz, passengers board using the island platform and alight via the side platforms; while at Marienplatz, due to narrow streets, the two tracks are overlapped: passengers aight from the train using the right hand side in the direction of travel, and board through the opposite doors. Along with the two levels dedicated to the S-Bahn (-2 and -3), there is also the U-Bahn station located at level -4, whose platforms are separated by nearly a hundred meters since the streets above are narrow and the City Hall building is inbetween.</p>
                <p>In other transfer stations, the line change is direct through a flight of stairs (Odeonsplatz, Hauptbahnhof, Sendlinger Tor) or through the vestibules in the case of most U-Bahn to S-Bahn transfers.</p>

            <div id="com_Nuremberg">
                <h5>Nuremberg</h5>
                <p>The Nuremberg U-Bahn has three lines. Two of them, U2 and U3, share tracks in the central section and have automatic operation.</p>
                <p>The station layout for most of the stations is quite simple. First of all, the ticketing policy is based in an honor system, so there aren't turnstiles in any station. The platforms are always located at the lowest level of the station, usually at level -1 or -2 (if the station has a mezzanine at level -1). In some cases, there is direct access from the street to the platform. All stations have elevators.</p>
                <p>The two interchange stations between the U-Bahn lines are designed to provide quick transfers. At Hauptbahnhof, the U1 station is located one level below the U2 and U3 station, and only a short flight of stairs is needed to change. At Plärrer station, a cross-platform transfer is ensured in both directions, as the platforms of both lines are stacked.</p>

                <h5>Stuttgart</h5>
                <p>The Stuttgart Stadtbahn is quite complex, but its operation can be simplified into cross-valley lines and the valley lines. Outside the city center, tracks run on street level and most stations ressemble modern tramway stops. In the city center, stations are underground and have side platforms at level -2 and one or two lobbies at level -1.</p>
                <p>The stations in the central section of the S-Bahn have a island platform at level -2 and lobbies placed at both ends of the platforms, at an intermediate level between the platform and the street.</p>

            <div id="com_Lille">
                <h5>Lille</h5>
                <p>The Lille metro consists of two VAL (light automated vehicle) lines. A VAL system is characterized by very narrow and short vehicles that operate at a high frequency in order to accommodate the demand. The narrow gauge is a direct consequence of minimizing tunnel construction costs.</p>
                <p>Initially, the metro operated on an honor system, so the stations were designed to allow easy connections between streets and the plaforms. The subsequent installation of turnstiles means that some stations may only have them installed in certain accesses, while others may have a weird distribution turnstiles.</p>
                <p>The main station of the network is Gare de Flandre, which is the central railway station and also a common station for both metro lines and tram lines, whose platforms are underground. This station provides a cross-platform transfer between the metro lines. Additionally, the transfer between the metro and the tram is also very fast. As a curiosity, the tram station has a platform exclusively for passenger alighting, since it is the last station.</p>
                <p>The other interchange station between the two metro lines is Porte des Postes, where the platforms of the two lines intersect at different levels, but transfers are quick.</p>

                <h5>Palma</h5>
                <p>The Palma metro is a recent construction. The section closest to the city center was built by taking advantage of the underground section of the Palma-Inca line at the entrance to the city. Between the Intermodal Station at Plaça d'Espanya and Son Costa - Son Fortesa, the metro tracks run parallel to the aforementioned railway line.</p>
                <p>The Estació Intermodal is the main transportation hub in Palma. There is an underground bus station located next to the underground railway and metro station. In fact, this hub is the starting point for all the interurban bus lines and rail lines originating from Palma.</p>
                <p>All the underground section was built very shallow. In fact, the stations located on Gran Via Asima have the same design, with platforms and lobbies located at level -1 and an underground passage at level -2 equipped with escalators and elevators.</p>
                <p>The Son Sardina station is located on the surface and provides an interchange with the Palma-Sóller line. The UIB station, on the other hand, has a street-level passenger building, although it does not host any facilities.</p>

                <h5>Brescia</h5>
                <p>The Brescia metro consists of a single line that opened in 2013. The rolling stock comprises Ansaldobreda’s automatic trains, also in operation on Milan metro lines 4 and 5. The line runs shallowly in the northern section, deeply in the city center, and on surface level and elevated through the eastern suburbs. An honor system is employed, eliminating the need for turnstiles.</p>
                <p>Some of the deepest stations, such as Marconi, Ospedale, Stazione FS, Bresciadue, or Volta, follow a standard design with two side platforms at level -3. These platforms are connected to the mezzanine at level -2 via a staircase and two independent escalators. From the mezzanine, there is access to an intermediate level (-1) and a further flight of stairs leading to the street.</p>
                <p>Shallow stations typically consist of two side platforms directly accessible from the street, while elevated stations feature an island platform.</p>

                <h5>Istanbul</h5>
                <p>Despite having 10 lines in operation, the Istanbul metro is quite modern. Except for lines 1 and 2, built in the 80s and 90s, the rest of the network was constructed in the 21st century. Extensions are underway in both the European and Asian parts of the city. The tram network complements the metro, which incorporates turnstiles at each stop. Additionally, the public transportation network includes four funiculars, three of which are entirely underground.</p>
                <p>The metro lines exhibit significant differences in technical features, including train type, automation, track count, and electrification system. Construction methods for tunnels and stations vary from line to line, affecting station layouts. With the exception of line 1 which runs shallow or elevated, all lines run at considerable depths. Access and egress times are relatively high and some transfer layouts may result in long passageways or unnecessary multiple level changes. Moreover, transfers are not free, as passage through turnstiles is required.</p>
                <p>All lines were constructed with dual-tube tunnels at depths ranging from 20 to 45 meters below ground level, except for line 1, which is shallower, and line 6, which was built with a single track and with passing loops at each station. Some stations are located as deep as 70 meters, only accessible via elevators in certain cases.</p>

Line 1 is mostly underground, but the western section of line 1 was built as a light metro with level crossings. The underground sections are shallow, with most stations featuring a lobby at level -1 and an island platform at level -2.</p>
                <p>The common section is peculiar. Each line has its own tracks. The tunnel has two levels, with two tracks on each one. Between El Perchel and Guadalmedina stations, two tracks interchange their levels, in a section located within two curves. La Unión station on line 1 has also overlapped platforms. Atarazanas station only has a single platform.</p>

                <p>The central section, built in the 70s, features a dual-tube tunnel constructed using TBMs. Stations generally have a lobby at level -1 or -2, followed by an intermediate level and an island platform at the lowest level. Platform screen doors protect the tracks.</p>
                <p>The western section, crossing the Guadalquivir river, includes elevated, surface, and underground sections. Ciudad Expo, the only station with both an island platform and a lobby at street level, stands out. Other stations have two side platforms, with the lobby located at either the upper or lower level, depending on the station's location.</p>

The segment between Estació Intermodal and Son Costa – Son Fortesa features quadruple tracks for metro and mainline traffic.</p>
                <p>Estació Intermodal serves as a transportation hub with 10 platforms, a bus station at level -2, and a mezzanine at level -1. Jacint Verdaguer station has two island platforms at level -2 and a mezzanine at level -1. Son Costa – Son Fortesa station features two unconnected island platforms at level -1. The UIB station has two side platforms at level -1 and a ground-level hall. Son Sardina station is at ground level, with two side platforms connected by an underpass and linking to the Sóller Railway station.

                <p>Line 1, opened in 1993, connects the old city by the sea with the upper districts. The line forms a loop to climb the hill. Most stations are at great depths, except the section between Colli Aminei and Piscninola. Connections to platforms vary by station, but the booking halls are commonly located at level -1. Some feature a single flight of parallel escalators (Montedonzelli, Policlinico), high-capacity lifts (Duomo), or two or three flights of stairs. Stations between Colli Amiei and Museo have island platforms, while those in the old city have side platforms. Quattro Giornate station has overlapped platforms.</p>
                <p>Line 2, owned by the Italian State, opened in 1925 with third rail electrification but was later converted to overhead lines. Montesanto and Cavour are the deepest stations, with a ground-level building comprising ticket office and turnstiles. Two flights of stairs and escalators connect to an intermediate level (-2), with two side platforms at level -3. Other stations, like Mergellina or Campi Flegei, are at ground level with grand station buildings. Piazza Garibaldi has two tracks and three platforms, with a recent layout change.</p>
                <p>Line 6, closed since 2013, featured a narrow profile with trains only 2.20 meters wide.</p>
                <p>The Arcobaleno line (Line 11) connects Piscinola with Aversa, built with cut-and-cover methods. The layouts resemble Milan metro lines 1 and 2 and Rome's southern section of line A.

Most of the line runs underground, with two elevated stations (La Poterie and Pontchaillou). The layout of the stations varies considerably, but all stations have side platforms on the lowest level. The lobbies are either located at street level or at level -1. Anatole France and Jacques Cartier are the deepest stations on this line. Initially, the stations had an honor system, but turnstiles were installed in 2020. Due to this reason, some lobbies might have a peculiar placement of the turnstiles.</p>
                <p>Line B is a Neoval, an automatic line that uses more modern technology developed by Siemens. Trains operate in 2-car compositions, but stations allow for 3-car trains. The entire line runs underground except for the easternmost section, which is elevated. Platforms are located on the lowest level, normally at level -2 or -3. Mezzanines are located at level -1. Sainte-Anne is an interchange station located at the city center. Transfers, access, and egress are performed through a complex system of one-way corridors, stairs, and escalators.</p>

In 1973, the citizens rejected again the construction of a metro network. However, a short section of the tunnels was already being built to conduct rolling stock tests. In 1978, the citizens approved integrating the existing tunnel into the tram network, which was completed in 1986. These stations were built at a considerable depth, as they are located in a hill between the valleys of the Limmat and the Glatt rivers. All stations have island platforms. Since trams in Zurich only have doors on the right side, they run on the left side of the tunnel.

Corridors connect the underpass of the surface-level station with a concourse that either leads to the underground railway station, of which only one of the two tracks is in service, or to the metro station through a series of underground walkways. The metro station has a semi-underground concourse, which connects to the mezzanine, located at the upper level of the platform, via a staircase.</p>

            <div id="com_Charleroi">
                <h5>Charleroi</h5>
                <p>Charleroi's premetro consists of a circular line that encircles the city center and three branches towards the suburbs and nearby towns. The network is operated as four radial services, which start from the central loop.</p>
                <p>The central ring is a mix of tram with priority (between Tirou and Gare Centrale) and a fully segregated line, mostly underground but with an elevated section between Gare Centrale and Palais. Line 4 operates completely segregated outside the city ring, with trams running on the left side. Lines 1 and 2 run also segregated from the rest of traffic between the city center and Pétria, and then as a tram line between Pétria and Monument, just like line 3 once past Piges.</p>
                <p>The station layouts are rather simple. Regardless of whether they are on a viaduct or in a tunnel, almost all have a central platform, which is accessed directly from the street, sometimes via an intermediate level, without turnstiles.</p>
                <p>Palais station has four tracks: two of them are in service, a third without regular service, and the fourth leads to a loop that reverses the direction of trains. Waterloo station has two platforms and three tracks, but only the central platform is in operation.</p>

            </div>

            <div id="com_Montreal"> 
                <h5>Montreal</h5> 
                <p>The Montreal metro consists of a network of 4 lines with rubber-tired trains. Nearly all of the network was built during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, and is entirely underground, with tunnels often (but not always) following the alignment of the streets.</p>
                <p>Each station has unique architecture and style. Station depth also varies. However, most stations feature two side platforms, each 500 feet long (152.4 m), and all entrances are equipped with enclosures to protect against winter temperatures. In some cases, these enclosures also host station lobbies.</p>
                <p>Transfer stations were designed to offer practical and fast connections. Snowdon and Lionel-Groulx stations feature overlapped platforms, allowing for cross-platform transfers, while at Berri-UQAM, the platforms for the green and orange lines intersect at adjacent levels. At Jean-Talon, transferring between the orange and blue lines is also quick, with the platforms arranged in a stacked layout.</p>
                <p>One unique feature of Montreal is that, in the city center, metro stations connect directly to the underground city known as RÉSO, which links city blocks underground.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="com_Ottawa"> 
                <h5>Ottawa</h5> 
                <p>Ottawa’s rail transit system (O-Train) includes an east-west light rail line called the Confederation Line and a north-south rail line called the Trillium Line.</p>
                <p>The entire network is above ground, except for the central part of the Confederation Line, which runs at a depth of 17 to 25 meters below street level. The three underground stations have side platforms located on the lowest level. Each station has two independent entrances connecting the mezzanines located at either end of the platforms, which are accessible via multiple stair flights.</p>
                <p>Outside of the city center, stations may be located at street level, elevated, or in a trench, with most featuring side platforms. Some stations are transfer points between light rail and bus services, such as Tunney’s Pasture, Hurdman, and Blair. Ottawa also has several BRT lines, some of which have fully segregated infrastructure, including stops shaped like rail stations, with escalators, elevators, and lobbies with fare validators.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="com_Toronto"> 
                <h5>Toronto</h5> 
                <p>The Toronto subway has three lines. The network is relatively shallow, with some sections running above ground.</p>
                <p>In the oldest sections, the tunnel alignment is parallel to the street one but is shifted several meters toward the blocks of houses. Due to the cut-and-cover construction method used in these segments, it was necessary to expropriate and demolish existing buildings. Some of these clearings were used to build transfer hubs containing bus and streetcar bays, together with the passenger building, which also serves as the subway entrance. All bus and streetcar platforms are located within the paid area of the station, providing free transfers between the subway and surface transit.</p>
                <p>Regarding subway line transfers, Sheppard-Yonge, Bloor-Yonge, and St. George stations provide direct transfers via a single flight of stairs, while at Spadina, the transfer involves a walkway over 200 meters long.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="com_Calgary"> 
                <h5>Calgary</h5> 
                <p>Calgary has a light rail system called the C-Train. In the downtown area, it operates like a streetcar, with a low stop spacing, but in the suburbs, the spacing between stations is greater, and the trains have dedicated platforms, although some crossings still use level crossings.</p>
                <p>As for stations, there is only one underground station (Westbrook). Some other stations have platform access at ground level, while others use overpasses that lead to platforms through lobbies with waiting areas.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="com_Vancouver"> 
                <h5>Vancouver</h5> 
                <p>Vancouver’s SkyTrain consists of three automated metro lines. The network has a radial layout, and only two of the three lines reach downtown. As the name suggests, most of the metro is elevated, with only the most central segments being underground.</p>
                <p>The Expo Line runs through downtown in a two-level tunnel, with stations located at significant depths. The Canada Line is much shallower, with each station featuring a different layout: Waterfront, Vancouver City Centre, Yaletown-Roundhouse, and Olympic Village have a lobby on level -1 and an island platform on level -2; King Edward has overlapped platforms; while Oakridge and Langara have platforms on level -1 connected by an underpass.</p>
                <p>The main interchange of the network, Waterfront, serves as the terminal for the Expo and Canada Lines, as well as the commuter train and the ferry to North Vancouver. The transfer here is not ideal, as the Canada Line is in an area with separate fare gates, and the distance between this line and the ferry terminal is 350 meters.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="com_Seattle"> 
                <h5>Seattle</h5> 
                <p>Seattle has a light rail line. Initially, a tunnel was built for buses and trolleybuses in the downtown area, running from International District / Chinatown to Westlake, which opened in 1990. Stations in this section had side platforms on level -2 and two lobbies on level -1, with platforms spaced widely enough to allow one bus to overtake another.</p>
                <p>The tunnel closed in 2005 for conversion to light rail, which opened in 2009. Until 2019, it operated as a mixed-use tunnel for both buses and light rail. In 2016, the network expanded northward, adding a segment with four underground stations and one elevated station. Platforms at the underground stations are more than 20 meters deep, and each one has a unique layout.</p>
                <p>On the southern section, there is Beacon Hill Station, accessible only via four high-capacity elevators that descend to the platforms, located about 50 meters below ground.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="com_Stockholm"> 
                <h5>Stockholm</h5> 
                <p>Stockholm has three subway lines that cross the city center and split into two or three spurs at each end. The city itself is in an archipelago, so the metro lines were planned and built through a complex geography and geology, featuring surface stretches, elevated viaducts, shallow underground sections, and deep tunnels.</p>
                <p>The green line, the first to be built, is considered to be the shallowest. In the city center, it runs in shallow tunnels built using the cut-and-cover method, and in the suburbs, the line runs either elevated or at surface level. The red line combines deep underground segments in the north with a mix of surface and deep sections in the south. The blue line runs at great depth along nearly its entire length.</p>
                <p>All stations are accessible to persons with reduced mobility thanks to the installation of lifts. Deep stations typically feature two island platforms at the lowest level (-2), connecting to lobbies located at or near the surface (level -1) via a set of 3 or 4 parallel escalators, in addition to an inclined lift which also runs parallel. Stockholm has one of the highest numbers of inclined lifts in its subway system. Some deep stations have cavern-like platform designs.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="com_Leipzig"> 
                <h5>Leipzig</h5> 
                <p>Leipzig has a tunnel that crosses the city centre, with four underground stations, all featuring island platforms at the deepest level. Although the tunnels are twin-tube and were built using tunnel boring machines, the stations were constructed using the cut-and-cover method, except for Hauptbahnhof, which was built using the mining method.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="com_Karlsruhe"> 
                <h5>Karlsruhe</h5> 
                <p>Karlsruhe has a tram-train system. In 2021, a T-shaped underground line was opened, which is served by six stations, one of which is a double station. All stations have side platforms located on level -2, except for Kongresszentrum, which has its platforms on level -1. The -1 level of the other stations consists of various concourses.</p>
                <p>The platforms have sections with different heights to ensure compatibility with all rolling stock in terms of accessibility.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="com_Bielefeld"> 
                <h5>Bielefeld</h5>
                <p>The Bielefeld Stadtbahn consists of a north-south trunk line that branches into four lines, both in the north and in the south. The central section and a bunch of the northern spurs are underground. Most stations have island platforms on the deepest level, with accesses at both ends of each platform.</p>
                <p>Hauptbahnhof is the junction station on the northern side. The station has a concourse at level -1, two platforms and three tracks at level -2; plus one track and one platform at level -3, which crosses the station diagonally.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="com_Gelsenkirchen"> 
                <h5>Gelsenkirchen</h5>
                <p>Gelsenkirchen has a Stadtbahn line operated with low-floor trains. Except for Heinrich-König-Straße, which is located at a junction, all stations have a platform at the lowest level. In some stations, access to the platforms is directly from the street; in others, access points converge in the concourse.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="com_Wuppertal"> 
                <h5>Wuppertal</h5>
                <p>The Wuppertal Schwebebahn is a suspended monorail opened in 1901, with a single line that follows the course of the Wupper River, except at the western end, where it follows a street.</p>
                <p>The stations are elevated and located above the river or the street. All stations have side platforms, so trains have doors on only one side. The platforms are around 30 meters long.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="com_Cologne"> 
                <h5>Cologne</h5>
                <p>Cologne has a Stadtbahn made up of different services that cross the city. Most of the underground sections are located in the center and in the north. Some of these lines are operated with low-floor trams, while others use high-floor trains. This results in some stations having platforms with two different heights.</p>
                <p>The stations typically have a simple structure with platforms at level -2 and one or two concourses at level -1, although some stations have platforms at level -1. The new north-south line, partially constructed and served by lines 5 and 17, runs deeper than the other lines and has central platforms at almost all stations. However, currently only one of the two tracks is operational. Finally, line 13, which runs along the <em>Gürtel</em> (ring road), includes an elevated section.</p>
                <p>As for transfer stations, some are designed for quick and short transfers, such as Friesenplatz or Ebertplatz. The central station is served by two different, adjacent Stadtbahn stations.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="com_Bonn"> 
                <h5>Bonn</h5>
                <p>Bonn has a Stadtbahn consisting of a line that runs parallel to both the Cologne – Mainz railway line and the Rhine River. It has two underground sections: one in the center and south of Bonn, and another in the Bad Godesberg district, plus a couple of isolated underground stations on a branch line.</p>
                <p>The stations are simple. All have side platforms at level -2 and one or two concourses at level -1.</p>
