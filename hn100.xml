<b>Vulnerabilities in TETRA radio networks</b>
<p>

On 24 July 2023, researchers of the Dutch security firm
<a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/manuf/midnightblue"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="More about: Midnight Blue">Midnight Blue</span></a> revealed
that they had found five vulnerabilities in the authentication and
encryption algorithms of the <span aria-label="Terrestrial Trunked Radio" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/radio/tetra/index.htm">TETRA</a></span> radio network, which is used in
the critical infrastructure of more than 100 countries.
Two of the vulnerabilities are deemed critical. One of them
appears to be an intentional <i><span aria-label="deliberate weaking of a cipher system with the aim to provide covert access" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/nsa/backdoor.htm">backdoor</a></span></i> <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>.

<br>
The vulnerabilities were discovered during the course of 2020, and were
reported to the <span aria-label="National Cyber Security Centre (Netherlands)" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/index.htm#ncsc">NCSC</a></span> in the Netherlands in December of that year. It was
decided to hold off public disclosure until July 2023, to give emergency
services and equipment suppliers the ability to patch the equipment.

        <p>
          <span size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Arial,Verdana,sans-serif" color="#555555">
Several algorithm suites and cryptographic primitives are used at the
core of the TETRA protocol, in particular <span aria-label="TETRA Authentication Algorithm" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/algo/taa">TAA</a></span> for authentication,
and <span aria-label="TETRA Encryption Algorithm" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/algo/tea">TEA</a></span> for encryption.
As these algorithms are secret, they have never been
publicly disclosed and, hence, have never been subjected to in-depth
public scrutiny. In order to find any vulnerabilities in the
code, the researchers therefore first had to <i>reverse-engineer</i> the
<span aria-label="TETRA Authentication Algorithm" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/algo/taa">TAA</a></span> and <span aria-label="TETRA Encryption Algorithm" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/algo/tea">TEA</a></span> algorithms, which appeared to be not trivial at all.
<p>

The reverse-engineering project — codenamed RE:TETRA — was started
on 1 January 2020, with funding from the non-profit
<a href="https://nlnet.nl/" target="_blank"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="nlnet.nl (off-site)">NLnet foundation</span></a>, as part of the latter's
European Commission supported <a href="https://nlnet.nl/PET/" target="_blank"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="nlnet.nl (off-site)">NGI0 PET fund</span></a>.
Once the reverse-engineering was completed, the researchers were
able to isolate and analyse the cryptographic functions.

commercial off-the-shelf (<span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Commercial Off-The-Shelf">COTS</span>) mobile radio was used,
along with associated firmware upgrades obtained through

is not trivial though, as it is heavily encrypted and relies
on a Trusted Execution Environment (<span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Trusted Execution Environment">TEE</span>), embedded in
the core processor of the radio.

able to do in-depth security research with the aim to find vulnerabilities

The <span aria-label="Terrestrial Trunked Radio" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/radio/tetra/index.htm">TETRA</a></span> encryption algorithms were implemented in 1996 and 1997 by

(<span aria-label="ETSI Security Algorithms Group of Experts" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/org/etsi/index.htm#sage">ETSI-SAGE</a></span>).
It is ETSI's policy not to disclose their cryptographic algorithms
and not to submit them to public in-depth security research,
other than validation by the other <span aria-label="ETSI Security Algorithms Group of Experts" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/org/etsi/index.htm#sage">ETSI-SAGE</a></span> members, claiming that
<i>obscurity</i> is also a form of <i>security</i> <a href="#ref_7">[7]</a>. Researchers
often see this as a violation of <i>Kerckhoffs's Principle</i> however <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>,
which in the long run can potentially lead to weak exploitable systems.

On the day of the TETRA:BURST disclosures,
<span aria-label="European Telecommunications Standards Institute" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/org/etsi/index.htm">ETSI</a></span> issued a press statement in which the findings of the
researchers were largely downplayed, claiming that improvements
were already underway and that no actual exploitations of operational
networks were known at the time <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a>.
</p><p>

The Midnight Blue researchers have since demonstrated real-life
exploitations of some of the vulnerabilities, for example at the
2023 Blackhat Conference in Las Vegas (USA). They have shown that
<span aria-label="Terrestrial Trunked Radio" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/radio/tetra/index.htm">TETRA</a></span> communications secured with the <span aria-label="TETRA Encryption Algorithm 1" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/algo/tea/1.htm">TEA1</a></span> encryption algorithm
can be broken in one minute on a regular commercial laptop and in 12 hours
on a classic laptop from 1998 <a href="#pub_3">[III]</a>.

Its structure is very similar to <a href="#tea2"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Jump to: TEA2">TEA2</span></a>,
but the 80-bit key is manipulated in such a way that it becomes
a 32-bit key, which can be broken with a brute-force attack
on a regular commercial laptop in around one minute.
The source code snippet below shows how the key length is reduced.
    </span>
    </p>
<br>  <div>
    <pre>     int32_t tea1_init_key_register(const uint8_t *lpKey) {
         int32_t dwResult = 0;
         for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
             dwResult = (dwResult &lt;&lt; 8) |
             g_abTea1Sbox[((dwResult &gt;&gt; 24) ^ lpKey[i] ^ dwResult) &amp; 0xff];
         }
         return dwResult;
     }
     
    </pre>
</div>
<p>
  <span size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Arial,Verdana,sans-serif" color="#555555">
The key consists of 80 bits, which is equal to 10 bytes.
In the above code, the 10 bytes are processed one at a time, and then shifted
into the result (<p>dwResult</p>) register. However, as the <p>dwResult</p>
register is only 32 bits wide, the first 48 bits are shifted out
and the key consists of the last 32 bits only, which is trivially
short for a brute-force attack.
<p>

Although the short key length can be seen as a <i><span aria-label="deliberate weaking of a cipher system with the aim to provide covert access" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/nsa/backdoor.htm">backdoor</a></span></i>
— it is a deliberate weakening —
this is disputed by the original developer, as it was done in plain
sight and not hidden in some complex code, function or table <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>.
The short key length was simply an <span aria-label="European Telecommunications Standards Institute" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/org/etsi/index.htm">ETSI</a></span> requirement.
Any company that had to implement the algorithm in its equipment,
had access to the design specification and must have been aware
of the limitation <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>.
This is corroborated by Gert Roelofsen in an interview with
De Volkskrant on 29 July 2023, in which he states that the government
had been aware of it for the past 30 years <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a>. At the time, Roelofsen
was on the <span aria-label="European Telecommunications Standards Institute" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/org/etsi/index.htm">ETSI</a></span> experts team on behalf of <span aria-label="Koninklijke PTT Nederland" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/manuf/ptt">KPN</a></span>.

<span aria-label="TETRA Encryption Algorithm 2" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/algo/tea/2.htm">TEA2</a></span> was developed for European emergency services, and is arguably
the strongest of the four algorithms. It uses the full 80-bit key
length. If we assume that a 32-bit key can be broken in one
minute – as with <a href="#tea1"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Jump to: TEA1">TEA1</span></a> above – we can calculate how long it would take
to brute-force an 80-bit key. As each bit doubles the required time,
the total time needed is:

It is similar to <span aria-label="TETRA Encryption Algorithm 2" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/algo/tea/2.htm">TEA2</a></span> and does not have the weakness of
<span aria-label="TETRA Encryption Algorithm 1" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/algo/tea/1.htm">TEA1</a></span> (i.e. the reduced key length). Although it is likely that

any weaknesses in this cipher, but acknowledge the need for further
research.

access, just like <span aria-label="TETRA Encryption Algorithm 1" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/algo/tea/1.htm">TEA1</a></span>, which suggests that it also has a

the researchers were unable to review the algorithm.
It seems likely though, that it has similar weaknesses to <span aria-label="TETRA Encryption Algorithm 1" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/algo/tea/1.htm">TEA1</a></span>.

Although there is no direct proof of actual exploitation of a <span aria-label="Terrestrial Trunked Radio" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/radio/tetra/index.htm">TETRA</a></span>

are known <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a>, does not mean that they do not exist.
The TETRA:BURST
project shows that reverse-engineering of the cryptographic primitives
is feasible with limited resources.
<p>

A weakness like the reduced key
length of <a href="#tea1"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Jump to: TEA1">TEA1</span></a> is so obvious that it will certainly have been
noticed and exploited. Apart from the possibility of reverse-engineering,
an adversary would not be hampered by legal restrictions,
and might use leaked or stolen documentation instead.

Below is a timeline of events since the start of the reverse-engineering
project RE:TETRA on 1 January 2021 and the first public disclosure on 24 July
2023. The Dutch <span aria-label="National Cyber Security Centre (Netherlands)" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/index.htm#ncsc">NCSC</a></span> (<span aria-label="National Cyber Security Centre (Netherlands)" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/index.htm#ncsc">NCSC-NL</a></span>) was informed in December 2021, after which
meetings were held with the law enforcement and intelligence communities,
as well as with <span aria-label="European Telecommunications Standards Institute" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/org/etsi/index.htm">ETSI</a></span> and the vendors. Shortly afterwards, on 2 February 2022,
preliminary advice was distributed to the various stakeholders and <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Computer Emergency Respnse Team">CERT</span>s.
The remainder of 2022 and the first half of 2023 were used for coordination
and advisory sessions with stake­holders, allowing manufacturers to come
up with firmware patches, updates or workarounds.

of the vulnerabilities, is a carefully chosen tradeoff between giving
asset owners as much time as possible and the right of the public to know.
The 1.5+ years inbetween were used to find as many stakeholders as
possible and inform/advice them, so that software updates and mitigations
could be devoloped.

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">🚧👷 <strong>Warning</strong> Proceed at your own risk. This is an in-development engine, which is another way of saying that it will change <em>quite a lot</em>. We do our best to keep release branches stable, but expect a lot of breaking changes and things that are not perfect (yet!).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to build it?</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you're good at just digging examples and figuring things out, I recommend starting out with our <a href="https://github.com/isadorasophia/neocityexpress">game jam project</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/isadorasophia/hellomurder">Hello World project</a>. These projects show what to expect from the Murder architecture and how to create a world, entities and components, which ECS is all about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">...I realize this is quite redundant because the Hello World references this repository as a documentation source, but hang with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This is what the architecture looks like:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="└── root 
    └── resources
    └── src
        ├── game
        │   ├── bin (final game)
        │   ├── packed
        │   └── resources
        └── game.editor
            ├── bin (game editor)
            └── resources"><pre><code>└── root 
    └── resources
    └── src
        ├── game
        │   ├── bin (final game)
        │   ├── packed
        │   └── resources
        └── game.editor
            ├── bin (game editor)
            └── resources
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You may notice that <strong>there is no external editor.exe</strong>, only your own project. This is so you can have full control of your project! Very similar of what you expect developing a <a href="https://www.monogame.net/" rel="nofollow">MonoGame</a> project, for example.</p>
<p dir="auto">The idea of a separate project for the editor is that editor code never touches your beautiful and efficient game code, and you can do whatever you want on the editor side.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is no nuget package for Murder yet, so the recommended way is to keep a git submodule to reference in your .csproj, <a href="https://github.com/isadorasophia/hellomurder/blob/main/src/HelloMurder/HelloMurder.csproj">see example</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information on how the ECS applies to the engine, I recommend checking out the documentation for <a href="https://github.com/isadorasophia/bang">Bang</a>, the framework that Murder uses.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Requirements</h3>
<p dir="auto">We support developing (which means, running the editor) on <strong>Linux, MacOS, Windows</strong> and even <strong>SteamDeck</strong>. All you really need is .NET 8 SDK installed. The game obviously also ships to all these architectures.</p>
<p dir="auto">Console support is still on progress.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h3>
<p dir="auto">This is still super early, but feel free to contact me or <a href="http://saint11.org/" rel="nofollow">saint11</a> if you have any suggestions. I am very interested in people trying it out and any feedback you may have!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m excited to announce our fintech startup <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Deadweight Loss as a Service</a> is coming out of stealth after receiving $8M in seed funding from Emergent Ventures and Thiel Capital. Our platform makes charitable giving more efficient using the latest AI and blockchain technology. Our platform has two major innovations:</p><ul><li><strong>OmniMatch™️</strong> will match any funding through our platform up to fifty cents on the dollar.</li><li><strong>Antidollars™️</strong> remove $1 of funding from an organization of your choosing.</li></ul><h2 id="antidollarstm">Antidollars™️</h2><p>Frustrated that the only avenues for disagreement with an organization’s decisions or worldview are ineffective and inefficient protests, petitions, boycotts, and social media campaigns? Tired of cardboard protest signs wasting valuable economic resources, then being reduced to litter in the street? The Antidollar™️ is for you. Patent-pending and only available through Deadweight Loss as a Service, each Antidollar™️ donation either annihilates a dollar donated to your target or donates a dollar to its antithesis.</p><p>Here’s how it works: We’ve identified hundreds of pairs of organizations which directly oppose each other (e.g. Clean Air Task Force / American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, Electronic Frontier Foundation / <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/01/apple-encryption-iphone-heat-initiative/">Heat Initiative</a>). For each pair, we’ve created a smart contract providing a “market” for this pair. Each market has a <em>balance</em> which starts at $0 and can become either negative or positive. Each January 1st at 00:00, the absolute value of the balance is donated to one of the organizations. If the balance is negative, it is donated to the first in the pair; if positive, it is donated to the second.</p><p>On our platform, you can send money (plus an <a href="https://unoriginal.blog/introducing-dwlaas/#omnimatchtm">OmniMatch™️ subsidy</a>) to a supported organization of your choosing. Behind the scenes, this works by increasing or decreasing the relevant market’s balance. If $1 is sent to the first organization, the balance decreases by a dollar; if the second, the balance increases by a dollar. The Antidollar™️ does the exact opposite: sending an Antidollar™️ to the first organization <em>increases</em> the balance by a dollar, and sending an Antidollar™️ to the second <em>decreases</em> the balance by a dollar. If the balance currently favors the organization sent an Antidollar™️, the Antidollar™️ will simply subtract $1 from the amount donated; if not, the Antidollar™️ is sent to the opposing organization, which, for well-chosen markets, should have a similar effect. Sending dollars or Antidollars™️ on our platform is completely free.</p><h2 id="omnimatchtm">OmniMatch™️</h2><p>If Antidollars™️ aren’t motivation enough to use our platform, OmniMatch™️ will be. $0.20 per Antidollar™️ sold is directed towards an OmniMatch™️ pool. This pool is used to match a fraction of each dollar or Antidollar™️ directed towards an organization on our platform. Our proprietary OmniMatch™️ algorithm determines this fraction using factors such as market activity. We guarantee these OmniMatch™️ subsidies will never go below 10 cents per dollar. Funding organizations through our platform is a no-brainer: your donation will be worth 10%-50% more at no cost.</p><p><img alt="A simple infographic-style bar chart with two bars, the left labeled “Without DWLaaS” and the right labeled “With DWLaaS”. The right bar is actually two bars, one behind the other. One is 10% larger than the left bar; the other is 50% larger. Above the left bar is text reading “10-50¢ matched per dollar”." src="https://unoriginal.blog/dwlaas-subsidy.png"></p><p>Thanks to OmniMatch™️, in our closed beta lasting only a few months, several of our markets have already seen more than $10,000 in volume:</p><ul><li>Cato Institute / Democratic Socialists of America (current balance -$12)</li><li>Brady Campaign / National Rifle Association (current balance +$536)</li><li>Planned Parenthood Federation of America / National Right to Life Committee (current balance -$4165)</li><li>United States Treasury / Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Central Planning Committee (current balance -$3484)</li><li>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals / National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (current balance $6645)</li><li>Biden for President / Donald J Trump for President (current balance -$8392)</li></ul><h2 id="testimonials">Testimonials</h2><blockquote><p>Tired of political quarrels at the Thanksgiving table? Buy anti-gift cards for the whole family! Can’t make it to a (counter-)protest? Whether you’d have been at Planned Parenthood or on Wall Street, Deadweight Loss as a Service has got you covered. …. This startup … is … good.</p><p>— <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716nAssnUVL._AC_SL1500_.jpg">WIRED Magazine</a>, “Forget Political Activism. ‘Deactivism’ Is Sweeping Silicon Valley”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[The] Hatch-Waxman [Act] was our wakeup call at Eli Lilly to start making connections inside the Beltway. They’ve been worth every penny, but were starting to impact our image. We partnered with Deadweight Loss as a Service to redirect our lobbying spend towards [Patients For Affordable Drugs Now] Antidollars™. It’s much more efficient, and our ESG scores have never been better.</p><p>— David A. Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly and Company</p></blockquote><h2 id="pro-modetm">Pro Mode™</h2><p>Stay tuned for a future update to the platform, Pro Mode™. For power users, Pro Mode™ further increases liquidity on our markets using advanced AI technology. We embed the mission statements of thousands of humanitarian aid groups, religious organizations, PACs, and more into a high-dimensional “cause-space” which accurately represents divergence in goals between any two supported organizations. The Pro Mode™ smart contract unifies Antidollar™ markets, replacing many distinct prices with a single Praxis Vector™ within cause-space. At the end of the year, the Pro Mode™ contract allocates its funds proportionally to each charity’s cause-space distance from the final Praxis Vector™.</p><p>In Pro Mode™ with patent-pending Praxis Vector™ technology, every dollar pushes the market’s Praxis Vector™ towards your own PPV (Personal Praxis Vector™), set manually or inferred with state-of-the-art LLMs. With Pro Mode™, you can be confident your funds increase the cosine similarity of your and the market’s Praxis Vectors™ as efficiently as possible, without wasting an Anticent™️ on causes literally and figuratively orthogonal to your beliefs. And best of all, Pro Mode™ comes at no additional cost.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p><h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next</h2><p>Our “PvP mode” experiment was extremely successful in closed alpha. We’ll go GA as soon as a lawyer stays long enough to sign off on it.</p><p>In the long term, you can expect even more from us. A certain seed investor has encouraged us to expand into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_pairing_in_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election">vote swapping</a> market with the help of Dr. Bryan Caplan. Meanwhile, Dr. Robin Hanson has been instrumental in the design of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Jury Nullification Market Beta</a>—early adopters can join the waitlist starting today!</p><p>We don’t expect to go public any time soon, but what’s a few unregistered securities between friends: invest in Deadweight Loss as a Service by sending Antidollars™ to our enemies.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><strong><mark>OSS Capital leads the Series A funding alongside Naval Ravikant (Founder of AngelList) and a group of angels including Justin Hoffman, Larry Augustin, Alex Atallah, Thomas Dohmke, Diogo Mónica, Scott Williamson.</mark></strong></p>



<p>3 billion people play video games – that’s nearly half the planet! Despite this already massive market size, <strong>the video game industry is at an inflection point where its already strong growth rate will increase even further, and exponentially so. </strong>Shifting demographics, widening Internet access, emerging technologies, and ever-growing adoption by non-gaming industries will completely transform demand for video game developers, platforms, and games themselves. 25,000+ studios. 22 million+ gaming jobs. These illustrate just the tip of the iceberg.</p>



<p>We at W4 Games are going all-in on the creation of an ecosystem with the Godot Engine at its center. The free, open-source technology of the Godot Engine empowers developers to create stunning 2D and 3D games, and we believe it will become the most used game engine in the world within the decade, driving video game development to new heights. It is already the preferred game engine for new generations of game developers and will scale exponentially further thanks to its fast learning curve, intuitive design, and a fast-growing and welcoming community.</p>



<p>To help drive our continuing growth, we are thrilled to announce a new $15M Series A funding round led by OSS Capital and Naval Ravikant (AngelList and AirChat co-founder). Other investors include Justin Hoffman (Ex&nbsp;Elastic), Larry Augustin (Ex SugarCRM),&nbsp;Alex Atallah (Co-founder of OpenSea), Thomas Dohmke (CEO of GitHub), Diogo Mónica (Founder of Anchorage Digital), Scott Williamson (Ex GitLab) and more notable founders and executives in the commercial open-source ecosystem.</p>



<p>W4 Games will strengthen our role within the Godot ecosystem by supporting its open-source development and continuing to build products and services to facilitate Godot’s expansion, such as W4 Consoles (an approved middleware console porting solution for Godot games) and W4 Cloud (multi-tenant service to support millions of users). Moreover, we will target international expansion across North America, Europe, and Asia, and the development of a new Godot education program.</p>



<p>With this new funding, W4 Games aims to more than double its headcount in the coming 18 months to capture the fast-growing demand for its products and services.</p>



<p>“W4 and the Godot community mark the first time in history that the now $300B+ gaming industry is seeing fundamental disruption and acceleration of innovation thanks to open source. OSS Capital is proud to deepen our partnership with W4 towards an open future in gaming.”</p>



<p><em>Joseph Jacks (Founder and General Partner at OSS Capital)</em></p>



<p><strong>About W4 Games (w4games.com)&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Founded in 2021, W4 Games is an Irish startup formed by Godot veterans Juan Linietsky, Rémi Verschelde and Fabio Alessandrelli, and veteran entrepreneur Nicola Farronato. The company plans to revolutionize the game industry by bringing the Commercial Open Source Software (COSS) business model to an ecosystem that has traditionally relied on proprietary solutions from an ever-shrinking number of independent vendors. By providing a commercial services offering anchored in the entirely open and community-developed Godot platform, W4 Games believes that companies will be able to reclaim control of the technology powering their games, with a level of freedom and flexibility they never had before. In 2021 W4 Games raised its seed investment round led by OSS and Lux Capital, with the participation of SISU Ventures and Bob Young, the co-founder of Red Hat.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>The discovery that two agents from Spain’s <a href="https://english.elpais.com/politics/catalonia_independence/2020-07-16/spains-intelligence-service-has-spyware-program-that-targeted-catalan-politicians.html">CNI intelligence service</a> were bribed to provide classified information to the United States has led to an unprecedented situation between Madrid and Washington. Spanish Minister of Defense Margarita Robles, who oversees the CNI, summoned the U.S. ambassador to Spain, Julissa Reynoso, to her office to explain what happened. Such actions are considered hostile and are not expected between two allies. The Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, José Manuel Albares, also spoke with Reynoso and expressed the Spanish government’s unease over the revelations, according to government sources. At least two U.S. agents stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid, who were directly involved in recruiting the CNI spies, have been discreetly expelled from Spain.</p><p>The investigation into the spying operation began before the summer, when during a CNI security check, it was discovered that the two Spanish agents had accessed classified information that they did not need for their work, nor were authorized to know. The internal investigation confirmed that at least one of the agents, a middle-ranking official at the secret service, had been recruited by U.S. spies to obtain secret information in exchange for a large sum of money. According to sources close to the CNI, the agent was an area chief, one of the sections that are part of the intelligence division, while the other was his assistant.</p><p>When the CNI concluded its investigation, the director of the secret service, Esperanza Casteleiro, reported the case to the Prosecutor’s Office of Spain’s highest court, the National Assembly, which transferred the case to the Prosecutor’s Office of the High Court of Madrid, on the grounds that it was the competent authority. The Madrid tribunal then presented the complaint to the investigative courts of Plaza de Castilla.</p><figure><span><img alt="Margarita Robles" decoding="auto" height="275" srcset="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/_PyZjH5NdM4k53dWZsOq0v16wgc=/414x0/filters:focal(352x123:362x133)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/GAH4LNRE6VFUFNYO2GGXBSPN3A.JPG 414w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/65ucy8UnINhGGz9RdPt77kqGoEM=/828x0/filters:focal(352x123:362x133)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/GAH4LNRE6VFUFNYO2GGXBSPN3A.JPG 640w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/G5YVvdz_8MCDVVDp7iV_pnh6EO4=/980x0/filters:focal(352x123:362x133)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/GAH4LNRE6VFUFNYO2GGXBSPN3A.JPG 1000w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/tZlYyRwpLKvqDrLZSJClrd2hHEg=/1960x0/filters:focal(352x123:362x133)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/GAH4LNRE6VFUFNYO2GGXBSPN3A.JPG 1960w" width="414" loading="lazy" src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/_PyZjH5NdM4k53dWZsOq0v16wgc=/414x0/filters:focal(352x123:362x133)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/GAH4LNRE6VFUFNYO2GGXBSPN3A.JPG" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw"></span><figcaption><span>Spain's Minister of Defense, Margarita Robles (l) and the U.S. ambassador to Spain, Julissa Reynoso, last May.</span><span>MINISTERIO DE DEFENSA</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was at that moment, according to the sources consulted, that the Spanish government decided to share the findings of the investigation with the United States and condemn what happened. The case is a very serious matter, since recruiting secret agents of a host state to betray their own country is considered an <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-05/ex-us-ambassador-who-put-evo-morales-on-the-map-arrested-for-spying-for-cuba.html">openly hostile act</a>. Such actions may be taken with enemy or adversary governments, but never with friends and allies. Sources from the Spanish intelligence service do not fully understand what happened. “What do Americans have to pay for if we give them everything they ask for?” they noted. These sources insist that Spain openly collaborates with the United States, and always exchanges information. According to these sources, the number of times in which Spain has refused to share information of interest to Washington is “between one and zero.”</p><p>These sources explain that, when the U.S. Ambassador Reynoso was summoned by Minister Robles, she said that she was not aware of the case. The U.S. ambassador allegedly claimed that the U.S. agents who had bribed the Spanish spies were working independently of her, in a program that was launched before current <a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2023-12-06/biden-says-he-might-not-have-run-for-reelection-if-not-for-threat-of-trump.html">President Joe Biden</a> arrived at the White House and that, for reasons unknown, had been maintained until now. Reynoso, the same sources add, apologized for what happened and promised utmost collaboration with the ongoing investigation. The case has left the U.S. in an embarrassing situation.</p><p>The Spanish Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs agreed to expel at least two American spies — some sources claim that there were more — who were involved in recruiting and bribing the CNI agents. The spies were expelled discreetly, as Washington rushed to remove them. For its part, the Madrid court sealed the investigation, and ordered the arrest of the two alleged CNI spies and for their homes to be searched. Both were taken to the Estremera prison module in Madrid, which is reserved for security forces personnel and prison officials who are serving a sentence or are in pre-trial, and is separated from the rest of the inmates. The CNI assistant was released last month, while his superior remains behind bars.</p><p>According to CNI sources, the arrest of the CNI area chief has shocked his colleagues, since he is a veteran agent and widely known in the center. Both he and his subordinate are accused of the crime of revealing secrets and could be sentenced to between six and 12 years in prison under Article 584 of the Penal Code, which punishes “a Spaniard who, with the purpose of helping a foreign power, association or international organization, procures, falsifies, disables or discloses information classified as reserved or secret, that is likely to harm national security or national defense.”</p><p>This is not the first time that the Spanish secret service has denounced one of its own agents for spying. In 2007, the CNI opened a case against former spy Roberto Flórez — who had worked for the center between 1992 and 2004 —, after classified documentation was found in his premises and two apartments he owned in Puerto de la Cruz in Tenerife. The CNI also seized a letter addressed to the Russian secret services in which Flórez offered to work for them in exchange for a first payment of $200,000. Although it could not be proven that Flórez had delivered the secret documents, the Provincial Court of Madrid sentenced him to 12 years in prison in 2010, which the Supreme Court later reduced to nine.</p><p><i>Sign up for </i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" target="_blank"><i>our weekly newsletter </i></a><i>to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>"If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing" (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/#tyler-james-hill">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>20 years ago, I got in a (friendly) public spat with Chris Anderson, who was then the editor in chief of <em>Wired</em>. I'd publicly noted my disappointment with glowing <em>Wired</em> reviews of DRM-encumbered digital devices, prompting Anderson to call me unrealistic for expecting the magazine to condemn gadgets for their DRM:</p>
<p><a href="https://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/is_drm_evil.html">https://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/is_drm_evil.html</a></p>
<p>I replied in public, telling him that he'd misunderstood. This wasn't an issue of ideological purity – it was about good reviewing practice. <em>Wired</em> was telling readers to buy a product because it had features x, y and z, but at any time in the future, without warning, without recourse, the vendor could switch off any of those features:</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2004/12/29/cory-responds-to-wired-editor-on-drm/">https://memex.craphound.com/2004/12/29/cory-responds-to-wired-editor-on-drm/</a></p>
<p>I proposed that all <em>Wired</em> endorsements for DRM-encumbered products should come with this disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  WARNING: THIS DEVICE’S FEATURES ARE SUBJECT TO REVOCATION WITHOUT NOTICE, ACCORDING TO TERMS SET OUT IN SECRET NEGOTIATIONS. YOUR INVESTMENT IS CONTINGENT ON THE GOODWILL OF THE WORLD’S MOST PARANOID, TECHNOPHOBIC ENTERTAINMENT EXECS. THIS DEVICE AND DEVICES LIKE IT ARE TYPICALLY USED TO CHARGE YOU FOR THINGS YOU USED TO GET FOR FREE — BE SURE TO FACTOR IN THE PRICE OF BUYING ALL YOUR MEDIA OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AT NO TIME IN HISTORY HAS ANY ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY GOTTEN A SWEET DEAL LIKE THIS FROM THE ELECTRONICS PEOPLE, BUT THIS TIME THEY’RE GETTING A TOTAL WALK. HERE, PUT THIS IN YOUR MOUTH, IT’LL MUFFLE YOUR WHIMPERS.
</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Wired</em> didn't take me up on this suggestion.</p>
<p>But I was right. The ability to change features, prices, and availability of things you've <em>already paid for</em> is a powerful temptation to corporations. Inkjet printers were always a sleazy business, but once these printers got directly connected to the internet, companies like HP started pushing out "security updates" that modified your printer to make it reject the third-party ink you'd paid for:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer</a></p>
<p>Now, this scam wouldn't work if you could just put things back the way they were before the "update," which is where the DRM comes in. A thicket of IP laws make reverse-engineering DRM-encumbered products into a <em>felony</em>. Combine always-on network access with indiscriminate criminalization of user modification, and the enshittification will follow, as surely as night follows day.</p>
<p>This is the root of all the right to repair shenanigans. Sure, companies withhold access to diagnostic codes and parts, but codes can be extracted and parts can be cloned. The real teeth in blocking repair comes from the law, not the tech. The company that makes McDonald's wildly unreliable McFlurry machines makes a fortune charging franchisees to fix these eternally broken appliances. When a third party threatened this racket by reverse-engineering the DRM that blocked independent repair, they got buried in legal threats:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/20/euthanize-rentier-enablers/#cold-war">https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/20/euthanize-rentier-enablers/#cold-war</a></p>
<p>Everybody loves this racket. In Poland, a team of security researchers at the OhMyHack conference just presented their teardown of the anti-repair features in NEWAG Impuls <em>locomotives</em>. NEWAG boobytrapped their trains to try and detect if they've been independently serviced, and to respond to any unauthorized repairs by bricking themselves:</p>
<p><a href="https://mamot.fr/@q3k@hackerspace.pl/111528162905209453">https://mamot.fr/@q3k@hackerspace.pl/111528162905209453</a></p>
<p>Poland is part of the EU, meaning that they are required to uphold the provisions of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive, including Article 6, which bans this kind of reverse-engineering. The researchers are planning to present their work again at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg this month – Germany is also a party to the EUCD. The threat to researchers from presenting this work is real – but so is the threat to conferences that host them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/researchers-face-legal-threats-over-sdmi-hack/">https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/researchers-face-legal-threats-over-sdmi-hack/</a></p>
<p>20 years ago, Chris Anderson told me that it was unrealistic to expect tech companies to refuse demands for DRM from the entertainment companies whose media they hoped to play. My argument – then and now – was that any tech company that sells you a gadget that can have its features revoked is defrauding you. You're paying for x, y and z – and if they are contractually required to remove x and y on demand, they are selling you something that you can't rely on, without making that clear to you.</p>
<p>But it's worse than that. When a tech company designs a device for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades, they <em>invite</em> both external and internal parties to demand those downgrades. Like Pavel Chekov says, a phaser on the bridge in Act I is going to go off by Act III. Selling a product that can be remotely, irreversibly, nonconsensually downgraded <em>inevitably</em> results in  the worst person at the product-planning meeting proposing to do so. The fact that there are no penalties for doing so makes it impossible for the better people in that meeting to win the ensuing argument, leading to the moral injury of seeing a product you care about reduced to a pile of shit:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/25/moral-injury/#enshittification">https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/25/moral-injury/#enshittification</a></p>
<p>But even if everyone at that table is a swell egg who wouldn't dream of enshittifying the product, the existence of a remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrade feature makes the product vulnerable to <em>external</em> actors who will demand that it be used. Back in 2022, Adobe informed its customers that it had lost its deal to include Pantone colors in Photoshop, Illustrator and other "software as a service" packages. As a result, users would now have to start paying a monthly fee to see their own, completed images. Fail to pay the fee and all the Pantone-coded pixels in your artwork would just show up as black:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process">https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process</a></p>
<p>Adobe blamed this on Pantone, and there was lots of speculation about what had happened. Had Pantone jacked up its price to Adobe, so Adobe passed the price on to its users in the hopes of embarrassing Pantone? Who knows? Who <em>can</em> know? That's the point: you invested in Photoshop, you spent money and time creating images with it, but you have no way to know whether or how you'll be able to access those images in the future. Those terms can change at any time, and if you don't like it, you can go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>These companies are all run by CEOs who got their MBAs at Darth Vader University, where the first lesson is "I have altered the deal, pray I don't alter it further." Adobe <em>chose</em> to design its software so it would be vulnerable to this kind of demand, and then its <em>customers</em> paid for that choice. Sure, Pantone are dicks, but this is <em>Adobe's</em> fault. They stuck a KICK ME sign to your back, and Pantone obliged.</p>
<p>This keeps happening and it's <em>gonna</em> keep happening. Last week, Playstation owners who'd bought (or "bought") Warner TV shows got messages telling them that Warner had walked away from its deal to sell videos through the Playstation store, and so all the videos they'd paid for were going to be deleted forever. They wouldn't even get refunds (to be clear, refunds would also be bullshit – when I was a bookseller, I didn't get to break into your house and steal the books I'd sold you, not even if I left some cash on your kitchen table).</p>
<p>Sure, Warner is an unbelievably shitty company run by the single most guillotineable executive in all of Southern California, the loathsome David Zaslav, who oversaw the merger of Warner with Discovery. Zaslav is the creep who figured out that he could make more money <em>cancelling completed movies and TV shows</em> and taking a tax writeoff than he stood to make by releasing them:</p>
<p><a href="https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership">https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership</a></p>
<p>Imagine putting years of your life into making a program – showing up on set at 5AM and leaving your kids to get their own breakfast, performing stunts that could maim or kill you, working 16-hour days during the acute phase of the covid pandemic and driving home in the night, only to have this absolute <em>turd</em> of a man <em>delete</em> the program before anyone could see it, forever, to get a minor tax advantage. Talk about moral injury!</p>
<p>But without Sony's complicity in designing a remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrade feature into the Playstation, Zaslav's war on art and creative workers would be limited to material that hadn't been released yet. Thanks to Sony's awful choices, David Zaslav can break into your house, steal your movies – and he doesn't even have to leave a twenty on your kitchen table.</p>
<p>The point here – the point I made 20 years ago to Chris Anderson – is that <em>this is the foreseeable, inevitable result</em> of designing devices for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades. Anyone who was paying attention should have figured that out in the GW Bush administration. Anyone who does this <em>today</em>? Absolute flaming garbage.</p>
<p>Sure, Zaslav deserves to be staked out over and anthill and slathered in high-fructose corn syrup. But save the next anthill for the Sony exec who shipped a product that would let Zaslav come into your home and rob you. That piece of shit <em>knew what they were doing</em> and <em>they did it anyway</em>. <em>Fuck</em> them. Sideways. With a <em>brick</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studios keep making the case for stealing movies rather than paying for them. As Tyler James Hill wrote: "If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing":</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-js-content="true" data-js-dom="toc"><p><em><strong>Quick take:</strong> How do you spend your time at work and what is it costing you? Slack’s Workforce Index, based on survey responses from more than 10,000 desk workers around the globe, uncovers new findings on how to structure the workday to maximize productivity and strengthen employee well-being and satisfaction. </em></p>
<p>Key learnings include:</p>
<ul><li>Employees who log off at the end of the workday register 20% higher productivity scores than those who feel obligated to work after hours.</li>
<li>Making time for breaks during the workday improves employee productivity and well-being, and yet half of all desk workers say they rarely or never take breaks.</li>
<li>On average, desk workers say that the ideal amount of focus time is around four hours a day, and more than two hours a day in meetings is the tipping point at which a majority of workers feel overburdened by meetings.</li>
<li>Three out of every four desk workers report working in the 3 to 6pm timeframe, but of those, only one in four consider these hours highly productive.</li>
</ul>

<p>For decades, putting in extra hours at the office was seen by many as a sign of hard work and productivity, even a badge of honor. But new research from Slack shows despite that longstanding perception, working after hours is more often associated with <em>lower</em> levels of productivity—and could be a red flag that an employee is juggling too many tasks and needs help prioritizing and balancing their time.</p>
<p>The latest results from the Workforce Index, Slack’s survey of more than 10,000 desk workers, show the productivity gap depends on what’s driving workers to burn the midnight (or early morning) oil. About two out of every five desk workers (37%) are logging on outside of their company’s standard hours at least weekly, and more than half (54%) of these workers say it’s because they feel pressured to, not because they choose to.</p>
<p>Employees who feel <em>obligated</em> to work after-hours register 20% lower productivity scores than those who log off at the end of the standard workday. They also report:</p>
<ul><li>2.1x worse work-related stress</li>
<li>1.7x times lower satisfaction with their overall working environment</li>
<li>2x greater burnout</li>
</ul>
<section><figure><img alt="Employees who feel pressured to work after hours report 20% lower productivity throughout the day" loading="lazy" data-src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_After-Hours-Horchata.png" data-srcset="" src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_After-Hours-Horchata.png"></figure></section>
<p>Both groups say around 70% of their time spent working is productive—a sign that those working extra hours are putting in as much effort as their colleagues—but those who work after hours are 50% more likely to say their productivity is blocked by competing priorities compared to those who log a standard workday.</p>
<p>On the flip side, employees who work outside of standard hours by choice, to better suit their schedule or to pursue personal ambitions, report no negative impacts and even a slight uptick in their wellness and productivity scores.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“We’ve long seen a focus on quantity over quality across many aspects of work, from how we spend our time to how we define productivity. Constantly feeling like you need to catch up is hurting employees and businesses. This underscores the importance of building a culture of trust where employees feel safe enough to speak up when they need help prioritizing and have the right balance of time in the work day to get work done.”</p></blockquote></div>
<h2>When it comes to productivity, it’s not quantity of time spent working, it’s quality</h2>
<p>Results from the Workforce Index show that a significant portion of desk workers across the globe are struggling to balance their time at work, with different job tiers experiencing this problem in different ways.</p>
<p>More than one in four desk workers (27%), including more than half (55%) of executives, say they spend too much time in meetings. A similar share (25%) of all desk workers, including 43% of executives, say they spend too much time in email.</p>
<p>One in five (20%) don’t have enough time to connect with coworkers, and this problem is most pronounced among more junior employees.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, the data shows that many workers across all levels are plowing through their daily tasks without any down time: Half of desk workers surveyed (50%) say they rarely or never take breaks during the workday. These workers are 1.7x more likely to experience burnout.</p>
<p>Their break-taking counterparts, on the other hand, show 62% higher scores for work-life balance, 43% greater ability to manage stress and anxiety, 43% greater overall satisfaction, and—perhaps surprisingly—13% higher scores for productivity.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“Why did we all come to believe that we are more productive if we are always on and that we need to burn out in order to succeed? It goes back to the first Industrial Revolution, when we started revering machines. The goal of machines is to minimize downtime. But for the human operating system, downtime is not a bug, it’s a feature. Elite athletes know that recovery is part of peak performance. Downtime is a productivity multiplier.”</p></blockquote></div><section><figure><img alt="Workers who regularly take breaks have 13% higher productivity" loading="lazy" data-src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Taking-Breaks-Horchata.png" data-srcset="" src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Taking-Breaks-Horchata.png"></figure></section>
<h2>Prime productivity hours: Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl, the afternoon slump is real</h2>
<p>On average, desk workers say that 70% of their time at work is productive. When asked about prime hours for productivity, answers vary widely, with some desk workers preferring the morning and others preferring the evening. But no matter their preference, a majority (71%) of desk workers agree that the late afternoon is the worst time for work, with productivity plummeting between the hours of 3 and 6pm.</p>
<section><figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Afternoon-Slump-Purple.png" data-srcset="" src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Afternoon-Slump-Purple.png"></figure></section>
<p>While three out of every four desk workers report working in the 3-6pm timeframe, only one in four consider these hours highly productive.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“This goes to show that productivity isn’t linear. Productivity happens in bursts, on and off throughout a day, not necessarily in prescribed windows of time, and definitely not for eight consecutive hours. The ‘afternoon slump’ shouldn’t be seen as a bad thing; for many workers this could be an ideal time to take that break that will boost their overall productivity for the day.”</p></blockquote></div>
<p>The most productive people use time management strategies. They are 1.6x more likely to block time to complete specific tasks, 1.7x more likely to only check email at specific times, and 2.2x more likely to set focus timers.</p>
<h2>The “Goldilocks Zone” for work: How to balance your workday to optimize your productivity</h2>
<p>While there’s no one-size-fits-all schedule that applies across all industries, roles, and job levels, a close examination of the data reveals a formula emerging to set employees up for success.</p>
<p>Regardless of job tier, the research shows a “Goldilocks Zone” for the ideal balance of focus time, collaboration time, social connection, and downtime. On average, desk workers say the ideal amount of focus time is around four hours a day. More than two hours a day in meetings is the tipping point at which a majority of workers say they’re spending “too much time” in meetings, with a similar pattern emerging across all job levels. People who say they spend too much time in meetings are more than twice as likely to say they don’t have enough time to focus.</p>
<p>In contrast, about 10% of desk workers, most common among employees with less than one year at a company and those under 30, say they spend <em>too little</em> time in meetings, and this is also associated with decreased sense of belonging and productivity.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“Focus time, collaboration time, connection, and rest are like the macronutrients of a workday. The right balance gives you the energy you need to work your best. We cannot consider these critical components of our work in silos. To be our most effective, we must create the space for collaborative work and for focused work.”</p></blockquote></div>
<h2>What do desk workers most want from AI? Assistance and automation to rightsize the meeting load and free up time</h2>
<p>At the same time that desk workers are struggling with time management, many are also excited about the potential of AI tools to give them more command over balancing their time.</p>
<p>An overwhelming majority of executives—94%—feel some urgency to incorporate AI into their organizations, with half of executives saying they feel a strong sense of urgency. And yet, our survey shows that adoption of AI is still in its infancy, with only one in five desk workers reporting that they have used AI tools for work.</p>
<p>Given the low adoption, it’s not surprising that most desk workers (more than 80%) say that AI tools are not improving their productivity at work—yet. But they’re anticipating that AI will assist with one of the biggest struggles of the workday: meetings. The top three activities that employees expect AI will provide the most value in the future are 1) meeting notes and recaps 2) writing assistance and 3) automation of workflows.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“People at every job level may be shocked to see that more than two hours of meetings a day reduces productivity. It may feel unrealistic to many team leaders to try to hit that target today. But that’s where the newest generation of AI tools could be a lifesaver. An AI assistant that could accurately summarize meeting notes and automate common workflows could be the key that frees up our time and helps us to unlock the balance we need to set ourselves up for success.”</p></blockquote></div>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p><em>The Workforce Index surveyed 10,333 workers in the U.S., Australia, France, Germany, Japan and the U.K. between August 24 and September 15, 2023. The survey was administered by Qualtrics and did not target Slack or Salesforce employees or customers. Respondents were all desk workers, defined as employed full-time (30 or more hours per week) and either having one of the roles listed below or saying they “work with data, analyze information or think creatively”: executive management (e.g. president/partner, CEO, CFO, C-suite), senior management (e.g. executive VP, senior VP), middle management (e.g. department/group manager, VP), junior management (e.g. manager, team leader), senior staff (i.e. non-management), skilled office worker (e.g. analyst, graphic designer). For brevity, we refer to the survey population as “desk-based” or “desk workers.”</em></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What Is PySimpleGUI ❓</h2>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI is a Python package that enables Python programmers of all levels to create GUIs.  You specify your GUI window using a "layout" which contains widgets (they're called "Elements" in PySimpleGUI).  Your layout is used to create a window using one of the 4 supported frameworks to display and interact with your window.  Supported frameworks include tkinter, Qt, WxPython, or Remi. The term "wrapper" is sometimes used for these kinds of packages.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your PySimpleGUI code is simpler and shorter than writing directly using the underlying framework because PySimpleGUI implements much of the "boilerplate code" for you.  Additionally, interfaces are simplified to require as little code as possible to get the desired result.  Depending on the program and framework used, a PySimpleGUI program may require 1/2 to 1/10th amount of code to create an identical window using one of the frameworks directly.</p>
<p dir="auto">While the goal is to encapsulate/hide the specific objects and code used by the GUI framework you are running on top of, if needed you can access the frameworks' dependent widgets and windows directly. If a setting or feature is not yet exposed or accessible using the PySimpleGUI APIs, you are not walled off from the framework. You can expand capabilities without directly modifying the PySimpleGUI package itself.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bridging the "GUI Gap"</h2>
<p dir="auto">Python has brought a large number of people into the programming community. The number of programs and the range of areas it touches is mindboggling.  But more often than not, these technologies are out of reach of all but a handful of people.  The majority of Python programs are "command line" based. This isn't a problem for programmer-types as we're all used to interacting with computers through a text interface.  While programmers don't have a problem with command-line interfaces, most "normal people" do.  This creates a digital divide, a "GUI Gap".</p>
<p dir="auto">Adding a GUI to a program opens that program up to a wider audience. It becomes more approachable. GUIs can also make interacting with some programs easier, even for those that are comfortable with a command-line interface.  And finally, some problems require a GUI.</p>

<p dir="auto">It's been said by some that "the bar is pretty high" when it comes to learning GUI programming in Python.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">What happens when the bar is placed on the ground and can be stepped over?</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This is one of the questions that the PySimpleGUI project has tried to answer.  Here's a humorous look at what's been a not funny situation.</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">The results have been fascinating to witness and it's been touching to read the accounts of the journeys of users.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nothing prepared me for the emails that started to arrive soon after the first release of PySimpleGUI. They are heartwarming and heartbreaking tales of life-long dreams of creating a program that required a GUI. Some made a few attempts, giving up each time. Others never started once they started to research what was required.</p>
<p dir="auto">After recounting the varied and long road to finding PySimpleGUI, the stories became similar. They each found success and expressed joy and gratitude. The joy expressed in these messages was unlike anything I had encountered in the entirety of career in the computing field.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's been these emails and the messages of gratitude seen here in the GitHub Issues that made dedicating my life to his project a non-decision.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About Me 👋</h2>
<p dir="auto">Hi there!  I'm Mike.  You'll find me right here, on the PySimpleGUI GitHub, solving problems and continuously pushing PySimpleGUI forward.  I've dedicated my days, nights, and weekends to the project and PySimpleGUI users.  Our successes are ultimately shared.  I'm successful when you're successful.</p>
<p dir="auto">While I'm a relative newcomer to Python, I've been writing software since the 70s.  The majority of my career was spent creating products in Silicon Valley. I bring to PySimpleGUI the same professionalism and dedication as I did to the corporate products I developed. You are my customers now.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project Goals 🥅</h2>
<p dir="auto">Two of the most important goals of the PySimpleGUI project:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Having fun</li>
<li>Your success</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Fun</strong> as a goal on a serious project sounds odd, but it's a serious goal. I find writing these GUI programs to be a lot of fun. One reason is how little time it takes to write a complete solution. If we're not enjoying the process then someone's going to give up.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is a significant amount of documentation, a cookbook, 100's of demo programs to get you immediately running, a detailed call reference, YouTube videos, online Trinket demos, and more... all working to create... a fun experience.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Your Success</strong> is a shared goal.  PySimpleGUI was built for developers. You're my peeps. It's been an unexpected reward to see the results of the combined effort of users and PySimpleGUI. Use the documentation &amp; other materials to help build your application.  If you run into trouble, help is available by opening on <a href="http://issues.pysimplegui.org/" rel="nofollow">Issue on the PySimpleGUI GitHub</a>.  Take a look at the section on Support below.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example 2 - Interactive Window</h2>
<p dir="auto">In this example, our window will remain on the screen until the user closes the window or clicks the Quit button.  The main difference between the one-shot window you saw earlier and an interactive window is the addition of an "Event Loop". The Event Loop reads events and inputs from your window.  The heart of your application lives in the event loop.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import PySimpleGUI as sg

# Define the window's contents
layout = [[sg.Text(&quot;What's your name?&quot;)],
          [sg.Input(key='-INPUT-')],
          [sg.Text(size=(40,1), key='-OUTPUT-')],
          [sg.Button('Ok'), sg.Button('Quit')]]

# Create the window
window = sg.Window('Window Title', layout)

# Display and interact with the Window using an Event Loop
while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    # See if user wants to quit or window was closed
    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED or event == 'Quit':
        break
    # Output a message to the window
    window['-OUTPUT-'].update('Hello ' + values['-INPUT-'] + &quot;! Thanks for trying PySimpleGUI&quot;)

# Finish up by removing from the screen
window.close()"><pre><span>import</span> <span>PySimpleGUI</span> <span>as</span> <span>sg</span>

</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's take a quick look at some of the differences between this example and the one-shot window.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, you'll notice differences in the layout.  Two changes in particular are important.  One is the addition of the <code>key</code> parameter to the <code>Input</code> element and one of the <code>Text</code> elements.  A <code>key</code> is like a name for an element.  Or, in Python terms, it's like a dictionary key.  The <code>Input</code> element's key will be used as a dictionary key later in the code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another difference is the addition of this <code>Text</code> element:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="          [sg.Text(size=(40,1), key='-OUTPUT-')],"><pre>          [<span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>size</span><span>=</span>(<span>40</span>,<span>1</span>), <span>key</span><span>=</span><span>'-OUTPUT-'</span>)],</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">There are 2 parameters, the <code>key</code> we already covered.  The <code>size</code> parameter defines the size of the element in characters.  In this case, we're indicating that this <code>Text</code> element is 40 characters wide, by 1 character high.  Notice that there is no text string specified which means it'll be blank.  You can easily see this blank row in the window that's created.</p>
<p dir="auto">We also added a button,  "Quit".</p>
<p dir="auto">The Event Loop has our familiar <code>window.read()</code> call.</p>
<p dir="auto">Following the read is this if statement:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED or event == 'Quit':
        break"><pre>    <span>if</span> <span>event</span> <span>==</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>WINDOW_CLOSED</span> <span>or</span> <span>event</span> <span>==</span> <span>'Quit'</span>:
        <span>break</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This code is checking to see if the user closed the window by clicking the "X" or if they clicked the "Quit" button.  If either of these happens, then the code will break out of the event loop.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the window wasn't closed nor the Quit button clicked, then execution continues.  The only thing that could have happened is the user clicked the "Ok" button.  The last statement in the Event Loop is this one:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    window['-OUTPUT-'].update('Hello ' + values['-INPUT-'] + &quot;! Thanks for trying PySimpleGUI&quot;)"><pre>    <span>window</span>[<span>'-OUTPUT-'</span>].<span>update</span>(<span>'Hello '</span> <span>+</span> <span>values</span>[<span>'-INPUT-'</span>] <span>+</span> <span>"! Thanks for trying PySimpleGUI"</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This statement updates the <code>Text</code> element that has the key <code>-OUTPUT-</code> with a string.  <code>window['-OUTPUT-']</code> finds the element with the key <code>-OUTPUT-</code>.  That key belongs to our blank <code>Text</code> element.  Once that element is returned from the lookup, then its <code>update</code> method is called.  Nearly all elements have an <code>update</code> method.  This method is used to change the value of the element or to change some configuration of the element.</p>
<p dir="auto">If we wanted the text to be yellow, then that can be accomplished by adding a <code>text_color</code> parameter to the <code>update</code> method so that it reads:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    window['-OUTPUT-'].update('Hello ' + values['-INPUT-'] + &quot;! Thanks for trying PySimpleGUI&quot;,
                              text_color='yellow')"><pre>    <span>window</span>[<span>'-OUTPUT-'</span>].<span>update</span>(<span>'Hello '</span> <span>+</span> <span>values</span>[<span>'-INPUT-'</span>] <span>+</span> <span>"! Thanks for trying PySimpleGUI"</span>,
                              <span>text_color</span><span>=</span><span>'yellow'</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">After adding the <code>text_color</code> parameter, this is our new resulting window:</p>
<p dir="auto">

</p>
<p dir="auto">The parameters available for each element are documented in both the <a href="http://calls.pysimplegui.org/" rel="nofollow">call reference documentation</a> as well as the docstrings.  PySimpleGUI has extensive documentation to help you understand all of the options available to you. If you lookup the <code>update</code> method for the <code>Text</code> element, you'll find this definition for the call:</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">As you can see several things can be changed for a <code>Text</code> element.  The call reference documentation is a valuable resource that will make programming in PySimpleGUI, uhm, simple.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Layouts Are Funny LOL! 😆</h2>
<p dir="auto">Your window's layout is a "list of lists" (LOL).  Windows are broken down into "rows".  Each row in your window becomes a list in your layout.  Concatenate together all of the lists and you've got a layout...a list of lists.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is the same layout as before with an extra <code>Text</code> element added to each row so that you can more easily see how rows are defined:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="layout = [  [sg.Text('Row 1'), sg.Text(&quot;What's your name?&quot;)],
            [sg.Text('Row 2'), sg.Input()],
            [sg.Text('Row 3'), sg.Button('Ok')] ]"><pre><span>layout</span> <span>=</span> [  [<span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>'Row 1'</span>), <span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>"What's your name?"</span>)],
            [<span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>'Row 2'</span>), <span>sg</span>.<span>Input</span>()],
            [<span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>'Row 3'</span>), <span>sg</span>.<span>Button</span>(<span>'Ok'</span>)] ]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Each row of this layout is a list of elements that will be displayed on that row in your window.</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/layout-with-rows.jpg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/layout-with-rows.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">Using lists to define your GUI has some huge advantages over how GUI programming is done using other frameworks.  For example, you can use Python's list comprehension to create a grid of buttons in a single line of code.</p>
<p dir="auto">These 3 lines of code:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import PySimpleGUI as sg

layout = [[sg.Button(f'{row}, {col}') for col in range(4)] for row in range(4)]

event, values = sg.Window('List Comprehensions', layout).read(close=True)"><pre><span>import</span> <span>PySimpleGUI</span> <span>as</span> <span>sg</span>

<span>layout</span> <span>=</span> [[<span>sg</span>.<span>Button</span>(<span>f'<span><span>{</span><span>row</span><span>}</span></span>, <span><span>{</span><span>col</span><span>}</span></span>'</span>) <span>for</span> <span>col</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>4</span>)] <span>for</span> <span>row</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>4</span>)]

<span>event</span>, <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>Window</span>(<span>'List Comprehensions'</span>, <span>layout</span>).<span>read</span>(<span>close</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">produces this window which has a 4 x 4 grid of buttons:</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/4x4grid.jpg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/4x4grid.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">Recall how "fun" is one of the goals of the project.  It's fun to directly apply Python's powerful basic capabilities to GUI problems. Instead of pages of code to create a GUI, it's a few (or often 1) lines of code.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Collapsing Code</h2>
<p dir="auto">It's possible to condense a window's code down to a single line of code.  The layout definition, window creation, display, and data collection can all be written in this line of code:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="event, values = sg.Window('Window Title', [[sg.Text(&quot;What's your name?&quot;)],[sg.Input()],[sg.Button('Ok')]]).read(close=True)"><pre><span>event</span>, <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>Window</span>(<span>'Window Title'</span>, [[<span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>"What's your name?"</span>)],[<span>sg</span>.<span>Input</span>()],[<span>sg</span>.<span>Button</span>(<span>'Ok'</span>)]]).<span>read</span>(<span>close</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/ex1-tkinter.jpg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/ex1-tkinter.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">The same window is shown and returns the same values as the example showing the sections of a PySimpleGUI program.  Being able to do so much with so little enables you to quickly and easily add GUIs to your Python code.  If you want to display some data and get a choice from your user, it can be done in a line of code instead of a page of code.</p>
<p dir="auto">By using short-hand aliases, you can save even more space in your code by using fewer characters.  All of the Elements have one or more shorter names that can be used.  For example, the <code>Text</code> element can be written simply as <code>T</code>. The <code>Input</code> element can be written as <code>I</code> and the <code>Button</code> as <code>B</code>.  Your single-line window code thus becomes:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="event, values = sg.Window('Window Title', [[sg.T(&quot;What's your name?&quot;)],[sg.I()],[sg.B('Ok')]]).read(close=True)"><pre><span>event</span>, <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>Window</span>(<span>'Window Title'</span>, [[<span>sg</span>.<span>T</span>(<span>"What's your name?"</span>)],[<span>sg</span>.<span>I</span>()],[<span>sg</span>.<span>B</span>(<span>'Ok'</span>)]]).<span>read</span>(<span>close</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>)</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Code Portability</h3>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI is currently capable of running on 4 Python GUI Frameworks.  The framework to use is specified using the import statement.  Change the import and you'll change the underlying GUI framework.  For some programs, no other changes are needed than the import statement to run on a different GUI framework.  In the example above, changing the import from <code>PySimpleGUI</code> to <code>PySimpleGUIQt</code>, <code>PySimpleGUIWx</code>, <code>PySimpleGUIWeb</code> will change the framework.</p>

<p dir="auto">Porting GUI code from one framework to another (e.g. moving your code from tkinter to Qt) usually requires a rewrite of your code.  PySimpleGUI is designed to enable you to have easy movement between the frameworks.  Sometimes some changes are required of you, but the goal is to have highly portable code with minimal changes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some features, like a System Tray Icon, are not available on all of the ports.  The System Tray Icon feature is available on the Qt and WxPython ports.  A simulated version is available on tkinter.  There is no support for a System Tray icon in the PySimpleGUIWeb port.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installing  💾</h2>
<p dir="auto">Two common ways of installing PySimpleGUI:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>pip to install from PyPI</li>
<li>Download the file PySimpleGUI.py and place in your application's folder</li>
</ol>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pip Installing &amp; Upgrading</h3>
<p dir="auto">The current suggested way of invoking the <code>pip</code> command is by running it as a module using Python.  Previously the command <code>pip</code> or <code>pip3</code> was directly onto a command-line / shell.  The suggested way</p>
<p dir="auto">Initial install for Windows:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>python -m pip install PySimpleGUI</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Initial install for Linux and MacOS:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>python3 -m pip install PySimpleGUI</code></p>
<p dir="auto">To upgrade using <code>pip</code>, you simply add 2 parameters to the line <code>--upgrade --no-cache-dir</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Upgrade installation on Windows:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>python -m pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir PySimpleGUI</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Upgrade for Linux and MacOS:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>python3 -m pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir PySimpleGUI</code></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Single File Installing</h3>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI was created as a single .py file so that it would be very easy for you to install it, even on systems that are not connected to the internet like a Raspberry Pi.  It's as simple as placing the PySimpleGUI.py file into the same folder as your application that imports it. Python will use your local copy when performing the import.</p>
<p dir="auto">When installing using just the .py file, you can get it from either PyPI or if you want to run the most recent unreleased version then you'll download it from GitHub.</p>
<p dir="auto">To install from PyPI, download either the wheel or the .gz file and unzip the file.  If you rename the .whl file to .zip you can open it just like any normal zip file.  You will find the PySimpleGUI.py file in one of the folders.  Copy this file to your application's folder and you're done.</p>
<p dir="auto">The PyPI link for the tkinter version of PySimpleGUI is:
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/#files" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/#files</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The GitHub repo's latest version can be found here:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/PySimpleGUI.py" rel="nofollow">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/PySimpleGUI.py</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Now some of you are thinking, "yea, but, wait, having a single huge source file is a terrible idea".  And, yea, <em>sometimes</em> it can be a terrible idea.  In this case, the benefits greatly outweighed the downside.  Lots of concepts in computer science are tradeoffs or subjective.  As much as some would like it to be, not everything is black and white.  Many times the answer to a question is "it depends".</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Galleries 🎨</h2>
<p dir="auto">Work on a more formal gallery of user-submitted GUIs as well as those found on GitHub is underway but as of this writing it's not complete.  There are currently 2 places you can go to see some screenshots in a centralized way.  Hopefully, a Wiki or other mechanism can be released soon to do justice to the awesome creations people are making.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">User Submitted Gallery</h3>
<p dir="auto">The first is a <a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/10" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/10/hovercard">user submitted screenshots issue</a> located on the GitHub.  It's an informal way for people to show off what they've made.  It's not ideal, but it was a start.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Massive Scraped GitHub Images</h3>
<p dir="auto">The second is a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g67ms0darox0i2p/AAAMrkIM6C64nwHLDkboCWnaa?dl=0" rel="nofollow">massive gallery of over 3,000 images</a> scraped from 1,000 projects on GitHub that are reportedly using PySimpleGUI.  It's not been hand-filtered and there are plenty of old screenshots that were used in the early documentation.  But, you may find something in there that sparks your imagination.</p>
<hr>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Uses for PySimpleGUI 🔨</h2>
<p dir="auto">The following sections showcase a fraction of the uses for PySimpleGUI.  There are over 1,000 projects on GitHub alone that use PySimpleGUI.  It's truly amazing how possibilities have opened up for so many people.  Many users have spoken about previously attempting to create a GUI in Python and failing, but finally achieving their dreams when they tried PySimpleGUI.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Your First GUI</h2>
<p dir="auto">Of course one of the best uses of PySimpleGUI is getting you into making GUIs for your Python projects.  You can start as small as requesting a filename.  For this, you only need to make a single call to one of the "high-level functions" called <code>popup</code>.  There are all kinds of popups, some collect information.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>popup</code> on itself makes a window to display information.  You can pass multiple parameters just like a print.  If you want to get information, then you will call functions that start with <code>popup_get_</code> such as <code>popup_get_filename</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Adding a single line to get a filename instead of specifying a filename on the command line can transform your program into one that "normal people" will feel comfortable using.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import PySimpleGUI as sg

filename = sg.popup_get_file('Enter the file you wish to process')
sg.popup('You entered', filename)"><pre><span>import</span> <span>PySimpleGUI</span> <span>as</span> <span>sg</span>

<span>filename</span> <span>=</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>popup_get_file</span>(<span>'Enter the file you wish to process'</span>)
<span>sg</span>.<span>popup</span>(<span>'You entered'</span>, <span>filename</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This code will display 2 popup windows.  One to get the filename, which can be browsed to or pasted into the input box.</p>
<p dir="auto">

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rainmeter-Style Windows</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/RainmeterStyleWidgets.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/RainmeterStyleWidgets.jpg" alt="img" width="500px"></a>
The default settings for GUI frameworks don't tend to produce the nicest looking windows.  However, with some attention to detail, you can do several things to make windows look attractive.  PySimpleGUI makes it easier to manipulate colors and features like removing the title bar.  The result is windows that don't look like your typical tkinter windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is an example of how you can create windows that don't look like your typical tkinter in windows.  In this example, the windows have their titlebars removed.  The result is windows that look much like those found when using Rainmeter, a desktop widget program.</p>
<p>
You can easily set the transparency of a window as well.  Here are more examples of desktop widgets in the same Rainmeter style.  Some are dim appearing because they are semi-transparent.
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/semi-transparent.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/semi-transparent.jpg" alt="img" width="500px"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Both of these effects; removing the titlebar and making a window semi-transparent, are achieved by setting 2 parameters when creating the window.  This is an example of how PySimpleGUI enables easy access to features.  And because PySimpleGUI code is portable across the GUI frameworks, these same parameters work for the other ports such as Qt.</p>
<p dir="auto">Changing the Window creation call in Example 1 to this line of code produces a similar semi-transparent window:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="window = sg.Window('My window', layout, no_titlebar=True, alpha_channel=0.5)"><pre><span>window</span> <span>=</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>Window</span>(<span>'My window'</span>, <span>layout</span>, <span>no_titlebar</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>, <span>alpha_channel</span><span>=</span><span>0.5</span>)</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Games</h2>
<p dir="auto">While not specifically written as a game development SDK, PySimpleGUI makes the development of some games quite easy.</p>

<p dir="auto">Capturing and displaying video from your webcam in a GUI is 4 lines of PySimpleGUI code.  Even more impressive is that these 4 lines of code work with the tkinter, Qt, and Web ports.  You can display your webcam, in realtime, in a browser using the same code that displays the image using tkinter.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>Media playback, audio and video, can also be achieved using the VLC player.  A demo application is provided to you so that you have a working example to start from. Everything you see in this readme is available to you as a starting point for your own creations.

<p dir="auto">AI and Python have long been a recognized superpower when the two are paired together. What's often missing however is a way for users to interact with these AI algorithms familiarly, using a GUI.</p>
<p dir="auto">These YOLO demos are a great example of how a GUI can make a tremendous difference in interacting with AI algorithms.  Notice two sliders at the bottom of these windows.  These 2 sliders change a couple of the parameters used by the YOLO algorithm.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>If you were tuning your YOLO demo using only the command line, you would need to set the parameters, once, when you launch the application, see how they perform, stop the application, change the parameters, and finally restart the application with the new parameters.

<p dir="auto">There are SO many AI programs that have been published that are command-line driven.  This in itself isn't a huge hurdle, but it's enough of a "pain in the ass" to type/paste the filename you want to colorize on the command line, run the program, then open the resulting output file in a file viewer.</p>
<p dir="auto">GUIs have the power to <strong>change the user experience</strong>, to fill the "GUI Gap".  With this colorizer example, the user only needs to supply a folder full of images, and then click on an image to both colorize and display the result.</p>
<p dir="auto">The program/algorithm to do the colorization was freely available, ready to use.  What was missing is the ease of use that a GUI could bring.</p>

<p dir="auto">Matplotlib is a popular choice with Python users.  PySimpleGUI can enable you to embed Matplotlib graphs directly into your GUI window.  You can even embed the interactive controls into your window if you want to retain the Matplotlib interactive features.</p>

Using PySimpleGUI's color themes, you can produce graphs that are a notch above default graphs that most people create in Matplotlib.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/JumpCutter.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/JumpCutter.png" alt="img" width="500px"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "GUI Gap" mentioned earlier can be easily solved using PySimpleGUI.  You don't even need to have the source code to the program you wish to add a GUI onto.  A "front-end" GUI is one that collects information that is then passed to a command-line application.</p>
<p dir="auto">Front-end GUIs are a fantastic way for a programmer to distribute an application that users were reluctant to use previously because they didn't feel comfortable using a command-line interface.  These GUIs are your only choice for command-line programs that you don't have access to the source code for.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>This example is a front-end for a program called "Jump Cutter".  The parameters are collected via the GUI, a command-line is constructed using those parameters, and then the command is executed with the output from the command-line program being routed to the GUI interface.  In this example, you can see in yellow the command that was executed.

<p dir="auto">Because PySimpleGUI is compatible back to Python 3.4, it is capable of creating a GUI for your Raspberry Pi projects.  It works particularly well when paired with a touchscreen.  You can also use PySimpleGUIWeb to control your Pi if it doesn't have a monitor attached.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Easy Access to Advanced Features</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/Customized%20Titlebar.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/Customized%20Titlebar.gif" alt="img" width="500px" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Because it's very easy to access many of the underlying GUI frameworks' features, it's possible to piece together capabilities to create applications that look nothing like those produced using the GUI framework directly.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>For example, it's not possible to change the color/look-and-feel of a titlebar using tkinter or the other GUI packages, but with PySimpleGUI it's easy to create windows that appear as if they have a custom titlebar.
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/Desktop%20Bouncing%20Balls.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/Desktop%20Bouncing%20Balls.gif" alt="img" width="500px" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Unbelievably, this window is using tkinter to achieve what appears to be something like a screensaver.</p>
<p dir="auto">On windows, tkinter can completely remove the background from your application.  Once again, PySimpleGUI makes accessing these capabilities trivial.  Creating a transparent window requires adding a single parameter to the call that creates your <code>Window</code>.  One parameter change can result in a simple application with this effect:</p>
<p dir="auto">You can interact with everything on your desktop, clicking through a full-screen window.</p>
<hr>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Themes</h2>
<p dir="auto">Tired of the default grey GUIs?  PySimpleGUI makes it trivial for your window to look nice by making a single call to the <code>theme</code> function.  There are over 150 different color themes available for you to choose:</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/ThemePreview.jpg" alt="img" width="900px"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">With most GUI frameworks, you must specify the color for every widget you create.  PySimpleGUI takes this chore from you and will automatically color the Elements to match your chosen theme.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use a theme, call the <code>theme</code> function with the name of the theme before creating your window. You can add spaces for readability.  To set the theme to "Dark Grey 9":</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import PySimpleGUI as sg

sg.theme('dark grey 9')"><pre><span>import</span> <span>PySimpleGUI</span> <span>as</span> <span>sg</span>

<span>sg</span>.<span>theme</span>(<span>'dark grey 9'</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This single line of code changes the window's appearance entirely:</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/DarkGrey.jpg" alt="img" width="400px"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">The theme changed colors of the background, text, input background, input text, and button colors.  In other GUI packages, to change color schemes like this, you would need to specify the colors of each widget individually, requiring numerous changes to your code.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you still have a question or need help...  no problem... help is available to you, at no cost. Simply <a href="http://issues.pysimplegui.org/" rel="nofollow">file an Issue</a> on the PySimpleGUI GitHub repo and you'll get help.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nearly all software companies have a form that accompanies bug reports.  It's not a bad trade... fill in the form, get free software support.  This information helps get you an answer efficiently.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition to requesting information such as the version numbers of PySimpleGUI and underlying GUI frameworks, you're also given a checklist of items that may help you solve your problem.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>Please fill in the form.</strong></em>  It may feel pointless to you.  It may feel painful, despite it taking just a moment.  It helps get you a solution faster.

<p dir="auto">Financial support for the project is greatly appreciated.  To be honest, financial help is needed.  It's expensive just keeping the lights on.  The domain name registrations, a long list of subscriptions for things like Trinket, consulting help, etc., quickly add up to a sizable recurring cost.</p>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI wasn't inexpensive to create. While a labor of love, it was very laborious over several years, and quite a bit was invested, and continues to be invested, in creating what you see today.</p>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI has an open-source license and it would be great if it could remain that way.  If you or your company (especially if you're using PySimpleGUI in a company) are benefiting financially by using PySimpleGUI, you have the capability of extending the life of the project for you and other users.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Buy Me A Coffee</h3>
<p dir="auto">Buy Me a Coffee is a great way to publicly support developers.  It's quick, easy, and your contribution is recorded so that others can see that you're a supporter of PySimpleGUI.  You can also choose to make your donation private.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/PySimpleGUI">GitHub recurring sponsorship</a> is how you can sponsor the project at varying levels of support on an ongoing basis.  It's how many Open Source developers are able to receive corporate level sponsorship.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your help in financially contributing to the project would be greatly appreciated. Being an Open Source developer is financially challenging.  YouTube video creators are able to make a living creating videos.  It's not so easy yet for Open Source developers.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Thank you for the Thank You's</h2>
<p dir="auto">To everyone that's helped, in whatever fashion, I'm very very grateful.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even taking a moment to say "thank you" helps, and a HUGE number of you have done that.  It's been an amazing number actually.  I value these thanks and find inspiration in the words alone.  Every message is a little push forward.  It adds a little bit of energy and keeps the whole project's momentum.  I'm so very grateful to everyone that's helped in whatever form it's been.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing  👷</h2>
<p dir="auto">While PySimpleGUI is currently licensed under an open-source license, the project itself is structured like a proprietary product.  Pull Requests are not accepted.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the best ways for you to contribute code is to write and publish applications.  Users are inspired by seeing what other users build.  Here's a simple set of steps you can take - Create a GitHub repo, post the code, and include a screenshot in your repo's readme file.  Then come back to the PySimpleGUI repo and post a screenshot in Issue #10 or in the project's WIKI.</p>
<p dir="auto">If there is a feature missing that you need or you have an enhancement to suggest, then <a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=issue-form---must-fill-in-this-form-with-every-new-issue-submitted.md&amp;title=%5B+Enhancement%2FBug%2FQuestion%5D+My+problem+is...">open an Issue</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Special Thanks 🙏</h2>
<p dir="auto">The PySimpleGUI team is tiny and they're all superstars. Every week I've been stunned by what they do. Dream-team is an understatement.  Simply put <a href="https://github.com/Chr0nicT">@Chr0nicT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jason990420">@jason990420</a>, <a href="https://github.com/snaiel">@Snaiel</a> and Mike<a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI">@PySimpleGUI</a> <em><strong>are</strong></em> PySimpleGUI.</p>
<p dir="auto">This version of the PySimpleGUI readme wouldn't have come together without the help from <a href="https://github.com/M4cs">@M4cs</a>. He's a fantastic developer and has been a PySimpleGUI supporter since the project's launch.   <a href="https://github.com/israel-dryer">@israel-dryer</a> is another long-term supporter and has written several PySimpleGUI programs that pushed the envelope of the package's capabilities.  The unique minesweeper that uses an image for the board was created by Israel.  <a href="https://github.com/jason990420">@jason990420</a> surprised many when he published the first card game using PySimpleGUI that you see pictured above as well as the first minesweeper game made with PySimpleGUI.  <a href="https://github.com/Chr0nicT">@Chr0nicT</a> is the youngest developer I've worked with, ever, on projects. This kid shocks me on a regular basis.  Ask for a capability, such as the PySimpleGUI GitHub Issues form error checking bot, and it simply happens regardless of the technologies involved. I'm fortunate that we were introduced. Someday he's going to be whisked away, but until then we're all benefiting from his talent. <a href="https://github.com/snaiel">@Snaiel</a> made the Udemy course happen. It wouldn't have been 1/4th of what it is without his amazing skills in video production, course design, marketing brilliance, and web programming. The Japanese version of the readme was greatly improved with help from  <a href="https://github.com/okajun35">@okajun35</a>. <a href="https://github.com/nngogol">@nngogol</a> has had a very large impact on the project, also getting involved with PySimpleGUI in the first year of initial release.  He wrote a designer, came up with the familiar window[key] lookup syntax, wrote the tools that create the documentation, designed the first set of doc strings as well as tools that generate the online documenation using the PySimpleGUI code itself.  PySimpleGUI would not be where it is today were it not for the help of these individuals.</p>
<p dir="auto">The more than 4,000 GitHub repos that use PySimpleGUI are owed a "Thank You" as well, for it is <em>you</em> that has been the inspiration that fuels this project's engine.</p>
<p dir="auto">The overseas users that post on Twitter overnight are the spark that starts the day's work on PySimpleGUI. They've been a source of positive energy that gets the development engine started and ready to run every day. As a token of appreciation, this readme file has been translated into <a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/readme.ja.md">Japanese</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI users have been the best user community an Open Source developer could hope for. I've never seen expressions of gratitude and joy like PySimpleGUI users show on a daily basis.</p>

            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OpenBao</h2>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note</strong>: We take OpenBao's security and our users' trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in Vault, <em>please responsibly disclose</em> by contacting us at <a href="https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/development/openbao-security@lists.lfedge.org">openbao-security@lists.lfedge.org</a>.</p>

<li>Discussion forum: <a href="https://github.com/openbao/openbao/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a></li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/development/bao.svg"><img width="300" alt="OpenBao Mascot" src="https://github.com/openbao/openbao/raw/development/bao.svg"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive data including secrets, certificates, and keys. The OpenBao community intends to provide this software under an OSI-approved open-source license, led by a community run under open governance principles.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where OpenBao steps in.</p>
<p dir="auto">The key features of OpenBao are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Secure Secret Storage</strong>: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored
in OpenBao. OpenBao encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent
storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access
your secrets. OpenBao can write to disk, <a href="https://www.consul.io/" rel="nofollow">Consul</a>,
and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Dynamic Secrets</strong>: OpenBao can generate secrets on-demand for some
systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application
needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks OpenBao for credentials, and OpenBao
will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After
creating these dynamic secrets, OpenBao will also automatically revoke them
after the lease is up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: OpenBao can encrypt and decrypt data without storing
it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and
developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without
having to design their own encryption methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Leasing and Renewal</strong>: All secrets in OpenBao have a <em>lease</em> associated
with them. At the end of the lease, OpenBao will automatically revoke that
secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Revocation</strong>: OpenBao has built-in support for secret revocation. OpenBao
can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example,
all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type.
Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the
case of an intrusion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation, Getting Started, and Certification Exams</h2>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Developing Vault</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to work on OpenBao itself or any of its built-in systems, you'll
first need <a href="https://www.golang.org/" rel="nofollow">Go</a> installed on your machine.</p>
<p dir="auto">For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH" rel="nofollow">GOPATH</a>. Ensure that <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> is in
your path as some distributions bundle the old version of build tools. Next, clone this
repository. OpenBao uses <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules">Go Modules</a>,
so it is recommended that you clone the repository <em><strong>outside</strong></em> of the GOPATH.
You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your environment:</p>

<p dir="auto">To compile a development version of OpenBao, run <code>make</code> or <code>make dev</code>. This will
put the OpenBao binary in the <code>bin</code> and <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> folders:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ make dev
...
$ bin/bao
..."><pre>$ make dev
...
$ bin/bao
...</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To compile a development version of Vault with the UI, run <code>make static-dist dev-ui</code>. This will
put the OpenBao binary in the <code>bin</code> and <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> folders:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ make static-dist dev-ui
...
$ bin/bao
..."><pre>$ make static-dist dev-ui
...
$ bin/bao
...</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To run tests, type <code>make test</code>. Note: this requires Docker to be installed. If
this exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!</p>

<p dir="auto">If you're developing a specific package, you can run tests for just that
package by specifying the <code>TEST</code> variable. For example below, only
<code>vault</code> package tests will be run.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ make test TEST=./vault
..."><pre>$ make <span>test</span> TEST=./vault
...</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Acceptance Tests</h3>
<p dir="auto">OpenBao has comprehensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing" rel="nofollow">acceptance tests</a>
covering most of the features of the secret and auth methods.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're working on a feature of a secret or auth method and want to
verify it is functioning (and also hasn't broken anything else), we recommend
running the acceptance tests.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Warning:</strong> The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify <em>real resources</em>, which
may incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug, it is technically
possible that broken backends could leave dangling data behind. Therefore,
please run the acceptance tests at your own risk. At the very least,
we recommend running them in their own private account for whatever backend
you're testing.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run the acceptance tests, invoke <code>make testacc</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul
..."><pre>$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul
...</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>TEST</code> variable is required, and you should specify the folder where the
backend is. The <code>TESTARGS</code> variable is recommended to filter down to a specific
resource to test, since testing all of them at once can sometimes take a very
long time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Acceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for
things such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell
you what to set, so it is not documented here.</p>

      Why does this matter?
    </p> <p>
      Anonymous genetic testing can eliminate several potential vulnerabilities individuals
      are exposed to when purchasing genetic testing services. Most importantly, enabling
      individuals to remain anonymous would eliminate the dependence on data de-identification
      by personal genomics companies prior to data sharing.
    </p></div> <div data-v-d23d7b80=""><div data-v-d23d7b80=""> <p>
        Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, can enable (pseudo)anonymous payments because they rely on blockchain addresses that can have no connection to real-life identities such as name, address or bank accounts. Alternatively, a prepaid debit card purchased with cash can be used to make anonymous payments.

        Consider using an email address that is not tied to any personal information. Creating a new email address that you are using for nebula purposes only through a service such as <a target="_blank" href="https://protonmail.com/" data-v-d23d7b80="">Protonmail</a> is a great first step.

        A virtual private network (VPN) is a tool that allows you to browse the internet while maintaining your privacy. It is good practice to always use a VPN, especially when you are purchasing anything or sharing any personal information online.

<h2>"If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing" (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/#tyler-james-hill">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>20 years ago, I got in a (friendly) public spat with Chris Anderson, who was then the editor in chief of <em>Wired</em>. I'd publicly noted my disappointment with glowing <em>Wired</em> reviews of DRM-encumbered digital devices, prompting Anderson to call me unrealistic for expecting the magazine to condemn gadgets for their DRM:</p>
<p><a href="https://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/is_drm_evil.html">https://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/is_drm_evil.html</a></p>
<p>I replied in public, telling him that he'd misunderstood. This wasn't an issue of ideological purity – it was about good reviewing practice. <em>Wired</em> was telling readers to buy a product because it had features x, y and z, but at any time in the future, without warning, without recourse, the vendor could switch off any of those features:</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2004/12/29/cory-responds-to-wired-editor-on-drm/">https://memex.craphound.com/2004/12/29/cory-responds-to-wired-editor-on-drm/</a></p>
<p>I proposed that all <em>Wired</em> endorsements for DRM-encumbered products should come with this disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  WARNING: THIS DEVICE’S FEATURES ARE SUBJECT TO REVOCATION WITHOUT NOTICE, ACCORDING TO TERMS SET OUT IN SECRET NEGOTIATIONS. YOUR INVESTMENT IS CONTINGENT ON THE GOODWILL OF THE WORLD’S MOST PARANOID, TECHNOPHOBIC ENTERTAINMENT EXECS. THIS DEVICE AND DEVICES LIKE IT ARE TYPICALLY USED TO CHARGE YOU FOR THINGS YOU USED TO GET FOR FREE — BE SURE TO FACTOR IN THE PRICE OF BUYING ALL YOUR MEDIA OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AT NO TIME IN HISTORY HAS ANY ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY GOTTEN A SWEET DEAL LIKE THIS FROM THE ELECTRONICS PEOPLE, BUT THIS TIME THEY’RE GETTING A TOTAL WALK. HERE, PUT THIS IN YOUR MOUTH, IT’LL MUFFLE YOUR WHIMPERS.
</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Wired</em> didn't take me up on this suggestion.</p>
<p>But I was right. The ability to change features, prices, and availability of things you've <em>already paid for</em> is a powerful temptation to corporations. Inkjet printers were always a sleazy business, but once these printers got directly connected to the internet, companies like HP started pushing out "security updates" that modified your printer to make it reject the third-party ink you'd paid for:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer</a></p>
<p>Now, this scam wouldn't work if you could just put things back the way they were before the "update," which is where the DRM comes in. A thicket of IP laws make reverse-engineering DRM-encumbered products into a <em>felony</em>. Combine always-on network access with indiscriminate criminalization of user modification, and the enshittification will follow, as surely as night follows day.</p>
<p>This is the root of all the right to repair shenanigans. Sure, companies withhold access to diagnostic codes and parts, but codes can be extracted and parts can be cloned. The real teeth in blocking repair comes from the law, not the tech. The company that makes McDonald's wildly unreliable McFlurry machines makes a fortune charging franchisees to fix these eternally broken appliances. When a third party threatened this racket by reverse-engineering the DRM that blocked independent repair, they got buried in legal threats:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/20/euthanize-rentier-enablers/#cold-war">https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/20/euthanize-rentier-enablers/#cold-war</a></p>
<p>Everybody loves this racket. In Poland, a team of security researchers at the OhMyHack conference just presented their teardown of the anti-repair features in NEWAG Impuls <em>locomotives</em>. NEWAG boobytrapped their trains to try and detect if they've been independently serviced, and to respond to any unauthorized repairs by bricking themselves:</p>
<p><a href="https://mamot.fr/@q3k@hackerspace.pl/111528162905209453">https://mamot.fr/@q3k@hackerspace.pl/111528162905209453</a></p>
<p>Poland is part of the EU, meaning that they are required to uphold the provisions of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive, including Article 6, which bans this kind of reverse-engineering. The researchers are planning to present their work again at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg this month – Germany is also a party to the EUCD. The threat to researchers from presenting this work is real – but so is the threat to conferences that host them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/researchers-face-legal-threats-over-sdmi-hack/">https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/researchers-face-legal-threats-over-sdmi-hack/</a></p>
<p>20 years ago, Chris Anderson told me that it was unrealistic to expect tech companies to refuse demands for DRM from the entertainment companies whose media they hoped to play. My argument – then and now – was that any tech company that sells you a gadget that can have its features revoked is defrauding you. You're paying for x, y and z – and if they are contractually required to remove x and y on demand, they are selling you something that you can't rely on, without making that clear to you.</p>
<p>But it's worse than that. When a tech company designs a device for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades, they <em>invite</em> both external and internal parties to demand those downgrades. Like Pavel Chekov says, a phaser on the bridge in Act I is going to go off by Act III. Selling a product that can be remotely, irreversibly, nonconsensually downgraded <em>inevitably</em> results in  the worst person at the product-planning meeting proposing to do so. The fact that there are no penalties for doing so makes it impossible for the better people in that meeting to win the ensuing argument, leading to the moral injury of seeing a product you care about reduced to a pile of shit:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/25/moral-injury/#enshittification">https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/25/moral-injury/#enshittification</a></p>
<p>But even if everyone at that table is a swell egg who wouldn't dream of enshittifying the product, the existence of a remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrade feature makes the product vulnerable to <em>external</em> actors who will demand that it be used. Back in 2022, Adobe informed its customers that it had lost its deal to include Pantone colors in Photoshop, Illustrator and other "software as a service" packages. As a result, users would now have to start paying a monthly fee to see their own, completed images. Fail to pay the fee and all the Pantone-coded pixels in your artwork would just show up as black:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process">https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process</a></p>
<p>Adobe blamed this on Pantone, and there was lots of speculation about what had happened. Had Pantone jacked up its price to Adobe, so Adobe passed the price on to its users in the hopes of embarrassing Pantone? Who knows? Who <em>can</em> know? That's the point: you invested in Photoshop, you spent money and time creating images with it, but you have no way to know whether or how you'll be able to access those images in the future. Those terms can change at any time, and if you don't like it, you can go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>These companies are all run by CEOs who got their MBAs at Darth Vader University, where the first lesson is "I have altered the deal, pray I don't alter it further." Adobe <em>chose</em> to design its software so it would be vulnerable to this kind of demand, and then its <em>customers</em> paid for that choice. Sure, Pantone are dicks, but this is <em>Adobe's</em> fault. They stuck a KICK ME sign to your back, and Pantone obliged.</p>
<p>This keeps happening and it's <em>gonna</em> keep happening. Last week, Playstation owners who'd bought (or "bought") Warner TV shows got messages telling them that Warner had walked away from its deal to sell videos through the Playstation store, and so all the videos they'd paid for were going to be deleted forever. They wouldn't even get refunds (to be clear, refunds would also be bullshit – when I was a bookseller, I didn't get to break into your house and steal the books I'd sold you, not even if I left some cash on your kitchen table).</p>
<p>Sure, Warner is an unbelievably shitty company run by the single most guillotineable executive in all of Southern California, the loathsome David Zaslav, who oversaw the merger of Warner with Discovery. Zaslav is the creep who figured out that he could make more money <em>cancelling completed movies and TV shows</em> and taking a tax writeoff than he stood to make by releasing them:</p>
<p><a href="https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership">https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership</a></p>
<p>Imagine putting years of your life into making a program – showing up on set at 5AM and leaving your kids to get their own breakfast, performing stunts that could maim or kill you, working 16-hour days during the acute phase of the covid pandemic and driving home in the night, only to have this absolute <em>turd</em> of a man <em>delete</em> the program before anyone could see it, forever, to get a minor tax advantage. Talk about moral injury!</p>
<p>But without Sony's complicity in designing a remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrade feature into the Playstation, Zaslav's war on art and creative workers would be limited to material that hadn't been released yet. Thanks to Sony's awful choices, David Zaslav can break into your house, steal your movies – and he doesn't even have to leave a twenty on your kitchen table.</p>
<p>The point here – the point I made 20 years ago to Chris Anderson – is that <em>this is the foreseeable, inevitable result</em> of designing devices for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades. Anyone who was paying attention should have figured that out in the GW Bush administration. Anyone who does this <em>today</em>? Absolute flaming garbage.</p>
<p>Sure, Zaslav deserves to be staked out over and anthill and slathered in high-fructose corn syrup. But save the next anthill for the Sony exec who shipped a product that would let Zaslav come into your home and rob you. That piece of shit <em>knew what they were doing</em> and <em>they did it anyway</em>. <em>Fuck</em> them. Sideways. With a <em>brick</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studios keep making the case for stealing movies rather than paying for them. As Tyler James Hill wrote: "If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing":</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2>
<p dir="auto">GitHub Actions <code>self-hosted</code> runners provide a flexible option to run CI workloads on the infrastructure of your choice. However, currently GitHub does not provide tooling to automate the creation and scaling of action runners. This module creates the AWS infrastructure to host action runners on spot instances. It also provides lambda modules to orchestrate the life cycle of the action runners.</p>
<p dir="auto">Lambda was selected as the preferred runtime for two primary reasons. Firstly, it enables the development of compact components with limited access to AWS and GitHub. Secondly, it offers a scalable configuration with minimal expenses, applicable at both the repository and organizational levels. The Lambda functions will be responsible for provisioning Linux-based EC2 instances equipped with Docker to handle CI workloads compatible with Linux and/or Docker. The primary objective is to facilitate Docker-based workloads.</p>
<p dir="auto">A pertinent question may arise: why not opt for Kubernetes? The current strategy aligns closely with the implementation of GitHub's action runners. The chosen approach involves installing the runner on a host where the necessary software is readily available, maintaining proximity to GitHub's existing practices. Another viable option could be AWS Auto Scaling groups. However, this alternative usually demands broader permissions at the instance level from GitHub. Additionally, managing the scaling process, both up and down, becomes a non-trivial task in this scenario.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2>
<p dir="auto">The moment a GitHub action workflow requiring a <code>self-hosted</code> runner is triggered, GitHub will try to find a runner which can execute the workload. See <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/docs/additional_notes.md">additional notes</a> for how the selection is made. This module reacts to GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#workflow_job"><code>workflow_job</code> event</a> for the triggered workflow and creates a new runner if necessary.</p>
<p dir="auto">For receiving the <code>workflow_job</code> event by the webhook (lambda), a webhook needs to be created in GitHub. The <code>check_run</code> option was dropped from version 2.x. The following options to send the event are supported.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Create a GitHub app, define a webhook and subscribe the app to the <code>workflow_job</code> event.</li>
<li>Create a webhook on enterprise, org or repo level, define a webhook and subscribe the app to the <code>workflow_job</code> event.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In AWS an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/index.html" rel="nofollow">API gateway</a> endpoint is created that is able to receive the GitHub webhook events via HTTP post. The gateway triggers the webhook lambda which will verify the signature of the event. This check guarantees the event is sent by the GitHub App. The lambda only handles <code>workflow_job</code> events with status <code>queued</code> and matching the runner labels. The accepted events are posted on a SQS queue. Messages on this queue will be delayed for a configurable amount of seconds (default 30 seconds) to give the available runners time to pick up this build.</p>
<p dir="auto">The "Scale Up Runner" Lambda actively monitors the SQS queue, processing incoming events. The Lambda conducts a series of checks to determine the necessity of creating a new EC2 spot instance. For instance, it refrains from creating an instance if a build is already initiated by an existing runner or if the maximum allowable number of runners has been reached.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Lambda first requests a JIT configuration or registration token from GitHub, which is needed later by the runner to register itself. This avoids the case that the EC2 instance, which later in the process will install the agent, needs administration permissions to register the runner. Next, the EC2 spot instance is created via the launch template. The launch template defines the specifications of the required instance and contains a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html" rel="nofollow"><code>user_data</code></a> script. This script will install the required software and configure it. The registration token for the action runner is stored in the parameter store (SSM), from which the user data script will fetch it and delete it once it has been retrieved. Once the user data script is finished, the action runner should be online, and the workflow will start in seconds.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current method for scaling down runners employs a straightforward approach: at predefined intervals, the Lambda conducts a thorough examination of each runner (instance) to assess its activity. If a runner is found to be idle, it is deregistered from GitHub, and the associated AWS instance is terminated. Presently, no alternative method appears available for achieving a more gradual scaling down process.</p>
<p dir="auto">To address potential delays in downloading the GitHub Action Runner distribution, a lambda function has been implemented to synchronize the action runner binary from GitHub to an S3 bucket. This ensures that the EC2 instance can retrieve the distribution from the S3 bucket, mitigating the need to rely on internet downloads, which can occasionally take more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sensitive information such as secrets and private keys is stored securely in the SSM Parameter Store. These values undergo encryption using either the default KMS key for SSM or a custom KMS key, depending on the specified configuration.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/docs/component-overview.svg"><img src="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/raw/main/docs/component-overview.svg" alt="Architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Permission are managed in several places. Below are the most important ones. For details check the Terraform sources.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The GitHub App requires access to actions and to publish <code>workflow_job</code> events to the AWS webhook (API gateway).</li>
<li>The scale up lambda should have access to EC2 for creating and tagging instances.</li>
<li>The scale down lambda should have access to EC2 to terminate instances.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Besides these permissions, the lambdas also need permission to CloudWatch (for logging and scheduling), SSM and S3. For more details about the required permissions see the <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/modules/setup-iam-permissions/README.md">documentation</a> of the IAM module which uses permission boundaries.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Major configuration options</h3>
<p dir="auto">To be able to support a number of use-cases, the module has quite a lot of configuration options. We tried to choose reasonable defaults. Several examples also show the main cases of how to configure the runners.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Org vs Repo level. You can configure the module to connect the runners in GitHub on an org level and share the runners in your org, or set the runners on repo level and the module will install the runner to the repo. There can be multiple repos but runners are not shared between repos.</li>
<li>Multi-Runner module. This modules allows you to create multiple runner configurations with a single webhook and single GitHub App to simplify deployment of different types of runners. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/modules/multi-runner/README.md">ReadMe</a> for more information to understand the functionality.</li>
<li>Workflow job event. You can configure the webhook in GitHub to send workflow job events to the webhook. Workflow job events were introduced by GitHub in September 2021 and are designed to support scalable runners. We advise using the workflow job event when possible.</li>
<li>Linux vs Windows. You can configure the OS types linux and win. Linux will be used by default.</li>
<li>Re-use vs Ephemeral. By default runners are re-used, until detected idle. Once idle they will be removed from the pool. To improve security we are introducing ephemeral runners. Those runners are only used for one job. Ephemeral runners only work in combination with the workflow job event. For ephemeral runners the lambda requests a JIT (just in time) configuration via the GitHub API to register the runner. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-just-in-time-runners">JIT configuration</a> is limited to ephemeral runners (and currently not supported by GHES). For non-ephemeral runners, a registration token is always requested. In both cases the configuration is made available to the instance via the same SSM parameter. To disable JIT configuration for ephermeral runners set <code>enable_jit_config</code> to <code>false</code>. We also suggest using a pre-build AMI to improve the start time of jobs for ephemeral runners.</li>
<li>GitHub Cloud vs GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES). The runners support GitHub Cloud as well GitHub Enterprise Server. For GHES, we rely on our community for support and testing. We at Philips have no capability to test GHES ourselves.</li>
<li>Spot vs on-demand. The runners use either the EC2 spot or on-demand life cycle. Runners will be created via the AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFleet.html" rel="nofollow">CreateFleet API</a>. The module (scale up lambda) will request via the CreateFleet API to create instances in one of the subnets and of the specified instance types.</li>
<li>ARM64 support via Graviton/Graviton2 instance-types. When using the default example or top-level module, specifying <code>instance_types</code> that match a Graviton/Graviton 2 (ARM64) architecture (e.g. a1, t4g or any 6th-gen <code>g</code> or <code>gd</code> type), you must also specify <code>runner_architecture = "arm64"</code> and the sub-modules will be automatically configured to provision with ARM64 AMIs and leverage GitHub's ARM64 action runner. See below for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">AWS SSM Parameters</h3>
<p dir="auto">The module uses the AWS System Manager Parameter Store to store configuration for the runners, as well as registration tokens and secrets for the Lambdas. Paths for the parameters can be configured via the variable <code>ssm_paths</code>. The location of the configuration parameters is retrieved by the runners via the instance tag <code>ghr:ssm_config_path</code>. The following default paths will be used. Tokens or JIT config stored in the token path will be deleted after retrieval by instance, data not deleted after a day will be deleted by a SSM housekeeper lambda.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usages</h2>
<p dir="auto">Examples are provided in <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/examples">the example directory</a>. Please ensure you have installed the following tools.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Terraform, or <a href="https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv">tfenv</a>.</li>
<li>Bash shell or compatible</li>
<li>Docker (optional, to build lambdas without node).</li>
<li>AWS cli (optional)</li>
<li>Node and yarn (for lambda development).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The module supports two main scenarios for creating runners. Repository level runners will be dedicated to only one repository, so no other repository can use the runner. At the organization level, you can use the runner(s) for all repositories within the organization. See <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners">GitHub self-hosted runner instructions</a> for more information. Before starting the deployment you have to choose one option.</p>
<p dir="auto">The setup consists of running Terraform to create all AWS resources and manually configuring the GitHub App. The Terraform module requires configuration from the GitHub App and the GitHub app requires output from Terraform. Therefore you first create the GitHub App and configure the basics, then run Terraform, and afterwards finalize the configuration of the GitHub App.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup GitHub App (part 1)</h3>
<p dir="auto">Go to GitHub and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app">create a new app</a>. Be aware you can create apps for your organization or for a user. For now we only support organization level apps.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Create an app in Github</li>
<li>Choose a name</li>
<li>Choose a website (mandatory, not required for the module).</li>

</ol>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup terraform module</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Download lambdas </h4>
<p dir="auto">To apply the terraform module, the compiled lambdas (.zip files) need to be available either locally or in an S3 bucket. They can either be downloaded from the GitHub release page or built locally.</p>
<p dir="auto">To read the files from S3, set the <code>lambda_s3_bucket</code> variable and the specific object key for each lambda.</p>
<p dir="auto">The lambdas can be downloaded manually from the <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/releases">release page</a> or using the <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/modules/download-lambda">download-lambda</a> terraform module (requires <code>curl</code> to be installed on your machine). In the <code>download-lambda</code> directory, run <code>terraform init &amp;&amp; terraform apply</code>. The lambdas will be saved to the same directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">For local development you can build all the lambdas at once using <code>.ci/build.sh</code> or individually using <code>yarn dist</code>.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Service-linked role </h4>
<p dir="auto">To create spot instances the <code>AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot</code> role needs to be added to your account. You can do that manually by following the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html#service-linked-roles-spot-instance-requests" rel="nofollow">AWS docs</a>. To use terraform for creating the role, either add the following resource or let the module manage the service linked role by setting <code>create_service_linked_role_spot</code> to <code>true</code>. Be aware this is an account global role, so maybe you don't want to manage it via a specific deployment.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="resource &quot;aws_iam_service_linked_role&quot; &quot;spot&quot; {

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pool</h3>
<p dir="auto">The module supports two options for keeping a pool of runners. One is via a pool which only supports org-level runners, the second option is <a href="#idle-runners">keeping runners idle</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The pool is introduced in combination with the ephemeral runners and is primarily meant to ensure if any event is unexpectedly dropped and no runner was created, the pool can pick up the job. The pool is maintained by a lambda. Each time the lambda is triggered a check is performed to ensure the number of idle runners managed by the module matches the expected pool size. If not, the pool will be adjusted. Keep in mind that the scale down function is still active and will terminate instances that are detected as idle.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pool_runner_owner = &quot;my-org&quot;                  # Org to which the runners are added

<p dir="auto">The pool is NOT enabled by default and can be enabled by setting at least one object of the pool config list. The <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/examples/ephemeral/README.md">ephemeral example</a> contains configuration options (commented out).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Idle runners</h3>
<p dir="auto">The module will scale down to zero runners by default. By specifying a <code>idle_config</code> config, idle runners can be kept active. The scale down lambda checks if any of the cron expressions matches the current time with a margin of 5 seconds. When there is a match, the number of runners specified in the idle config will be kept active. In case multiple cron expressions match, the first one will be used. Below is an idle configuration for keeping runners active from 9:00am to 5:59pm on working days. The <a href="https://crontab.cronhub.io/" rel="nofollow">cron expression generator by Cronhub</a> is a great resource to set up your idle config.</p>
<p dir="auto">By default, the oldest instances are evicted. This helps keep your environment up-to-date and reduce problems like running out of disk space or RAM. Alternatively, if your older instances have a long-living cache, you can override the <code>evictionStrategy</code> to <code>newest_first</code> to evict the newest instances first instead.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="idle_config = [{
   cron             = &quot;* * 9-17 * * 1-5&quot;

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ephemeral runners</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can configure runners to be ephemeral, in which case runners will be used only for one job. The feature should be used in conjunction with listening for the workflow job event. Please consider the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The scale down lambda is still active, and should only remove orphan instances. But there is no strict check in place. So ensure you configure the <code>minimum_running_time_in_minutes</code> to a value that is high enough to get your runner booted and connected to avoid it being terminated before executing a job.</li>
<li>The messages sent from the webhook lambda to the scale-up lambda are by default delayed by SQS, to give available runners a chance to start the job before the decision is made to scale more runners. For ephemeral runners there is no need to wait. Set <code>delay_webhook_event</code> to <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>All events in the queue will lead to a new runner created by the lambda. By setting <code>enable_job_queued_check</code> to <code>true</code> you can enforce a rule of only creating a runner if the event has a correlated queued job. Setting this can avoid creating useless runners. For example, a job getting cancelled before a runner was created or if the job was already picked up by another runner. We suggest using this in combination with a pool.</li>
<li>To ensure runners are created in the same order GitHub sends the events, by default we use a FIFO queue. This is mainly relevant for repo level runners. For ephemeral runners you can set <code>enable_fifo_build_queue</code> to <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Errors related to scaling should be retried via SQS. You can configure <code>job_queue_retention_in_seconds</code> and <code>redrive_build_queue</code> to tune the behavior. We have no mechanism to avoid events never being processed, which means potentially no runner gets created and the job in GitHub times out in 6 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The example for <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/examples/ephemeral">ephemeral runners</a> is based on the <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/examples/default">default example</a>. Have look at the diff to see the major configuration differences.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prebuilt Images</h3>
<p dir="auto">This module also allows you to run agents from a prebuilt AMI to gain faster startup times. The module provides several examples to build your own custom AMI. To remove old images, an <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/modules/ami-housekeeper/README.md">AMI housekeeper module</a> can be used. You can find more information in <a href="https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner/blob/main/images/README.md">the image README.md</a> for building custom images.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Experimental - Optional queue to publish GitHub workflow job events</h3>
<p dir="auto">This queue is an experimental feature to allow you to receive a copy of the wokflow_jobs events sent by the GitHub App. This can be used to calculate a matrix or monitor the system.</p>
<p dir="auto">To enable the feature set <code>enable_workflow_job_events_queue = true</code>. Be aware though, this feature is experimental!</p>
<p dir="auto">Messages received on the queue are using the same format as published by GitHub wrapped in a property <code>workflowJobEvent</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="export interface GithubWorkflowEvent {
  workflowJobEvent: WorkflowJobEvent;
}"><pre><code>export interface GithubWorkflowEvent {
  workflowJobEvent: WorkflowJobEvent;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This extensible format allows more fields to be added if needed.
You can configure the queue by setting properties to <code>workflow_job_events_queue_config</code></p>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: By default, a runner AMI update requires a re-apply of this terraform config (the runner AMI ID is looked up by a terraform data source). To avoid this, you can use <code>ami_id_ssm_parameter_name</code> to have the scale-up lambda dynamically lookup the runner AMI ID from an SSM parameter at instance launch time. Said SSM parameter is managed outside of this module (e.g. by a runner AMI build workflow).</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tracing</h2>
<p dir="auto">The distributed architecture of this application can make it difficult to troubleshoot.  We support the option to enable tracing for all the lambda functions created by this application. To enable tracing, you can provide the <code>tracing_config</code> option inside the root module or inner modules.</p>
<p dir="auto">This tracing config generates timelines for following events:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Basic lifecycle of lambda function</li>
<li>Traces for Github API calls (can be configured by capture_http_requests).</li>
<li>Traces for all AWS SDK calls</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This feature has been disabled by default.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Debugging</h2>
<p dir="auto">In case the setup does not work as intended, trace the events through this sequence:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In the GitHub App configuration, the Advanced page displays all webhook events that were sent.</li>
<li>In AWS CloudWatch, every lambda has a log group. Look at the logs of the <code>webhook</code> and <code>scale-up</code> lambdas.</li>
<li>In AWS SQS you can see messages available or in flight.</li>
<li>Once an EC2 instance is running, you can connect to it in the EC2 user interface using Session Manager (use <code>enable_ssm_on_runners = true</code>). Check the user data script using <code>cat /var/log/user-data.log</code>. By default several log files of the instances are streamed to AWS CloudWatch, look for a log group named <code>&lt;environment&gt;/runners</code>. In the log group you should see at least the log streams for the user data installation and runner agent.</li>
<li>Registered instances should show up in the Settings - Actions page of the repository or organization (depending on the installation mode).</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Security Considerations</h2>
<p dir="auto">This module creates resources in your AWS infrastructure, and EC2 instances for hosting the self-hosted runners on-demand. IAM permissions are set to a minimal level, and could be further limited by using permission boundaries. Instances permissions are limited to retrieve and delete the registration token, access the instance's own tags, and terminate the instance itself. By nature, instances are short-lived, and we strongly suggest using ephemeral runners to ensure a safe build environment for each workflow job execution.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ephemeral runners use the JIT configuration, which can be used only once to activate a runner. For non-ephemeral runners this option is not provided by GitHub, so instead a registration token is passed via SSM. After using the token, the token is deleted. But the token remains valid and is potential available in memory on the runner. For ephemeral runners this problem is avoid by using just-in-time tokens.</p>
<p dir="auto">The examples are using standard AMI's for different operation systems. Instances are not hardened, and sudo operation are not blocked. To provide an out of the box working experience by default the module installs and configures the runner. However secrets are not hard coded, they finally end up in the memory of the instances. You can harden the instance by providing your own AMI and overwriting the cloud-init script.</p>
<p dir="auto">We welcome any improvement to the standard module to make the default as secure as possible. But in the end it remains your responsibility to keep your environment secure.</p>

				Fluorinated plastic containers may leach toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances into household products stored in them.

                     <p><span>The US Environmental Protection Agency is cracking down on a fluorination process that enhances the barrier properties of certain plastic containers. The agency says the process, used by Inhance Technologies to treat millions of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic containers each year, <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/persistent-pollutants/fluorinating-polyethylene-health-threat/101/i5" shape="rect" title="Is fluorinating polyethylene a health threat?">creates dangerous per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) impurities</a> that can leach into products stored in the treated containers.</span></p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>In a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-takes-action-protect-people-pfas-leach-plastic-containers-pesticides-and-other" shape="rect" title="EPA Takes Action to Protect People from PFAS that Leach from Plastic Containers into Pesticides and Other Products I US EPA">Dec. 1 notice</a>, the EPA ordered Inhance to stop producing the PFAS by Feb. 28, 2024. The agency says that nine PFAS are created by the company’s fluorination process. Three of them—perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorodecanoic acid—are highly toxic. Additional testing is needed to determine whether the other six pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment, the EPA says.</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>Inhance claims in a <a href="https://www.inhancetechnologies.com/news/inhance-technologies-response-to-u.s.-epa-call-to-ban-fluorination" shape="rect" title="Inhance Technologies Response to U.S. EPA Call to Ban Fluorination">news release</a> responding to the EPA’s order that it has modified its fluorination process over the past 2 years, resulting in a more-than-90% decrease in PFAS impurities. PFAS are undetectable in nearly all of its fluorinated plastic packaging, the company says.</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>The EPA warned Inhance in 2022 that it was not in compliance with a rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requiring companies to notify the agency before they produce certain PFAS.</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>Inhance says the EPA’s rule does not apply to its operations because its fluorination process has been in continuous use since 1983. Uses that have been ongoing since before the EPA proposed the rule in 2015 are exempt. The firm says it “will pursue all legal options to protect its customers, suppliers, and employees and to ensure the continued operations of this environmentally critical technology.”</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>Fluorinated HDPE containers are used for storing personal care products, detergents, pesticides, and other household and industrial goods. Inhance markets its fluorination process as a way to extend the shelf life of products and prevent permeation through the packaging. The company claims the resulting containers are fully recyclable.</p>
                
            

            
                

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>The EPA first became aware of PFAS impurities created by Inhance’s fluorination process in 2020 after <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/persistent-pollutants/Mosquito-spray-tainted-PFAS-shipping/99/web/2021/01" shape="rect" title="Mosquito spray tainted with PFAS from shipping containers">PFAS-tainted mosquitocide</a> contaminated a Massachusetts drinking water supply. The agency determined that PFOA had leached into the mosquitocide from fluorinated HDPE containers treated by Inhance.</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>The EPA and environmental groups filed lawsuits against Inhance in December 2022 for its failure to notify the agency that it produces certain long-chain PFAS. The EPA considers making such PFAS, even as impurities, a significant new use under TSCA.</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>Environmental groups involved in the case welcome the EPA’s decision to essentially ban Inhance’s fluorination process. “This is a huge step forward in eliminating PFAS from consumer products and a win for human health and the environment,” Kyla Bennett science policy director at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, says in a <a href="https://peer.org/peer-ceh-applaud-epas-decision-to-protect-people-from-pfas-that-leach-from-plastic-containers/" shape="rect" title="PEER and CEH Applaud EPA’s Decision to Protect People from PFAS that Leach from Plastic Containers">statement</a>. “EPA has known about PFAS leaching from these containers for three years, and it’s a relief that EPA is finally taking action to halt this dangerous practice.”</p>

<p>OpenBao is a fork of Vault, which helps developers manage secrets like passwords, tokens, certificates, API keys, and the like.</p>

    

<p>Vault, like HashiCorp's Boundary, Consul, Nomad, Packer, Terraform, Vagrant, and Waypoint, has been put under the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hashicorp.com/license-faq">Business Source License</a>, which disallows other cloud companies from offering the software as a competitive product. And so rivals have forked the Vault code under an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://opensource.org/licenses/">OSI-compliant license</a> – Mozilla PLv2 – to ensure continued access to the technology.</p>

        


        

<p>"If there are two projects that are identical and one's open source and one's not, I personally believe that the moral choice is to use the open source project and help in some manner," Stadil told the conference.</p>
<p>Stadil explained to <em>The Register</em> that later this month an OpenTofu release candidate is planned and that OpenBao will start accepting new contributions.</p>

        

<p>OpenBao is being incubated by the Linux Foundation, led by IBM developers through LF Edge, an edge computing initiative. The project is not (yet) officially endorsed by IBM. Before it graduates in the eyes of the Linux Foundation, it needs to meet <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md">certain criteria</a> to demonstrate that it's likely to last.</p>
<p>Project viability and longevity were among the concerns voiced by those attending Stadil's presentation, given that OpenTofu and OpenBao are recent projects.</p>
<p>Stadil declined to speak for other companies, and in fact had been told not to make any announcements about other organizations endorsing the projects. But he recommended visiting the project repos and making note of where those <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/graphs/contributors">contributing</a> to the two projects work as a proxy for corporate support.</p>

        

<p>Asked by a conference attendee about HashiCorp's rationale for relicensing its software, Stadil said the official party line is that Terraform is vital to the internet and there's long been a desire to have it under the oversight of The Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>"If HashiCorp in the future wants to join us at OpenTofu we'd be thrilled to see that happen," he said.</p>
<p>Stadil <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/N_0QDOZ-_GE?feature=shared&amp;t=12122">said</a> he can't speculate on HashiCorp's internal decision making process.</p>
<p>Hashicorp, he said, had been burning cash and with interest rates rising it would not be surprising to see the software firm taking steps to generate greater revenue. HashiCorp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the software biz <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ir.hashicorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hashicorp-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-financial">reported</a> revenue of $146.1 million for its third fiscal quarter of 2024, representing a 17 percent increase year-on-year. That amounted to a GAAP net loss of $39.5 million, which is down from $72 million in the same period last year. ®</p>

<p>Verizon Wireless gave a female victim's address and phone logs to an alleged stalker who pretended to be a police officer, according to an affidavit filed by an FBI special agent. The man, Robert Michael Glauner, was later arrested near the victim's home and found to be carrying a knife at the time, according to the affidavit submitted in court yesterday.</p>
<p>Glauner allegedly traveled from New Mexico to Raleigh, North Carolina, after finding out where she lived and, before arriving, sent a threatening message that said, "if I can't have you no one can." He also allegedly threatened to send nude photos of the victim to her family members.</p>
<p>Glauner was charged yesterday with stalking and fraud "in connection with obtaining confidential phone records" in US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. We aren't posting or linking directly to the court record because it seems to contain the victim's home address. The incident was previously <a href="https://www.404media.co/verizon-gave-phone-data-to-stalker-edrs-search-warrant-pose-as-cop/">reported by 404 Media</a>.</p>
<p>Glauner and the victim met in August or September 2023 on xhamster.com, a porn website with dating features, and "had an online romantic relationship," the affidavit said. The victim ended the relationship, but Glauner "continued to contact or try to contact" her, the document said.</p>
<p>Glauner tricked Verizon into providing sensitive information by sending an email and fake search warrant to vsat.cct@one.verizon.com, the email address for the Verizon Security Assistance Team (VSAT), which handles legal requests. Verizon didn't realize the request was fraudulent even though it came from a Proton Mail address rather than from a police department or other governmental agency, according to the affidavit filed yesterday by FBI Special Agent Michael Neylon.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Fake cop, forged judge’s signature</h2>
<p>An email to Verizon from "steven1966c@proton.me" on September 26, 2023, said, "Here is the pdf file for search warrant. We are in need if the [<em>sic</em>] this cell phone data as soon as possible to locate and apprehend this suspect. We also need the full name of this Verizon subscriber and the new phone number that has been assigned to her. Thank you."</p>
<p>The email's attached document contained a fake affidavit written by "Detective Steven Cooper" of the Cary, North Carolina Police Department. The Cary Police Department confirmed that no officer named Steven Cooper is employed by their agency, Neylon wrote.</p>
<p>VSAT received a phone call the same day from a man identifying himself as Cooper, who stated that he needed information on a suspect in a homicide case. "The caller stated that the person involved changed her phone number," Neylon wrote.</p>
<p>The fake affidavit asked for the new phone number as well as "call records both outgoing and incoming" and "locations and text messages incoming and outgoing." The affidavit for a search warrant was supposedly approved by Superior Court Judge Gale Adams.</p>
<p>Adams is a real judge and she later confirmed to authorities "that the signature displayed on the document was not hers," Neylon wrote. Neylon's affidavit also said the "search warrant" was "not in the proper format and does not have form AOC-CR-119, as required for State of North Carolina search warrants."</p>
<h2>Verizon provides address and phone logs</h2>
<p>But after reviewing the email and document sent by "Cooper," Verizon provided an address and phone logs. "On October 5, 2023, Verizon Wireless provided Victim 1's phone records, including address and phone logs, to Glauner," according to Neylon's affidavit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/account/manage-account/security/security-assist-team">Verizon's website</a> says that the Verizon Security Assistance Team ensures that "court orders, search warrants, subpoenas and other legal demands served upon Verizon are processed confidentially and in compliance with all applicable law."</p>
<p>"Verizon Security Assistance Team will only accept valid legal demands (subpoena, court order or search warrant) for records," the VSAT webpage says.</p>
<p>We contacted Verizon about the incident today and will update this article if we get a response. A Verizon spokesperson told 404 Media that the company is cooperating with law enforcement on this matter.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit amazing performance on a wide
variety of tasks such as text modeling and code generation. However,
they are also very large. For example Llama 2 70B has 70 billion
parameters that require 140GB of memory to store in half precision. This
presents many challenges, such as needing multiple GPUs just to serve a
single LLM. To address these issues, researchers have developed
compression methods that reduce the size of models without destroying
performance.</p>
<p>One class of methods, post-training quantization, compresses trained
model weights into lower precision formats to reduce memory
requirements. For example, quantizing a model from 16 bit to 2 bit
precision would reduce the size of the model by 8x, meaning that even
Llama 2 70B would fit on a single 24GB GPU. In this work, we introduce
<strong>QuIP#</strong>, which combines lattice codebooks with
incoherence processing to create state-of-the-art 2 bit quantized
models. These two methods allow QuIP# to significantly close the gap
between 2 bit quantized LLMs and unquantized 16 bit models.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="method-overview">Method Overview</h3>
<p>QuIP# relies on two main components: <em>incoherence processing</em>
and <em>lattice codebooks</em>. Incoherence processing in the context of
model quantization was introduced in QuIP. While QuIP used a Kronecker
product to perform incoherence processing, we introduce a Hadamard
transform-based incoherence approach that is more amenable to fast GPU
acceleration.</p>
<p>Incoherence-processed weights are approximately Gaussian-distributed,
which means that they are suitable for quantizing with symmetric and
“round” codebooks. We introduce a new lattice codebook based on the
<span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice, which achieves the
optimal 8 dimension unit ball packing density. Our codebooks are
specifically designed to be hardware-friendly by exploiting symmetries
in these lattices.</p>
<h3 id="quantization-background">Quantization Background</h3>
<p>In QuIP#, we follow existing state-of-the-art post training
quantization methods and round weights to minimize the per-layer
“adaptive rounding” proxy objective</p>
<p><span>\[
\ell(\hat W)
  = E_x \left[ \| (\hat W - W)x \|^2 \right]
  = \operatorname{tr}\left(
    (\hat W - W) H (\hat W - W)^T
   \right).
\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span>\(W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times
n}\)</span> is the original weight matrix in a given layer, <span>\(\hat W = \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span> are the
quantized weights, <span>\(x \in
\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is an input vector drawn uniformly at random from
a calibration set, and <span>\(H\)</span> is the
second moment matrix of these vectors, interpreted as a proxy Hessian.
This intra-layer formulation makes quantization tracatable for large
language models. The original QuIP paper forumlated a class of adaptive
rounding methods that used linear feedback to minimize <span>\(\ell\)</span>. Within this class, the LDLQ
rounding algorithm was shown to be optimal; we use LDLQ in QuIP# as
well.</p>
<h3 id="incoherence-processing">Incoherence Processing</h3>
<p>The main insight of QuIP is that incoherent weight and hessian
matrices result in improved quantization performance. Informally, this
means that weights that are even in magnitude with important rounding
directions (the Hessians) that are not too large in any one coordinate
are significantly easier to quantize without catastrophic error. In some
sense, incoherence processing can be viewed as a form of outlier
suppression across weight and activation spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> <em>We say a symmetric Hessian matrix
<span>\(H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\)</span> is
<span>\(\mu\)</span>-incoherent if it has an
eigendecomposition <span>\(H = Q \Lambda
Q^T\)</span> such that for all <span>\(i\)</span>
and <span>\(j\)</span>, <span>\(|Q_{ij}| = |e_i^T Q e_j| \leq \mu /
\sqrt{n}\)</span>. By extension, we say a weight matrix <span>\(W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span> is <span>\(\mu\)</span>-incoherent if for all <span>\(i\)</span> and <span>\(j\)</span>, <span>\(|W_{ij}| =
|e_i^T W e_j| \leq \mu \|W\|_F / \sqrt{mn}\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>Incoherence is an important property for quantizing models. In QuIP,
the incoherence condition on <span>\(H\)</span> is
required to show that LDLQ achieves a superior proxy loss to nearest and
stochastic rounding through a spectral bound on <span>\(H\)</span>. Therefore, it is important to be able
to incoherence-process weight and hessian matrices efficiently so that
incoherence-processed models can be tractably deployed.</p>
<p>One way to do this is by conjugating <span>\(W\)</span> and <span>\(H\)</span> by random orthogonal matrices. Let
<span>\(U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}\)</span>, and
<span>\(V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\)</span> be
two random orthogonal matrices. If we assign <span>\(\tilde H \gets V H V^T\)</span> and <span>\(\tilde W \gets U W V^T\)</span>, <span>\(\tilde H\)</span> and <span>\(\tilde W\)</span> become incoherence processed
with high probability (see QuIP for proof). One can verify that this
transformation preserves the proxy objective as <span>\[\operatorname{tr}(\tilde W \tilde H \tilde W^T) =
\operatorname{tr}((U W V^T) (V H V^T) (V W^T U^T)) =
\operatorname{tr}(WHW^T).\]</span></p>
<h4 id="randomized-hadamard-transformation-rht">Randomized Hadamard
Transformation (RHT)</h4>
<p>To construct <span>\(U\)</span> and <span>\(V\)</span> from above, we use the RHT, which is
amenable to fast GPU implementation. In fact, one of the CUDA sample
kernels is the RHT. The RHT performs the multiplication <span>\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{H}Sx\)</span>,
where <span>\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> is a <span>\(n \times n\)</span> Hadamard matrix (scaled by a
normalization factor) and <span>\(S\)</span> is a
<span>\(n\)</span> dimensional random sign vector.
The RHT concentrates the entries of <span>\(x\)</span> and thus results in incoherent matrices
through an <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/dwoodruf/www/teaching/15859-fall20/lecture_2.1.pdf">application
of the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality</a>. Note that the Hadamard transform
can be computed more efficiently than a matrix multiplication via the
fast Walsh-Hadamard transform, which we employ directly for powers of 2.
To handle non power-of-two values of <span>\(n\)</span>, we perform the following
algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let <span>\(p\)</span> be the remaining
dimension and reshape <span>\(Sx\)</span> into a
<span>\(n/p \times p\)</span> matrix.</li>
<li>Perform the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform on <span>\(Sx\)</span> associated with dimension <span>\(n/p\)</span>.</li>
<li>Let <span>\(\mathbb{H}'\)</span> be a <span>\(p \times p\)</span> scaled Hadamard matrix. Apply
this Hadamard transform to <span>\(Sx\)</span> on
the right, and reshape back.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only consequence of performing RHT is needing to store two sign
vectors per layer: <span>\(S_U\)</span> and <span>\(S_V\)</span>. Since large language models have
large weight and Hessian matrices, this only increases the number of
bits per weight in practice by less than 0.01, or a negligible
amount.</p>
<h3 id="lattice-codebooks">Lattice Codebooks</h3>
<p>Incoherence processed weights are approximately Gaussian-distributed,
meaning that they are symmetric and “round.” To take advantage of this
“roundness,” we can use <span>\(n\)</span>
dimensional codebooks that quantize <span>\(n\)</span> weights at once. Specifically, to
quantize <span>\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> to a
<span>\(n\)</span> dimensional codebook <span>\(C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span>, we round
<span>\(x\)</span> to its nearest distance-wise
entry in <span>\(C\)</span>. This requires <span>\(\log_2m\)</span> bits to represent which index in
<span>\(C\)</span> to store, and results in <span>\(k = \frac{\log_2m}{n}\)</span> bits per
weight.</p>
<p>Increasing <span>\(n\)</span> results in a
“rounder” codebook that reduces quantization error. However, note that
the number of bits per weight is determined by <em>both</em> the number
of entries in <span>\(C\)</span> (m) as well as the
dimension of <span>\(C\)</span> (n). To maintain a
set number of bits per weight, a linear increase in <span>\(n\)</span> requires an exponential increase in
<span>\(m\)</span>. For example, a naively designed
16-dimensional codebook requires <span>\(2^{32}\)</span> entries to achieve 2 bits per
weight, but performing lookups into a size <span>\(2^{32}\)</span> codebook is intractable. Thus, it
is important to design codebooks that both have relatively large <span>\(n\)</span> while being compressible so the actual
lookup happens with less than <span>\(2^{nk}\)</span> entries.</p>
<p>Geometric lattices are suitable bases for such codebooks as most
lattices have inherent symmetries and certain lattices achieve optimal
bin packing densities. For example, our E8P codebook based on the <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice has <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> entries but only requires looking
up into a size <span>\(2^8\)</span> codebook due to
symmetries inherent to the <span>\(E_8\)</span>
lattice itself – more on this later. In QuIP#, we present the E8P
codebook based on the 8-dimensional <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice. This lattice achieves the 8
dimensional kissing number, or the maximum number of unit balls touching
a central unit ball in 8 dimensions. Interestingly, Maryna Viazovska
recently won the Fields Medal in 2022 “for the proof that the <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice provides the densest packing
of identical spheres in 8 dimensions.”</p>

</figure>
<h4 id="e8p-codebook">E8P Codebook</h4>
<p>Our E8P codebook is a version of the <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice intersected with a ball,
padded (hence the P in E8P) to reach <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> entries. This results in <span>\(k = 16/8 = 2\)</span> bits per weight. The <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice is composed of 8 dimensional
all-integer or all-half integer vectors whose sum is an even number. In
set-builder notation, <span>\[E_8 = \left\{x \mid x
\in \left(\mathbb{Z}^8 \cup \left(\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}\right)^8\right)
\land \sum_i x_i \equiv 0 \pmod 2\right\}.\]</span> Note that <span>\(E_8 + \frac{1}{4}\)</span> has the same packing
density of <span>\(E_8\)</span> and is equivalent to
<span>\(D_8 + \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{1}{4}\)</span>,
where <span>\(D_8\)</span> is the set of 8
dimensional all-integer vectors with even sum. Denote <span>\(D_8 + \frac{1}{2}\)</span> as <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>; all elements in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span> also have even sum parity.</p>
<p>Now, note that if we flip an even number of signs of an element in
<span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, we get another element
in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, whereas flipping an
odd number of signs results in something not in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. This is due to <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span> being a half integer grid;
flipping a single half integer results in changing the sum parity. Since
<span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span> has 8 dimensions, there
are <span>\(2^8/2 = 128\)</span> possible “even sign
flip” patterns to stay within <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Conversely, there are also 128
“odd sign flip” patterns.</p>
<p>If we start from some “source codebook” <span>\(S\)</span> that is a subset of <span>\(|\hat{D_8}|\)</span>, where <span>\(|\cdot|\)</span> denotes the elementwise absolute
value, we can use 128 odd or even sign flips to generate a subset of
<span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Each entry in <span>\(S\)</span> is either an odd or even number of
flips away from an entry in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, but not both. Thus, given an
entry <span>\(s \in S\)</span> and 7 out of the 8
sign flips, we can infer the last one from the parity of the 7 sign
flips and <span>\(s\)</span>. This lets us use the
following bit pattern to store a 16-bit codeword in <span>\(E_8 + \frac{1}{4}\)</span>: 8 bits for the entry
index in <span>\(S\)</span>, 7 bits for the sign
flips of the right 7 dimensions of the entry in <span>\(S\)</span>, and 1 bit to add or subtract <span>\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if we had the codeword <code>0001010110010111</code>,
the first 8 bits <code>00010101</code> = 21 would indicate that we start
with the 21st entry in <span>\(S\)</span>. In this
example, let this be the vector</p>
<p><span>\[\left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2}\right\},\]</span></p>
<p>which is not in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Thus,
<span>\(s\)</span> requires an odd number of sign
flips to get into <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Then,
the next 7 bits <code>1001011</code> would indicate that we need to
negate the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 7th from right bits. Since we need an odd
number of sign flips, the 8th from right bit is also a sign flip. The
sign-decoded vector is then</p>
<p><span>\[\left\{-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2},
-\frac{1}{2}\right\},\]</span></p>
<p>which we can verify is in <span>\(E_8\)</span>.
Finally, the last bit <code>1</code> indicates that we need to add <span>\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>, so the final decoded vector
is</p>
<p><span>\[\left\{-\frac{1}{4}, -\frac{3}{4},
\frac{3}{4}, \frac{7}{4}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, -\frac{1}{4},
-\frac{1}{4}\right\},\]</span></p>
<p>which is in <span>\(E_8 + \frac{1}{4}\)</span> as
desired.</p>
<p>Putting this all together, this lets us decode a size <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> codebook by looking up into only a
size <span>\(2^8\)</span> codebook (namely <span>\(S\)</span>) and performing some operations. On
hardware, this means that we can store the smaller <span>\(2^8\)</span> codebook in local caches, avoiding
performance killing memory accesses that the larger <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> codebook would require. The
question remains then of how to choose <span>\(S\)</span>. In our implementation, we set <span>\(S\)</span> to be the 227 elements of <span>\(|\hat{D_8}|\)</span> with norm <span>\(\le \sqrt{10}\)</span> plus 29 elements from <span>\(|\hat{D_8}|\)</span> that have norm <span>\(\sqrt{12}\)</span>. The exact elements chosen can
be found in our code.</p>
<h4 id="codebook-errors">Codebook Errors</h4>
<p>To show the optimality of our lattice codebooks, we plotted the
minimum achievable elementwise MSE of quantizing a <span>\(n\)</span>-dimensional multivariate Gaussian to
various <span>\(k\)</span> bit codebooks. To create
each codebook, we intersected a ball with the base lattice and increased
the radius of the ball to get more bits. The half integer codebooks are
formed from the <span>\(n\)</span>-dimensional half
integer grids.</p>
<p>Specifically, each point in the graph below plots <span>\((k, y)\)</span> where</p>
<p><span>\[y = \min_{s \in \mathbb{R}^+}
\frac{1}{n}\left\|\mbox{quantize}\left(\frac{\mathcal{N}(0_n, I_n)}{s},
\mbox{codebook}\right)*s - \mathcal{N}(0_n, I_n)\right\|^2\]</span></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://cornell-relaxml.github.io/quip-sharp/img/lattice_err.png" title="Lattice Errors" alt="Lowest element-wise mean squared error (MSE) achievable for quantizing a multivariate Gaussian to various codebooks. The E_8 lattice achieves the densest unit-sphere packing in 8 dimensions and our derivative codebooks have the lowest MSE.">

</figure>
<p>The <span>\(E_8\)</span>-based codebooks achieves
lower MSEs than all other codebooks, including those based on the <span>\(D_4\)</span> lattice that achieves the 4
dimensional kissing number. This figure also shows the importance of
having a large number of columns <span>\(n\)</span>.
Increasing the number of columns decreases the error for the half
integer grid, as the resulting codebook is more “round.” Since the E8P
codebook is actually the union of two shifted codebooks, each of which
is a ball intersected with <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, it is not perfectly round.
This is reflected in the MSE plot, where it sits slightly above the
<span>\(E_8\)</span> line. However, there does not
exist a <span>\(E_8\)</span> codebook with exactly 2
bits, so E8P is still practically superior.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Here, we present quantization results using QuIP# on Llama 1 and 2
models. All models were quantized using the Hadamard transform for
incoherence processing and a weight scale factor of roughly 0.9 times
the optimal scale for a multivariate Gaussian to compensate for
inter-layer interactions. Furthermore, all Llama 2 models were evaluated
using a context lenth of 4096 and all Llama 1 models were evaluated with
context length 2048; these numbers match the context length the models
were trained with. These and other models can be found in our <a href="https://huggingface.co/relaxml">Hugging Face repository</a>.</p>
<p>The table below contains results for all Llama 1 and 2 models when
quantized to 2 bits using the E8P codebook. QuIP# achieves excellent
performance across all model sizes on both language modeling and zero
shot tasks. Furthermore, on the zero-shot tasks (ArcC, ArcE, BoolQ,
PiQA, WinoGrande), QuIP# models achieve near-native performance with
minimal degradation. Additional results are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18woLrIBdVGUr9CuFDbK9pl_6QzEBl09hfnoe4Qkg7Hg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

And Apple is to blame, it seems. Users, including those of us at TechCrunch with access to the app, began seeing error messages when trying to send texts via the newly released Beeper Mini and messages are not going through.</p>
<p>The error message reads: “failed to lookup on server: lookup request timed out” spelled out in red letters.</p>

<p>In a response to a question on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beeper/comments/18duom1/comment/kcjk6df/">Reddit</a> as to whether or not the app was broken, a Beeper team member had earlier replied, “Report a problem from the app, give us a chance to look into it.”</p>
<p>However, Beeper CEO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmigi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmigi/">Eric Migicovsky</a> responded to TechCrunch’s inquiry about Beeper Mini’s status by pointing us to <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733223640270082501">the X post acknowledging the outage</a>, and providing more detail. Asked if possibly Apple found a way to cut off Beeper Mini’s ability to function, he replied, “Yes, all data indicates that.”</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Investigating reports that sending/receiving is not working in Beeper Mini 🔎</p>
<p>— Beeper (@onbeeper) <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733223640270082501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>We don’t know what this means for the future of Beeper Mini’s efforts, unless Beeper’s engineers are able to work around the problem somehow.</p>
<p>Migicovsky, who previously founded the smartwatch Pebble, has argued that Beeper Mini wasn’t just beneficial for Android users who wanted to finally join their iMessage friends’ group chats, but that it increased security for iPhone users, too.</p>
<p>In an interview ahead of Beeper Mini’s launch, the founder explained that green bubble texts were unencrypted.</p>
<p>“That means that anytime you text your Android friends, anyone can read the message. Apple can read the message. Your phone carrier can read the message. Google… literally, it’s just like a postcard. Anyone can read it. So Beeper Mini actually increases the security of iPhones,” he had told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Apple, on the other hand, sees iMessage as one of the key tools for locking in users to its ecosystem, which is why it won’t launch an iMessage app for Android. While there was some hope that EU regulations would force it to make iMessage more interoperable, news this week indicates that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/imessage-will-reportedly-get-a-reprieve-from-eus-interoperability-regulation/">iMessage will get a reprieve from those rules</a> because the service is not popular enough with business users. That means Apple has no reason not to try to shut down Beeper Mini, if it could.</p>
<p>Migicovsky is none too pleased with that turn of events.</p>
<p>“I would be very interested to hear why they think that making security worse for iPhone users makes sense,” he said.</p>
<p>“If it’s Apple, then I think the biggest question is — if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they try to kill a service that enables iPhones to send encrypted chats to Android users? With their announcement of RCS support, it’s clear that Apple knows they have a gaping hole here. Beeper Mini is here today and works great. Why force iPhone users back to sending unencrypted SMS when they chat with friends on Android?,” he asked.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020, Beeper’s team had originally been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/pebble-founder-launches-beeper-a-universal-chat-app-that-works-with-imessage-and-others/">working on a multi-platform messaging aggregator</a>, which was renamed Beeper Cloud this week as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/beeper-reversed-engineered-imessage-to-bring-blue-bubble-texts-to-android-users/"> Beeper Mini went to launch</a>. The latter uses new <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/how-beeper-mini-works">technology</a> that allows Android users to text iMessage users as if they were also texting from an iPhone for just $1.99 per month. That means blue bubbles in the group chat, not green ones. Because the startup was no longer using a middleman — like a Mac server relaying messages, as other iMessage-to-Android apps employ — it would essentially appear to Apple’s servers that Beeper Mini’s messages were coming from a device that runs iMessage natively. It’s unclear, then, how Apple was able to cut off Beeper Mini’s access.</p>
<p>What this means for Beeper Mini’s future is uncertain.</p>
<p>“We’ll evaluate options,” Migicovsky said.</p>

<p><span>From my kitchen window,</span> I’ve been watching the construction of a ten-story building a block away. After a year of demolition, excavation, and pile-driving, an enormous crane blocked the entire street and extended into the sky, hoisting fifteen-foot sections of frame for the tower crane that would operate daily for more than a year, slowly lifting thousands of tons of beams, rebar, steel plates, posts, concrete forms, and glass.</p>
<p>My experience with this kind of construction is pretty much the same as most people’s: watching from a safe distance as some high-rise tower slowly takes shape. What keeps those dozen stories from collapsing under their own weight? How can a structure of steel, concrete, and glass, all of which expand and contract differently, survive the Winnipeg weather extremes, where the difference between the summer’s heat and winter’s deep-freeze is 130 degrees Fahrenheit? What kinds of systems provide sufficient water pressure to run the faucets on the tenth floor, and move enough fresh air into the building and stale air out?</p>
<div><p><img height="599" alt="painting of a screwdriver" width="600" src="https://www.plough.com/-/media/images/plough/quarterly/2024/38winterrepair/38armstrong/38armstrongembed1.jpg?la=en"></p><p>Raymond Logan, <em>Dad’s Drill,</em> oil, 2020.&nbsp;<span>All a</span><span>rtwork used by permission.</span></p>
</div>
<p>There is a conference room full of people responsible for a project like this: designers, architects, engineers, contractors, builders, tradespeople, accountants, and project managers minding every detail. No one person could ever build something like this. Only a few people involved in a construction project of this scale would actually know how it all comes together, and even they count on the hundreds of workers who spend hundreds of thousands of hours putting the whole thing together.</p>
<p><span>Some people know</span> how to build high-rise towers. Is this what I should aspire to? My life and my work are so tiny. I feel constant pressure, almost entirely of my own making, to be more driven, to aspire to larger public work, something grander, more life-changing, more important. When I see what others are capable of, I feel like I should do more: expand my business, build homes rather than just fixing them. Or that I should write more, establish a greater presence in the culture, have more say in shaping the world. Build more, earn more, write more, do more, be more. Dazzled by the things others are capable of, I lose track of what I actually can do and have done.</p>
<p>Am I doing enough? Should I be doing more? And what should I want for my son? How pleased I would be to watch him exceed everything I am and the things I can do. Is it my job to push him to aim higher, strive for more?</p>
<p>I’m a handyman. People hire me to fix things. My jobs start when someone tells me about something they’d like me to build, or some problem they want me to solve: we need to put a window in the north wall; we want a tile tub surround; this sink is leaky; our old fence is rotten and needs replacing; we’d like to paint our kitchen cabinets. </p>
<p>Each call or email is a window into a more complicated situation. If, say, there’s a damp spot on the kitchen ceiling, I’ll start by snooping around the house: just upstairs from the kitchen is a bathroom. Is there a leaky valve or a loose fitting? There’s no access panel to the plumbing in the bathroom, so I go back to the kitchen and cut out the wet section of the ceiling. I square the edges of the cut so it will be easier to patch, and I cut the hole a few inches beyond the wet section so I have better access to whatever it is that’s creating the problem. I can see the plumbing set between the joists, and&nbsp;– aha!&nbsp;– it’s not in the drain or the faucet but somewhere in the supply line. A loose nut on the braided supply hose, or a loose PEX connection?</p>
<p>However tricky the diagnosis, fixing the problem is always its own complicated puzzle. And then there is an inescapable intimacy to the work. I have to be mindful of the fact I’m inside someone else’s home, in their living space, maybe even standing on the kitchen counter, holding a drywall saw, carving a hole in the ceiling. These customers have had to admit a vulnerability, and they’ve asked me to come and help. The problem is mechanical, structural, or technical, but my work is every bit as much relational as it is physical. The repair problem is always tangible, but it’s always people I’m working for. I can fix the leak, I’m sure. But how quickly do they need it done? Can I work here in the kitchen while still allowing them to do what they need to do? Am I working quickly enough for them? Am I making more of a mess than they’d anticipated? And how perfect will they expect the drywall patch to look when I’m done?</p>
<p>Homeowners identify a problem, but usually I have to dig deeper to find its source. I have been doing this kind of work long enough that I have some sense of the kinds of things that go wrong in older homes, and what I lack in experience I can mostly make up for in determination and trustworthiness. I don’t always really know how to do whatever task I’ve said “yes” to, but I accept the responsibility to assess the problem as best I can, and will write a fair and honest bill when the work is done. (Actually, I often bill to my own detriment; I still don’t know how to properly charge for my work.)</p>
<p><span>For fourteen years</span> I’ve been doing this. My business strategy is nothing more than word-of-mouth and repeat customers&nbsp;– I’ve never advertised. It’s grown into a modest but thriving business, but it was born out of desperation and necessity, when I landed in a gap between jobs and needed to do <em>something</em> to earn some money. I knocked on our neighbors’ door and asked if they needed something&nbsp;– anything&nbsp;– built in their house. “A window seat and an indoor playhouse for the boys would be nice.” I’ve been fixing and building things ever since.</p>
<p>I call myself a part-time autodidact handyman, a playful term to distract folks from the fact that, on paper at least, I have no business whatsoever working on their house. I have a decent education in theology and literature, but zero official qualifications for building a deck or plumbing a kitchen sink or adding lights to an entryway. Autodidact isn’t quite right, though, because for years I worked as a laborer alongside experienced, qualified, and certified tradespeople: carpenters, bricklayers, a plumber, an electrician, and a glazier, all of which constituted a kind of informal apprenticeship in the general principles of building and construction. From these pros, I picked up a good sense of how to do good work: selecting quality materials, proper fasteners, decent tools; establishing an orderly worksite; maintaining professionalism with colleagues and good and honest communication with customers; knowing when to fuss with details and when the work is good enough; knowing when to push through and finish a job and when to pack up the tools and call it a day.</p>
<p>I still don’t mind asking for help from friends who are trained electricians, plumbers, framers, engineers, and architects. But the vast majority of what I know in my work has come from continuously saying “yes” to jobs I’ve never done before&nbsp;– I decided I could figure them out by being careful. Massive construction jobs take large teams, heavy equipment, advanced math, and huge budgets; in my kind of work you can get by with basic tools, junior-high math, honesty, a reasonable dose of common sense, courage, and, most of all, attention. In my kind of work you’d better take things apart carefully because you’re going to have to put them back together again.</p>
<div><p><img height="600" alt="painting of a hot water handle" width="600" src="https://www.plough.com/-/media/images/plough/quarterly/2024/38winterrepair/38armstrong/38armstrongembed2.jpg?la=en"></p><p>Raymond Logan, <em>Hot Handle</em>, oil, 2020.</p>
</div>
<p>So most of what I know about building I’ve learned from careful demolition, close attention, and common sense, shot through with medium-to-high anxiety as I mess with people’s homes. I’ve learned how to build by learning to take things apart, minding the various elements, noting materials and fasteners and what goes where, checking level and plumb (or approximations thereof in the old houses I typically work in). I’m learning how to communicate well with customers, to walk the line between the sort of exaggerated know-how that makes me look more qualified than I actually am, and the reflexively self-effacing disclaimers that come all too naturally to me and make people question whether they should have hired me at all.</p>
<p>I have renovated a dozen bathrooms and built kids’ beds, basement walls, frames for stretching art canvases, decorative wall structures, openings for new doors in old houses, elaborate bookshelves, storm windows, front decks, porch steps, boardwalks, woodsheds, backyard fences, cedar garden planters, crokinole boards, and picture frames. I’ve built a clothesline for an eco-conscious politician, a treehouse and zipline for the four kids of a single mom, a coffin for my father-in-law and another for an infant.</p>
<p>My projects are modest&nbsp;– the biggest thing I do is gut and renovate bathrooms&nbsp;– but the moment I step over the threshold to work on anyone’s house, it’s all on me to do good work and not wreck things. It’s simpler than a ten-story tower, but I carry the responsibility entirely.</p>
<p><span>I have a tiny workshop</span> in the basement of our house, where I keep my table saw and tools, and I’ll admit it’s a pain in the arse to haul the tools and materials up the stairs at the start of every day. Sometimes it’s hard even to get out of bed and face another day of this. I didn’t choose this because it’s my dream job. Handyman work is not my passion, not by a long shot. I don’t hate my work, but I don’t do it because I love it. I do it because I love my wife and kids and want to provide for them.</p>
<p>My kids get regular doses of “No limits!” and “You can be whatever you want!” in school, and I resent it because it simply isn’t true. You cannot actually be whatever you want. That’s harmful, sentimental garbage. Fact is, the real world is chock full of limits.</p>
<p>The other trouble with the promise that you can be anything is that you can spend a lifetime trying to be anything, forgetting that you actually already <em>are something</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I am a small man; I live a small life where I make careful, modest choices. I am not an entrepreneur, an adventurer, or a risk-taker. I don’t have the freewheeling imagination of an artist. Also, I know all too well that I come from a line of sensitive souls touched with mental health troubles that range from chronic everyday melancholy to the catastrophic. My mental health is like a bike with tires at 30 PSI instead of the suggested 80. I can pedal along most of the time and usually get where I need to go, but I spend a lot more emotional energy than necessary. I am not the kind of man who is likely to guide my children to greatness.</p>
<p>I don’t know who my children will be&nbsp;– ambitious, driven, fierce, and singular; or content, satisfied, and peaceful. Maybe they will do great things. I can’t say much to them about that. What I have to say is small, but I think it counts for more: “If I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge…but have not love, I am nothing.” Ever since they were little, I have prayed for them at night: “May they grow up to be strong, wise, kind people who know you and love you.”</p>
<p>I don’t know what they will do with their lives, where they will go, what they will learn and study, what kinds of work they will do. I was thirty-five before my vocation started to crystallize and I began finding work that was a good fit for who I am. So I’m not going to tell them what to do or make plans for what they will be. I might encourage some things and discourage other things: “I’d feel better about you being a carpenter than an investment banker because I think some jobs are more taxing on the soul than others.”</p>
<p><span>In <em>The Master and His Emissary</em></span>, the Scottish psychiatrist <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bookshop.org/a/78/9780300245929" target="_blank" title="Get the book">Iain McGilchrist argues</a> that for the past five centuries, we have constructed and inhabited a world of orderliness, mastery, and objects. Ours has become a left-brain-dominated world that prefers straight lines, predictability, and power. This has had catastrophic effects, he argues, because it undervalues human relationships. Our orderly mastery of materials is powerful, but it’s secondary&nbsp;– McGilchrist believes we’ve spent centuries mistakenly trusting our engineered, manufactured, modern, manipulated existence as though we have the power to construct something fixed and predictable, all to the detriment of the inextricable relatedness of everything. God bless modernity and its many comforts&nbsp;– penicillin, anesthetics, triple-pane windows, power grid, silicon chips, Netflix. Without modernity I wouldn’t have bananas, cordless tools, or emails from friends in Australia. But it’s becoming clear how costly it all is: glowing screens captivate and splinter our attention; our capacity to harness the power of stored carbon has unleashed a slow-moving catastrophe; our water and food are polluted; modern weaponry has killed millions.</p>
<p>Home repair helps pull me back to the primacy of human relationship. I begin with attention: I show up, attend, observe, and listen. Sometimes the customer needs someone to talk to as much as he needs his floor replaced. My work takes care, and when I do it well, love. I mostly work away from home, but wherever I go, I am always a father to my children. They are never more than one or two steps removed from every decision I make.</p>
<div><p><img height="595" alt="painting of a cordless screwdriver" width="600" src="https://www.plough.com/-/media/images/plough/quarterly/2024/38winterrepair/38armstrong/38armstrongembed3.jpg?la=en"></p><p>Raymond Logan, <em>Ode to a DeWalt Drill</em>, oil, 2013.</p>
</div>
<p>I like the word “integrity.” I grew up thinking it was primarily about moral behavior, and that I ought to strive to be a man of integrity. As a handyman, I’ve come to understand it more as a description of right relationship, that a thing has integrity when its parts work together and serve the whole. The integrity of a beautiful old house means that its systems and their thousands of parts work as a whole, from ridge cap to footing and everything in between. Roof trusses, studs, joists, shiplap, plumbing, eaves, windows, flooring, faucets, switches. A house will function as a house and a home when it is built well and maintained well, in an integrity of form and function, beauty and usability. If it is poorly made, or when it starts to fall apart, integrity suffers. Give a simple leak enough time and it is capable of ruining the whole thing.</p>
<p>Every week at church, the deacon reads this: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” Love God; love my neighbor. Who is my neighbor? I am grateful for the philosophers and theologians who have written complex, eloquent arguments. But it is neighbors, not philosophies, that I live and work for.</p>
<p>Every day when I go to work I think of my kids. I picture their faces and imagine their voices. I pray for just enough courage, audacity, stubbornness, and humility for the day’s work. I pray for willingness to face whatever the problem is, and I plunge in. I close my eyes and take a deep breath, thanking God for muscles that are strong enough and hands that are willing, for the gift of work where I can be useful to others. And I head out the door to help provide for my beloved children and their simple, beautiful, everyday needs.</p>

Spinning out of a research program from our team and academic collaborators, with roots in <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-08-hyena-safari">signal processing-inspired sequence models</a>, we are excited to introduce the <strong>StripedHyena </strong>models. This release includes <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/StripedHyena-Hessian-7B"><strong>StripedHyena-Hessian-7B</strong> <strong>(SH 7B)</strong></a>, a base model, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/StripedHyena-Nous-7B"><strong>StripedHyena-Nous-7B (SH-N 7B)</strong></a>, a chat model. StripedHyena builds on the many lessons learned in the past year on designing efficient sequence modeling architectures: <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/hungry-hungry-hippos-towards-language-modeling-with-state-space-models">H3</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-07-hyena">Hyena</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-29-hyena-dna">HyenaDNA</a>, and <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/monarch-mixer">Monarch Mixer</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/657376483aa570d149ef2a34_ezgif-1-cf1baf1671.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>StripedHyena is the first alternative model competitive with the best open-source Transformers in short and long-context evaluations. The same base model achieves comparable performance with<strong> </strong>Llama-2, Yi and Mistral 7B on OpenLLM leaderboard tasks, outperforming on long-context summarization.</li><li>StripedHyena is faster and more memory efficient for long sequence training, fine-tuning, and generation. Beside attention, one core computational primitive for efficient inference is a state-space model (SSM) layer, building on pioneering work such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">S4</a> (Gu el al.), enabling conversion of convolutional layers into recurrences. Using our latest research on fast kernels for gated convolutions (<a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/flashfftconv">FlashFFTConv</a>) and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">on efficient Hyena inference</a>, StripedHyena is &gt;30%, &gt;50%, and &gt;100% faster in end-to-end training on sequences of length 32k, 64k and 128k respectively, compared to an optimized Transformer baseline using FlashAttention v2 and custom kernels. StripedHyena caches for autoregressive generation are &gt;50% smaller than an equivalently-sized Transformer using grouped-query attention.&nbsp;</li><li>StripedHyena is designed using our latest research on <strong>scaling laws of efficient architectures.</strong> In particular, StripedHyena is a hybrid of attention and gated convolutions arranged in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena operators</a>. Via a compute-optimal scaling protocol, we identify several ways to improve on baseline scaling laws for Transformers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">Chinchilla</a>) at the architecture level, such as hybridization. With these techniques, we are able to obtain higher quality models than Transformers at each training compute budget, with additional benefits at inference time.</li><li>StripedHyena is optimized using a set of new <strong>model grafting</strong> techniques, enabling us to change the model architecture during training. StripedHyena was obtained by grafting architectural components of Transformers and Hyena, and trained on a mix of the RedPajama dataset, augmented with longer-context data.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>We look forward to further pushing the boundaries of model architectures for fast training and inference, allowing us to improve on existing scaling laws and to obtain higher quality base models at each compute budget. </p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>A single architecture for short and longer context tasks</strong>‍</h2><p>For the past year, the Together AI team and our collaborators at Hazy Research have been working on the design of new sequence models for language and other domains. We’ve been especially excited by architectures that replace attention as the primary operator responsible for mixing sequences of embeddings, and replacing them with alternatives that are computationally cheaper. We’ve developed several models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena</a>) that replace attention with implicit gated convolutions and gated SSMs, and trained some of the first alternative architectures rivaling Transformers on language.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Evaluation</strong></h3><p>We evaluate StripedHyena on a suite of benchmarks to establish performance on short-context tasks, as well as to probe its ability to process long prompts.&nbsp;</p><p>First, we test perplexity scaling on a subset of books from Project Gutenberg. We compute the perplexity on the last 2048 tokens of each sample, and repeat the experiment by including increasingly longer prefixes in the prompt of StripedHyena. We observe different behaviors depending on the structure of the sample; perplexity either saturates at 32k (the input length seen during the last stages of training), or keeps decreasing past 32k, suggesting that the model is able to incorporate some information from the longer prompt.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65732f121802735f813cafb9_PastedGraphic-5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Context length scaling on books sampled from the Gutenberg collection.

These observations echo findings described in various papers: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mega+arxiv+model&amp;oq=mega+arxiv+model&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l4j33i299.3100j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">MEGA</a> (among others) and find even earlier connections to the hybrid global-local attention design of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">GPT-3</a> (from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10509.pdf">Sparse Transformers</a>) and <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt_neo">GPTNeo</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>To understand this phenomenon, as well as the improvement on scaling coefficients – for example, the expected loss reduction per floating point operation (FLOP) in the budget – for a class of architectures, we carried out an extensive compute-optimal scaling analysis. We found hybrids composed of multi-head attention, gated MLPs and gated convolutions to outperform strong Transformer architectures such as Llama across compute budget, and identified optimal ways to mix these components, in both ordering and quantity.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65734be22ed8d1eca69a9876_graph23.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>[Left] Perplexity scaling of different architectures, as a function of compute budget.

We follow a compute-optimal protocol and identify the optimal model sizes for each FLOP group (each indicated via a different color) for base and hybrid architectures. To minimize the impact of hyperparameters on different architectures, we derive hyperparameter scaling laws from a subset of optimized experiments. <strong>Hybridizing improves on both scaling and robustness to training performed outside the compute-optimal frontier.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>With our academic partners, we have been developing theory and synthetic tasks to understand how and why this occurs. We have identified a variety of regimes where layers specialize to particular sub-tasks of sequence modeling, providing valuable signals for further architecture optimization. This continues our general line of work on <strong>mechanistic design</strong>, which involves small-scale, synthetic tasks carefully constructed to stress-test architecture capabilities.</p><h3><strong>Multi-head gated convolutions</strong></h3><p>‍</p><p>Another way to improve over Transformer rates is to introduce additional computation in the form of multiple heads in gated convolutions. This design, inspired by linear attention, has been validated in architectures such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">MultiHyena</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">is provably more efficient at encoding associative recall circuits.</a>&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/6573717223a903c3f413a3bd_white%20lines.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>We validate a variety of architectural improvements via compute-optimal scaling.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>These are two of many architectural design techniques that can result in improved scaling over Transformers. With StripedHyena, we focus in particular on the synergy between attention and gated convolutions.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>A shift in the computational footprint of language models: Cheaper fine-tuning, faster inference</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p>Optimizing models built on a different architecture requires rethinking computational trade-offs of training, fine-tuning, and inference. For these new architectures, a different set of computational bottlenecks emerges, and we’re proud to have developed the key technologies enabling these models as well, such as <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/flashfftconv">FlashFFTConv</a> and its <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/h3">predecessors</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>For training and fine-tuning workloads on long sequences, SH 7B is always faster than optimized Transformers (&gt;10%, &gt;20% and &gt;50% end-to-end faster than FlashAttention v2 processing sequences of lengths 32k, 64k and 128k, at batch size 1), with the speedup growing larger on longer sequences and with larger batches. StripedHyena models are optimal candidates for fine-tuning on long-context tasks – for tasks at length 128k, SH 7B can finetune on more than twice as many tokens as a Transformer given the same budget.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65732f3e6bb6da558f966bb8_PastedGraphic-4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><strong> </strong>End-to-end batch size 1 latency of an optimized Transformer 7B (FlashAttention v2 and custom kernels) compared to SH 7B.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>These improvements are driven by the different asymptotic scaling and computational profile of layers in the hybrid architecture. We look forward to even faster models with refined mixing ratios and layers.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Reducing memory for inference</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p>One additional advantage of SH 7B is a &gt;50% reduced memory footprint during autoregressive generation, compared to a Transformer (both with grouped-query attention). In Transformers, the key and value entries of each layer are cached during the <em>prefilling</em> phase to avoid recomputation and speed up incremental decoding. Gated-convolution layers introduce significantly more degrees of freedom during inference, as there are several ways to represent and optimize computation. We explore these trade-offs in our recent research on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">distillation and representation of convolutions in Hyena</a>. These new techniques have been used in SH 7B to further reduce the memory footprint by identifying and pruning redundant states.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65732f59425c945fc9fbfe71_PastedGraphic-6.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Memory footprint of inference cache for GQA Transformer and StripedHyena, including key-value cache and convolution states (FIR and IIR).&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From signal processing to language models</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p>The flexibility of StripedHyena is a direct consequence of the existence of multiple equivalent representations and parametrization of linear systems: convolutional, modal, canonical. Each form is better suited to a specific training and inference workload.</p><p>‍</p><p>Borrowing terminology from classical signal processing, SH convolutional filters can be broadly treated as&nbsp; either finite (FIR) or infinite (IIR). FIR caching for a convolution is analogous to standard key-value caching (kv caching) in attention – particularly the sliding window kind – and grows in memory footprint (until a maximum value).</p><p>‍</p><p>IIR filters on the other hand can be applied by caching a constant-size state, then updated during decoding via a recurrent step. The IIR representation can itself be customized. Fixed-size states, in contrast to kv caches, open up several key optimizations at the inference stack level, streamlining techniques such as continuous batching and speculative decoding.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>What’s ahead&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Our primary objective with the StripedHyena models is to push the frontier of architecture design beyond Transformers. StripedHyena only scratches the surface of what is possible with careful architecture design via mechanistic design and scaling laws, and with ideas such hybridization, implicit convolutions and state caching. We hope these models can inspire the open source community to explore new exciting builds with diverse architectures.</p><p>‍</p><p>In future versions we will explore:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Larger models with longer context.&nbsp;</li><li>Multi-modal support.&nbsp;</li><li>Further performance optimizations.&nbsp;</li><li>Integration of StripedHyena into retrieval pipelines for full utilization of longer context.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></h2><p>This work would not have been possible without our collaborators at <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/">HazyResearch</a>, <a href="https://hessian.ai/">Hessian.AI</a>, <a href="https://nousresearch.com/">Nous Research</a>, <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">MILA</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/">HuggingFace</a>, <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web">DFKI</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We are grateful to Hessian.AI Innovation Lab (funded by the Hessian Ministry for Digital Strategy and Innovation) and the hessian.AISC Service Center (funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)) for the collaboration and joint use of their AI supercomputer forty-two.

<p><strong>RNAi</strong> – In the context of American chestnut restoration, this is a method whereby partial sequences of important pathogenicity genes from the chestnut blight fungus are inserted into American chestnut. The partial fungal sequences are expressed in the chestnut tree as double stranded RNA, which are then degraded by the chestnut trees through a pathway called RNA interference. The degradation of the key fugal pathogenicity genes by the host reduces the chestnut blight fungal virulence. Thus far ESF researchers have used this technology to silence chestnut blight genes involved in the production of oxalic acid, which reduces the chestnut blight fungus’s ability to kill tissues in chestnut bark.</p>
