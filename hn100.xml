<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Concepts</h2>
<p dir="auto">Catala is a programming language adapted for socio-fiscal legislative literate
programming. By annotating each line of the legislative text with its meaning
in terms of code, one can derive an implementation of complex socio-fiscal
mechanisms that enjoys a high level of assurance regarding the code-law
faithfulness.</p>
<p dir="auto">Concretely, you have to first gather all the laws, executive orders, previous
cases, etc. that contain information about the socio-fiscal mechanism that
you want to implement. Then, you can proceed to annotate the text article by
article, in your favorite text editor :</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/ScreenShotVSCode.png"><img src="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/ScreenShotVSCode.png" alt="Screenshot" height="350"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">Once your code is complete and tested, you can use the Catala
compiler to produce a lawyer-readable PDF version of your
implementation. The Catala language has been specially designed
in collaboration with law professionals to ensure that the code
can be reviewed and certified correct by the domain experts, which
are in this case lawyers and not programmers.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/CatalaScreenShot.png"><img src="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/CatalaScreenShot.png" alt="Screenshot" height="350"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">The Catala language is special because its logical structure mimics
the logical structure of the law. Indeed, the core concept of
"definition-under-conditions" that builds on default logic has been formalized
by Professor Sarah Lawsky in her article
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3088206" rel="nofollow">A Logic for Statutes</a>.
The Catala language is the only programming language to our knowledge that
embeds default logic as a first-class feature, which is why it is the only
language perfectly adapted to literate legislative programming.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting started</h2>
<p dir="auto">To get started, the best place is the <a href="https://catala-lang.org/en/examples/tutorial" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>
of the language. A <a href="https://catala-lang.org/fr/examples/tutoriel" rel="nofollow">French version</a>
is also available but might be out of sync with the latest language features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> bleeding-edge version</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are interested in the latest development version, pre-built artifacts
including binaries and API documentation can be found at
<a href="https://catalalang.github.io/catala" rel="nofollow">https://catalalang.github.io/catala</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building and installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Catala is available as an <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/catala/" rel="nofollow">opam package</a>!
If opam is installed on your machine, simply execute:</p>

<p dir="auto">To get the cutting-edge, latest version of Catala, you
can also do</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="opam pin add catala --dev-repo"><pre><code>opam pin add catala --dev-repo
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">However, if you wish to get the latest developments of the compiler, you probably
want to compile it from the sources of this repository or use nix. For that, see
<a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/INSTALL.md">the dedicated readme</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Catala</h3>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>catala --help</code> if you have installed it to get more information about the
command line options available. The man page is also <a href="https://catala-lang.org/en/doc/catala" rel="nofollow">available
online</a>. To get the development version
of the help, run <code>make help_catala</code> after <code>make build</code>. The <code>catala</code> binary
corresponds to the Catala compiler.</p>
<p dir="auto">The top-level <code>Makefile</code> contains a lot of useful targets to run. To display
them, use</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Plugin backends</h3>
<p dir="auto">While the compiler has some builtin backends for Catala (Python, Ocaml, etc.),
it is also possible to add a custom backend to the Catala compiler without
having to modify its source code. This plugin solution relies on dynamic
linking: see <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/compiler/plugins/README.md">the dedicated README</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Clerk</h3>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>clerk --help</code> if you have installed it to get more information about the
command line options available. To get the development version of the help, run
<code>make help_clerk</code> after <code>make build</code>. The <code>clerk</code> binary corresponds to the
Catala build system, responsible for testing among other things.</p>
<p dir="auto">To get more information about Clerk, see <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/tree/master/build_system/README.md">the dedicated readme</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Catleg</h3>
<p dir="auto">Catleg is a command line utility providing useful integration with
<a href="https://legifrance.gouv.fr/" rel="nofollow">LÃ©giFrance</a>, the official repository of French
legal documentation. See the <a href="https://github.com/catalaLang/catleg">decidated
repository</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Syntax cheat sheet</h3>
<p dir="auto">A complete and handy reference of the Catala syntax can be found in the <a href="https://catalalang.github.io/catala/syntax.pdf" rel="nofollow">cheat
sheet</a> (for French and English
versions of the syntax).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Formal semantics</h3>
<p dir="auto">To audit the formal proof of the partial certification of the Catala compiler,
see <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/doc/formalization/README.md">the dedicated readme</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiler documentation</h3>
<p dir="auto">The documentation is accessible online, both for the <a href="https://catala-lang.org/ocaml_docs/" rel="nofollow">latest release</a> and <a href="https://catalalang.github.io/catala/api-doc/" rel="nofollow">bleeding-edge version</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is otherwise generated from the compiler source code using
<code>dune</code> and <code>odoc</code>. Run</p>

<p dir="auto">to generate the documentation, then open the <code>doc/odoc.html</code> file in any browser.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2>
<p dir="auto">To explore the different programs written in Catala, see
<a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/examples/README.md">the dedicated readme</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">API</h2>
<p dir="auto">To know how to use the code generated by the Catala compiler in your favorite
programming language, head to the <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/french_law/README.md">readme of the French law library</a>. The corresponding pre-built examples are also <a href="https://catalalang.github.io/catala/" rel="nofollow">available</a>.</p>

for a sub-directory.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations and disclaimer</h2>
<p dir="auto">Catala is a research project from Inria, the French National
Research Institute for Computer Science. The compiler is yet
unstable and lacks some of its features.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pierre Catala</h2>
<p dir="auto">The language is named after Pierre Catala, a professor of law who
pionneered the French legaltech by creating a computer database of law cases,
Juris-Data. The research group that he led in the late 1960s, the
Centre dâÃ©tudes et de traitement de lâinformation juridique (CETIJ),
has also influenced the creation by state conselor Lucien Mehl of the
Centre de recherches et dÃ©veloppement en informatique juridique (CENIJ),
which eventually transformed into the entity managing the LegiFrance website,
acting as the public service of legislative documentation.</p>

In the 2000s and 2010s these regular public demonstrations were filled with suspense and anticipation What would the phones look like this year? Which executive would Steve Jobs personally execute in a windowless room immediately following the presentation? Would the new iPhone finally solve my problems and make me happy?</p><p>Here in 2023, that air of mystery and expectation is gone. Every phone looks the same; every announcement has been widely leaked. But there is still a good reason to attend to Appleâs marketing extravaganzas: The fake texts.</p><p>Iâm talking about the mocked-up texts and emails Apple puts together to demonstrate new messaging features in its operating-system updates, presumably written by some well-paid professionals in Appleâs marketing department. These eerily cheery, aggressively punctuated messages suggest a alternate dimension in which polite, good-natured, rigorously diverse groups of friends and coworkers use Apple products exactly how they are designed to be used, without complaint or error.

Like Android users, irony simply does not occur in Dimension Apple.</p><p>For a long time I have enjoyed the stilted, improbable cheeriness of fake Apple texts for their extreme distance from my own texting habits and experiences. (As my friend Emma put it to our group chat âif any of you texted me like this I would immediately call your significant others to make sure you hadnât been kidnapped.â) But in the last year or so I have realized that Dimension Apple does exist--or at least overlaps with our own--in one very specific place: The WhatsApp groups that the parents at my sonâs daycare/school create to share information or set up play dates. In these groups, and only in these groups, do I encounter the same kind of earnest helpfulness and baffling ebullience that exists in the Dimension Apple. Naturally, I find them totally alienating.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png" width="1456" height="94" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/baaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:94,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:17721,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>To aid future study of the Dimension Apple, Iâm publishing all the screenshots and images of fake Apple texts I was able to pull from the Wayback Machine below.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In Rust, there are certain API decisions about what is and isnât sound that impact all Rust code.
That is, a decision was made to allow or not allow types which have certain safety requirements, and
now all users are committed to that decision. They canât just use a different API with different
rules: <em>all</em> APIs must conform to these rules.</p><p>These rules are determined through certain âmarkerâ traits. If a safe API could do something to a
value of a type which some types donât support, the API must be bound by that marker trait, so that
users can not pass values of those types which donât support that behavior to that API. In contrast,
if Rust allows APIs to perform that behavior on any type, without any sort of marker trait bound,
then types which donât support that behavior cannot exist.</p><p>Iâm going to give three examples to show what I mean, each of which Rust has considered at different
points, though only the first one actually exists in Rust.</p><h2 id="rules-of-rust">Rules of Rust</h2><h3 id="send"><code>Send</code></h3><p>Letâs say you want Rust to support types which canât be sent across threads. There are a couple of
examples of <em>why</em> you would want this:</p><ul><li>The type provides shared ownership without synchronizing interior mutable writes to the reference
count (e.g. <code>Rc</code>)</li><li>The type may wrap an OS API that doesnât guaranteee thread safety (e.g. <code>Args</code>, <code>MutexGuard</code>)</li></ul><p>To support this, you would include a marker trait called <code>Send</code>, which is the set of types which
<em>can</em> be sent across threads. Any API which might send a value to another thread needs to include a
<code>Send</code> bound, such as:</p><ul><li><code>thread::spawn</code>, which spawns a thread</li><li><code>rayon::join</code>, which runs two tasks on a thread pool</li><li><code>tokio::spawn</code>, which may move this task to another thread of the executor</li></ul><p>Of course, Rust chose to support types which canât be sent across threads, and so it has a <code>Send</code>
bound. But an alternative Rust could have just as easily chosen that <em>all</em> types in Rust must
support sending across threads, and effectively all interior mutability would need to be
synchronized. Indeed, the <code>Send</code> trait is actually a decision fully enforced by the standard
library: someone could release an âalternative libcoreâ which imposes this requirement with no
change to rustc, though it wouldnât be compatible with any of the Rust code that exists in the
world.</p><h3 id="move"><code>Move</code></h3><p>Letâs say you want Rust to support types which canât be invalidated without running their destructor
once their address has been witnessed. This is a sort of wonky and specific definition of
âimmoveable type,â but it happens to fit perfectly for what stackless coroutines and intrusive
data structures require.</p><p>To support this, you would include a marker trait called <code>Move</code>, which is the set of types that can
be moved freely. Unlike <code>Send</code>, <code>Move</code> requires some language support: I think the simplest way to
implement it would be to say that operations that take the address of something take ownership of
types if they donât implement <code>Move</code> (so <code>let x = &amp;mut y;</code> takes ownership of <code>y</code>, effectively
preventing you from ever moving it again.) And the magic behavior of <code>Box</code> which lets you move out
of it would need to be bound by <code>Move</code> as well.</p><p>Additionally, certain APIs would need to be bounded by <code>Move</code>, which let you move out of a
reference, such as:</p><ul><li><code>mem::swap</code> lets you swap values behind two mutable references</li><li><code>mem::replace</code> lets you replace the value behind a mutable reference with another</li></ul><p>Youâll notice that Rust doesnât have a <code>Move</code> trait; instead, it provides the same guarantees using
the <code>Pin</code> wrapper around pointer types. Even though the <code>Move</code> trait would have probably been a
much easier to use API, it proved difficult to add in a backward compatible way (Iâll explain why in
a moment), so instead the <code>Pin</code> API was added and used only in the new interfaces that required
these semantics.</p><h3 id="leak"><code>Leak</code></h3><p>Letâs say you want Rust to support types which canât go out of scope without running their
destructor. This is one of the two different definitions of âlinear types,â it is less expressive
than the other (which would also prevent a destructor from running, requiring the type to be
destructured as its final end), but it is the easier of the two to add to the language (because it
works better with generics), and it supports all of the most compelling use cases for linear types.</p><p>To support this, you would include a marker trait called <code>Leak</code>, which is the set of types that can
go out of scope without running their destructors. Like <code>Send</code> and unlike <code>Move</code>, this would require
no language support at all: its not possible to âleakâ a value in the core language of Rust, you
have to use standard library APIs to do it.</p><p>Certain APIs would have to be bound by <code>Leak</code>:</p><ul><li>APIs that always leak a value (<code>mem::forget</code>)</li><li>APIs that make it your responsibility to run the destructor (<code>ManuallyDrop::new</code>)</li><li>APIs that allow cyclic shared ownership and can accidentally leak values (<code>Rc::new</code>, <code>Arc::new</code>)</li></ul><p>Of course, Rust doesnât have the <code>Leak</code> trait, but it almost did. This discussion came to a head in
early 2015, when the scoped thread API that Rust was using was found to be unsound, because its
safety depended on its guard type never leaking. It was decided (in some haste, because the 1.0
release was scheduled within a few months of the controversy) that Rust would not support types that
canât be leaked, and so the <code>Leak</code> trait would not be added.</p><h2 id="changing-the-rules">Changing the rules</h2><p>Thereâs been a renewed interest in supporting linear types in Rust, especially because of what I
called the <a href="https://without.boats/blog/the-scoped-task-trilemma">scoped task trilemma</a>, which is only true because of the fact that destructors
cannot be guaranteed to run. Unlike immoveable types, there is no isolated API addition that could
support guaranteeing that a destructor will run, the way there was with <code>Pin</code>. (You can guarantee a
destructor will run if you never give up ownership of the object and use a kind of closure passing
style, but this isnât adequate for the âscoped taskâ use case). So some users would like to see Rust
add a <code>Leak</code> trait.</p><p>There are two possible ways a marker trait like <code>Leak</code> could be added to Rust:</p><ol><li><strong>Auto trait:</strong> you could add a new auto trait, like <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code></li><li><strong>?Trait:</strong> you could add a new â?Trait,â like <code>Sized</code></li></ol><p>Each of these presents certain challenges regarding backward compatibility.</p><h3 id="auto-traits">Auto traits</h3><p>At first glance, adding auto traits might seem like a backward compatible change. You add a new
trait, <code>Leak</code>, which says that a type can be leaked. Types that donât implement this trait
cannot go out of scope without running their destructor. Because all types in Rust today necessarily
can be leaked (this is a consequence of the decision <em>not</em> to have a <code>Leak</code> trait), its perfectly
fine for all types to implement <code>Leak</code>. This is the semantics of an auto trait, so it sounds like it
should work great.</p><p>The problem comes when you go to add bounds to the APIs that can be used to leak values, like <code>mem::forget</code>. If you want to make it so that types that donât implement <code>Leak</code>d
cannot be leaked, you need to add a bound to <code>mem::forget</code>. But there are two ways in which this
is not backward compatible.</p><p>First, it does not work with generics. This code is legal today, but would break if you add a
<code>Leak</code> bound to <code>mem::forget</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>forget_generic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>value</span>: <span>T</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>mem</span>::<span>forget</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is because there is no <code>Leak</code> bound on the type parameter for this function. Adding such a
bound to the API of <code>mem::forget</code> (or any other API that can forget values) would be a breaking
change.</p><p>Another way in which it is not backward compatible is that trait object types will not implement
<code>Leak</code> unless they add <code>+ Leak</code>. Trait object types do not inherit impls by way of auto traits,
because you donât actually know what type the trait object is. So a trait object like <code>dyn Future</code>
does not implement <code>Leak</code>. For example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>forget_trait_object</span><span>(</span><span>object</span>: <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span><span> </span><span>Display</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>mem</span>::<span>forget</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="traits">?Traits</h3><p>So if adding an auto trait is not backward compatible, we are left turning to the <code>?Trait</code> solution.
But there are problems here as well.</p><p>in the strictest sense, adding a new trait like <code>?Leak</code> is backward compatible. Instead of adding
new bounds to APIs like <code>mem::forget</code>, you would be <em>relaxing</em> the bounds on other APIs. So all of
the code above would be fine, because to make a generic function that takes a linear type, you would
have to write a <code>?Leak</code> bound.</p><p>The first problem with this for something like <code>Leak</code> is that the vast majority of generic APIs in
Rust cannot possibly forget their value; after all, even though memory leaks are not undefined
behavior, they are still undesirable and mostly avoided. This is quite different from <code>Sized</code>:
because passing something by value requires <code>Sized</code>, the large majority of generic APIs in Rust
require <code>Sized</code>, and so <code>?Sized</code> bounds are relatively rare. In contrast, adding <code>?Leak</code> would
create a permanent scar across the ecosystem, as the vast majority of generics would gain a <code>T: ?Leak</code> bound.</p><p>The second problem is bigger, though: the interaction between <code>?Traits</code> and associated types means
that it is a breaking change to add a <code>?Trait</code> bound to an associated type. This means that any
stable associated type in the standard library cannot gain a <code>?Leak</code> bound.</p><p>Consider this example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>forget_iterator</span><span>(</span><span>iter</span>: <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Iterator</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>iter</span><span>.</span><span>for_each</span><span>(</span><span>mem</span>::<span>forget</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will forget every element of the iterator, even though the <code>Iterator::Item</code> associated type is
never mentioned. Therefore, <code>Iterator::Item</code> must implement <code>Leak</code>, always. The compiler is allowed
to assume that the item of every iterator implements <code>Leak</code>, and it would be a breaking change to
invalidate that assumption.</p><p>The implications of this are far reaching. If <code>Leak</code> were added as a <code>?Trait</code>, all of these things
would not be possible with linear types:</p><ul><li><strong>Iterator:</strong> You couldnât construct an iterator of linear types.</li><li><strong>Future:</strong> You couldnât construct a future that evaluates to a linear type (and so you couldnât
return a linear type from an async function).</li><li><strong>Deref:</strong> You couldnât dereference a Box containing a linear type, or dereference a vector of
linear types to a slice of linear types, or any other smart pointer type.</li><li><strong>Index:</strong> You couldnât index a collection of a linear type, so you couldnât index into a slice of
linear types or into a map with linear values.</li><li><strong>Add/Sub/Mul/Div:</strong> You couldnât have a linear type as the output value of any overloaded
arithmetic operator.</li></ul><p>One special set of associated types is the return value of the <code>Fn</code> traits. The Rust project has
specifically made it difficult to refer to the <code>Output</code> associated type of these traits, so that it
would have flexibility to change this in the future. Still, certain issues were encountered in the
past when experimenting with a <code>Move</code> trait. Itâs not clear to me if these issues would have been
encountered with other traits (like <code>Leak</code>) or if they were specific to the built-in semantics of
<code>Move</code>.</p><p>Basically, there is a very steep trade off in choosing to add a new <code>?Trait</code> - especially one that
wouldnât be relevant to very many bounds, like <code>Leak</code> - because you will add confusing new syntax to
a huge variety of generic interfaces in exchange for getting a very limited new feature. I would
consider adopting something like <code>?Leak</code> a poor cost-benefit analysis, even if we do accept that the
current Rust rules are âwrongâ and we wish Rust had linear types.</p><h3 id="editions">Editions</h3><p>The final thing that needs to be considered is the edition mechanism. Is it possible, using the
edition mechanism, to introduce one of these traits? Maybe.</p><p>Each edition in effect forms a âdialectâ of Rust, all of which are supported by the same compiler.
So at first glance it sounds plausible that in one dialect of Rust, all types can be forgotten, and
in another dialect, the <code>Leak</code> trait exists. The problem is that a hard requirement on editions is
that crates from one edition can depend on crates from another edition, so that the upgrade from one
edition to the next is seamless and voluntary.</p><p>Consider that the Rust project decided to add the <code>Leak</code> trait in the 2024 edition. All of the
code in the 2021 edition needs to still work - including code like the examples I showed above.
Sure, you can use a tool like cargo fix to add <code>Leak</code> bounds everywhere and expect users to relax
them on their own as they move into the 2024 edition, but the code from the 2021 edition needs to
work without modification.</p><p>A way to possibly do this would be to make trait coherence depend on edition, so that in pre-2024
editions, every type meets the <code>Leak</code> bounds, even types that absolutely shouldnât, like unbounded
generics, and trait object types that donât mention <code>Leak</code>. If, in the pre-2024 editions, all
types implement <code>Leak</code>, then the added bounds will never fail.</p><p><em>However</em> - and this is the big, enormous caveat of this section - this would rely on the compiler
effectively implementing some kind of unbreakable firewall, to prevent a type that does not
implement <code>Leak</code> from ever getting used with pre-2024 code. This would mean:</p><ul><li>Any time post-2024 code instantiates a generic from pre-2024 code, it needes to check that the
type it instatiates it with implements <code>Leak</code>, even though the pre-2024 code doesnât have such a
bound.</li><li>Any time pre-2024 code calls post-2024 code, it needs to check that the types it gets from that
API implement <code>Leak</code> (under the 2024 edition rules). Note that the standard library would be
considered post-2024 code, so every call to a std API would involve checking types for <code>Leak</code> in
the pre-2024 editions.</li></ul><p>I donât know if this is even possible to implement, probably it would have pretty bad effect on
compile times at least on pre-2024 edition code, and it would likely create a very difficult
transition at first. But in the longer term at least it would leave <code>Leak</code> in the ârightâ state
(as an auto trait, which can be used with old associated types correctly, and not as a ?Trait).</p><h2 id="what-should-be-done">What should be done</h2><p>If I could go back in time to 2015, I think I would probably add both <code>Move</code> and <code>Leak</code> to Rust.
There are certain downsides, which were highlighted by the team at the time in their decision not to
add <code>Leak</code>: any trait object type which needs to meet these bounds needs to add <code>+ Move</code> or <code>+ Leak</code> to their definition. Having two auto traits of such global significance (<code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>)
was already considered enough of a burden.</p><p>But if Iâm honest, I have the impression (I wasnât there) that the decision to exclude <code>Leak</code> was at
least partly a matter of expediency: my understanding is that the Rust team at Mozilla was under
incredible pressure from their management to ship a 1.0 on the deadline they set, and this probably
influenced their decision not to make any last minute changes to the rules that could impact meeting
that deadline.</p><p>In a language with <code>Leak</code>, the scoped task trilemma wouldnât exist, the simpler scoped thread API
would be safe, GC-integration would possibly be easier, and Iâve gotten the impression many systems
APIs would be easier to wrap safely (though I donât know the details of this).</p><p>In a language with <code>Move</code>, the <code>Pin</code> type wouldnât need to exist, users would therefore not have
such annoyance dealing with it, and so-called âpin projectionsâ wouldnât be an issue requiring
macros to solve, and making self-referential generators would present no complication for the
<code>Iterator</code> trait.</p><p>However, making these changes now is a much thornier problem. I think the edition-based technique is
the only viable solution for adding a new, globally relevant marker trait (except for certain unique
exceptions, like <code>DynSized</code>, not discussed here). And I think there are all kinds of reasons to
think that wouldnât work - that it would be too difficult to implement, that the implementation
would have too many soundness holes, that the transition would be too disruptive, that itâs actually
totally impossible because Iâve missed something important.</p><p>This is why Iâm very glad we found the <code>Pin</code> solution for immoveable types, and were able to ship
self-referential futures and async/await syntax on top of them, in a reasonable time frame without
major disruption to all existing users. When it comes to <code>Leak</code> and linear types, I just despair.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>A</span></span>s Vladimir Nabokov revised his autobiography,<em> </em><em>Speak, Memory</em>, he found himself in a strange psychological state. He had first written the book in English, published in 1951. A few years later, a New York publisher asked him to translate it back into Russian for the Ã©migrÃ© community. The use of his mother tongue brought back a flood of new details from his childhood, which he converted into his adopted language for a final edition, published in 1966.</p><p>âThis re-Englishing of a Russian re-version of what had been an English re-telling of Russian memories in the first place, proved to be a diabolical task,â he wrote. âBut some consolation was given me by the thought that such multiple metamorphosis, familiar to butterflies, had not been tried by any human before.â</p><p>Over the past decade, psychologists have become increasingly interested in using such mental metamorphoses. Besides altering the quality of our memories, switching between languages can influence peopleâs financial decision-making and their appraisal of moral dilemmas. By speaking a second language, we can even become more rational, more open-minded and better equipped to deal with uncertainty. This phenomenon is known as the âforeign language effectâ and the benefits may be an inspiration for anyone who would like to enrich their mind with the words of another tongue.</p><p>The foreign language effect should not be confused with the older concept of âlinguistic determinismâ, which proposes that the specific words and grammar of a language can change the way we perceive the world. In this view, peopleâs colour perception should change according to the terms that we use to divide the rainbow, while peopleâs perception of time may be influenced by the grammatical tenses they use.</p><p>You may be familiar with this idea from the film <em><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/does-century-old-linguistic-hypothesis-center-film-arrival-have-any-merit-180961284/" data-link-name="in body link">Arrival</a></em>, in which the aliensâ language mysteriously shapes their experience of the world. Whether this happens in real life, however, is still a matter of considerable scientific debate. The foreign language effect does not depend on the particular features of the language that someone speaks; instead, it is concerned with the general experience of moving from a first to a second language. How will my thinking change, for example, when I move from English, which I absorbed in my cot, to Italian, which I have painstakingly studied as an adult?</p><h2 id="influencing-moral-reasoning-the-trolley-problem">Influencing moral reasoning: the âtrolley problemâ</h2><p>For Prof Boaz Keysar at the University of Chicago, who pioneered this research, the inspiration was personal. He grew up in Israel, and has now lived in the US for more than three decades, but still finds that Hebrew has more emotional resonance than English. Driving home from work one day, he started to wonder whether this might influence our moral reasoning, which is often driven by our gut feelings rather than logical reasoning.</p><p>Imagine, for instance, that you are standing on a footbridge when you see that an oncoming train is about to kill five people walking on the track. The only way to save these five people is to push a heavy man off the bridge in front of the train. He will die but the impact will prevent the train from hitting the other five people. This is considered the âutilitarianâ choice in a version of the thought experiment known as the âtrolley problemâ. Many people feel such strong revulsion at the idea of pushing the man to his death that they would prefer to take no action at all, even though that means that many more lives will be lost.</p><p>In a preliminary experiment, Keysarâs team asked participants who had learned Spanish as a second language to consider this dilemma in either their native or adopted tongue. As he had hypothesised, they were far more likely to make the utilitarian choice when they used Spanish compared with English. The effect was so big that Keysar delayed publishing the results. âI just didnât believe the data,â he says. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0094842" data-link-name="in body link">later collaboration</a> with Albert Costa at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, however, documented the same results across diverse participants from the US, Europe and Asia. In one sample, participants were twice as likely to choose the utilitarian option when speaking a second language.</p><figure id="b208b555-b513-4128-99ff-32fb1347e6b0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba70a8080d9ad00ef46335795839de097c0b4397/112_240_6568_3942/master/6568.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba70a8080d9ad00ef46335795839de097c0b4397/112_240_6568_3942/master/6568.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba70a8080d9ad00ef46335795839de097c0b4397/112_240_6568_3942/master/6568.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba70a8080d9ad00ef46335795839de097c0b4397/112_240_6568_3942/master/6568.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba70a8080d9ad00ef46335795839de097c0b4397/112_240_6568_3942/master/6568.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba70a8080d9ad00ef46335795839de097c0b4397/112_240_6568_3942/master/6568.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Amy Adams in Arrival" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba70a8080d9ad00ef46335795839de097c0b4397/112_240_6568_3942/master/6568.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.08130328867236" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Amy Adams in Denis Villeneuveâs 2016 sci-fi drama Arrival.

Previous experiments showed that people are unwilling to risk losing a small amount of money for the chance of winning a bigger sum, even if the odds are tipped in their favour. If you give people a 50% chance of winning Â£2.50, for example, or offer them the opportunity to take Â£1 for sure, most people go for the guaranteed money. This may pay off in the short term, but when you have made many such decisions, it severely limits your profits.</p><p>Myopic loss aversion is a serious problem for investors, but Keysar found that this tendency was much less pronounced when the bets were presented in a foreign language. âPeople just hate the prospect of losing,â says Keysar. âBut they hate it less in a foreign language.â Further experiments have shown that speaking a foreign language can also reduce the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001002771300228X" data-link-name="in body link">framing effect</a>, which is our tendency to be swayed by the particular phrasing of information, and the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20445911.2023.2216918" data-link-name="in body link">sunk cost effect</a>, which is our reluctance to leave a failing endeavour.</p><p>One of the most intriguing recent studies tested the âbias blind spotâ â the expectation that we are less susceptible to error than the average person. âWe believe that other people are stupid, and we are not,â explains MichaÅ BiaÅek, an associate professor at the University of WrocÅaw, Poland. In line with Keysarâs findings, he found that speaking a foreign language <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/13670069221110383" data-link-name="in body link">punctures this egotistical way of thinking</a>.</p><p>It is now 11 years since Keysar published his first paper on the foreign language effect. Over the same period, many psychological findings have crumbled under scrutiny â but not the foreign language effect. âItâs consistent and replicable,â says Simone Sulpizio, an associate professor at the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy, who conducted a recent <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/decisionmaking-depends-on-language-a-metaanalysis-of-the-foreign-language-effect/357CDDF948DB7FC3C101534F1EA3442A" data-link-name="in body link">meta-analysis</a> examining the evidence to date, though both he and BiaÅek emphasise that we need more research into the mechanisms behind the effect.</p><h2 id="the-memory-game">The memory game</h2><p>Psychologists have also started to explore how the foreign language effect may touch many other areas of our psyche. Consider memory, the topic of Nabokovâs musings. We encode our recollections with verbal narratives, particular words triggering specific associations attached to an event. As a result, a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11006905/" data-link-name="in body link">childhood memory</a> may seem less vivid when someone recalls it using a language that was acquired later in life. That may be a disadvantage for someone writing a memoir in a foreign tongue. On the plus side, it could help people to process painful events. People who recalled a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1133915/full" data-link-name="in body link">childhood trauma in a second language</a> showed less emotional distress than those recounting the event in their native tongue.</p><p>Keysarâs <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0001378" data-link-name="in body link">latest study</a>, led by his PhD student Leigh Grant, has shown that the foreign language effect can discourage the creation of false memories. In one experiment, the participants were first given a list of connected words, such as âdreamâ, âsnoozeâ, âbedâ and ârestâ. When their recall was tested later, many people mistakenly remembered hearing the word sleep, which was not on the list. This is a standard technique to test peopleâs tendency to form false memories, and it was considerably less likely to happen if they performed the task in their foreign language.</p><p>In a follow-up experiment, the team showed participants two clips of robberies from the films <em>The Pink Panther</em> and <em>Rififi</em>, before playing them audio narratives of the same events that contained some false details. This can muddy peopleâs memories so that they begin to incorporate the misinformation into their own recollections. Once again, participants managed to avoid more of those errors when they heard the descriptions in their second language.</p><p>Keysar suggests that people employ more careful and deliberative thinking when using their foreign language: âYou need to make sure that what you say, and how you understand things, is correct.â And they apply the same attention to the monitoring of their memories, leading them to question the accuracy of their recollections rather than simply recounting the first thing that comes into their heads.</p><p>The foreign language effect may even stretch to elements of our personality. Silvia Purpuri at the University of Trento, Italy has examined âtolerance of ambiguityâ, which concerns peopleâs appreciation of uncertainty, and their willingness to enter unfamiliar situations. This can influence our behaviour in a changing workplace. âThose with high levels of tolerance of ambiguity display more flexibility and adaptability, leading to a more harmonious working environment and overall successful performance,â explains Purpuri. By allowing people to entertain new ideas, tolerance of ambiguity can improve peopleâs creative problem-solving. Recruiting Italian-English bilingual speakers, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/foreign-language-effect-on-tolerance-of-ambiguity/54A1ABB8E1A2609F155512821A4CC41E" data-link-name="in body link">Purpuri and her colleagues found</a> that people naturally score more highly on this trait when primed to use their second language.</p><p>In todayâs increasingly globalised world, many people regularly use two or more languages in their day-to-day lives, yet they may be completely unaware how that may influence their thinking. âPeople need to realise that if they choose to use one language over the other, that will have a systematic effect on the process and outcome of what they do,â says Keysar.</p><p>We still need much more research examining the limits of the foreign language effect and the cases where it may backfire. But in certain situations, it could be <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.549083/full" data-link-name="in body link">a useful tool</a> to <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/11/6/103" data-link-name="in body link">switch mindsets</a>, allowing us to be a little more detached, objective and flexible in our thinking. You could deliberately swap to your second language when investigating important investments, for instance, so that you can more rationally appraise the risks. Or, when facing a personal upset, you may find that describing the situation in your second language helps to <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.19.22283671v1" data-link-name="in body link">calm some of your fears or anxieties</a>. And if you are considering a controversial new environmental policy, you might try to read about it in a foreign newspaper: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-017-0005-9" data-link-name="in body link">the research suggests</a> that this may render you more open-minded to the facts at hand and less easily swayed by your immediate gut reaction.</p><p>For those who already speak another language, this may be an unexpected payoff for all your studies. For those who do not, such benefits may offer an extra incentive to pick up your old French textbooks, sign up for a night class in Spanish, or download Duolingo. Nabokovâs experience may have been exceptional, but we may all undergo a mini-metamorphosis as we immerse our minds in the words and idioms of another culture.</p><ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

							<!-- Title -->
							

							<!-- Content -->
							<p>Last week, Unity announced that they will soon start charging developers $0.20 each time their games are installed, past certain (high) thresholds. This came as a surprise to me and a few thousand other developers who chose Unity, invested in it, and paid for it in large part because they told us they wouldnât take any of our revenue.</p>
<p>The reaction has been huge, but itâs not clear yet if Unity will make it right. The hasty, vague, conflicting clarifications theyâve offered all seemed aimed at reassuring people âNo no, weâre not gonna steal much of <em>your</em> money, because you wonât be successful. Our plan is to steal <em>that</em> guyâs money.â</p>
<p>Thatâs not my issue, so I just wanna spell out exactly what my issue is.</p>
<h5>My issue</h5>
<p>We chose Unity for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/">Tactical Breach Wizards</a> over 5 years ago. The deal was, it costs $125 per month per programmer, but thatâs it â they take no share of your income when you release. Unreal, a rival engine, has no monthly fee but takes 5% of your revenue when you release. If Unity wanted any part of our revenue, whether percentage or per-install, we wouldnât have used it â I had more experience in Game Maker, which takes no rev share and has a lower sub cost.</p>
<p>So now weâve spent 5+ years investing in Unity on that understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of our coding and implementation work (about 70% of my job, and all of my programmerâs job) is in Unity, and could not be pasted into some other engine â it would need to be redone.</li>
<li>To be able to even do that productive work, I spent a ton of this time learning Unity.</li>
<li>Relatedly, I took around 3,824 points of psychic damage during this time from Unityâs bizarre, maddening quirks.</li>
<li>Iâve also paid Unity over $10,000 in subscription fees so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>And not for a slew of useful new features â we use Unity 2019.3. In the last 4 years, the only additional value Unity have provided us is bug fixes to that version. But thatâs OK! Iâm happy to pay a large fee up front to avoid having our income skimmed forever.</p>
<p>In case we were worried about how much we were investing, in 2019 Unity went out of their way to say, and cement in their Terms of Service, that <a href="https://blog.unity.com/community/updated-terms-of-service-and-commitment-to-being-an-open-platform">âWhen you obtain a version of Unity, and donât upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS.â</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos.png" alt="When you obtain a version of Unity, and donât upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS. In practice, that is only possible if you have access to bug fixes. For this reason, we now allow users to continue to use the TOS for the same major (year-based) version number, including Long Term Stable (LTS) builds that you are using in your project." width="933" height="373" srcset="https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos.png 933w, https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos-500x200.png 500w, https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos-178x71.png 178w, https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos-768x307.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px"></p>
<p>But, well, EULAâs say the darnedest things!</p>
<p>A year ago, they quietly removed that part of the TOS. I probably clicked agree on something since then. It wasnât on my radar that the most reputable indie engine might be silently laying the groundwork for a moustache-twirling betrayal next year.</p>
<p>The new per-install fee is not in the current terms Iâve agreed to, so you might think I have an out â just donât agree to the new ones! But Unity is a subscription, not a product I bought one time. I have to accept the new terms to continue paying for it, which we have to do to keep legally using Unity, which we have to do to finish our game â because by this point weâre trapped in their platform to the tune of 5 yearsâ work.</p>
<h5>The situation</h5>
<p>This is why I am not remotely mollified by reassurances that the&nbsp;<em>current</em> profit-skimming terms wonât sting&nbsp;<em>me in particular</em> too badly. Thatâs not the fuckinâ headline! The headline is that you (surprisingly) can and (staggeringly) will change how much of our revenue you wish to take at any time after weâve already committed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not just the size of the monthly fee, but the very conceptual structure of what <em>kind of debt</em> we owe you.</li>
<li>Not just to use future versions of your engine, with whatever features you think justify this sharp hike, but even for past versions you previously promised would be usable under the old terms forever.</li>
<li>And not just for games that are starting development now, or mid development â even for games that are <em>already released</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Youâre cool with punishing our trust and investment in your platform by using it as a trap to pressure us into terms we would never agree to if we had free choice.</p>
<p>So if I donât seem impressed that the current terms wonât brutalise my expected revenue, itâs cos it doesnât take a genius to flash forward to your next twist of the knife. Even after Breach Wizards is finished and released, apparently youâre able and willing to change the terms under which we used your engine, placing the fees and thresholds wherever you like to see what you can force out of us.</p>
<p>The only difference with a released game is our recourse: instead of having to abandon development of our game, weâd just have to abandon the game â never patch, never update. Which sucks for players almost as much as it sucks for devs.</p>
<h5>Maybe they wonât force worse terms on us later??</h5>
<p>Well, as far as trusting Unity not to do something scummy if they think they legally can: *waves vaguely at the whole situation*</p>
<p>But more specifically, forcing this new fee structure is a <em>desperate</em> move. They knew it would be roundly despised â their own staff told them so â and they did it anyway. The money was more important than their integrity or reputation. Under those terms, what wouldnât a corporation do? If taking 100% of our revenue would make them more money than it loses, is anyone confident they wouldnât do it? For some people, they already have: one dev calculated theyâd owe Unity 108% of the yearâs revenue under the current terms.</p>
<h5>But I heard itâs not retroactive?</h5>
<p>Unity are saying itâs ânot retroactiveâ in the sense that when they count how many installs you owe them money for, they wonât count installs that happened before Jan 2024.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;<em>is</em> retroactive in the sense that it doesnât matter how long ago your game released, or what version of Unity it was made in, if you still need to use Unity at all, you agree to pay Unity for each install of any of your Unity games, over the thresholds.</p>
<p>Again, the thresholds are high, and again, the thresholds are not the point. If this change is allowed to be retroactive in that sense, thereâs nothing to stop them making a â100% of your revenueâ TOS retroactive in that sense.</p>
<h5>But they have to do this, their game engine business isnât profitable!</h5>
<p>Ah, I didnât know that, perhaps because I donât give a fuck? Itâs not the customerâs job to make your business plan pay off. I didnât ask them to offer terms that donât work for them, I didnât ask them to hire 7,000 people, I never even made a feature request. They asked me to pay them $10,000 in sub fees on the promise that it meant no fee per-sale, then once I was in too deep to switch, they changed the deal.</p>
<h5>But game engines are hard to make and update, itâs not reasonable to expect them to be cheap</h5>
<p>I have no opinions about how much they should cost. My thing is, if you offer me Unity 2019 at $150 a month, itâs a scumbag move to wait til Iâm too far invested to switch, then change it to a per-install deal <em>even if I keep using the old version.</em> You can change the price, and even the nature of the cost, for any and all future versions, no probs! I get to not buy those. I canât not-buy Unity 2019 cos I already paid you $10k and spent over 5 years work on it, so you shouldnât be able to layer on a new type of debt I owe you.</p>
<p>Especially, I feel, if you promised not to.</p>

<b> Explanation: </b> 

On September 12, from a location just south of the Arctic Circle,
stones of Iceland's
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230327.html">modern Arctic Henge</a>
point skyward in this startling scene.

Entertaining an intrepid group of aurora hunters during a
<a href="https://spaceweather.com/">geomagnetic storm</a>,
alluring northern lights dance across the darkened sky
when a stunning
<a href="https://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/">fireball meteor</a>
explodes.

Awestruck, the camera-equipped skygazers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHHitRCagcE">captured video and still
images</a>
of the boreal bolide, at its peak about as bright as a full moon.

Though quickly fading from view, the fireball left a lingering
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2309/_DSC7281-1s_1024.jpg">visible trail</a>
or persistent train.

<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180817.html">The wraith-like trail</a> was seen for
minutes wafting in the upper atmosphere at altitudes
of 60 to 90 kilometers along with the
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/aurora">auroral glow</a>.

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org"><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>Current policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase adaptation and mitigation funding are insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5Â°C. It is clear that further action is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and achieve a just climate future. Here, we offer a new perspective on emissions responsibility and climate finance by conducting an environmentally extended input output analysis that links 30 years (1990â2019) of United States (U.S.) household-level income data to the emissions generated in creating that income. To do this we draw on over 2.8 billion inter-sectoral transfers from the Eora MRIO database to calculate both supplier- and producer-based GHG emissions intensities and connect these with detailed income and demographic data for over 5 million U.S. individuals in the IPUMS Current Population Survey. We find significant and growing emissions inequality that cuts across economic and racial lines. In 2019, fully 40% of total U.S. emissions were associated with income flows to the highest earning 10% of households. Among the highest earning 1% of households (whose income is linked to 15â17% of national emissions) investment holdings account for 38â43% of their emissions. Even when allowing for a considerable range of investment strategies, passive income accruing to this group is a major factor shaping the U.S. emissions distribution. Results suggest an alternative income or shareholder-based carbon tax, focused on investments, may have equity advantages over traditional consumer-facing cap-and-trade or carbon tax options and be a useful policy tool to encourage decarbonization while raising revenue for climate finance.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Anthropogenic climate change is an existential threat to all of humanity [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref001">1</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref002">2</a>]. Yet, extreme economic inequality, across and within societies, results in a powerful disconnect between those facing the worst climate impacts and those reaping the economic and consumption benefits that drive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref003">3</a>â<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref008">8</a>]. This disparity in harm and benefits has been a central tension at international climate negotiations, particularly when trying to allocate responsibility and financial compensation between developed and developing countries.</p>
<p>In recognition of such disparities, wealthy nations at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNCCCâCOP 15) agreed to mobilize $100 billion a year, by 2020, to fund mitigation and adaptation efforts in poorer developing nations. The creation of a âloss and damageâ fund at the recent UNCCC COP 27 marks an additional commitment to address disparities between those disproportionately driving emissions and those disproportionately experiencing the harms they cause. These efforts represent progress, yet there is also some reason for skepticism. Existing climate commitments will not keep global temperature rise within 1.5Â°C [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref009">9</a>], finance pledges fall about 5-10x short of the need [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref010">10</a>], and nations have consistently failed to meet these insufficient emissions and finance pledges [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref009">9</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref011">11</a>]. This has made the current moment pivotal to address an increasingly urgent climate crisis and suggests addition perspectives may be useful in motivating such efforts.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Emissions responsibility frameworks and prior work</h3>
<p>While existing climate agreements are based on national-level territorial emissions, alternative consumption-based and income-based frameworks have been proposed to account for trade related emissions transfers and to better align responsibility with the flow of benefits. At the national level, consumption-based emissions have been well studied over the last several decades [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref012">12</a>â<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref021">21</a>], while income-based emissions [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref022">22</a>â<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref029">29</a>] have received less attention. Because consumption and income ultimately flow to households, these alternative frameworks also allow emissions responsibility to be quantified sub-nationally at the household-level.</p>
<p>The United States (U.S.) provides an interesting case for consumption- and income-based analysis due to its significant emissions, high levels of consumption, and extreme economic inequality. Since the Industrial Revolution the U.S. has cumulatively emitted more GHGs and captured more wealth (GDP) than any other country. At the same time, the U.S. has significant economic inequality, with the top 10% of income earners capturing 46% of pre-tax national income, in 2021, and the top 1% alone capturing 19% [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref030">30</a>].</p>
<p>From a consumption-based standpoint, prior U.S. analyses have been conducted by Weber and Matthews [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref018">18</a>], Jones and Kammen [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref031">31</a>], Song et al. [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref017">17</a>], Sager [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref032">32</a>], Feng et al. [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref016">16</a>] and others. In a recent paper we fill in a gap in these studies by explicitly addressing the undersampling and underestimation of top 1% and top 0.1% householdsâ emissions in prior work [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref033">33</a>]. We find extreme and growing emissions disparities between very high-income households and the rest of U.S. society.</p>
<p>While emissions related to household <em>consumption</em> (consumer responsibility) have been well explored for the U.S. and many countriesâinforming climate equity debatesâvery little work [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref034">34</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref035">35</a>] has been done linking households to the emissions used in generating their <em>incomes</em> (income responsibility). This misses a critical connection between climate altering GHG emissions and those households reaping a tangible benefit from these emissionsâobscuring alternative policy solutions.</p>
<p>To date, the only research we are familiar with on income-based household GHG footprints are an initial U.S.-based analysis we conducted [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref034">34</a>] and recent work by Pottier and Le Truet [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref035">35</a>] that report wage-based footprints for households in France. Here we present results for an analysis that links GHG emissions to the full range of U.S. household incomes (wages, investments, retirement, etc.) over a 30 year period (1990â2019). In doing so, we offer a new perspective on emissions responsibility, fill in a key knowledge gap for a major GHG emitting nation, and highlight some alternative tax policies that could help close the climate finance gap [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref010">10</a>]âincluding post-COP 27 loss and damage funds.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Research approach</h3>
<p>To link U.S. households with the GHG emissions that enable their income we calculate global GHG emissions intensities (metric tons (t) CO<sub>2</sub>e per dollar) of income using a multi-region input-output (MRIO) model (see <a href="#sec016">Materials and Methods</a>) [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref036">36</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref037">37</a>]. We calculate emissions intensity using two distinct accounting approaches: direct <em>producer</em> emissions and <em>supplier</em> emissions. In the producer framework, each industryâs direct operational emissions (Scope 1) are allocated to households in proportion to the share of total income they receive from that industry. The supplier framework allocates emissions to households in the same proportional way, but each industryâs emissions are calculated as the sum of emissions occurring in all activities which directly and indirectly provide sales revenue to that industry in its role as a supplier. For example, in the producer framework households receiving wage or investment income from a power plant are responsible for the direct emissions it generates, while in the supplier framework households receiving wage or investment income from selling financial services or fossil fuel to that power plant are responsible for the plantâs emissions, proportional to their importance as a supplier. The producer approach allocates direct emissions from 429 U.S. industries, while the supplier approach includes the full downstream supply chain emissions of 9,812 industries across 190 countries (about 2.8 billion inter-sectoral transfers or around 96 million per year).</p>
<p>Industry-specific emissions intensities are linked with an individualâs wage income from that industry, using the nationally representative Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) harmonized Current Population Survey (CPS), which includes around 5.4 million individuals (~181,000 individuals annually) [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref038">38</a>]. Emissions for unearned income, such as investment and retirement (social security, IRA, 401(k), etc.) income, are also included and based on weighted national average multipliers that model a range of diversified investment portfolios. In total, emissions associated with 12 pre-tax income categories are included and aggregated by household (~65,000 annually). The post-tax analysis includes 35 income categories that capture social and government transfers and reduces the householdâs income responsibility by the amount of taxes paid (see Table E in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for a comprehensive list of income variables). To compare emissions responsibility across the income distribution, households are then binned into income groups including deciles 1â9, the <em>next 9%</em> (90â99.0th percentile), <em>top 1%</em> (99.0th - 100th percentile), <em>next 0</em>.<em>9%</em> (99.0thâ99.9th percentile), and <em>top 0</em>.<em>1%</em> (99.9th - 100th percentile) (see <a href="#sec016">Materials and Methods</a> for how we estimate top 1% households, which are under sampled in CPS and <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for additional methodological details).</p>
</div>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Results</h2><p>Below we present results for both supplier and producer frameworks. For brevity, Figures use the supplier framework and all Figures except <a href="#pclm-0000190-g001">Fig 1</a> present pre-tax income footprints. Producer-based Figures generally show similar results. They are included as Supporting information files and referenced in the corresponding Figure legends below. We mainly focus on pre-tax footprints since they provide a clear picture of the raw income-based emissions distribution. Post-tax results are mostly presented to show the impact of tax policy and social transfers on this distribution (see <a href="#pclm-0000190-t001">Table 1</a> and <em>Tax effects on emissions footprints</em> in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a>).</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Income sources and carbon intensity</h3>
<p>Across the income distribution, household income sources and GHG intensities are heterogeneous. Social transfers make up a significant share of lower income groupsâ post-tax footprint, wages dominate middle income groupsâ emissions, and wage and investment income are the key drivers of very high-income groupsâ emissions (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g001">Fig 1</a>). For average top 0.1% households, we find investment income drives &gt;50% of emissions.</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of incomes also varies across the income distribution (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g002">Fig 2</a>). In the supplier framework, the CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of wages tends to increase with income, though there is significant dispersion within groups. In the producer-based analysis, middle income households have the most CO<sub>2</sub>e intensive wages while low- and high-income households, employed in various service sectors, have less emission intensive incomes (see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s003">S2 Fig</a>). These differences result in some decoupling of national income and national emissions (NE) shares (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t001">Table 1</a>), for some income groups. For example, top 1% households have NE shares that are higher than their income share in the supplier framework and lower in the producer framework. While underlying income inequality is by far the most important factor shaping extreme inequality in emissions footprints, differences in income sources and GHG intensity (see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s004">S3</a> and <a href="#pclm.0000190.s005">S4</a> Figs) cause emissions heterogeneity at a given income level and a divergence between national income shares and emissions shares for some income groups.</p>

<div id="section2"><h3>Most recent year (2019)</h3>
<p>In 2019, we estimate U.S. household income-based emissions range from ~0 to over 8,000 t and follow a strong linear relationship (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.94) with an elasticity of 1.0 (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g003">Fig 3</a>). We find a highly unequal emissions distribution with Gini coefficients of 0.57 (producer) and 0.58 (supplier) (for Lorenz curves, see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s006">S5</a> and <a href="#pclm.0000190.s007">S6</a> Figs). It is worth noting that at a given income level differences in the GHG intensities of income sources result in emissions variability. For example, we estimate a pre-tax income around $1 million has emissions as low as ~200 t or as high as ~1,300 t depending on the type of profession or investments that are generating that income.</p>

<div id="section3"><h3>Super emitters</h3>
<p>We term households with emissions &gt;3,000 t CO<sub>2</sub>e per year as âsuper emittersâ. For pre-tax income, we estimate about 43,200 U.S. households or 34% of the top 0.1% households are super emitters with the supplier framework (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e005" loading="lazy"></span> = 4,317 t, <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e006" loading="lazy"></span> = 4,053). About 26,500 households, or 21% of top 0.1% households surpass this threshold with the producer framework (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e007" loading="lazy"></span> = 3,906 t, <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e008" loading="lazy"></span> = 3,583). Post-tax, the percent of <em>top 0</em>.<em>1%</em> households classified as super emitters drops to about 9% (supplier) and 3% (producer).</p>
<p>Almost all super emitting households come from the top 0.1% income group. They had average incomes of over $10.6 million (supplier) and $11.5 (producer) (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t002">Table 2</a>). Because GHG intensity varies widely across sectors, a household may surpass the 3,000 t threshold with either much lower or much higher income than the average, depending on the GHG intensity of their income source. While super emitting households can also be employed in any sector of the economy (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t002">Table 2</a>), they are markedly overrepresented in finance, real estate, and insurance; manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and services (other). Meanwhile, households earning income from accommodations and restaurants; education; retail and wholesale trade; and some other fields are underrepresented among super emitting households. Generally, both producer and supplier frameworks show the same directionality in terms of divergence from U.S. average employment by sector, but there is variability in the scale of this divergence.</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Relationship to racial inequality</h3>
<p>Black households had mean pre-tax footprints of 19 t CO<sub>2</sub>e (supplier and producer) (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e009" loading="lazy"></span> = 11 t in both), White Hispanic households had 26 t (supplier) and 25 t (producer) (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e010" loading="lazy"></span> = 16 t in both), and White non-Hispanic households had 40 t (supplier) and 36 t (producer) (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e011" loading="lazy"></span> = 22 t in both). The fact that White non-Hispanic household emissions were 1.4x - 2.1x higher than other groups partly reflect differences in the CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of employment across groups. For example, in the supplier footprint White non-Hispanic households had emissions intensity of wages 1.12x higher than Black households. More critical, however, is the extreme racial inequity of the underlying income distribution. In 2019, the <em>top 1%</em> of the income distribution was 76% White non-Hispanic, 8% Hispanic, and only 3% Black. Meanwhile, Black households make up a disproportionate share of bottom decile households. Post-tax the racial emissions gap closes somewhat, but White non-Hispanic households still have emissions 1.3â1.7x higher than other groups. An additional observation is that significant emissions inequality exists within each racial group. Comparing the median to the means, shows that the emissions distribution is right skewed, with most of the population having emissions far below the mean and a relatively small percent of the population having emissions much higher than the group mean.</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Emissions by age group</h3>
<p>In terms of age, average emissions tend to increase with age until peaking within the 45â54 years old head of household age group (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t003">Table 3</a>). After this point they tend to decline. This mirrors household incomes, which tend to increase as cohorts gain experience and seniority within the labor force, then decline as they enter early retirement and retirement age.</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Time series: (1990â2019)</h3>
<p>Looking across 30 years of data a few noteworthy trends emerge. First, <em>emissions intensities</em> consistently differ across income groups and have fallen (45â49%) over time (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g005">Fig 5</a>). Second, these falling emission intensities have resulted in <em>decreasing national average</em> household emissions, despite rising incomes (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g006">Fig 6</a>). Yet, this declining national average belies a divergence that has occurred between the bottom 99% of the income distribution and the top 1%. While the bottom 99% have seen rising incomes, their absolute emissions have fallen (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g007">Fig 7</a>) due to declining emissions intensities. For the top 1% however, income growth has outpaced falling emission intensities and resulted in flat or rising absolute emissions (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g007">Fig 7</a>). Finally, these trends have resulted in a large and increasing <em>share of national emissions</em> generating economic benefits for high income households (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g008">Fig 8</a>).</p>
<p>Put together, these trends reveal an interesting emissions story: despite falling emissions intensities, declining national average emissions and rising incomes for all groups, unequal income growth has created significant and increasing emissions inequality between extremely high-income households and the rest of U.S. society. This has moved the income-based national emissions Gini coefficient from 0.51 (producer and supplier) in 1990 to 0.57 (producer) and 0.58 (supplier) in 2019.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Discussion</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Limitations and sources of uncertainty</h3>
<p>Our study is limited in scope, makes certain assumptions about unearned income that are important for top 1% households, and relies on survey and emissions databases that can introduce errors. First, this study focuses on linking emissions with <em>income</em>. Household <em>wealth</em> is only considered insofar as it generates realized income as capital gains or dividends. Because wealth is even more unequally distributed than income, a wealth-based emissions analysis would very likely show greater emissions inequality than our results.</p>
<p>In estimating the emissions intensity of <em>unearned income</em>, it is not feasible to estimate itemized sources of investment income per household. Instead, we assume that households have a diversified passive investment portfolio generating unearned <em>investment income</em> equal to the weighted mean GHG intensity of the U.S. economy. When creating the synthetic dataset for top 1% households, where investments are a key source of income, we allow the GHG intensity of individual householdâs investment income to vary up to Â±25% from the mean. This creates a distribution of households whose average equals the mean but whose individual portfolios can be overweighted to either more or less GHG intensive industries than the national average. While some households may be outside these bounds, we assume extremely overweight portfolios in either GHG intensive or non-intensive industries are somewhat rare, tend to balance out and in aggregate do not meaningfully affect the overall group mean. This study assumes that on average, investments are passively managed, though further study of how investors can actively influence the carbon intensity of their investments is an interesting topic for future work.</p>
<p>The emissions per industry for <em>wage income</em> are taken from the Eora MRIO (see <a href="#sec016">Materials and Methods</a>). In Eora, import and export data reported across countries may not exactly align and balancing used in Eora to resolve these discrepancies may lead to minor estimation error, though the affect is minimal on large economies like the U.S. In all MRIO models emissions data are taken from IPCC-style inventories which itemize emissions by activity rather than by economic sector. Reallocating from activity-based inventories to sector-based inventories introduces error that could affect the accuracy of estimated emissions per wage income sector. Additionally, converting from symmetrical and non-symmetrical Supply-Use (SUT), Industry-Industry (II), and Commodity-Commodity (CC) tables, in the original Eora, to a symmetrical II intermediate transaction matrix involves the Fixed Product Sales Structure Assumption [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref039">39</a>] and again moves away from the original national data reports. While some error is inherent, for a large economy with robust GHG reporting the effect on the final income group GHG estimates is limited.</p>
<p>All surveys, including the IPUMS CPS we use for household income are sensitive to sampling and non-sampling error. Most important to our study, top 1% households are under sampled in CPS (See <em>Undersampling and underestimating top 1% incomes in CPS</em> and Table A in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a>). To address this, we use income data from the World Inequality Database (WID) [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref030">30</a>] and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates on capital income shares to estimate incomes for these missing households (see <a href="#sec016">Materials and Methods</a>). Linking household incomes with Eora GHG intensities also requires the use of a concordance matrix. This reduces the number of U.S. industries from 429 to 246 and can impact an individual householdâs emission estimate if their employer has a much higher or lower emissions intensity than the sector average. Yet, it seems reasonable that over- or under-estimates for individual household emissions intensity tend to balance out at the income group level.</p>
<p>While some degree of measurement error is unavoidably present in any estimate of carbon intensity, ultimately income-based footprints are the direct result of the total income dollars received and the carbon intensity of those dollars. As the U.S. is a large economy with fairly accurate income and emissions data collection, we consider error in overall estimates for these variables is likely small. Considering the limited heterogeneity of emissions intensity across income groups and between capital and wage income, any error in group-level CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity is also fairly limited. Nevertheless, to quantify the impact from a quite high level of error, we ran our model with carbon intensity Â±20% from the baseline analysis. We then bootstrapped the results for each income group and extract lower 95% bounds from the -20% analysis and upper 95% bounds from the +20% error estimates (gray error bars in <a href="#pclm-0000190-g004">Fig 4</a>). In practice this yields lower and upper bounds Â±21â24% from the baseline group means. While the Â±20% choice is arbitrary and we believe far higher than the actual error, given that the underlying error is unknown, it was chosen as a reasonable starting point. Results show that even when a high degree of error is tested, the absolute emissions and NE share from next 0.9% and top 1% households remains quite high and distinct from the lowest earning 99% of households. (See the <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for additional discussion on uncertainty).</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Income and emissions inequality</h3>
<p>Across all accounting methods, those at the very top of the income distribution are responsible for striking absolute t CO<sub>2</sub>e and disproportionate shares of national emissions. Disparities between these top income groups and the rest of society have also been growing over time. Between 1990 and 2019, Deciles 1â9 all saw declining absolute emissions and NE shares. For the bottom 5 deciles absolute emissions fell an average of 51% (producer) and 38% (supplier), while their NE shares showed average declines of 20% (producer) and 17% (supplier). For top 1% households, trends moved in the opposite direction. The next 0.9% and top 0.1% groups saw their NE shares respectively rise 46% and 82% (producer) and 43% and 83% (supplier). By 2019, the top 1% alone (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e012" loading="lazy"></span> = 475 t (producer), <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e013" loading="lazy"></span> = 595 t (supplier)) were responsible for more emissions (15â17% NE) than the poorest 50% of U.S. households put together (14% NE). Average top 0.1% households (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e014" loading="lazy"></span> = 2,110 t (producer), <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e015" loading="lazy"></span> = 2,670 t (supplier)) have emissions 1,650â1,700x higher than an average bottom decile household (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e016" loading="lazy"></span> = 1.3 t (producer), <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e017" loading="lazy"></span> = 1.6 t CO<sub>2</sub>e (supplier)). This divergence between top 1% households and the rest of society has been driven by rising income inequality (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g006">Fig 6</a>) and has occurred despite the falling GHG <em>intensity</em> of incomes (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g005">Fig 5</a> and <a href="#pclm.0000190.s010">S9 Fig</a>).</p>
<p>Income-based emissions responsibility closely correlates with income inequality. We find that in 2019 the poorest 50% of the U.S. population captured just 15% of pre-tax national income and was responsible for 14% of pre-tax NE in both frameworks (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t001">Table 1</a>). The top 10%, <em>top 1%</em>, and <em>top 0</em>.<em>1%</em> captured about 41%, 16%, and 7% of national income. We find they have fairly comparable NE shares of 43%, 17%, and 8% for pre-tax supplier and 40%, 15%, and 7% for pre-tax producer. While limited, the differences between income shares and emission shares are due to variations in GHG-intensity across income sources, income groups, and accounting methods. An interesting recent study by Pottier and Le Treut analyzing wage-based emissions in French households finds the emissions distribution is more unequal than the wage distribution [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref035">35</a>]. Here they find large variability in the carbon intensity of wages is driving this difference. They also find an interesting gender gap in emissions, with men tending to earn wages from more carbon intensive activities than women.</p>
<p>While income-based emissions accounting is distinct from consumption-based accounting, it is worth noting that an income-based approach estimates greater inequality. For example, in a related consumption-based study that we conducted, we estimate the top 10%, top 1%, and top 0.1% of U.S. households are responsible for a much lower 24%, 6%, and 2.3% of national emissions [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref033">33</a>]. The discrepancy is due to large savings rates among high-income households (which reduces consumption) and significant heterogeneity in GHG intensity across income groups, with low-income households purchasing more GHG intensive goods. In France, Pottier and Le Truet find this same trend of income-based emissions being more unequal than consumption-based emissions [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref035">35</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref040">40</a>].</p>
<p>We find that because income-based emissions are the result of both income and the GHG intensity of that income (which varies across industries and producer and supplier accounting principles (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t002">Table 2</a>)), households at the same income level can have very different emissions levels. For example, in the producer framework a household earning $980,000 from the petroleum refining industry would be a super emitter (&gt;3,000 t), while the same amount of emissions would require $11 million in income from the hospital industry. In the supplier framework, becoming a super emitting household would take at least $18 million in hospital income, but only $2.7 million in income from the coal industry. Households may also have very different GHG intensities from different income sources. This is particularly true for high income households that have a significant share of income flowing from investments. For example, one might earn wages from a low GHG intensive sector like education but have above average GHG intensity of investment income from a portfolio that is overweight on fossil fuel companies.</p>
<p>In terms of how age relates to emissions, prior consumption-based work by Zheng et al. has shown that seniors (age 60+) in the U.S. had the highest per capita footprint (20 t) of any age group [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref041">41</a>]. With our income-based analysis we find the highest household emissions are among the 45â54 years old peak earning group. If our analysis was wealth-based however, rather than income-based, it would likely agree with the findings from Zheng et al. that seniors have the largest emissions footprints. This is because, while incomes tend to decline for cohorts above age 54, household net worth continues rising and peaks within the 65â74 years old cohort [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref042">42</a>]. Even the 75 and above group has a higher net worth than the 45â54 peak income group.</p>
<p>While different in methodology, an interesting study by Lucas Chancel looking at global income groupsâ consumption and investment found that for the global top 1%, emissions related to investments account for a much greater share of their emissions responsibly (70%) than their consumption (30%) [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref043">43</a>]. Finally, it is worth noting that household income is shaped by a variety of demographic factors. While we report on emissions disparity by race, ethnicity, and age, we are principally focused on quantifying the emissions distribution in relation to the income distribution as it exists and do not investigate in great detail how demographic factors influence the income distribution.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Policy implications</h3>
<p>Carbon pricing, either through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, are seen by economists as an essential and cost-effective way to help decarbonize the US economy [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref044">44</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref045">45</a>]. Prior work has suggested this tax would need to be &gt;$200 per t CO<sub>2</sub>e, to achieve even a 5% reduction in oil consumption, and estimates that 70â80% of this cost would be initially passed onto consumers [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref045">45</a>]. Another paper we have published looking at consumption-based U.S. emissions suggests that a tax this high would present a significant burden to low-income families, even though they have comparatively small GHG footprints [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref033">33</a>]. Meanwhile the tax may not be sufficient to shift behavior of high-income households, who have significant consumption-based emissions, but adequate savings rates to absorb the tax. While a carbon tax-funded dividend has been proposed to reduce financial strain on low income households [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref046">46</a>], consumer-facing carbon taxes have not found sufficient political support, despite two decades of development.</p>
<p>The fact that income-based footprints are more inequitable than consumption-based footprints [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref016">16</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref017">17</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref035">35</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref047">47</a>â<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref049">49</a>] suggests an alternative income-based approach to carbon pricing schemes, applied to wage earners or investors, could have equity and political advantages over consumer-facing carbon taxes. Such a tax could be calculated based on direct emissions (producer), on the supply of fossil fuels into the economy (supplier), or some split between the two. Tax revenue could be used for climate mitigation or adaptation projects either within the U.S. or to meet and increase international climate finance pledges including loss and damage funding agreed to at COP 27.</p>
<p>While either wage or investment income could be the focus of such a tax, a wage-based tax has some drawbacks. Just like low-income consumers, low-income wage earners would have the least ability to absorb a tax. To address this, a carbon income tax could be applied progressively, to shield low-income workers. Yet the effectiveness of such a tax to shift the economy to lower GHG emissions may be insubstantial as workers generally have limited agency in shifting their industryâs emissions behavior. While a tax may generate revenue that could be invested in decarbonization or climate finance, it may be politically unpopular to create a wage-based carbon tax that would impact a wide swath of the public.</p>
<p>Because unearned investment income and asset ownership are heavily concentrated at the top of the income distribution, limiting a carbon tax to either of these items could further focus it on those reaping the most economic benefit from GHG emissions, increase public support, and reduce GHG-intensive economic activity in a more direct way. A consideration here is that while there is some overlap of households in the top 1% or 0.1% of <em>income earners</em> and the top 1% or 0.1% of <em>wealth holders</em> there is far more annual churn among the top income group [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref050">50</a>]. Here, households may see huge profits one year from the sale of a business or stocks, but far less income in subsequent years. In this way, an asset-based shareholder carbon tax may be more desirable than an unearned income tax because it would set a more stable annual tax rate and keep the focus on those with the most economic power. It would also be more equitable in that it accounts for the historical emissions embodied in unrealized capital gains, rather than focusing solely on present day emissions that generate unearned income. Furthermore, it concentrates behavior change incentives on the executives and large shareholders who have the most agency and power to reduce their industriesâ emissions activities.</p>
<p>At the extreme end of the income distribution, an interesting 2022 study by Oxfam International on 125 global billionaires with assets in excess of $2 trillion, estimates emissions related to their investments were over 3 million t per person annually [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref051">51</a>]. If these individuals were incentivized to reduce the GHG intensity of their industries or shift their investments to other industries, in response to a tax, it could meaningfully impact emissions. Indeed, they estimate the overall carbon intensity of billionairesâ emissions, in their study, could be reduced fourfold if investments were shifted to funds with stronger environmental and social standards [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref051">51</a>]. Work by Lucas Chancel suggests that a progressive carbon tax tied to the carbon intensity of investments could be helpful to accelerate decarbonization, while having limited impact on most households [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref043">43</a>]. Further work by Chancel, Bothe, and Voituriez [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref052">52</a>] estimate a progressive global wealth tax starting at 1.5% for individuals with net worthâs &gt;$100 million (~65,000 individuals or &lt;0.001% of the global population) and going as high as 3% for individuals with assets above $100 billion could raise $300 billion annually for decarbonization, loss and damage, or other climate funding. Even if just the U.S. and European countries adopted such as tax, Chancel and colleagues estimate $175 billion could be raised annually. As they note, because wealth tends to grow 7â9% annually for extremely wealthy individuals, their overall fortunes would still increase, even in the face of these progressive climate-focused taxes [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref052">52</a>]. Kapeller, Leitch, and Wildauer also find that a progressive European wealth tax has the potential to raise enough revenue to close the European Unionâs (E.U.) several hundred billion dollar per year green investment gap [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref053">53</a>]. If revenue from capital taxes is reinvested in public infrastructure, such as decarbonization efforts, it can also benefit wealthy countries by increasing social welfare, while reducing extreme economic inequality [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref054">54</a>].</p>
<p>While it would increase the complexity of tax administration, basing such a tax on Scope 1 (or full supply chain Scope 1â3) emissions, rather than a tax based solely on net worth, would keep the tax close to the source of the emissions and encourage divestment from high emitting (highly-taxed) industries. In the U.S., new climate disclosure rules proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2022, which require Scope 1 and 2 reporting (and Scope 3 for companies with Scope 3 emissions targets) would provide company-specific emissions data that could be used for calculating an appropriate tax rate for investments in that company. In Europe, similar data will become available as the E.U.âs Corporate Sustainability Reporting directive, that came into effect in 2023, requires Scope 3 emissions reporting for E.U. based companies. At the asset manager level, interesting recent work by Zengkai Zhang and colleagues has highlighted the carbon emissions in firmsâ portfolios in China [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref055">55</a>] and emissions associated with investments for multinational enterprises [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref056">56</a>].</p>
<p>Finally, while it is impractical to assume large numbers of high-income households could or would easily switch to lower GHG intensive professions, it seems reasonable that in their role as investors high-income households and their asset managers can nimbly shift to lower GHG intensive investments if the market rewards such moves. Linking the shareholder tax rate to the GHG intensity of the industry would also spur fiduciary fund managers to divest from GHG intensive industries in search of higher returns elsewhere. From an industry perspective, such a tax may also encourage firms to decarbonize their operations in order to attract investors with the promise of higher returns, via relatively lower taxes on ownership of the companyâs shares. It could also encourage executives, who have seen ballooning compensation over the last several decades [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref057">57</a>] to decarbonize their operations and supply chains to reduce taxes on the income and shares they receive. If high income households did shift their investments in response to such a tax, we would see further decoupling of the national income shares and national emission shares (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t001">Table 1</a>) among high income households.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To avoid the worst impacts of climate change it is imperative that global temperature rise is limited to 1.5Â°C [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref007">7</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref058">58</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref059">59</a>]. Yet, the window to achieve this goal is rapidly shrinking. By 2030, even if the existing Paris Agreement National Determined Contributions are achieved, global emissions are still projected to overshoot the 1.5Â°C pathway by at least 60% [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref009">9</a>]. At the same time, climate finance falls well short of what is needed to mitigate and adapt to a warming world. Recent work by Andrew Fanning and Jason Hickel has shown that if nations were each allocated an equality-based fair share of emissions, by 2050 wealthy countries in the global North would owe $192 trillion (or about $6.2 trillion per year) to poorer countries in the global South to compensate for their atmospheric over-appropriations [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref060">60</a>]. To date, climate finance flows to developing nations have struggled to reach the $100 billion a year goal set over a decade ago. It is clear that the economy needs to decarbonize faster than its current trajectory and that more money is needed to both fund this transition and equitably adapt societies to a warming world.</p>
<p>By linking GHG emissions with the incomes it enables our work has quantified the scale of emissions inequality in U.S. society and the extreme and growing concentration of emissions among very wealthy households. It also offers some suggestions on how accelerated decarbonization and revenue generation might occur, such as an income or shareholder-based carbon tax that reflects the GHG intensity of oneâs income sources or financial assets. This is distinct from consumer facing carbon taxes that rely on individuals decarbonizing the economy by shifting their consumption to less GHG intensive goods and services and thereby encouraging companies to respond to their new preferences. A consumer-facing approach assumes individual consumers have the knowledge, financial resources, and agency to shift spending and the power to alter corporate decision making on the GHG intensity of their supply chain and operations. An alternative income or shareholder facing carbon tax puts pressure on executives and large shareholders (i.e. those with the most economic and corporate power) to act in their own self-interest and decarbonize their supply chain and operations in order to reduce taxes on their compensation and investments. Recent work has calculated that a climate inspired wealth tax could indeed be an effective tool to raise revenue for adaptation and mitigation efforts [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref052">52</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref053">53</a>].</p>
<p>By thinking of carbon as an outcome of income generation rather than just an outcome of consumption, such alternative policy solutions become possible. While consumer-facing carbon taxes have struggled to move from proposal to law in the U.S. an investment-based carbon tax may be more equitable, politically palatable, and equally justifiable. Of course, any such proposals would likely face significant pushback from the economically advantaged households who dominate policymaking [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref061">61</a>]. Finally, given the urgent nature of the climate crisis and the shrinking window in which limiting warming to 1.5Â°C is possible, policymakers may be wise to consider adopting multiple approaches (both consumer and income or investor facing carbon taxes) that can simultaneously put pressure on different actors to equitably decarbonize the economy and fund a just transition to a still warming world. We suggest further work quantifying the potential effects of such proposals is warranted.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section5"><h2>Materials and methods</h2><p>For both the producer- and supplier-income approach we link income to GHG emissions using survey data on individual-level income (see Table E in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for income categories) and an Environmentally-Extended Multi-Region Input-Output Model (EE-MRIO). For earned income, the GHG intensity per dollar of wages, for each industry, is calculated and multiplied by an individualâs income from that industry. The GHG intensities of unearned investment income, retirement, and employer contributions to healthcare are also included (12 categories in total) in the pre-tax analysis. In post-tax footprints, emissions responsibilities are increased by 23 categories of social transfers and reduced by the amount of taxes paid. Individuals are aggregated into households and households are ranked into percentiles and deciles, for income group comparisons.</p>
<p>To calculate the CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of income, we use the Eora MRIO database [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref036">36</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref037">37</a>] covering 14,839 sectors, 190 countries, and 1,140 final demand and value-added categories. For each of the 30 years, EORA is converted from a 14,839 x 14,839 heterogeneous classification system to a square 9,812 x 9,812 industry by industry input-output table, using the Fixed Product Sales Structure assumption [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref039">39</a>]. Current year dollars are adjusted to constant 2020 US$. GHG emissions data come from the PRIMAPHIST database (Version 2.3âavailable in Eora) [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref062">62</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref063">63</a>]. This includes the six Kyoto GHGs and excludes land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF).</p>
<p>In a producer-income approach the CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of each industryâs direct emissions are calculated by proportionally allocating emissions to each value added category and calculating the GHG intensity per dollar of various income types. In the supplier income emissions framework, we calculate the enabled emissions, in t CO<sub>2</sub>e per dollar, using the Ghosh inverse (see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a>). This captures all <em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em> CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions, along the whole downstream global supply chain (~96 million inter-sectoral transfers each year) that were enabled to produce a dollar of value added.</p>
<p>For each year, these supply chain and direct emissions factors are matched with individual-level IPUMS CPS income data. IPUMS CPS is a harmonized dataset drawn from the Census Bureauâs Current Population Survey [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref038">38</a>]. It includes approximately 65,000 U.S. households and about 181,000 individuals per year. From CPS, we extract 58 variables related to income, healthcare, social benefits, industry from which wages are earned, and individual or household characteristics. Each year yields approximately 10,500,000 data points, totaling about 315,000,000 data points across the 30-year period. Individual-level emissions and income matching is done by applying a concordance matrix to convert emissions factors from the 429 U.S. industries in Eora to the 246 U.S. industries reported by CPS, using International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) system coding (For more details see <em>Converting Eora industries into CPS industries</em> in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> and <a href="#pclm.0000190.s024">S12 Data</a>). Individual-level wage data in CPS includes both the amount (in dollars) and the industry from which income is earned (IND90LY). Individual-level wage data are then multiplied by the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity for that industry. The income value of employer healthcare contributions is added, based on the employing industryâs CO<sub>2</sub>e multiplier. This is included for all years except 1990â1992 and 2019, where data is not reported in CPS.</p>
<p>The GHG responsibility of social security, retirement, capital gains, interest and dividends, and social benefits are also accounted for using weighted average income-based emissions intensities of the U.S. economy. These national average intensities are calculated to reflect each industryâs share of emissions from the relevant value added category/ies (see <em>Converting Eora industries into CPS industries</em> and <em>Calculating CO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>e intensities of income sources from value added</em> in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a>). For example, because Social Security comes out of employee compensation, an industry specific weight is calculated based on each industryâs share of total employee compensation. Each industryâs weight is then multiplied by its CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity. All the weighted CO<sub>2</sub>e intensities are then summed into the weighted national average CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity per dollar Social Security. Interests and dividends multipliers are calculated the same way but based on each industryâs share of Net Operating Surplus. Social benefits are also calculated in this way but based on each industryâs share out of all value added categories. In practice, the difference between these three different national average CO<sub>2</sub>e intensities is generally quite small (a few percentage points).</p>
<p>For each individual in CPS, income dollars from wages, investments, retirement, and employer healthcare contributions are multiplied by the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of that income source. Individuals are then merged into their respective households and t CO<sub>2</sub>e are summed. This yields the pre-tax emissions footprint of each household. Households are then binned into income groups.</p>
<p>To calculate the post-tax and transfer footprint, the value of social transfers such as monetary gifts and publicly provided benefits such as veterans benefits, unemployment, home heating, rental, and educational assistance are multiplied by the social benefit CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity. Tons CO<sub>2</sub>e are summed and added to the pre-tax footprint. Finally, post-tax footprints are reduced by subtracting emissions equivalent to the percentage of taxes paid. For example, a household with a 20% tax rate would have its t CO<sub>2</sub>e pre-tax plus benefits footprint reduced by 20%.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Top 1% households</h3>
<p>While CPS is the most authoritative source on U.S. household income, top 1% households are under sampled, average incomes are underestimated (see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a>), and top-coding affects some income categories. To address this, we create an over-sampled synthetic dataset for the next 0.9% and top 0.1% households and estimate their income, income sources, and CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity. This is done by creating a distribution of 1,000 households, for each group, whose mean pre-tax income and upper and lower thresholds come from WID and whose distributions is right-skewed to reflect within-group income inequality (see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for detailed methodology).</p>
<p>We then extract the IPUMS CPS households that meet the WID top 1% threshold and bootstrap these into two 1,000 row datasets that are matched with the next 0.9% and top 0.1% WID synthetic income distributions. In this merged synthetic distribution, total household income from WID is then distributed to wage, investment, retirement, and employer healthcare income categories, based on values from the bootstrapped CPS households. Income related to retirement and employer healthcare, which makes up an exceedingly small share of total income (and emissions) for <em>top 1%</em> households, are directly extracted from the CPS households and subtracted from the householdâs total income.</p>
<p>The remaining income is divided among wages and investment income. Due to limited reporting on capital gains and investment income in CPS we do not directly apply the raw income share allocation from the CPS bootstrapped households. Instead, we use CBO estimates on the share of capital income versus wage income for next 0.9% and top 0.1% households [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref064">64</a>]. To do this we use CBO values for each groupâs mean capital income share and create a normal distribution (<em>s</em> = 15%) of capital share values around this mean. In so doing we simulate variations in household income streams for each group. For each household, this wage and capital share (which sum to 100) are multiplied by the remaining household total income dollars. This yields dollars per wage and investment income category (see <em>Investment CO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>e intensity</em> and <em>Investments and capital gains</em> in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for more details on the investment income approach).</p>
<p>Each income category total dollars are then multiplied by the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>e intensities for that category. These intensities come from the bootstrapped dataset but are allowed to randomly vary up Â±25% from the original value. This is done to reflect the natural variation in GHG intensity that exists between top 1% households due to differences in employment and investment choices. Summing all categories yields pre-tax income based GHG footprints for the next 0.9% and top 0.1% groups. Post-tax footprints are calculated by adding the emissions value of social benefits (which are exceeding small as a portion of total income for these groups) and reducing these footprints in proportion to the householdâs tax rate.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post">
  
  <p>
    New York, NY â September 08, 2023
  </p>
  <p>At WWDC earlier this year, Apple announced that upcoming versions of iOS and macOS would ship with a new feature powered by â<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/ios-17-makes-iphone-more-personal-and-intuitive/">a Transformer language model</a>â that will give users âpredictive text recommendations inline as they type.â</p>

<p>Upon hearing this announcement, I was pretty curious about how this feature works.
Apple hasnât deployed many language models of their own, despite most of their competitors going all-in on large language models over the last couple years.
I see this as a result of Apple generally priding themselves on polish and perfection, while language models are fairly unpolished and imperfect.</p>

<p>As a result, this may be one of the first Transformer-based models that Apple will ship in one of its operating systems, or at least one of the first that theyâve acknowledged publicly.
This left me with some questions about the feature, notably:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What underlying model is powering this feature?</li>
  <li>What is its architecture?</li>
  <li>What data was used to train the model?</li>
</ul>

<p>After spending some time with these questions, I was able to find some answers, but many of the details still remain unclear.
If youâre able to get any further than I could, please get in touch!</p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-feature-work">How does the feature work?</h2>

<p>After installing the macOS beta, I immediately opened the Notes app and started typing.
Despite trying many different sentence structures, the feature generally appeared less often than I expected it to.
It mostly completes individual words.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/predictive-text/individual-word-2.png">
<figcaption>Predictive text completing one word at a time.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The feature will occasionally suggest more than one word at a time, but this is generally limited to instances where the upcoming words are extremely obvious, similar to the autocomplete in Gmail.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/predictive-text/multiple-words.jpeg">
<figcaption>Predictive text completing two words at a time.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="can-we-dig-deeper">Can we dig deeper?</h2>

<p>Finding the model itself was a little tough, but I eventually found the model being used by <code>AppleSpell</code>, an internal macOS application that checks for spelling and grammar mistakes as you type.
With the help of <a href="https://github.com/hot3eed/xpcspy"><code>xpcspy</code></a>, I wrote a Python script that snoops on <code>AppleSpell</code> activity and streams the most probable suggestions from the predictive text model as you type in any application.</p>

<figure>
<video controls="" src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/predictive-text/script-demo.mov" type="video/mov"></video>
<figcaption>My âpredictive spyâ script in action.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unfortunately, I wrote this script earlier in the summer, on the first macOS Sonoma beta.
In one of the subsequent betas (Iâm not sure which), Apple removed the unused completions from the XPC messages sent by AppleSpell.
I wasnât able to glean too much about the modelâs behavior from these completions, but it was still a cool find.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-the-model">Where is the model?</h2>

<p>After some more digging, Iâm pretty sure I found the predictive text model in <code>/System/Library/LinguisticData/RequiredAssets_en.bundle/AssetData/en.lm/unilm.bundle</code>.
The bundle contains multiple Espresso model files that are used while typing (Espresso <a href="https://machinethink.net/blog/peek-inside-coreml/">appears to be</a> the internal name for the part of CoreML that runs inference on models).
I wasnât ultimately able to reverse-engineer the model, but Iâm fairly confident this is where the predictive text model is kept.
Hereâs why:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many of the files in <code>unilm.bundle</code> donât exist on macOS Ventura (13.5), but they do exist on the macOS Sonoma beta (14.0). And the files that do exist in both versions have all been updated in Sonoma.</li>
  <li><code>sp.dat</code>, one of the files in <code>unilm.bundle</code>, exists on Ventura, but itâs been updated in the Sonoma beta. In the updated version of the file, I found what looks pretty clearly like a set of tokens for a tokenizer.</li>
  <li>The number of tokens in <code>sp.dat</code> matches the shape of the output layer in both <code>unilm_joint_cpu.espresso.shape</code> and <code>unilm_joint_ane.espresso.shape</code> (ANE = Apple Neural Engine), two files in <code>unilm.bundle</code> that describe the shapes of layers in an Espresso/CoreML model. This is what we would expect to see for a model that is trained to predict the next token.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-predictive-text-models-tokenizer">The predictive text modelâs tokenizer</h2>

<p>I found a set of 15,000 tokens in <code>unilm.bundle/sp.dat</code> that pretty clearly look like they form the vocabulary set for a large language model.
I wrote a script that you can use to see this vocabulary file for yourself, which you can check out <a href="https://github.com/jackcook/predictive-spy">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The vocabulary starts with <code>&lt;pad&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;/s&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;unk&gt;</code> tokens, which are all fairly common special tokens (<code>roberta-base</code> and <code>t5-base</code> are two popular language models):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import AutoTokenizer</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-base")</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens([0, 1, 2, 3])</code>
<code>['&lt;s&gt;', '&lt;pad&gt;', '&lt;/s&gt;', '&lt;unk&gt;']</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-base")</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens([0, 1, 2])</code>
<code>['&lt;pad&gt;', '&lt;/s&gt;', '&lt;unk&gt;']</code>
</pre>

<p>Next come the following sequences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 special tokens, named <code>UniLMCTRL0</code> through <code>UniLMCTRL19</code></li>
  <li>79 contractions (Iâd, couldnât, youâveâ¦)</li>
  <li>1 special <code>_U_CAP_</code> token</li>
  <li>20 special tokens, named <code>_U_PRE0_</code> through <code>_U_PRE19_</code></li>
  <li>60 special tokens, named <code>_U_NT00_</code> through <code>_U_NT59_</code></li>
  <li>100 emojis</li>
</ul>

<p>And then comes a more normal-looking list of 14,716 tokens, most of which are followed by the special character â (U+9601), which is commonly used in byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, such as the GPT-2 tokenizer, to denote a space.</p>

<p>I have to say that this vocabulary file strikes me as pretty unique, but itâs definitely not out of the question for a language model deployed in this setting.
Iâve personally never seen emojis featured so prominently in a language modelâs tokenizer, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15779">existing</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564">research</a> has shown that domain-specific models and tokenizers can drastically improve downstream model performance.
So it makes sense that a model trained for use in things like text messages, in which emojis and contractions will be used a lot, would prioritize them.</p>

<h2 id="model-architecture">Model architecture</h2>

<p>Based on the contents of the <code>unilm_joint_cpu</code> model from earlier, we can make some assumptions about the predictive text network.
Despite sharing the name of Microsoftâs <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/unified-language-model-pre-training-for-natural-language-understanding-and-generation/">UniLM</a> from 2019, it looks more to me like a model based on <a href="https://openai.com/research/better-language-models">GPT-2</a>.</p>

<p>GPT-2 has four main parts: token embeddings, positional encodings, a series of 12-48 decoder blocks, and an output layer.
The network described by <code>unilm_joint_cpu</code> appears to be the same, except with only 6 decoder blocks.
Most of the layers within each decoder block have names like <code>gpt2_transformer_layer_3d</code>, which would also seem to suggest itâs based on a GPT-2 architecture.</p>

<p>From my calculations based on sizes of each layer, Appleâs predictive text model appears to have about 34 million parameters, and it has a hidden size of 512 units.
This makes it much smaller than even the smallest version of GPT-2.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <th>Decoder Blocks</th>
      <th>Parameters</th>
      <th>Hidden Size</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Appleâs predictive text model</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>34M</td>
      <td>512</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gpt2</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>117M</td>
      <td>768</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gpt2-medium</td>
      <td>24</td>
      <td>345M</td>
      <td>1024</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gpt2-large</td>
      <td>36</td>
      <td>762M</td>
      <td>1280</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gpt2-xl</td>
      <td>48</td>
      <td>1542M</td>
      <td>1600</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For the limited scope of the predictive text feature, this makes sense to me.
Apple wants a model that can run very quickly and very frequently, without draining much of your deviceâs battery.
When I was testing the predictive text feature, suggestions appeared almost instantly as I typed, making for a great user experience.
While the modelâs limited size means it wouldnât be very good at writing full sentences or paragraphs, when it exhibits very high confidence in the next word or two, theyâre likely to be good enough to suggest to the user.</p>

<p>However, with my script that snoops on activity from <code>AppleSpell</code>, we can get the model to write full sentences anyway.
If I type âTodayâ as the first word of my sentence and take the modelâs top suggestion each time, hereâs what I get (<a href="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/predictive-text/longer-demo.mov">video</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today is the day of the day and the day of the week is going to be a good thing I have to do is get a new one for the next couple weeks and I think I have a lot ofâ¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not very inspiring.
We can compare this with the output from the smallest GPT-2 model:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, the White House is continuing its efforts against Iran to help the new President, but it will also try to build new alliances with Iran to make moreâ¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or the largest GPT-2 model:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the city of Chicago, the Chicago Police Department, and the cityâs Independent Police Review Authority, alleging that the police department and the Independent Police Review Authority engaged in a pattern or practiceâ¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty cool seeing the effects of all those extra parameters!
Itâll be interesting to see how this feature grows and evolves in the future, and whether Apple decides to keep its scope fairly narrow or someday expand its abilities.</p>

      <p>To save his own life, Joseph Dombey had an idea. As two pirate ships surrounded the ship he was on in the Caribbean Sea in 1794, Dombey scrambled below deck, disrobing as he went. He appropriated the outfit of one of the shipâs many Spanish sailors and prayed that he had picked up enough of their language during his trips to South America to blend in. Dombey shouldnât have been in this position. In fact, he shouldnât have been in the Caribbean at all. None other than Thomas Jefferson himself was expecting to meet with Dombey in Philadelphia at that very moment.</p>

                </figcaption></figure><p>Dombeyâs fate that day arguably delayed the adoption of the metric system in the United States by almost a century and left us as one of the few countries in the world still using non-metric units for our everyday measurements.</p>

<h3><strong>A doomed voyage</strong></h3>

<p>The marauders now swarming Dombeyâs ship were a particular breed of pirate: British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privateer">privateers</a>âthe state-sponsored terrorists of the 18th century. These waterborne gangs had the tacit approval of the government in London to harass and plunder other countriesâ maritime commerce and keep part of the spoils as their profit.</p>

<p>After seizing control of the ship, the pirates came across a sailor speaking Spanish with a curiously French accentâJoseph Dombey. A French physician and botanist acting under orders from the French government, Dombey had left the port city of Le Havre, France, weeks earlier for Philadelphia and the meeting with Jefferson, the United Statesâ first secretary of state and future president. But storms had pushed Dombeyâs ship off course and deep into pirate territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>France had supported the United States against the British in the War of Independence, and now they intended to build closer economic ties with the new American nation. Dombey was to negotiate with Jefferson for grain exports to France and to deliver two new French measurement standards: a standard of length (the meter) and a standard of mass called, rather ominously, a grave, to be considered by the U.S. for adoption. (The grave would be renamed the kilogram a year later in 1795.)</p>

<p>In many ways, Dombey was an excellent choice for this mission. Having already been on several trips to South America to collect botanical specimens, he was an experienced trans-Atlantic traveler. His knowledge of plants would also be of help in his agricultural trade negotiations with Jefferson. And Dombeyâs scientific training as a physician and botanist gave him an understanding of the importance of accurate weights and measures, so it was highly likely that he would be able to convince Congress to adopt the new French standards, which would later come to be known as the metric system.</p>

<p>Despite his qualifications, Dombey lacked one important attribute: luck. His previous trips had all ended in failure. He had spent two years in Peru collecting plants that could be usefully cultivated in France, only to have the shipment captured by the British. A second collecting trip, this&nbsp;time in Chile and in collaboration with Spain, fell apart over a business dispute, with Spain keeping all the valuable specimens. But Dombeyâs voyage to Philadelphia would turn out to be his most disastrous.</p>

          </figcaption></figure><p>Upon learning his true identity, the pirates imprisoned Dombey on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. Unfortunately, Dombey died before they were able to ransom him to the French, and the units of measure in his charge never made it into Jeffersonâs hands.</p>

<h2><strong>A missed opportunity</strong></h2>

<p>Some historians view this event as a tragic missed opportunity whose consequences we are still living with today. When the U.S. became an independent nation, it inherited an inconsistent collection of traditional British weights and measures. Congress was aware of the flaws with its British measures, and a congressional committee was formed to recommend solutions. Thomas Jefferson, an admirer of French scientific ideas, lobbied for a measurement system similar to that of France. But Congress didnât adopt it, and the British-influenced system took hold in the U.S. instead. However, If pirates hadnât intercepted Dombey on his way to Philadelphia, the situation might be very different today. As historian Andro Linklater writes in his book&nbsp;<em>Measuring America</em>,</p>

<p>âThe sight [in Congress] of those two copper objects [Dombeyâs meter and grave], so easily copied and sent out to every state in the Union, together with the weighty scientific arguments supporting them, might well have clarified the minds of senators and representatives alike. And today the U.S. might not be the last country in the world to resist the metric system.â</p>

<p>It would take almost 100 years after Dombeyâs failed mission before the United States, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendenhall_Order">Mendenhall Order of 1893</a>, officially adopted metric standards as our fundamental standards for weights and measures. While many U.S. industries have since converted to metric, the nation's long history with British-influenced standards&nbsp;has slowed the widespread adoption of metric units in common practice.</p>



<h2><strong>The well-traveled </strong><strong>g</strong><strong>rave</strong></h2>

                </figcaption></figure><p>Whatever became of the meter and grave Dombey had with him in 1794? Only six sets of these standards were made. And only Dombeyâs set is known to have traveled to the Americas. The cargo on Dombeyâs ship was eventually auctioned off. The meter and grave were purchased, and through a series of French intermediaries, the standards were turned over to the next U.S. secretary of state, Edmund Randolph. Randolph failed to understand the significance of the standards and took no action regarding them.</p>



<p>Somehow a grave ended up in the possession of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ellicott">Andrew Ellicott</a>, a contemporary of Dombey and a well-regarded land surveyor.&nbsp;Ellicott surveyed the boundaries for what became Washington, D.C., and completed the street plan for D.C. that had originally been envisioned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L%27Enfant">Pierre L'Enfant</a>. The grave remained in the Ellicott family until 1952 when his descendant Andrew Ellicott Douglass donated it to the NIST museum.</p>



<p>Is the grave now on display in the museum the same one captured by pirates in 1794? That remains a mystery.</p>

<p>AMDâs mobile and small form factor journey has been arduous. In the early 2010s, the companyâs Bulldozer-derived CPU cores stood no chance as Intel made massive gains in power efficiency. Zen narrowed the gap, but AMD still had a lot of work to do. Idle power consumption was still worse than Intelâs. The GPU side was stronger thanks to AMDâs acquisition of ATI, but AMDâs integrated GPUs were often left using horribly out of date graphics architectures. Terascale 3 remained in use on APUs well after GCN discrete GPUs hit the market. AMD launched the Ryzen 7 5800H in 2021 with Vega (improved GCN) graphics, when desktop GPUs had already transitioned to using RDNA 2.</p>

<p>Recent AMD products have been turning the situation around. Van Gogh (Steam Deck APU) and Rembrandt finally brought RDNA 2 into integrated GPUs. Phoenix takes another step in the right direction, combining current-generation Zen 4 cores and RDNA 3 graphics into a potent package. Weâd like to thank AMD for putting together an excellent Hot Chips presentation on the Phoenix SoC.</p>

<p>Alongside using up-to-date architectures for the all-important CPU and GPU, Phoenix integrates a variety of accelerators to improve power efficiency in specific applications. Intel had been integrating accelerators like their GNA AI accelerator for a while, and AMD is looking to catch up. An XDNA accelerator helps with machine learning inference, and an audio controller offloads signal processing from the CPU. Importantly for a mobile SoC, Phoenix also features a capable video engine.</p>

<p>Weâre going to complement our coverage of AMDâs Phoenix presentation with test data, since Cheese owns a laptop with the Phoenix-based Ryzen 7 7840HS. That laptop uses DDR5-5600 46-45-45-90, and runs the cores at up to 4.5 GHz. HP has thus chosen to artificially limit clock speeds, because the SKU should be boosting to 5.1 GHz.</p>

<p>Phoenix is manufactured on TSMCâs N4 process and occupies 178 mm2. The chip has 25.4 billion transistors, and combines Zen 4 cores with RDNA 3 graphics. Alongside the all-important CPU and GPU, AMD has added several supporting IP blocks to accelerate ML inference and signal processing. Phoenixâs die ends up being smaller than AMDâs prior Rembrandt, and fits into the same 25x35mm BGA package. </p>
<h2>CPU Side</h2>
<p>On the CPU side, Phoenix has a cluster of eight Zen 4 cores. Weâre very familiar with the core architecture already, and recommend checking out <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2022/11/05/amds-zen-4-part-1-frontend-and-execution-engine/">our </a><a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2022/11/08/amds-zen-4-part-2-memory-subsystem-and-conclusion/">articles</a> on that. Phoenix however has a different cache setup, with only 16 MB of L3 instead of the usual 32. AMD likely shrank the L3 slices to 2 MB per core to reduce die area usage.</p>

<p>From our testing, latency is identical to desktop Zen 4âs. Actual latency will be slightly worse because desktop Zen 4 clocks higher. For example, the Ryzen 9 7950X3Dâs non-VCache chiplet sees 8.85 ns of latency at a 16 MB test size. The Ryzen 7 7840HS gets 10.92 ns of latency at the 10 MB test size. Part of that difference is because HP insists on limiting clock speed to 4.5 GHz, even though the 7840HS should be able to boost to 5.1 GHz.</p>

<p>Memory latency is also higher at 103.26 ns for the 1 GB test size, compared to 87.68 ns on the 7950X3D. Memory timings play a role here, because my 7950X3D is using DDR5-5600 36-36-36-88. Laptops often have worse memory timings, and the DDR5-5600 CL46 memory used by HP is no exception.</p>

<p>Phoenixâs memory controller supports both DDR5 and LPDDR5. The latter is useful in handhelds where power efficiency is of paramount importance. Memory latency with LPDDR5 is higher at 119.81 ns. However, AMD has dramatically improved LPDDR5 latency compared to Van Gogh, which suffered massive latency when CPU cores accessed DRAM.</p>
<h3>Bandwidth to Infinity Fabric</h3>
<p>The CPU cluster interfaces with the rest of the system through a 32 byte per cycle Infinity Fabric link. Unlike desktop designs where the write path is half as wide, the CPU-to-fabric write path can also handle 32 bytes per cycle. This is very unlikely to affect real world performance, as I have seen no workload where a single core needs more than 30 GB/s of write bandwidth. A workload with more than one thread could demand more bandwidth, but can also be split across CCX-es.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try writing zeroes and see what happens</p>
<cite>Paraphrased, from Mahesh Subramony on the sidelines at Hot Chips 2023</cite></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, AMD has implemented write optimizations to reduce Infinity Fabric traffic. Write bandwidth from a single 7950X3D CCD can exceed 68 GB/s when zeroing cachelines with CLZERO. Zeroing out memory is surprisingly common, because programs will initialize memory to ensure newly allocated memory starts at a known state. Operating systems will often do so as well. If applications zero memory with recognized methods, they can see higher effective write bandwidth than a generic test may suggest.</p>

<p>Stepping back, maximum write bandwidth is very close to that of desktop Zen 4. Read behavior is slightly different because the single clusterâs 32 byte per cycle interface canât saturate the memory controller.</p>

<p>However, 60 GB/s is still plenty of bandwidth for eight cores. Caches should be absorbing the bulk of memory accesses in most client programs. Some applications may take all the bandwidth they can get, like scientific computing or machine learning, but mobile SoCs arenât your best bet for that.</p>
<h3>Infinity Fabric Optimizations</h3>
<p>Infinity Fabric is AMDâs coherent interconnect. Itâs critical to power efficiency because interconnect power can be a significant portion of chip power consumption, especially in workloads that arenât pushing compute at full tilt. AMD has profiled a variety of workloads, and set up Phoenixâs Infinity Fabric to enter different operational modes based on whether a workload is compute bound, IO bound, or has very specific characteristics (like videoconferencing).</p>

<p>These optimizations avoid Van Goghâs problems, where it was limited to <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/03/05/van-gogh-amds-steam-deck-apu/">around 25 GB/s of CPU-side bandwidth</a>, thanks to an Infinity Fabric implementation heavily optimized for gaming within a tiny power budget. On Cheeseâs HP laptop, Infinity Fabric clock varies depending on workload:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Ryzen 7840HS (Phoenix)</td><td>Ryzen 4800H (Renoir)</td></tr><tr><td>CPU Load</td><td>2 GHz</td><td>1.6 GHz</td></tr><tr><td>GPU Load</td><td>1.4 GHz</td><td>1.6 GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed CPU/GPU Load</td><td>1.6 GHz</td><td>1.6 GHz</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Infinity Fabric clock when running CPU/GPU bandwidth tests</figcaption></figure>
<p>My suspicion is AMDâs using low fabric clocks to improve energy efficiency when the GPUâs pulling a lot of bandwidth. The GPU has four 32B/cycle ports to fabric, letting it get enough memory bandwidth even at low fabric clock. CPU workloads are given higher fabric clocks because client programs tend to be more sensitive to latency than bandwidth, and higher fabric clock improves latency. Phoenixâs variable Infinity Fabric clocks contrast with Renoirâs, where fabric clock goes to 1.6 GHz regardless of what component is generating memory traffic.</p>
<p>To further save power, AMD aggressively pursues power and clock gating opportunities. A new Z8 sleep state allows power and clock gating for brief periods of idleness, like between keystrokes, with imperceptible wake time. Phoenix can achieve high residency in Z8 state during video playback, suggesting the media engineâs buffers and caches are large enough to let it make memory accesses in short bursts.</p>

<p>Additional power savings come from optimizing various physical interfaces. Memory controllers can dynamically change clock and voltage states depending on how much traffic they have to serve. A USB 2.0 interface that AMD has been using for years turned out to have a lot of power optimization opportunities, so AMD tuned that as well.</p>
<h2>GPU Side</h2>
<p>Pheonixâs GPU is based on AMDâs current-generation RDNA 3 architecture, and gets a proper âRadeon 780Mâ moniker rather than just being called Vega or gfx90c. It features six WGPs for a total of 768 SIMD lanes, capable of 1536 FP32 operations per cycle. These are divided into two shader arrays, which each have 256 KB of mid-level cache. A 2 MB L2 cache helps insulate the iGPU from DRAM, and is pretty important to the iGPUâs performance. Compared to <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/03/05/van-gogh-amds-steam-deck-apu/">Van Gogh</a>, Phoenix has twice as much L2 cache, slightly more memory bandwidth, and 50% more SIMD lanes. </p>

<p>To get a sense of how disproportionately big Phoenixâs L2 cache is, AMDâs RX 7600 discrete GPU also has 2 MB of L2 cache, as does Nvidiaâs old RTX 3050.</p>
<p>Latency at L0, L1, and L2 is quite similar when compared to the RX 7600, though the discrete card is slightly faster thanks to higher clock speeds.</p>

<p>Past L2, Phoenixâs iGPU suffers much higher latency because it lacks an Infinity Cache. (LP)DDR5 gives the iGPU a better bandwidth per SIMD operation ratio than that of desktop GPUs, so dedicating area towards another level of cache canât be justified.</p>

<p>DDR5âs bandwidth really canât be understated. With DDR5-5600 or LPDDR5-5600, Phoenix can achieve higher GPU-side DRAM bandwidth than Nvidiaâs GDDR5 equipped GTX 1050 3 GB from several years ago. 5.6 gigabits per pin is also faster than some early GDDR5 implementations.</p>
<p>If GPU-side memory accesses hit cache, Phoenixâs iGPU enjoys several times as much L2 bandwidth as Van Gogh.</p>

<p>For perspective, Nvidiaâs flagship GTX 980 Ti from 2015 gets 686.9 GB/s of L2 bandwidth in the same test. Phoenix wonât have to worry about L2 bandwidth issues at all, even with its large shader array.</p>
<p>Unlike top end desktop RDNA 3 parts, the iGPU runs the frontend and shader array at the same clock. With smaller GPUs, AMD did not see much benefit in clocking the work distribution hardware faster, because the shader array is often the bottleneck. We already saw signs of this on <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/06/04/amds-rx-7600-small-rdna-3-appears/">AMDâs RX 7600</a>, and Pheonixâs iGPU has an even smaller shader array.</p>

<p>Valveâs Steam Deck already demonstrated how a lot of PC games can run on a handheld. Phoenixâs iGPU is wider, faster, and enjoys more bandwidth than the Steam Deckâs. AMD didnât provide framerate figures, instead choosing to show Phoenixâs performance advantage over Intelâs iGPU. But given the Steam Deckâs performance, I expect Phoenix to deliver playable framerates at 1080P or 720P with some settings turned down.</p>
<h3>Video Engine</h3>
<p>Even if itâs not used for gaming, RDNA 3 comes with a AV1-capable video engine, making Phoenix more future proof as next-generation video codecs start to gain traction. While the engine is not new, AMD did reveal that it uses a race-to-idle scheme to save power. It also has enough throughput to handle several simultaneous video streams, which is important for videoconferencing.</p>

<h2>XDNA AI Engine</h2>
<p>Machine learning has taken off in the past few years, and AMD has put an AI engine (XDNA) on Phoenix to accelerate inferencing. XDNA is built from AIE-ML tiles using a Xilinx developed architecture. Phoenixâs XDNA implementation has 16 AIE-ML tiles, and can be spatially partitioned to let multiple applications share the AI engine.</p>
<p>AMD didnât go into specifics of the AIE architecture, but thankfully documentation is public.</p>

<p>XDNA aims for enough throughput to handle small ML loads while achieving very high power efficiency. It runs at very low clock and uses very wide vector execution. Documentation suggests a 1 GHz clock, but Phoenixâs XDNA might be running at 1.25 GHz as AMD says BF16 is supported with 5 TFLOPS of throughput. To drive the very wide vector units, XDNA has two vector register files. One 6 KB set of registers provides multiplier inputs. A separate 8 KB register file holds accumulator values and is accessed at a later stage in the multiply-add pipeline. Both register files can be addressed in 1024-bit, 512-bit, or 256-bit modes, with consecutive 256-bit registers forming a 512-bit or 1024-bit one.</p>

One cycle longer than the integer FMA pipeline because an extra stage is used for FP normalization. Imagine wanting to be normal.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Multiply-add operations seem to have 5-6 cycle latency depending on whether you need FP normalization. Itâs a bit long for something running around 1 GHz, but XDNA gives you permutes as part of the deal. Simpler 512-bit adds and shuffles enjoy faster 3 cycle latency.</p>
<p>Each XDNA tile feeds its massive vector units with 64 KB of directly addressed data memory. The data memory is not a cache, saving power because no tag checks are needed. Further power savings come from using 20-bit addressing, which ought to be enough for anyone. Addresses are generated by three AGUs, which operate on 20-bit pointer and modifier registers. Using separate registers for addresses is nothing new (the 6502 had two index registers), and avoids needing six extra ports on the main scalar register file.</p>

<p>After addresses are generated, the data memory can handle two 256-bit loads and one 256-bit write per cycle. XDNA enjoys the same bandwidth when accessing data memory on neighboring tiles, which gives a single tile high bandwidth access to 256 KB of memory. XDNA can save significant memory bandwidth (and computational power) with support for 50% sparsity, though ML models have to be developed with sparsity in mind to see benefits. The memory subsystem can decompress sparse matrices, and mask registers let the vector units avoid pointless calculations. </p>

<p>At the frontend, each XDNA tile has 16 KB of program memory for instruction storage. Again, this isnât a cache, so power is saved by avoiding tag checks and using fewer address bits. VLIW instruction formats allow simple decode logic while letting the frontend bring in up to six instructions per cycle, as long as theyâre in the right mix. A VLIW bundle with 6 instruction occupies 16 bytes, but bundles can be shorter too if not all of the slots are needed.</p>

<p>At the engine level, XDNA uses a specialized interconnect and memory subsystem. I already mentioned how each tile can directly access data memory on its neighbors with very high bandwidth. But thatâs not it. Tiles can forward accumulator outputs to their neighbors too, with dedicated 512-bit interfaces. A general AXI4 interface allows more generic transfers between tiles, and crossing tile boundaries happens with two cycle latency. The whole engine has a shared block of L2 SRAM, which acts as staging memory. AMD didnât disclose the L2 SRAM size, but I suspect itâs a row of four memory tiles. Each memory tile has 512 KB of capacity, so Phoenixâs XDNA engine could have 2 MB of L2 SRAM. </p>

<p>System memory is accessed via DMA, which streams in data using a 32-byte per cycle port to Infinity Fabric.</p>
<p>If applications take advantage of it, XDNA should let Phoenix handle AI workloads with better power efficiency than the GPU. Technically, the RDNA 3 iGPU can achieve higher BF16 throughput with <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/wmma_on_rdna3/">WMMA instructions</a>. However, doing so would likely require a lot more power than the more tightly targeted XDNA architecture. Saving every bit of power is vital in a mobile device running off battery, so XDNA should let programs use AI with minimal power cost. AMD says most applications theyâre targeting are friendly to INT8 operations, and XDNA should provide massive throughput there.</p>
<p>Zooming up, AMDâs Xilinx acquisition is starting to bear fruit. Previously, AMDâs smaller company size and lower budget meant they had less capability to branch out into side projects. AMDâs mobile chips had no answers for Intelâs GNA or IPU. XDNA is a step in the right direction, and gives AMD a potent accelerator for machine learning.</p>
<h2>Audio Co-Processor</h2>
<p>As you might have noticed, offloading processing to dedicated accelerators is a becoming a favored way to improve power efficiency. Phoenix goes further than offloading AI by offloading audio processing too. In fact, you could run AI noise reduction on the audio coprocessor if you can fit it within its two DSPs. </p>

<p>The audio processor can run at a very low clock while itâs being used as a wake source. With voice assistants playing a role across several operating systems, this could potentially save a lot of power.</p>
<p>Another cool use of low power, always-on DSPs is using ultrasound sonar to detect humans. AMDâs ultrasound runs at above 20 KHz but below 35 KHz, letting it get through the microphone and speakerâs band pass filters. Then, it can use Doppler shift to distinguish human movement from static objects in the same way that a look-down radar filters out ground clutter.</p>

<p>AMD has opened up this ultrasound engine to third parties. As another note, dog hearing can cover the 20-35 KHz range, so the ultrasound engine may be able to detect static dogs by making them non-static, after which they will cause a Doppler shift.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Phoenix is the latest addition to AMDâs long line of APUs (chips with integrated graphics). Ever since Picasso launched with Zen cores and Vega graphics, AMDâs APUs saw massive improvements from generation to generations. Thatâs largely because AMD started from so far behind. But Zen 2 and Zen 3 APUs were already very solid products, so Phoenixâs improvements make it a very dangerous competitor.</p>
<p>AMD has put a lot of focus into reducing power consumption across every area of the chip. Zen 4 cores do an excellent job on the CPU side, while RDNA 3 provides strong graphics performance. Hardware offload helps power efficiency on specialized AI and audio processing workloads. To support all this, Infinity Fabric gets lower power states and very flexible clock behavior. Phoenix ends up being able to perform well across a wide range of form factors and power targets. </p>

<p>Today, Phoenix has already surfaced in a variety of products. These include handhelds like ASUSâs ROG Ally, along with a variety of laptops and mini PCs. AMD now has a mobile CPU ready to take on Intelâs best, and Intel should be worried.</p>
<p>Weâd like to thank AMD for putting together an excellent presentation at Hot Chips 2023, and hope to see their mobile efforts reach even further in the future.</p>

			<p><span>I</span>ndustrial policy is no longer taboo in the United States.<a href="#notes"><sup>1</sup></a> In the last two years, the federal government has undertaken multiple industrialâinnovation policy initiatives. The <span>chips</span> and Science Act of 2022 is designed to revitalize domestic production of semiconductors as well as to add an applied science directorate to the National Science Foundation (NSF) focused on advanced technologies. The Executive Order on BioÂ­tech and Biomanufacturing hopes to ensure that the next generation of medicines are manufactured in the United States. And the Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act include massive investments in clean energy technologies.<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a> These industrial and innovation strategies are underpinned by a common vision, one centered on nurturing advanced technologies. The belief is that these policies will result in the United States once again being able to manufacture critical technologies at home.</p>
<p>But can the United States still make things domestically? What if America lacks capabilities for advanced manufacturing which the most recent round of industrial policies have not fully addressed? These go beyond the lack of resilient supply chains, or the unsurprising fact that a country which has aggressively deindustrialized during the last several decades currently lacks a workÂ­force with skills in advanced manufacturing. What if there are more profound weaknesses inhibiting advanced manufacturing in the United States, as is indicated by the trade deficit in advanced technology products? This deficit is accelerating, growing from $128 billion in 2019, to $195 billion in 2021, to $244 billion in 2022.<a href="#notes"><sup>3</sup></a> In 2021, the United States accounted for 78 percent of the total trade deficit among industrial nations, while China accounted for 45 percent of the total trade surplus.<a href="#notes"><sup>4</sup></a> Productivity in manufacturing in the United States, across most measures, has actually been declining.</p>
<p>The United States was once the global leader in manufacturing, ushering in the mass production era from the end of the nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century. It is not a global leader in the advanced manufacturing of the twenty-first century. (Advanced manuÂ­facturing can be defined as the application of innovative technologies to improve manufacturing processes and products, adding significant value through productivity advances and innovation. These would include digital technologies, robotics, 3-D printing, advanced materials, bio-fabrication, artificial intelligence, and nanofabrication.<a href="#notes"><sup>5</sup></a>)</p>
<p>The United States does not currently have the correct institutional infrastructure and accompanying operational mechanisms to support adÂ­vanced manufacturing. Industry, government, and academia are largely unlinked when it comes to advanced production technology and processes, and there is a similar lack of interagency coordination within the government. Pathways necessary for diffusing new technologies and getting them to market are missing, including a lack of scale-up financing mechanisms. The vocational education system has withered as has the corporate lab system. The Department of Defenseâs (DoD) mission has traditionally been one of military security rather than economic security and assuring a strong American industrial base. Yet economic security and military security are now inseparable, and by failing to pursue innovation in production, the DoD is putting U.S. economic and therefore national security at risk. Financial markets do not reward advanced manufacturing. They favor outsourcing and the disaggregation of integrated firms. Corporations are not rewarded for pursuing production as opposed to, say, stock buybacks. What is sometimes called the U.S. developmental state has many <span>strengthsâin</span> basic research as well as applications in the areas of defense technology, software, and biopharma <span>developmentâbut</span> advanced manufacturing is not one of them.</p>
<p>Robert J. Gordon, in his widely read book <em>The Rise and Fall of American Growth</em>, argues that recent generations of technologies are inherently less conducive to job creation, compared to earlier breakthroughs, leading to lower growth.<a href="#notes"><sup>6</sup></a> But the real culprit may be the way in which our innovation system was designed, leaving a manufacturing focus out of the innovation equation. The result of all this has been the decline of U.S. manufacturing and the corresponding weakening of the American working class, growing economic inequality, and protracted political confrontation.</p>
<p>How did we arrive at this state of affairs, and how can we fix it? The design of the existing system has been informed by many factors: which sectors in the United States are seen as prestigious and which are not; false beliefs about the strengths of U.S. manufacturing; beliefs that a postindustrial future is both inevitable and desirable; policy decisions that promoted diffusing technologies globally and not domestic indusÂ­trial strength; the DoDâs assumption that it would always have a robust industrial base to rely upon; hubris and insularity dating from the period when the United States was the unchallenged leader in mass manufacturing; financial market pressures; and the ideological and methodological limitations of mainstream economics.</p>
<p>A pervasive source of weakness is the disconnect between the U.S. production system and the U.S. innovation system. Unlike Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and now China, the United States failed to put manufacturing at the center of its innovation system. In fact, it didnât even consider manufacturing as part of innovation. When the United States was assembling its innovation system after World War II, it assumed its lead in manufacturing would be eternal. It built its innovation system in the area it needed to strengthen: R&amp;D. Thus Americaâs innovation system is in many ways a historical artifact, maladapted to the global economic competition of today.</p>
<p>The challenges America faces in adopting advanced manufacturing practices are, however, surmountable. Overcoming these challenges would allow current and future industrial-innovation policies to reach their full potential and revive domestic manufacturing. Yet these problems are not amenable to an updating of a single process or a management-consultant fix. Solving them will require a major system redesign, relinking innovation to production, building on efforts already underway as well as new initiatives.</p>
<h3><span><strong>America as the Leader in Mass Production</strong></span></h3>
<p>In the 1930s, Detroit was the technological and commercial leader of the worldâs auto industry. Detroit used mass production techniques conÂ­sisting of assembly lines and standardized products to produce an ever-increasing number of cars at reduced cost. Detroit had nearly double the wages of other industrial centers like Chicago. At the time, nearly five out of six of the worldâs cars and trucks were manufactured in the USA.</p>
<p>The most colossal and advanced factory in the worldâs most advanced center for car manufacturing was Fordâs River Rouge plant. Here, all production used the assembly line method with conveyor belts bringing together different components of the car in synchronized harmony. Mass production technologies and the division of labor created a workforce consisting of relatively unskilled employees on the line combined with a smaller group of highly skilled workers and the engineering teams that designed it. Visitors from around the world came to view this modern technological marvel, including delegations from Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. Stefan Link, in his book <em>Forging Global Fordism</em>, writes, âFordâs new factory became the destination of engineering delegations. Italian, German, Russian, and Japanese specialÂ­ists traveled to Detroit and spent weeks, months, even years at River Rouge to learn the American secret of mass production.â<a href="#notes"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Mass production was furthermore a dual-use technology. Industrialist Henry Kaiser, who had no background in shipbuilding (he built the Hoover dam and the OaklandâSan Francisco bridge) applied mass proÂ­duction techniques to shipbuilding in World War II. Kaiser shipyards could produce Liberty Ships in a matter of weeks and sometimes even days as opposed to the two-thirds of a year it took to build a comparable ship in the past. The mass production method dramatically raised manufacturing productivity. The United States produced so much war materiel so quickly that it had to scrap more planes after World War II than Nazi Germany was able to produce during the last four years of the war.<a href="#notes"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Mass production itself has military origins. The system of interchangeable machine-made parts was implemented in the early 1800s at the federal governmentâs Harperâs Ferry and Springfield, Massachusetts, arsenals, for the production of firearms. These production techniques then spread to the civilian sector. This precursor to mass production, which used specialized machines for the production of interchangeable parts, was called the American system of manufacturing or sometimes, more specifically, âarmory practice.â<a href="#notes"><sup>9</sup></a> Ford added the moving assembly lines which marked the starting point of true mass production.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Postwar Innovation Policy and Its Assumptions about U.S. Manufacturing</strong></span></h3>
<p>The U.S. victory in World War II was supported by rapid advances in science and technology and the scaling of mass production, with central planning combining the two, and the military promoting improved production techniques for private firms. Before the war was even over, President Roosevelt considered the implications of this organized approach to scientific development for peacetime. On November 17, 1944, he wrote a letter to Vannevar Bush, his science adviser and the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, stating that Bushâs office ârepresents a unique experiment coordinating scientific research and in applying scientific knowledge to the solution of the technical problems paramount in war. There is, however, no reason why the lessons to be found in this experiment cannot be profitably employed in times of peace.â<a href="#notes"><sup>10</sup></a> Roosevelt asked for Bushâs recommendations, adding, âNew frontiers of the mind are before us.â</p>
<p>Bushâs report, written in response, <em>Scienceâthe Endless Frontier</em>, is widely credited as the basis for postwar U.S. science and innovation policy.<a href="#notes"><sup>11</sup></a> It conceived of innovation as a linear pipeline. The federal government would fund basic research and the development of scientific talent. The knowledge would be available to industry which, it was assumed, would develop it further, moving it along the pipeline until it was ready for mass production, eventually reaching the marketplace. The report called for a new central science agency to oversee the research funding.</p>
<p>There were other influences on postwar innovation policy, however, which would prove to be as important as Bushâs report. John Steelman, assistant to President Truman (todayâs equivalent of a chief of staff) proposed instead a more decentralized model of research no longer overseen by a central agency, which is how federal research would come to be organized, overturning Bush. Nevertheless, Bushâs emphasis on basic research remained the focus of the U.S. innovation system, at the NSF, other government agencies, and U.S. universities, as did his linear innovation model.<a href="#notes"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The Department of Defense was a holdout from the Bush model in that it continued to support prototyping, testing, demonstrating, and implementing technologies in addition to basic research. Particularly after Sputnik, the DoD pursued the more integrated wartime approach, and was also the customer for the new technologies it developed. In contrast, the civilian R&amp;D agencies and universities supported research only through early-stage development. The civilian sector therefore folÂ­lowed Bushâs basic research architecture as well as Steelmanâs decentralized one. The result, effectively, was two innovation systems in the United States, an integrated defense one, and a disjointed civilian one.<a href="#notes"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Missing from <em>both </em>new R&amp;D-led innovation systems was any focus on manufacturing or the understanding that manufacturing-led innovaÂ­tions could occur along the pipeline rather than just as an afterthought.<a href="#notes"><sup>14</sup></a> The <em>Endless Frontier</em> report doesnât contemplate that new technologies could transform manufacturing processes <span>themselvesâthe</span> word manufacturing only occurs once. The Pentagon likewise didnât pay that much attention to broad manufacturing capabilities in the United States, nor did it need to, given the countryâs recent performance during the war.</p>
<p>Instead, the U.S. postwar approach to innovation rested on the assumption that the United States <span>wasâand</span> would <span>remainâthe</span> preÂ­eminent manufacturing power, deploying the most advanced production processes from a position of unchallenged supremacy. After all, the industrial bases of the Axis powers had just been destroyed. The foreign policy establishment, assuming U.S. industrial strength would be endurÂ­ing, made trade deals aimed at building up allies at the expense of domestic manufacturing, a position that has only recently changed.<a href="#notes"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The private sector similarly took Americaâs supremacy in manufacturing for granted. The corporate lab system of AT&amp;T, GE, GM, Ford, Xerox, and IBM, much like the government lab system, focused on technology research, not incremental advances or breakthroughs in manufacturing production. Henry Kressel, who led the central research lab at RCA, explains why: âThe returns are deemed faster and higher in focusing on product development and marketing. And there was a lack of trained <span>peopleâmanufacturing</span> carries a stigma for college trained elites. Regarding the old labs, they rarely focused on production <span>technologyâwith</span> the exception of Corning.â<a href="#notes"><sup>16</sup></a> The corporate labs declined with the pressures of global competition, with most cutting back their role on potential breakthroughs in favor of safer, shorter-term incremental advances. There has been no replacement for the old lab system when they phased down. And manufacturing technology was never an emphaÂ­sis.</p>
<p>Overall, the U.S. federal innovation system of government labs and government-funded academic research was disconnected from manufacturing. On the nondefense side, it emphasized basic rather than applied research. The focus was on scientific breakthroughs, and not on manuÂ­facturing technology. The government did not coordinate the innovative activities it funded across market actors. There were no features speÂ­cifically designed to move a new technology along the commercial pipeline.</p>
<p>The United States further lacked collaborative government, academic, and industry institutions centered on improving manufacturing techÂ­niques and sharing related new technologies. The system was therefore very unlike that of agricultural colleges, cited in <em>Endless Frontier</em> as a model, through which government-supported research is transmitted into practice. (The United States remains highly competitive in agriculture to this day.<a href="#notes"><sup>17</sup></a>)</p>
<p>The government planners and businessmen of the postwar era may have presumed that Americaâs leadership in the prior manufacturing innovation <span>waveâmass</span> <span>productionâwould</span> be repeated in subsequent waves, but this was not to be. The disconnect in the United States between innovation and production would lead to profound weaknesses. America often missed out on newer production approaches starting with quality manufacturing. As the mass production era was succeeded by new waves of manufacturing advances, America would no longer be king of manufacturing.</p>
<h3><span><strong>The Japan Shock </strong></span></h3>
<p>Ford was building cars in Yokohama, Japan, as early as the 1920s. By the 1930s, Ford, together with GM, completely dominated the Japanese auto market. The Japanese government, however, sought to change this, and pursued interventionist policies to foster a locally owned industry. In 1936, Japan enacted the Automobile Manufacturing Enterprise Law favoring domestic carmakers. The American firms were forced to leave Japan. Toyota and Nissan took over their manufacturing equipment.<a href="#notes"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, Japanâs automakers, with support of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), pioneered the âquality production paradigm.â Japanese producers pursued precision production, just-in-time production, quality built into all production stages (not just at the end), continuous improvements by the entire workforce, and collaborative labor practices, all of which led to dramatically increased efficiencies and quality. MITI funded industry rather than basic research to support this new approach. It was Japanâs turn to lead technological innovation in car manufacturing, with Detroit a follower.</p>
<p>Currency manipulation by the Japanese government further aided its exports, and the oil shock of 1973 was helpful to Japanese automakers given that they specialized in smaller, more efficient cars while the United States produced gas-guzzlers. Japanâs exports to the United States soared. U.S. automakers, in contrast, took too long to understand and then adjust their manufacturing technologies and techniques to the quality revolution. Rather than making the necessary changes or investments, the standard reaction of Detroit was to offshore lower-end models to lower-wage countries. Japan, bolstered by the quality revoluÂ­tion and the modernization of its industrial production process, and taking advantage of open U.S. markets while keeping its own closed, leapt ahead in economic competitiveness with the United States in consumer electronics as well as autos.</p>
<p>The U.S. government eventually countered in the 1980s with industrial policies of its own: the Bayh-Dole Act (which encouraged universities to commercialize federally funded research); the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (modeled on the U.S. agriculture extension program to bring advances to small manufacturers); the SBIR program (R&amp;D grant funding to small and start-up companies); <span>sematech</span> (the consortium to restore U.S. semiconductor technology leadership though improved production efficiency and quality); and the R&amp;D tax credit (which benefited firms that increased their R&amp;D investments). Finally, a joint currency intervention between the United States and its allies, the Plaza Accord, resulted in the depreciation of the dollar.</p>
<p>These industrial policies were modestly funded and piecemeal in comparison to Japanâs efforts. S<span>ematech</span>, for instance, only targeted one sector, semiconductors. Generally, these programs targeted early stages of innovation, rather than actual production technologies. The quality revolution in manufacturing of the 1970s and â80s, pioneered by Japan, largely passed America <span>byâit</span> was only adopted slowly. The country faced a widespread economic malaise and the emergence of the âRust Beltâ in the Midwest.<a href="#notes"><sup>19</sup></a> The manufacturing competition with Japan was a harbinger of the far graver China shock to come.</p>
<h3><span><strong>The Future Will Be Postindustrial </strong></span></h3>
<p>There are reasons why the United States was slow to adopt the quality revolution in manufacturing and the production innovation waves which followed. The handful of industrial policies launched by the U.S. government in response to Japanâs industrial successes were overwhelmed by larger trends, including beliefs, incentives, and policies pushing in the opposite direction, against reviving domestic manufacturing. Simply put, manufacturing was no longer a prestigious sector in the United States.</p>
<p>Americaâs success in the IT revolution in the 1990s completely diverted U.S. attention from following through on the piecemeal industrial policy reforms of the 1980s. By this point, the United States was moving too slowly, if at all, on new production techniques, and adopted policies that often hastened deindustrialization altogether.</p>
<p>The widespread <span>beliefâand</span> <span>prophecyâthat</span> the most advanced economy was a postindustrial one made concerns about Americaâs manufacturing malaise seem irrelevant. Daniel Bellâs influential 1973 book <em>The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting</em> is illustrative of American intellectualsâ thinking about manufacturing during this era.<a href="#notes"><sup>20</sup></a> The book took the transition from a goods to services economy as a given. Indeed, it is more of a meditation about the features of this transformed society.</p>
<p>As early as the 1960s, Bell argued, âthe leadership of the new society will rest, not with businessmen or corporations as we know them, for a good deal of production will have been routinized . . . but rather with intellectual institutions. Social prestige and social status will be rooted in the intellectual and scientific communities.â<a href="#notes"><sup>21</sup></a> It is quite clear which sectors and activities Bell valued. The idea that production could move beyond the routine is not considered. Instead, manufacturing seems to almost vanish entirely in his conception of the future; it is a relic.</p>
<p>Bell also claimed, âwhat has now become decisive for society is the new centrality of theoretical knowledge, the primacy of theory over empiricism.â<a href="#notes"><sup>22</sup></a> This statement contains a great deal of self-insight, about Bell, but also American intellectuals and social scientists. Bellâs theory-driven approach lacked any empirical understanding of what was going on in American manufacturing in the 1970s. The routinized production in the United States he refers to was being globally displaced by the newer type of manufacturing of Japan.</p>
<p>Bellâs book and others like it, such as those from futurist Herman Kahn, were prescient about the future of the United <span>Statesâbut</span> not about the future of East Asian countries. These nations did not embrace the postindustrial paradigm theorized by American intellectuals and academics. More damagingly, the prophecies about a postindustrial American future might have been self-fulfilling.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Workforce Education</strong></span></h3>
<p>The state of American vocational education is emblematic of the low prestige associated with production. The U.S. vocational education system of the 1950s, â60s, and â70s was not quality education. It shunted off too many students into what became a dead-end track. It was representative of the low status in the United States of factory jobs or jobs which did not require a college degree.</p>
<p>The college-for-all movement, which arose in response, was a well-intentioned reform which created its own problems. It largely dismantled vocational education. It did not, however, replace it with a better system. Instead, academic courses crowded out vocational courses, but most students who were previously on the vocational track did not end up going to college.</p>
<p>Some states and regions maintained and improved their vocational schools. Today, the United States has a small number of effective vocational-ed high schools, often with long waiting lists for admissions. These typically put students into programs that combine work and learning. But these remaining programs are the exceptions.</p>
<p>Instead, the education system for Americaâs technical workforce is largely broken.<a href="#notes"><sup>23</sup></a> Yet without a workforce trained in the skills required for new technologies, those technologies cannot be implemented. The overall problems include: a history (until recently) of disinvestment by government and employers in workforce education; Labor Department training programs that do not reach either higher technical skills or incumbent workers that need to upskill; Education Department programs that are focused on college not workforce needs and not linked to the Labor Department programs; underfunded community colleges that lack the resources to provide advanced training in new fields and have too-low completion rates; colleges and universities that are disconnected from workforce education; no system for lifelong learning; underfunded advanced technical education programs (at the NSF and at advanced manufacturing institutes); and a broken labor market information system. These problems are compounded by the reality that the existing actors are in a âlegacyâ <span>sectorâthe</span> long-established education sector is hard to change.</p>
<p>There is a burgeoning literature on innovation ecosystems as essential to technology-based growth. However, the role of workforce education as a factor in innovation ecosystems has largely been missed by these analysts.<a href="#notes"><sup>24</sup></a> It is time to put it into the equation. Overall, the United States has never created a widespread or effective work-learn model supporting skilled manufacturing jobs, akin to the vocational and apprenticeship programs of other industrial countries like Germany or Japan. But the issues go beyond just the collapse of vocational education in the United States. In addition, the American higher educational sysÂ­tem is largely disconnected from manufacturing technology and <span>proÂ­cessesâexactly</span> as Vannevar Bush designed.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Economistsâ Perspectives</strong></span></h3>
<p>In the 1970s, when American heavy industry was decimated by the combination of the oil shock and the rise of East Asian exporters, neoclassical economists could offer little advice about how to stem the decline. The Keynesian demand regime which had successfully managed the U.S. economic cycle over the previous thirty years now only proÂ­duced stagflation and was no longer tenable. The neoliberal approach which replaced it, with its emphasis on privatization, deregulation, monetarism, and free trade, also was unable to revive <span>manufacturingâand</span> was not particularly interested in doing so. These inadequacies stem from both the methodological limitations and ideological biases of mainstream economics.</p>
<p>Macroeconomic theory has been unable to adequately model innovaÂ­tion, nor does it deeply grapple with innovation systems. Nevertheless, there have been some attempts to include innovation in growth models: Robert Solowâs models identify growth as coming predominantly from technological progress in addition to labor and capital, but this is treated as an exogenous input, a black box with the model offering no further insight. Other models try to endogenize innovation, incorporating learning by doing.<a href="#notes"><sup>25</sup></a> But the details of Americaâs innovation system and its weaknesses are essentially alien to macroeconomics and not part of this field.</p>
<p>In addition to these methodological flaws, ideological preferences creep into modeling. A standard assumption is sector agnosticism. Manufacturing is treated just like any other sector, despite the evidence of the importance of manufacturing innovation to long-term growth. Although manufacturing is only 11 percent of U.S. GDP and 8 percent of direct employment, it drives 20 percent of capital investment, 30 percent of productivity growth, 60 percent of exports, and 70 percent of business R&amp;D.<a href="#notes"><sup>26</sup></a> Yet economists have often held manufacturing in disdain, with deindustrialization a sign of progress akin to sociologistsâ prophecies. Alan Blinder, former member of Clintonâs Council of EcoÂ­nomic Advisers and vice-chair of the Fed, wrote in 2005, âThe shift to services is still viewed with alarm in America and many other rich countries, where people bemoan rather than welcome the resulting losses of manufacturing jobs.â<a href="#notes"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>There are parallel beliefs, misconceptions, and dogmas in trade theory, though its recommendations were largely ignored until the neoliberal era. The United States was historically a high tariff nation, only reducing tariffs once it reached economic supremacy after World War II. It turned a blind eye to the mercantilist trade practices of South Korea, Germany, and Japan (until the imbalances with Japan became too outsized and the Plaza Accord was enacted) because these were allied nations during the Cold War. The United States offered these countries access to its markets for geopolitical reasons. The result too often was one-sided free trade.</p>
<p>Then, during the neoliberal era, ideology suffused into policy. The United States extended the same courtesy of domestic market access to China, not an ally, that it had previously offered Germany and Japan. It did so for many reasons: the desire to change China; hubris after winning the Cold War; pressure from U.S. corporations; but also because standard trade models showed this to be net-welfare improving for the United States. N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of George W. Bushâs Council of Economic Advisers, in his 2004 <em>Economic Report to the President</em>, stated âwhen a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it than make or provide it domestically.â<a href="#notes"><sup>28</sup></a> Mankiw told reporters, âoffshoring is the latest maniÂ­festation of the gains from trade that economists have talked about for centuries.â<a href="#notes"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Since then, there have been changes in trade policy attempting to reverse this neoliberal approach. Theory, however, has generally lagged policy with some exceptions. Economistsâ apparent disdain for manufacturing is still a constant. Mankiwâs indifference to Americaâs manufacturing sector remains representative of economistsâ thinking. Although manufacturing jobs result in significantly higher net employment than services jobs when indirect jobs are included, the report treats manufacturing as just another sector. It is oblivious to the underlying weaknesses in U.S. manufacturing and its many causes, which are not addressed. The 2004 <em>Economic Report</em>âs advice: âThe best policy response to recent developments in manufacturing is to focus on stimulating the overall economy.â</p>
<h3><span><strong>Mis-Incentives and Misconceptions </strong></span></h3>
<p>Though economics is conspicuous for its lack of insights about what exactly is wrong with American manufacturing, this doesnât mean economic incentives are not key. Financialization and globalization combined to reduce incentives for manufacturers to adopt advanced production techniques in the United States.</p>
<p>American financial markets favor a capital-light production model, or one of no production at all. Jack Welch was well aware of this in his transformation of GE from an engineering <span>companyâone</span> cofounded by Thomas <span>Edisonâto</span> a financial engineering company. In 1985, during his early years as CEO, he canceled the companyâs âfactory of the futureâ initiative consisting of automation systems, robotics, and adÂ­vanced machine tools, which would have allowed GE to catch up with Siemens and Japanese competitors in its offerings.<a href="#notes"><sup>30</sup></a> Instead, that same year he acquired RCA, parent company of the television broadcaster NBC. Eventually, 60 percent of company profits came from GE capital. Welchâs strategy worked, at least for a while: in 1993, GE became the worldâs most valuable company, before the stock price collapsed during the great financial crisis and GE was broken up.</p>
<p>The assessment of author David Gelles, in his critical biography of Welch, <em>The Man Who Broke Capitalism</em>, is that âinstead of trying to fix American manufacturing, he effectively abandoned it, and would soon start shuttering factories around the country and shipping jobs overseas.â<a href="#notes"><sup>31</sup></a> Welch once stated, âIdeally, youâd have every plant you own on a barge to move with currencies and changes in the economy.â</p>
<p>This dream might have been unthinkable in a previous age, when American elites had more of a national commitment. But it would have been unfeasible without the disaggregation of production and the rise of the internet conveying information. Political economist Suzanne Berger has explained that IT-based precise specifications and designs enabled manufacturing, which previously had to be vertically integrated, to be distributed across many sites. Manufacturing could take place in counÂ­tries which subsidized it through direct grants, cheap electricity,<a href="#notes"><sup>32</sup></a> and manipulated currencies. None of these factors favored investing in technological improvements in U.S. production. Ultimately, the IT revolution made the whole manufacturing issue moot in the United States. The future was the Information Age, and platform companies which manufactured nothing. Manufacturing didnât matter. It was a legacy sector at best. Daniel Bellâs prophecy about a postindustrial future seemed true.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, buried in this disdain for manufacturing were long-held assumptions about U.S. strengths, updated with beliefs that IT was transforming American production. The unprecedented decline in U.S. manufacturing employment, falling by 28 percent between 2000 and 2016, was often interpreted as resulting from automation rather than trade with <span>Chinaâwhat</span> would later be called the China <span>shockâand</span> other Asian nations. This faulty analysis, which still remains widespread, rests on the mistaken belief that U.S. manufacturing output remained solid. In fact, statistical anomalies involving how growth in computer processing capabilities is credited to growth in manufacturing output gave a misleadingly positive picture of the overall state of U.S. manufacturing.<a href="#notes"><sup>33</sup></a> There is no need to turn to explanations about automation to explain the seeming disconnect between manufacturing employment and output, because there is no actual discrepancy: both declined from the China shock.</p>
<p>In fact, the United States has been slow in adopting factory automation compared to leading competitor nations. All evidence points toward weakness. According to the International Federation of Robotics, the worldâs top five most automated countries in manufacturing in 2021 were South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Germany, and China. The United States ranks a distant ninth, just slightly ahead of Slovenia in robot density per worker, a key indicator of automation.<a href="#notes"><sup>34</sup></a> The United States is not close to being as dominant in advanced manufacturing as it was in mass manufacturing during the first half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, even today, there is a burgeoning genre of white papers from management consultants which insists that U.S. manufacturing is undergoing a technological renaissance. Often published as ânative advertisingâ (sponsored content) in the financial press, they discuss the Third Industrial <span>Revolutionâusing</span> IT to automate <span>productionâand</span> now the Fourth (4IR), which involves biological processes, blockchain, virtual reality, and more. The most prominent of these white papers are published in partnership with the World Economic Forum,<a href="#notes"><sup>35</sup></a> and the recommendations are distinctly neoliberal, meaning they are CEO-led rather than government led. There is no analysis of the design flaws of the overall U.S. innovation system, including its delinking from producÂ­tion, nor of the successes of the Chinese system, including the heavy use of subsidies. Instead, resilience, sustainability, and inclusivity are the key words of this corporate literature. They can appear in any order. Words that do not make an appearance include industrial policy, subsidies, mercantilism, and the CCP. Reading about this imminent Fourth Industrial Revolution, one would never imagine that during the Covid pandemic the United States struggled to produce the most basic PPE gear and doctors resorted to wearing plastic bags.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Case Study: Clean Energy</strong></span></h3>
<p>Often for the United States, the choice hasnât been between mass production and advanced production, but whether to pursue any domestic production at all. The federal government continues to fund basic research as Vannevar Bush planned, but the production chain beyond that is broken. Most <span>manufacturingâand</span> products developed based on innovations in manufacturing <span>processesâtakes</span> place outside the United States.</p>
<p>The clean energy sector is just one example of many. Despite the initial invention of key technologies, the United States has ceded manufacturing leadership of one energy sector after another, from solar to offshore wind to batteries to nuclear power. Jonas Nahm in his book <em>Collaborative Advantage</em><a href="#notes"><sup>36</sup></a> analyzes these differences, comparing the United States, Germany, and Chinaâs experiences in developing clean-energy industries.<a href="#notes"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>âIn the United States firms have typically taken the form of start-ups with skills in the invention of new technologies, but with far fewer capabilities in the commercialization and production of these inventions,â Nahm writes. In contrast, he found Germanyâs highly skilled small manufacturers had prowess in the customization of small batch production of <em>equipment </em>and components. China pursued what Nahm terms âinnovative manufacturingâ: Chinese manufacturers âfocused on the R&amp;D required for scaling and commercializing novel technologies. Far fewer firms prioritized the production of manufacturing equipment or the invention of new technologies.â</p>
<p>As a result of Chinaâs strength in innovative manufacturing processes and scale-up, supported by its financial system, demand policies, and workforce <span>trainingâas</span> well as massive production subsidies, local content requirements, and forced technology <span>transferâonly</span> China curÂ­rently manufactures new energy technologies like solar and increasingly batteries and soon EVs at worldwide scale. Although Nahm sees the new global system as a positive because it presents new opportunities for firms and countries to specialize and collaborate, the United States misses out on the large potential base of employment from, and control of, the technologies it invented.</p>
<h3><span><strong>The Innovation System <span>Revisitedâby</span> China</strong></span></h3>
<p>Today, it is China which is the pacesetter for auto manufacturing, not Germany or Japan, and certainly not Detroit. China dominates the production of full electric vehicles and, in 2023, surpassed Japan as the worldâs largest auto exporter. As soon as 2025, Europe could become a net importer of cars, given the rapid growth of electric vehicles made in China. Some of these are Chinese brands but others are European (and American) brands that have shifted their EV manufacturing to China. China leads in battery production and offers well-developed supply chains, a vast domestic market, and technological expertise.</p>
<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> observed, âThanks to competition and [Chinaâs] focus on execution, the EV industry went from a niche industrial policy project to a sprawling ecosystem of predominantly private companies. Much of this happened below the Western radar.â<a href="#notes"><sup>38</sup></a> The <em>Journal</em> also referenced a statement from a Chinese entrepreneur who said, âIdeas are not important in <span>Chinaâexecution</span> is.â This attention to execution in production is very different from the basic research ambitions and goals of Americaâs innovation system. But Chinaâs seemingly overnight success in electric vehicles derives from something else, too: the industrial and frequently outright mercantilist policies<a href="#notes"><sup>39</sup></a> it has successfully used in industry after industry. These include market access and consumer financing contingent upon local production, forced technology transfer, exclusion of foreign battery producers, and massive subsidies through government guidance funds.<a href="#notes"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Chinaâs emphasis on manufacturing is the exact opposite of the postindustrial discourse which has been dominant in the United States from World War II until very recently. âIndustry is the main engine of economic growth. Industry is the main battlefield of technological innovation,â writes Party Secretary Jin Zhuanglong, head of the MinisÂ­try of Industry and Information Technology. His article, âAccelerate the Promotion of New Industrialization,â published in an official CCP theory journal, further stated, âkeep the proportion of manufacturing industry to GDP basically stable, and prevent the economy from âmoving away from the real to the virtual.â Promoting new industrialization is urgent to build a large countryâs competitive advantage. It is the foundation for winning the initiative in international economic competiÂ­tion.â</p>
<p>The United States, however, is no longer sitting still. It has put in place significant industrial policies under the Biden administration, some of which passed with bipartisan support in 2021 and 2022. China is not sitting still, either.<a href="#notes"><sup>41</sup></a> Its industrial policies include the equivalent of up to $400 billion in annual scale-up financing for growing <span>industriesâthe</span> United States has no comparable program.<a href="#notes"><sup>42</sup></a> It is rapidly reforming its own innovation system, including addressing its needs in basic research. This is the last missing link in its âinnovation chain,â one required for Chinese technological self-sufficiency. Funding for basic research increased 24 percent in 2021 compared to a year earlier.</p>
<p>âChinaâs policy makers are seeking to systematically address and integrate every step of the innovation process,â notes a 2023 report by the German think tank <span>merics</span>.<a href="#notes"><sup>43 </sup></a>âThese include launching large projects, promoting industry-university-research synergy, and integrating the innovation, industrial, capital, and talent chains.â</p>
<p>Basic as well as applied scientific research is directed towards national strategic goals such as technological self-sufficiency according to the <span>merics</span> report. âChinaâs government has brought the work of State Key Laboratories closer to commercialization by embedding labs in compaÂ­nies including Huawei and ZTE.â With government backing, China is reproducing in its way the vanished U.S. corporate lab system. Even basic research conducted at universities shares these strategic and commercial imperatives. Under the National Key R&amp;D Projects proÂ­gram, which provides research funding, âthere is no strict division between funding for basic research and support for developing practical applications,â according to the <span>merics</span> report. China is now second in the world in R&amp;D spending and on a path to pass the United States.<a href="#notes"><sup>44</sup></a> Unlike in the United States, in China there are combined thrusts for invention, innovation, and production, integrated with trade policy.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Implementing Advanced Manufacturing Policies </strong></span></h3>
<p>As of 2021, Chinaâs manufacturing sector accounted for a 28 percent share of the value add of its GDP. In the United States, manufacturing makes up only 11 percent of the value add of its GDP. Roughly 40 to 45 percent of Chinaâs manufacturing output is directed to exports.<a href="#notes"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, the United States ran a trade deficit in advanced technology goods, largely with Asian nations (predominantly China), as noted above, that grew to $244 billion in 2022. This is not a deficit in commodity goods; it is a deficit in the goods the United States needs for technology and innovation leadership. And this is an accelerating probÂ­lem for the United States, not a declining or stabilizing one.</p>
<p>Although itâs long been in denial, the United States is now recognizing that it has a deep manufacturing problem. If it is going to tackle this problem, it must shift to advanced manufacturing methods to get the kind of productivity and efficiency gains needed to compete in these goods. The issue now is how to do this. A systematic approach is needed; trying to tackle the problem by relying on just R&amp;D capabilities will not be enough. Trade policy, for instance, will be part of any successful solution and is necessary to protect manufacturing from predatory pricing by mercantilist competitors. We focus here, however, on pragmatic steps the United States could take to strengthen its innovation chain. The general theme, usually overlooked in standard policy analysis, is relinking the innovation system to production.</p>
<p>Policy discussions in recent years increasingly focus on âdirectionÂ­ality,â that is, the idea that policies should set the&nbsp;<em>direction for</em>&nbsp;technolÂ­ogy development<em>,</em> as opposed to simply letting markets work their will. But what role should government play in setting that direction for manufacturing? And how can âdirectionalâ policy decisions be pursued given the complex mix of actors (from industry in numerous sectors to universities to government) and the highly federalized political system of the United States?</p>
<p>Given this complexity, it is important for manufacturing policy design to bring together the critical actors in the system. These include industry, including small manufacturing firms and large; government, including federal, state, and local; and educators, including universities and community colleges. The tool kits of each set of actors will all be needed to form effective policies. Below are ten steps that the federal government, working with the other actors, could undertake.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Improve the Manufacturing Institutes.</strong> Although policymakers began to see that American manufacturing was facing challenges when Japanâs quality model began making inroads into U.S. auto and consumer electronics sectors in the 1970s and 80s, only limited policy steps were taken. Industry, while trying to copy Japan on quality, continued to believe that the overall solutions to its problems lay in tax and trade policies. It was not until the Obama administration that an innovation-based set of policies started to evolve, with the creation of sixteen manufacturing innovation institutes during the period of 2012 to 2017.<a href="#notes"><sup>46</sup></a> The motivating concept was that U.S. manufacturers could only compete with lower-cost Asian producers, particularly from China, if they became much more efficient and productive, to offset their cost and wage disadvantages. The institutes were collaborations, with federal core funding cost-shared with industry, universities, and state governments. Each institute was organized around a particular key manufacturing technology <span>strandârobotics,</span> digital production, bio-fabrication, adÂ­vanced composites, <span>etc.âand</span> they were loosely modeled on Germanyâs Fraunhofer Institutes, which play a comparable role. Congress has recently approved three more institutes. While the institute model involves the critical actors required for manufacturing innovation listed above, program details need attention.<a href="#notes"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p><em>End the term limits.</em> The institutes have never had the budget or long-term commitment that a manufacturing technology transformation requires. At the outset of the program, the institutes were placed on term limits<strong>, </strong>with federal support set to end after five years. This was a political decision but was never realistic: the structural problems in manufacturing that the institutes were designed to tackle cannot be solved in five years; they represent long-term challenges. The term limits forced the institutes to organize around the needs of large <span>companiesâthe</span> only source that could sustain them over time when the government pulled <span>outâwhich</span> meant that they had to neglect the smaller firms that were furthest behind in adopting new technologies and limit their workforce education investments. The term limits should be ended, with institutes subject to rigorous review at the end of their current terms; if they are successful they should be extended with comparable funding. The Commerce and Defense Departments have now adopted this approach, although the Energy Department has not, and many of its institutes have become shells with very limited programs. While Commerce has reviewed and fully funded its first institute, DoD has reviewed its institutes but renewed them at significantly lower funding levels. These problems require correction.</p>
<p><em>Network the institutes.</em> In addition, efforts need to be networked across the institutes. Companies donât want to adopt advanced manufacturing for one technology at a time just because they were developed at separate, stove-piped institutes. Instead, institutes need to cooperate to offer packages of their technology advances to firms. For example, firms donât want to adopt just robots; they want robotics integrated with digital production technologies and other technologies such as 3-D printing or advanced composites. We need an institute network function to pull together advances from across institutes and package them for easier adaption.</p>
<p><em>Collaborate closely with state and local governments</em>. Although the institutes must have a national mission, manufacturing is highly regional, and the states and local governments play the leading roles in economic development and workforce education.&nbsp;Collaborations between them and the institutes are ongoing but deepening them will be key to institute success. New manufacturing technologies need to be available for national adoption but tested and piloted regionally, which means institutes must operate at both national and regional levels.</p>
<p><em>Undertake testing, demonstration, and certification</em>. The Defense Department has long supported the testing and demonstration stages, key steps for technology acceptance and scaling. Most manufacturing institutes have created technology centers and should receive additional funding to undertake rigorous testing and demonstration of new techÂ­nologies developed by participating companies in the areas the institutes support, such as robotics or 3-D Printing. Part of these demonstrations should be to identify the cost and efficiency savings to manufacturers these technologies can provide. After effective demonstration, the instiÂ­tutes should certify and validate the feasability of the new technologies, which can help with prompt market acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Back R&amp;D for manufacturing technologies</strong>. We also need to enlist our federal R&amp;D agencies in the cause. Manufacturing is not a subject of their research, but it needs to be, so technology advances move into the manufacturing institutes for experimentation and adopÂ­tion. The federal basic research agencies work at what DoD and NASA have characterized as âTechnology Readiness Levelsâ (TRL) 1â3, meaning they support early-stage research up to proof-of-concept experimentation. Since industry typically devotes most of its resources to the scale-up and initial production <span>stagesâTRL</span> levels <span>7â9âthere</span> is a major gap (the infamous âvalley of deathâ) in between. The manufacturing institutes are designed for these in-between levels, from development and prototyping to technology demonstration (TRL levels 4â6).</p>
<p>But if the institutes focus at these post-research stages, over time they will need new input from earlier stage research. Our R&amp;D agencies have historically shunned research on manufacturing <span>technologiesâthatâs</span> been viewed as industryâs purview, although industry emphasizes later-stage development not research. We need to see manufacturing as a system, with connections throughout, from research to production.</p>
<p>Although the research agencies never developed significant portfolios around manufacturing, now is the time for them to do so if we are to have a connected innovation system to spur advanced manufacturing. This means, too, that they will need to include applied work that adds manufacturing solutions to their earlier-stage research. We need a cross-agency agenda for R&amp;D on manufacturing technologies and processes at our R&amp;D agencies, linked to the development initiatives at the institutes. Otherwise, over time, tech development at the institutes will become stranded and thin out.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Provide scale-up financing. </strong>While venture capital has been a major force for financing innovation in the United States, it is now focused overwhelmingly on software, biotech, and various services sectors. It is largely out of âhard <span>techââinnovations</span> that must be manufactured. This means there are few mechanisms to scale up manufacturing production in the United States. In recent decades, firms have been shifting prototyping and production of hard-tech goods to China.</p>
<p>A significant manufacturing gap in the United States is seen in its lack of entrepreneurial start-up firms in this sector, which are needed to advance innovation. The share of&nbsp;young manufacturing firms (less than&nbsp;five years old) among U.S. manufacturers has steadily declined over the past three decades, falling far below the levels in sectors supported by VC, such as biotech, software, or IT.<a href="#notes"><sup>48</sup></a> Yet newer firms tend to adopt and develop new manufacturing technologies and processes at a higher rate than established firms. Manufacturing is missing among new entrants, and scale-up financing could help encourage their entry into manufacturing and corresponding production innovation.</p>
<p>If the United States is to shift to advanced manufacturing at both old firms and new, it will need scale-up financing to support it.<a href="#notes"><sup>49</sup></a> In contrast to the United States, China has long provided massive manufacturing scale-up assistance to its firms, which accounts for much of its dominance of world manufacturing output. What form could scale-up fiÂ­nancing take in the United States? Operation Warp Speed in 2020 used guaranteed contracts to Covid-19 vaccine makers to reduce their risks and assure production. Senator Chris Coons and colleagues have proÂ­posed an industrial finance corporation for innovative manufacturing.<a href="#notes"><sup>50</sup></a> The DoD in 2022 created a new âOffice of Strategic Capitalâ for techÂ­nology scale-up, although it appears focused more on national security rather than broader economic security goals.<a href="#notes"><sup>51</sup></a> The Biden administration has proposed repurposing an established federal bank, the Ex-Im Bank, to provide manufacturing scale-up support alongside its long-standing export financing role.<a href="#notes"><sup>52</sup></a> The DepartÂ­ment of Energyâs Loan Programs Office, since 2005, has provided financing for scale-up of new energy technologies. While the program suffered a political backlash for a failed loan to a thin-film solar company, Solyndra, in 2011, it has had numerous successes. The most notable was a $465 million loan to Tesla in 2009â13 for expansion of its Fremont, California, production site, which enabled the company to avoid bankruptcy and accelerated the scale-up of electric vehicles in the United States. In addition, states in their economic development role have often provided financing to firms to support regional job creation. In contrast to the United States,<a href="#notes"><sup>53</sup></a> China has long provided massive manufacturing scale-up assistance to its firms, which accounts for much of its dominance of world manufacturing output.</p>
<p>There are thus a range of possible mechanisms available, from forming a new industrial bank to expanding the role of existing institutions. Applying a number of these mechanisms with expanded lending authority for advanced manufacturing scale-up could be a solution to this glaring manufacturing system gap.<a href="#notes"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>(4) Use government procurement power to promote new manufacturing technologies. </strong>The DoD is by far the largest procurement agency, and it needs to strengthen its industrial base and build more resilient supply chains for increasingly pressing national security needs. The productivity and efficiency gains possible from advanced manufacturing therefore should be a priority. DoD historically played a role in fostering new manufacturing technologies, such as the interchangeable machine-made parts developed at Army arsenals in the 1840s. A more recent example is computer numerically controlled (CNC) equipment, pervasive now in all manufacturing sites. It was first developed through DoD-supported research at MIT. When DoD saw the new level of precision manufacturing it enabled, it required its contractors to implement CNC machining for its missile programs, which spread this advance throughout U.S. industry.</p>
<p>DoD, working with manufacturing innovation institutes, could identify productivity savings available from new technologies such as digital production advances, robotics, or 3-D printing, and require its defense contractors, through specifications and contracts, to implement them. It also has authority under the Defense Production Act to acquire these new technologies and lease them back to its contractors. While DoD procurement does not dominate U.S. manufacturing, it has a significant market share. DoD could adopt the approach of mandating improvements, along with funding support for new equipment, that it used with CNC machining, enabling larger-scale adoption of the new manufacturing technologies.</p>
<p><strong>(5) Direct production support</strong>. In the case of some critical technologies, we may need more direct production support to build factories. We need a more sustained <span>chips</span> Act, and for other critical sectors, not just semiconductors.</p>
<p>In the 2022 <span>chips</span> Act, the federal government provided $39 billion in grants as well as loan guarantees and investment tax credits to semiconductor makers to fund new advanced production facilities. Similarly, the federal government, through the Commerce or Defense Departments, could provide support for firms to acquire and install new advanced manufacturing technologies. This could be applied particularly toward production of critical or national-security-related technologies.<a href="#notes"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>(6) Provide both âtop-downâ and âbottom-upâ support</strong>. Many support tools are going to be needed for a manufacturing revival and will involve a series of organizations and agencies, from the advanced manufacturing institutes, to the R&amp;D agencies noted above, and the Defense and Commerce Departments. Each has existing policy impleÂ­mentation mechanisms and could acquire new ones based on the recommendations here. These tools can be offered to manufacturing firms in two basic forms. Top-down tools have long been employed by <span>darpa</span> and were also employed by Operation Warp Speed. Here, the government identifies a technology challenge to be addressed, and picks a small portfolio of leading companies to pursue it. The DOEâs funding of eight companies for fusion development is yet another example. Bottom-up tools involve incentives widely available to interested comÂ­panies to meet a technology <span>challengeâitâs</span> up to the firms to pursue them. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits for purchases of EVs manufactured in America if the vehicles meet sourcing and processing requirements for critical materials used in their batteries. Tesla notably took advantage of many other bottom-up tools in rising to EV technology leadership.<a href="#notes"><sup>56</sup></a> The manufacturing chalÂ­lenge is complex so both top-down and bottom-up approaches will be needed.</p>
<p><strong>(7) Build a manufacturing focus into existing industrial policy programs. </strong>The United States has recently passed a major package of industrial policy programs (including the energy demonstrations in the Infrastructure Act, the <span>chips</span> and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act) with over $500 billion in new funding. Yet programs specifically focused on manufacturing technologies are largely missing from these initiatives. While the new legislation aims to rebuild U.S. supply chains, if the bulk of this manufacturing does not occur in the United States, supply-chain resilience will remain elusive. In effect, we need to put the âindustrialâ into these industrial policy programs. Each requires a policy focus on manufacturing. And future industrial policy approaches require more of a specific manufacturing focus. Rather than just incentivizing the growth of a particular manufacturing sector through subsidies or tax credits, this would also mean incentivizing adoption of advanced manufacturing processes such as digital technologies, robotics, artificial intelligence, 3-D printing, or bio-fabrication, both in general and in those sectors.</p>
<p><strong>(8) Map and fill gaps in supply chains</strong>. The Covid pandemic and the resulting economic fallout exposed the weaknesses of U.S. supply chains not only in protective equipment, pharmaceuticals, and pharmaceutical materials but in a host of areas, from semiconductors to critical materials and supplier manufacturing capabilities. A fundamental lesson from Operation Warp Speed in 2020 was the need to better map supply chains in order to assure production capability, and the Defense Production Act enabled the Defense Department, working closely with industry, to intervene and fill gaps to assure sufficient vaccine production to meet the emergency. Similarly, in 2020, the executive branch, through a series of participating agencies and the White House, began a major effort to identify and fill supply-chain gaps in advanced batteries, pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, semiconductors, and critical minerÂ­als.<a href="#notes"><sup>57</sup></a> Particularly for the production of critical and nationÂ­al-securiÂ­tyârelated technologies, relevant federal agencies could work with industry to support the mapping of supply chains for implementing advanced manufacturing technologies and processes.</p>
<p><strong>(9) Fix workforce education. </strong>Germany has long gained productivity improvements from a famously well-trained manufacturing workforce based on an apprenticeship system. In contrast, U.S. companies have generally tried to get productivity gains from capital, plant, and equipÂ­ment investments and ignored the workforce side. German firms underÂ­stand, however, that productivity gains from new equipment can soon spread worldwide, while a gain from a high-quality workforce will be enduring and provides a long-term competitive edge.</p>
<p>The United States has a broken workforce-education system, with a deep disconnect between the education system and workplaces. If the United States wants to adopt advanced manufacturing, its workforce must be ready for it. This requires rebuilding much of workforce education at all levels.<a href="#notes"><sup>58</sup></a> Community colleges must introduce advanced manufacturing curricula, create short programs more adapted to upskilling workers already in the workforce, establish certificates around particular skills that stack toward degrees, and turn around low completion rates. At the federal level, disconnected Labor and Education Department programs need to be integrated and efforts to expand registered apprenticeship programs accelerated. At the industry level, firms must collaborate with each other and with community colleges to build new training and apprenticeship programs, including youth apprenticeship starting in high school. Solutions will have to be pursued throughout the U.S. federal system, since education is largely state- and local-government led. These governments need to improve community college funding and support, integrate advanced manufacturing proÂ­grams across community colleges, promote apprenticeships, and work closely with area firms on reforms and curricula.</p>
<p><strong>(10) Put someone in charge. </strong>The above steps require a series of agencies to act in concert, not an easy task in our stove-piped government, and ways must be found to pull these varied manufacturing pieces together. An interagency committee will be inadequate for the task. The Obama administration in 2008, faced with the bankruptcy of most of the U.S. auto industry, named a manufacturing czar to supervise federal support and put the industry back together, who then began to attack manufacturing challenges more broadly.<a href="#notes"><sup>59</sup></a> A comprehensive program to spur and implement new manufacturing technologies and processes, with varied mechanisms of support, as well as new trade approaches, calls for such a position in a permanent White House office. Operation Warp Speed provides guidance on how to organize it. OWS was a task force with a specific mission that included key representatives from relevant agencies led by a highly experienced industry leader and senior Army logistics expert, as well as an independent and expert supporting staff. That model could work here, assuring White House authority, links to agency powers, and independent leadership. Since the mission will require industry collaboration, an advisory group of industry, engiÂ­neering, university, and labor leaders could be formed.<a href="#notes"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>This is not an exclusive list for what needs to be done through government policy for the United States to shift to advanced manufacturing, but it marks a beginning. Most are relatively manageable initial steps, many within reach of the existing policymaking process and not requiring new laws. Nearly all require collaboration between the actors in the U.S. manufacturing <span>systemâindustry,</span> government, and <span>educationâand</span> there will be no substitute for committed companies. The remedies here are largely federal but some are shared across federal, state, and local governments. But more âdirectionalityâ from new government policies will be required for this shift to advanced manufacturing.</p>
<h3><span><strong>A Rare Opportunity</strong></span></h3>
<p>Only about twenty countries have managed to move from developing to developed-nation status since World War II. Fourteen of them applied industrial policies based on governmental interventions.<a href="#notes"><sup>61</sup></a> This approach has been most famously expressed in the East Asian development model. Directed and targeted interventionist policies were key to Japanâs recovery after World War II and were also applied by Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and in recent decades by China. All these countries relied on strong manufacturing through industrial policy approaches to drive economic growth. Since these examples suggest that the restoration of manufacturing prowess requires interventionist government policies, there are lessons here for the United States about the kinds of policies it needs to consider.</p>
<p>U.S. global power paralleled its rise in manufacturing power. It was the first nation to introduce interchangeable machine-made parts before the mid-nineteenth century. It grew this breakthrough in technology and process into its system of mass production, which led the world in manufacturing by the early twentieth century. By the end of World War II, it had achieved production <span>supremacyâno</span> other nation was close to U.S. manufacturing capacity and output. Through this manufacturing advance it forged a deep connection between national security and economic security with manufacturing as the enabler of both. But this link, never explicit, has been neglected since the end of the Cold War. Americaâs problems with, and indeed indifference to, manufacturing have historical and societal roots, which&nbsp;predate the rise of China and the offshoring of manufacturing. In some ways, offshoring is the culmiÂ­nation of the trend, not the cause.&nbsp;But by missing a focus on manufacturing, the United States has missed an innovation capability step that many other leading nations have grasped.</p>
<p>The recent industrial policies of the Biden administration mark a sea change in Americaâs approach. They are attempts to address both the technological competition with China and the need for new energy technologies.<a href="#notes"><sup>62</sup></a> These initiatives are important and <span>necessaryâbut</span> they are not sufficient. No nation can maintain a world-power position while walking away from manufacturing. Major gaps remain in advanced manufacturing and scale-up financing, which are not a significant focus of the new programs compared to the level of effort needed. The United States is now pursuing a series of industrial policies, although so far they are light on the âindustrial.â For the United States to successfully adopt advanced manufacturing at scale, its industrial innovation policies need to address production directly. China is facing its own challenges, including adverse demographic trends, rising wages, regulatory uncerÂ­tainties, and wasted resources, but a negative shift in Chinaâs growth model does not mean the United States will succeed in manufacturing.</p>
<p>The way forward is for the United States to redesign its innovation system, so that innovation is more closely linked to production. It canât just focus on basic R&amp;D as has been the case since World War II. The United States needs to retain these basic research capabilities, but at the same time sharpen its focus on execution. Overall, the United States needs to more fully integrate government policies, trade, finance, education, innovation, and production.</p>
<p>There is a rare opportunity to do this. Economic security, including the technological competition with China, as well as the quest to renew American economic leadership, provide a strategic imperative.<a href="#notes"><sup>63</sup></a> But there is something more. The United States created breakthroughs in technologies which can transform advanced manufacturing: 3-D printÂ­ing, advanced composites, new materials, biomanufacturing, photonics, power electronics, and other emerging fields including AI manufacturing.<a href="#notes"><sup>64</sup></a> We are at a once-in-a-century moment where we could fundamentally change the way we undertake production.</p>
<p>Whereas EU nations define advanced manufacturing primarily in terms of current digital technologies, the federal governmentâs modest manufacturing programs are researching and pursuing a broader host of <span>technologiesâa</span> more revolutionary approach. The United States may have fallen behind in implementing todayâs advanced production techÂ­niques, but with the right political commitment, new scale-up financing and other tools, and tighter linking of innovation and production, America may be able to leapfrog to the frontier of an industrial transÂ­formation.</p>

Although the <span>chips</span> and Science Act calls for regional innovation hubs to try to spread innovation mastery to new areas, potentially including production capability, it is not yet funded. So Nahmâs analysis remains relevant for understanding comparative approaches to innovation and production.</p>

<div>
    <p>Until November 1, 2023, Creative Cloud, Adobe Firefly, Adobe Express, and Adobe Stock paid subscribers won't be subject to generative credit limits. Starting November 1, 2023, credit limits will apply.<br>

            <p>Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that enhances creativity by producing amazing results from simple text prompts. Generative AI features powered by Firefly are now available in our core creative tools and the standalone Firefly web app. Weâre starting with images, text effects, and vectors, with Generative Fill and Generative Expand in Adobe Photoshop, Text to Image in Adobe Firefly, Generative Recolor in Adobe Illustrator, Text Effects in Adobe Express, and more. Next, we plan to bring generative AI powered by Firefly to 3D, animation, and video. Each groundbreaking generative AI feature unlocks new creative possibilities, empowering users to play, experiment, dream, and create the extraordinary.</p>
<p>Since generating content with AI models requires significant computational resources, we have updated our plans to include a monthly allocation of âgenerative credits.â</p>

            <p>Generative credits can be used across generative AI features powered by Adobe Firefly in the applications you are entitled to. Generative credit counts reset each month. If you have multiple subscriptions, the total number of generative credits available is the aggregate of what is included in each plan.&nbsp;<span>We have updated our plans to include access to generative AI creations in the following ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Creative Cloud and Adobe Stock paid subscriptions include a plan-specific number of monthly generative AI creations of vector graphics or standard-resolution images* powered by Adobe Firefly. After the plan-specific number of generative credits is reached, you can keep taking generative AI actions, but your use of generative AI features may be slower.</li>
<li>Adobe Express and Adobe Firefly paid plans also include a plan-specific number of monthly generative AI creations of vector graphics or standard-resolution images* powered by Adobe Firefly. After the plan-specific number of generative credits is reached, you'll be able to take two generative AI actions to create vector graphics or standard-resolution images per day until your credits reset the next month.</li>
<li>Creative Cloud, Adobe Firefly, and Adobe Express free plans receive a plan-specific number of monthly generative AI creations of vector graphics or standard resolution images* powered by Adobe Firefly. After the plan-specific number of generative credits is reached, you can upgrade to a paid plan to continue creating assets with features powered by Firefly or wait until credits reset the next month.</li>

Each groundbreaking feature unlocks new creative possibilities, from Text to Image in Adobe Firefly to Generative Fill in Adobe Photoshop, Text Effects in Adobe Express, and so much more.</p>
<p>Since generating content with AI models requires significant computational resources, we have updated our plans to include a monthly allocation of generative credits that provide priority processing of generative AI content across features powered by Firefly in the applications to which users are entitled. The number of monthly generative credits each user receives depends on&nbsp;<span>their subscription. The consumption of generative credits depends on the generated output's computational cost and the value of the generative AI feature used.<br>

<p>Java 21 will be released on September 19, 2023, supporting record patterns in switch blocks and expressions. Such syntax is monumental (At least, in Java land). It marks the point where Java could be considered to properly support functional programming patterns in ways similar to Kotlin, Rust, or C#. And it marks the first point where I can say, as a Kotlin developer, that I feel jealous.</p>

<p>There are a few notable releases here.</p>
<p>Java 14 stabilised switch expressions, 16 records and <code>instanceof</code> pattern matching, 17 sealed classes, and now, 21 will stabilise record patterns and switch pattern matching.</p>
<p>This set of changes allows Java to express one of the foundations of functional programming that the language never could before - Algebraic data types, along with idiomatic ways of using them.</p>
<p>Algebraic data types are a concept born from <em>Type theory</em>, which is a branch of Set theory that focuses specifically on questions like âIs an <em>Apple</em> a <em>Fruit</em>?â and other such whimsical conundrums math teachers like to pose to hapless students the world over.</p>

</h2><p>Type theory has quite a lot of meat to it, and most of it isnât relevant to this article.</p>
<p>So, instead of explaining type theory, I will talk about a few specific kinds of types that it would be useful to know about.</p>
<h3 id="the-bottom-or-empty-type-">The Bottom, or Empty Type (<code>â¥</code>)
<span>
    <a href="#the-bottom-or-empty-type-">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path></svg>
    </a>
</span>
</h3><p>This type describes the set of all values which <em>canât be computed</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This set is usually empty for any normal programming language (Ã).</p>
<p>No object can be cast to bottom since it is an empty set.</p>
<p>An example of such a type is Kotlinâs <code>Nothing</code>. It is considered an error for an instance of <code>Nothing</code> to exist. The way Kotlin prevents <code>Nothing</code> from being instantiated is <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/7a7d392b3470b38d42f80c896b7270678d0f95c3/core/builtins/native/kotlin/Nothing.kt#L23">by setting its constructor to be private</a>.</p>
<p>The Java version of this type is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Void.html"><code>Void</code></a>, the wrapper class for the <code>void</code> primitive type. It is, again, impossible to construct a <code>Void</code> instance because its constructor is private. However, <code>Void</code> cannot be considered a true bottom type because a <code>Void</code> variable can still hold <code>null</code>, which means it is technically a unit type<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (more on that below). In that sense, the primitive <code>void</code> does better. Thereâs absolutely no way to use it as a variable type, so you canât even have an empty <code>void</code> variable.</p>
<h3 id="the-top-type-">The Top Type (<code>â¤</code>)
<span>
    <a href="#the-top-type-">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path></svg>
    </a>
</span>
</h3><p>This type represents every value of every type - the universal set of values, <code>U</code>. In Kotlin, this type is named <code>Any</code>. And it may be tempting to think <code>Object</code> (the Java equivalent of <code>Any</code>) is a top type, except for the fact that primitives exist. Primitives are wholly separate from Javaâs object model, and interact with objects in rather non-standard ways. Because of this, Java technically does not have a top type the way other languages do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <code>C</code> does as it do and overloads <code>void</code> by using <code>void *</code> to represent a pointer that can refer to a value of any type instead. How droll!</p>
<p>Every object can be cast to top since <code>U</code> contains every value that exists.</p>
<p>There isnât much to say about top other than that a variable of this type can hold anything. Including a value of the bottom type. Good luck finding that value, though.</p>
<h3 id="the-unit-type-">The Unit Type (<code>()</code>)
<span>
    <a href="#the-unit-type-">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path></svg>
    </a>
</span>
</h3><p>This type has only one value. There is only one instance of that one value, and it is impossible to create more of it.</p>
<p>Javaâs <code>void</code> primitive technically works like this. When a method returns <code>void</code>, you can treat it as if it implicitly returns the sole instance of the <code>void</code> type under the hood (This is <em>not</em> how the JVM handles <code>void</code>). Java deviates from the theoretical norm in that <code>void</code> can never be passed into a method as a parameter.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
        The truth is, Java just mashes the bottom and the unit types together to give us <code>void</code>.
    </p>
</div>
<p>You can technically simulate the unit type in Java by declaring a new class that is final and has no fields other than a static instance value. You would then be able to treat that instance as the sole unit type value.</p>
<p>In fact, this is precisely how Kotlin defines its own <code>Unit</code>. If you navigate to the definition of <code>Unit</code>, youâll see how simply it is defined; <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/7a7d392b3470b38d42f80c896b7270678d0f95c3/core/builtins/src/kotlin/Unit.kt#L22">itâs just an <code>object</code></a>!</p>
<p>Unlike Java, Kotlin allows you to use <code>Unit</code> anywhere, including as a parameter to a method. The following snippet is thus legal:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="kotlin"><span><span><span>fun</span> <span>identity</span>(param1: Unit): Unit = param1
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>val</span> result = identity(param1 = Unit) <span>// just returns the Unit instance again.
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="the-boolean-type">The Boolean Type
<span>
    <a href="#the-boolean-type">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path></svg>
    </a>
</span>
</h3><p>Weâre now in familiar territory.</p>
<p>The boolean type has two valid values, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> (Or whatever other names you want to use). Indeed, you donât even need to use your languageâs native boolean type to represent this type; you can do just as well by using a nullable instance of a unit type. If the variable is non-null, itâs <code>true</code>, and if it is <code>null</code>, <code>false</code>. This is of course, a useless waste of time fit only for those interested in obfuscating their source code.</p>
<p>So far, weâve looked at some basic examples of ârulesâ used to define types in type theory. Letâs move onto the heart of the matter and discuss sum and product types, and how Java 21 allows us to represent them via records and sealed classes.</p>
<h3 id="the-product-type">The Product type
<span>
    <a href="#the-product-type">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path></svg>
    </a>
</span>
</h3><p>Product types are composed of two or more constituent types. In general, a product type is a list of two or more types grouped together. A product typeâs <em>arity</em>, or <em>degree</em>, is the number of constituent types within it.</p>
<p>If youâd like a nice, concrete example of a product type, look no further than the humble C <code>struct</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>struct</span> some_type {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>int</span> val1; <span>// Type 1
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    <span>char</span> <span>*</span>val2; <span>// Type 2
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    <span>double</span> val3; <span>// Type 3
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    <span>int</span> val4; <span>// Type 4
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>};
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the struct above, <code>some_type</code> is a product type composed of four different types: <code>int</code>, <code>char *</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>int</code> again. Notice that weâre repeating <code>int</code> here. How do we figure out which <code>int</code> is which when we perform operations on <code>some_type</code>? This may seem obvious, but itâs a problem in math, because you have to construct all the building blocks and concepts you use from scratch!</p>
<p>In this case, we already have the tools to make this work. We associate each type with the name given to it in the struct (Duh). Mathematically speaking, a product type is not merely a list of types but a list of <em>ordered pairs</em>, where each ordered pair consists of a type and a name associated with that type.</p>
<p>For example, we can represent the first value of <code>some_type</code> as the ordered pair <code>(int, "val1")</code>. That way, itâs impossible to mix up the two <code>int</code> components; theyâve got different names!</p>

</h4><p>In set theory, the word product usually refers to the <em>Cartesian</em> product of two sets.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
        The Cartesian product of two sets is a set of ordered pairs made from every possible combination of every element from both sets.
    </p>
</div>
<p>You can use set theory notation to express the product of two types <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> as <code>C = A Ã B</code>. This product operation is not commutative; <code>A Ã B</code> is <em>not</em> the same as <code>B Ã A</code>. If you think about it for a bit, youâll see why: youâd be switching around the order of the declared components! The example I just talked about only uses two component types: <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. How would we represent <code>some_type</code>, for example? The answer is to chain multiple product operations together, like so:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>some_type = int Ã char* Ã double Ã int
</code></pre><p>The set of values within a product type could be expressed like this (Please leave your complaints about my (ab)use of math symbols in the comments):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>C = A Ã B = {(a, b) | a â A, b â B}
</code></pre><p>You could represent the set of all values in <code>some_type</code> like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>some_type = { (val1, val2, val3, val4) | val1 â int, val2 â char*, val3 â double, val4 â int }
</code></pre><h4 id="alright-weve-established-what-product-types-are-whats-this-got-to-do-with-java">Alright, weâve established what product types are. Whatâs this got to do with Java?

</h4><p>When Java 16 was released, the record class feature was stabilised. Record classes are a great example of what a product type is. All fields are final; you canât inherit from these classes either. All of a recordâs state is set at the time of its construction<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and once a record is created, thatâs how itâll look for the rest of its lifetime, all 200 milliseconds of it.</p>
<p>This contrasts with normal Java classes, which are all over the place. You can have public and private state, thereâs hidden state via inheritance that you donât think about until it pops up like some haunted animatronic on caffeine to jumpscare you with weird bugs, and you can have mutable fields, static fields, and all sorts of other distracting things that yadda yadda yaddaâ¦ (<em>you get the idea</em>).</p>
<p>The problem with normal Java types is that it is impossible to generalise what a typeâs components are. And that matters when all you want is to efficiently process data; you have to navigate a maze of potentially nonstandard getters to even get at your data in the first place, let alone munge it.</p>
<p>Now, Java never did support destructuring like JavaScript or Rust do. But even if Java had supported it, the spec would still probably restrict that feature to records. Letâs ask ourselves a few questions to better understand why.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
        Destructuring is a feature certain languages (very famously, JavaScript) have which allows you to take a complex value, and, to borrow a PHPism, <em><strong>EXPLODE</strong></em> it into its components as a list of completely independent variables. Read more about this feature <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">here</a>.

</span>
</h4><p>A Java classâs internal state includes all its fields, both public and private. However, allowing the extraction of private fields by destructuring doesnât seem like a good idea; we all know how mad old Uncle Bob gets about breaking encapsulation. So fine, we have to exclude private state.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-public-state-then">What about public state, then?
<span>
    <a href="#what-about-public-state-then">

    </a>
</span>
</h4><p>Letâs first think about this: How do Java objects expose public state? Sure, you can define a field as public, and if you want to prevent undue modification, make the field final. But there is another extremely common approach to this as well. Most Java objects set every field to be private and make all fields accessible only through accessor methods for reading and writing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no <em>language enforced</em> conventions for defining accessors; you could give the getter for <code>foo</code> the name <code>getBar</code>, and itâll still work fine, except for the fact that it would confuse anybody trying to access <code>bar</code> and not `foo'.</p>
<p>Sure, you can use frameworks like Lombok to take away the complexity and uncertainty by slapping a few annotations on your POJO classes, but that doesnât change the underlying fact that normal classes in Java are <em>very difficult to statically reason about</em> due to how many âvariablesâ contribute to defining the state of a class.</p>
<p>I suspect this is one of the problems that prevented the Java Language Specification authors from adding pattern matching to all classes right off the bat.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>To fix this, they created records, an entirely different class hierarchy. There is already a precedent; Java 5 introduced enums, which inherit from <code>java.lang.Enum</code>. Similarly, all records inherit from <code>java.lang.Record</code>.</p>
<h4 id="so-how-do-records-do-what-normal-classes-dont">So how do records do what normal classes donât?

    </a>
</span>
</h4><p>Records solve this problem by restricting how they can be defined and rigidly defining the set of properties they can have.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Records are implicitly final classes and canât be inherited from.
<ul>
<li>No more illegitimate child classes birthed of a tryst with an entirely different concubine library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Records cannot extend any class but <code>java.lang.Record</code>.
<ul>
<li>This avoids the pitfall of inherited state polluting the recordâs code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A recordâs components cannot have any visibility modifiers.</li>
<li>A recordâs components are always final and immutable.
<ul>
<li>This does not extend the immutability to the contents of each record component, however.</li>
<li>Only the references of a recordâs components are treated as immutable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you declare a record and do not define getter methods, getters will be defined using very specific syntax.
<ul>
<li>This syntax is very regular; Java just uses the name of the field as the getterâs name.</li>
<li>For field <code>a</code>, the getter would be <code>a()</code>.</li>
<li>Java will use your definition if you manually define a getter that matches the naming conventions. Otherwise, Java will automatically create a getter method that correctly follows the conventions. The nonstandard getter wonât make much of a difference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fields that back a recordâs components are always implicitly private and are accessed only through getters.</li>
</ul>
<p>(There is a little more to it, but this seems like a good stopping point.)</p>
<p>These properties of records guarantee that any new language feature Java brings out that uses records such as pattern matching will always work, because the language spec itself guarantees the behaviour and structure of records.</p>

</h4><p>Itâs quite a drag to have to write extremely nested code when you have a lot of conditions based on the types of your data. This problem will come into perspective when I introduce sum types further into the article. Pattern matching is a way to statically (Meaning at compile time, as you write the code) verify that certain patterns are present in the data you are processing.</p>
<p>Take a look at the example below. Note that the data within <code>A</code> is a <code>Record</code> instance, and could contain <em>any</em> record type. We first try printing <code>r</code>âs contents with normal Java if statements, before doing it with switch pattern matching.</p>

Switch patterns are very powerful when you want to quickly and easily extract deeply nested data without waffling around with <code>instanceof</code> checks and cumbersome type casts. If you ever get a chance to work with Java 21 (May you be blessed with management that isnât allergic to new Java versions), Iâm sure youâll appreciate this feature.</p>
<p>If youâd like to try this yourself, hereâs how. Install Java 21 (Thereâs a handy <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jdk21-jetbrains-bin"><code>jdk21-jetbrains-bin</code></a> package available in the AUR if anybody wants to immediately try it. I use Arch, btw). Copy this code into a <code>main.java</code> and run it with:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>java --enable-preview --source <span>21</span> main.java

<p>In the previous example, we were able to use pattern matching to switch over different record types. Now, letâs set that aside for a second and talk about how we manage choices in Java.</p>

<p>Now, given a <code>Color</code> instance, youâd just need to check if it is an <code>instanceof</code> your desired colour representation, and youâd be able to access data from that representation. But this implementation has a flaw. How do we restrict what a colour is in our class hierarchy? Any user of your library could create a new <code>RYB</code> class that inherits from <code>Color</code>, or from <code>RGB</code>, for example. This becomes a problem when your library does not expect any new variants of <code>Color</code> to exist or if it does not expect specific <code>Color</code> variants to change their behaviour. Unless the API is designed to be extensible, creating new representations could cause crashes in the best case (So you have a chance of knowing what went wrong) or in the worst case, subtle bugs that affect code far away from the problemâs source.</p>
<p>To fix this, we could do a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make all variants <code>final</code>.
<ul>
<li>While this helps, it doesnât preclude the creation of new variants directly from <code>Color</code>, since itâs impossible to make <code>Color</code> itself final.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure that all internal logic always has a default case for unrecognised variants.
<ul>
<li>This will reduce the extensibility of the library, but if that is not a goal, it will help.</li>
<li>But this will also be a lot more error-prone; if even one part of the logic forgets to account for the bad case, thereâll be problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or, we could use sealed classes or interfaces and kill two birds with one stone.</li>

</h3><p>Java 17âs sealed classes enable design patterns based on the concept of <em>Sum types</em>. Where a product typeâs range of values is the product of the value ranges of its constituent types, a sum typeâs range of values is the <em>sum</em>. Well, that was pretty obvious from the nameâ¦ But what does it mean for the range of values to be a sum?</p>
<p>Sum types encode that a type can be <em>any one</em> of its constituents at a single time. They are also known as tagged union types because, in type theory, they are usually represented as a type whose range of values is the union set of its components, where each component type is âtaggedâ with a label.</p>
<p>You could express a sum type like this if you were to use my pseudo-type-theory notation:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>T = A + B + C
</code></pre><p>The set of values that are in T could be expressed with this logical predicate:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>T = { x | x â A â B â C }
</code></pre><p>You may be reminded of <code>C</code>âs <code>unions</code> when you hear the term union types.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>union</span> MyUnion {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>int</span> intValue;
</span></span><span><span>    <span>double</span> doubleValue;
</span></span><span><span>    <span>char</span> charValue;
</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>MyUnion</code> is composed of three component types, and <code>C</code> allows you to treat a value of <code>MyUnion</code> as a container for any of these three types:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>union</span> MyUnion myUnion;
</span></span><span><span>myUnion.intValue <span>=</span> <span>42</span>;
</span></span><span><span><span>printf</span>(<span>"Integer value: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, myUnion.intValue);
</span></span><span><span>myUnion.doubleValue <span>=</span> <span>3.14159</span>;
</span></span><span><span><span>printf</span>(<span>"Double value: %lf</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, myUnion.doubleValue);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that the value of the union is overwritten in the second assignment of <code>doubleValue</code>. If you were to print <code>myUnion.intValue</code> after the second assignment, youâd see gibberish; thatâs actually just the bytes of <code>doubleValue</code> cut in half and interpreted as an integer.</p>
<p>This exposes the most significant flaw <code>C</code> unions have; thereâs no built-in way to know which variant is contained within a union value without external information. Thus, we need an external <em>discriminant</em> to determine whatâs inside. Javaâs polymorphism can do that for us with <code>instanceof</code>. But Javaâs class hierarchy is too open; thereâs no way to restrict the number of variants of a Java âunionâ.</p>
<p>What we need are <em>tagged unions</em>, which is exactly what sealed types allow us to represent. The <code>sealed</code> modifier exists to make it clear that you canât extend a sealed class beyond the classes allowed to inherit from it. This allows the developer to control how users interact with their libraryâs API.</p>








<div id="colour-sealed-class">
    
    <p><span>
            
        </span> 
        <span>Listing:&nbsp;<code>Color</code>&nbsp;implemented with a sealed class</span>
    </p>

    <hr>

    
</div>
<p>Note the syntax of the sealed class <code>Color</code>. There is a <code>sealed</code> modifier and a <code>permits</code> clause with the names of all the subclasses of <code>Color</code>. <code>permits</code> is used to specify which classes get to inherit from a particular class and is used to prevent any unwanted inheritance. Note also that each implementation of <code>Color</code> is marked as <code>final</code>, so you only get the four colour representations you see here; you canât make your own.</p>
<p>This class hierarchy is locked down. No new classes can inherit from <code>Color</code>, whether they are located in the same package or not.</p>
<p>If your class hierarchy starts with a <code>sealed</code> class, you must mark all inheritors (direct or indirect) as <code>sealed</code>, <code>non-sealed</code>, or <code>final</code>. If an inheriting class doesnât have these modifiers, it is a compile error.</p>
<p>Hereâs what each of these modifiers mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sealed</code> - The class cannot be inherited unless the inheritorâs name is mentioned after <code>permits</code>.</li>
<li><code>non-sealed</code> - The class can be inherited normally. Helpful in controlling the scope of custom behaviours.</li>
<li><code>final</code> - The class is a âleafâ in the inheritance tree; you canât extend it anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>These modifiers can be used to control exactly how the classes of an API can behave and how they are used. This avoids situations where the only thing stopping everything from exploding are rules that can only be enforced by developers agreeing to not do the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Imagine weâre writing code to handle colours based on their format. We already have a nice, restricted way of ensuring thereâll be no funny business. But how would we structure the code that handles the sealed class instances?</p>
<p>Earlier Java versions wouldnât give us much of a choice; the best we can manage is an if-else ladder:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But wouldnât it be nice to switch on a colour variable and extract the contents at the same time as well the way Rust can?</p>
<p>Rust would let you do this, for example:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span> color <span>=</span> Color::<span>RGB</span>(<span>255</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>);

</span></span><span><span><span>match</span> color {
</span></span><span><span>  Color::<span>RGB</span>(red, green, blue) <span>=&gt;</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>// ...
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  }
</span></span><span><span>  Color::<span>CMYK</span>(cyan, magenta, yellow, black) <span>=&gt;</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>// ...
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  }
</span></span><span><span>  Color::<span>YUV</span>(y, u, v) <span>=&gt;</span> {

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that these colour values are being destructured in the <code>match</code> block above. How would we get that done with sealed classes? Switch pattern matching with destructuring only works on records, and records canât inherit from any class but <code>Record</code>â¦</p>
<p>The solution is to just use sealed interfaces. They work in exactly the same way as sealed classes, except even records and enums can implement them.</p>

    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
        Java 21 allows you to catch the <code>null</code> case within <code>switch</code> blocks and expressions now, so you donât need to precheck for <code>null</code> before you get to a switch.
    </p>
</div>
<p>You may notice we arenât using a default case here. Java would have normally raised an error stating that all cases havenât been covered. However, because <code>Color</code> is a sealed class, Java can tell that every case has been handled.</p>

</h3><p>Did I mention weâve got guard clauses? Guard clauses! You can attach additional conditions to switch arms that have to be true for the arm to be executed! Guard clauses allow the succinct expression of more complex conditions within switch statements and expressions. No more extremely nested <code>if</code> conditions in your switches.</p>
<p>Consider a situation where we need to special-case RGB colours where <code>red &gt; 200</code> is true. Before, we had to put that condition inside an <code>if</code> condition within the corresponding caseâs body:</p>

    <p>
        Java will still eagerly match whichever case evaluates to true first, so make sure to put more specific cases (guarded or not) first, followed by less specific ones.

</h2><p>We have a new class of exceptions to deal with now. Specifically, <a href="https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/MatchException.html"><code>java.lang.MatchException</code></a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>What happens when a pattern match goes wrong? Consider the case of a bad record getter implementation:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span>record <span>R</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> i<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>    <span>// bad (but legal) accessor method for i
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>        <span>return</span> i <span>/</span> 0<span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>exampleAnR</span><span>(</span>R r<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>switch</span><span>(</span>r<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>case</span> R<span>(</span>var i<span>):</span> System<span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span>i<span>);</span> <span>// i's accessor always throws!
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The switch block above will throw a <code>MatchException</code> because when iâs getter is called, an <code>ArithmeticException</code> is thrown.</p>
<p><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/441">JEP 441</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A record accessor method which always throws an exception is highly irregular, and an exhaustive pattern switch which throws a MatchException is highly unusual.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exhaustive switch blocks will throw if none of the specified variants can match the selector. Regarding this, the JEP states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(An exhaustive switch over an enum fails to match only if the enum class is changed after the switch has been compiled, which is highly unusual.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <code>MatchException</code> will also be thrown if a guard clause raises an exception when executed.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span>Object obj<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>obj<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>case</span> R r <span>when</span> <span>(</span>r<span>.</span><span>i</span> <span>/</span> 0 <span>==</span> 1<span>):</span> System<span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span> <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"It's an R!"</span><span>);</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>default</span><span>:</span> <span>break</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The example here is very easy to spot; we can easily statically determine that thereâs a divide-by-zero error here. However, the waters would be muddier if the dividend were to be a dynamic, possibly <code>0</code> value.</p>
<p>As my late grandfather (A doctor) always said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Divide by zero, not even once.</p>

</h2><p>In this article, weâve looked at a bunch of things that Java 21 allows us to do (I havenât covered certain things like how generics interact with switch patterns, however). In the next one, Iâll show you some interesting quirks and a few practical examples of how we can leverage these functional building blocks to improve how we write Java code.</p>
