<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The new terminal (Beta) is now in JetBrains IDEs and will be available in the new UI starting from the 2024.1 version of the IDEs. You can switch between the old and new terminal in <em>Settings/Preferences | Tools | Terminal | Enable New Terminal</em>. Currently, it supports only Bash, Zsh, and PowerShell, with other shells in development. This blog post covers the architectural and visual changes and outlines our plans.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1600" height="640" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-79.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Software developers use terminals for a variety of tasks. Though it’s a basic element of programming, the convenience of a terminal lies in its ability to provide a universal way of managing tasks without needing to be proficient in all UI elements. Modern solutions, on the other hand, come with numerous productivity enhancements, such as smart layouts for the command prompt and output, command completion with a list of options, AI-powered functions, and many others.</p>



<p>Aiming to combine both basic and advanced capabilities, the new terminal&nbsp; is a familiar tool presented in a fresh way and with an expanded set of features. Our goals are to preserve the functionality of working in a terminal, enhance convenience and simplicity, and address long-standing issues. This article will guide you through the changes to the terminal in JetBrains IDEs and our plans for the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Visual changes</strong></h2>



<p>The new terminal aligns with the look and feel of the new UI and is available in all JetBrains IDEs starting from version 2024.1. The primary visual distinction of the new terminal is that each command is now presented in a separate block. This helps you quickly locate the start and end of each command, enhancing the readability of the output. This change brings other new capabilities, such as easy navigation between blocks using arrows and the <em>⌘↑ / ⌘↓</em> (macOS) and <em>Ctrl+↑ / Ctrl+↓</em> (Windows and Linux) shortcuts that enable you to easily switch between the prompt and output.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/idea/navigation.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>Another significant change is the command completion feature that supports commands, paths, arguments, and options, aimed at simplifying command entry.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/QULxSq2WHjSg2t94A3GtzBvfuG9ZEBVI44CXexGGBTsXXCTGum2TeutNXzsn-eAsQqnkvt7bAS9kClRFjDLXxTIjcFqoNbd073AqO-sRIy0rm9l6ujJNdYioKisK9pdl0-uekitU3n3WjlEUMhZb_tc" alt=""></figure>



<p>A new, convenient command history has been added, which allows for filtering and makes it easier to navigate through recently executed commands. The UX designers have also revamped the color scheme – the palette is now aesthetically pleasing and easy to read.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/idea/history.gif" alt=""></figure>



<h2><strong>Architectural changes</strong></h2>



<div><p>The new terminal is not just visual changes, but a new architecture that made these changes possible. Here are the most notable changes:</p><p>We took full control over the prompt area of the terminal. You can now use editor actions and move the cursor with the mouse during command input. At this stage, some shell shortcuts either do not work or behave incorrectly. We are working to address these issues.</p></div>



<p>We reworked command completion that integrates all of the IDE’s knowledge into the suggestions. Since we are still working on this update, some completion options may not be available or they may differ from shell-based completion.</p>



<p>We added our own command prompt, which shows the current directory, Git branch, Python virtual environment, and Anaconda environment. This is intended to provide a rich, modern command prompt even if it is not configured in a shell. We understand that some prefer having the same prompt as in the system terminal, and we are working on an option to allow this.</p>



<h2><strong>How to enable the new terminal</strong></h2>



<p>Starting from version 2024.1, when the <em>Terminal</em> tool window is opened for the first time, you will see a promotional window for the new terminal. After that, you can switch between the old and new terminal using the three dots menu in the upper right corner of your <em>Terminal </em>tool window or via <em>Settings/Preferences | Tools | Terminal | Enable New Terminal</em>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/idea/enable.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>At the moment, we only support a limited set of shells: Zsh, Bash, and PowerShell. If you use any other shell, you will see the old terminal even if the new setting is enabled.</p>



<h2><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2>



<p>Currently, we’ve only taken the first step in overhauling the terminal, and there’s much more work ahead. Our immediate focus is on improving the stability of the new terminal and refining its current behavior.</p>



<p>We plan to introduce more terminal customization options (fonts, spacing, etc.), improve command completion, add the ability to switch between the built-in and shell prompt, introduce context actions for blocks, and streamline tab management in the terminal. Additionally, we have plans to implement useful AI capabilities, such as assisting in command typing or explaining the obtained results.</p>



<h2><strong>How to provide feedback</strong></h2>



<p>The new JetBrains IDE terminal, which will be made available from v2024.1, is in Beta and currently undergoing changes and improvements. At this stage, your feedback is crucial to us. Our goal is that the new terminal will have the same capabilities as the old one, while offering a host of beneficial new features.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>As we are currently in the development process, we acknowledge that some issues may arise when interacting with the new terminal.</strong><strong> </strong>Please report any issues on <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTrack</a>.

<ul>
<li>Better reliability when sending out emails across different providers.</li>
<li>Streamlining the HTTP API and improving related SDK methods.</li>
<li>Better performance when calling the whoami API endpoint, updating identities, and listing identities.</li>
<li>The performance of listing identities has significantly improved with the introduction of keyset pagination. Page pagination is still available but will be fully deprecated soon.</li>
<li>Ability to list multiple identities in a batch call.</li>
<li>Passkeys and WebAuthn now support multiple origins, useful when working with subdomains.</li>
<li>The logout flow now redirects the user back to the&nbsp;<code>return_to</code>&nbsp;parameter set in the API call.</li>
<li>When updating their settings, the user was sometimes incorrectly asked to confirm the changes by providing their password. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
<li>When signing up with an account that already exists, the user will be shown a hint helping them sign in to their existing account.</li>
<li>CORS configuration can now be hot-reloaded.</li>
<li>The integration with Ory OAuth2 / Ory Hydra has improved for logout, login session management, verification, and recovery flows.</li>
<li>A new passwordless method has been added: "Magic code". It sends a one-time code to the user's email during sign-up and log-in. This method can additionally be used as a fallback login method when the user forgets their password.</li>
<li>Integration with social sign-in has improved, and it is now possible to use the email verified status from the social sign-in provider.</li>
<li>Ory Elements and the default Ory Account Experience are now internationalized with translations.</li>
<li>It is now possible to convert an Ory Session Cookie or Ory Session Token into a JSON Web Token.</li>
<li>Recovery on native apps has improved significantly and no longer requires the user to switch to a browser for the recovery step.</li>
<li>Administrators can now find users by their identifiers with fuzzy search - this feature is still in preview.</li>
<li>Importing HMAC-hashed passwords is now possible.</li>
<li>Webhooks can now update identity admin metadata.</li>
<li>New screens have been added to make account linking possible when a user has registered with a password and later tries signing in with a social account sharing the same email.</li>
<li>Ability to revoke all sessions of a user when they change their password.</li>
<li>Webhooks are now available for all login, registration, and login methods, including Passkeys, TOTP, and others.</li>
<li>The login screen now longer shows “ID” for the primary identifier, but instead extracts the correct label - for example, “Email” or “Username” from the Identity Schema.</li>
<li>Login hints help users with guidance when they are unable to sign in (wrong social sign-in provider) but have an active account.</li>
<li>Phone numbers can now be verified via an SMS gateway like Twilio.</li>
<li>SMS OTP is now a two-factor option.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following features have been shipped exclusively to Ory Network for this version:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/organizations" rel="nofollow">B2B SSO</a></strong>&nbsp;allows your customers to connect their LDAP / Okta / AD / … to your login. Ory selects the correct login provider based on the user’s email domain.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.ory.sh/docs/api/eventual-consistency" rel="nofollow">Significantly better API performance</a></strong> for expensive API operations by specifying the desired consistency (<code>strong</code>,&nbsp;<code>eventual</code>).</li>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>Pagination parameters for the <code>list identities</code> CLI command have changed from arguments to flags <code>--page-token</code> and <code>page-size</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="- kratos list identities 1 100
+ kratos list identities --page-size 100 --page-token ..."><pre><code>- kratos list identities 1 100
+ kratos list identities --page-size 100 --page-token ...
</code></pre></div>
<p>Furthermore, the JSON / JSON pretty output of <code>list identities</code> has changed:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="-[
-  { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;...&quot; },
-  { /* ... */ },
-  // ...
-]
+{
+  &quot;identities&quot;: [

+  ],
+  &quot;next_page_token&quot;: &quot;...&quot;
+}"><pre><span><span>-</span>[</span>

<p>Omit irrelevant OIDC providers in forced refresh login flows (<a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/3608" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/ory/kratos/pull/3608/hovercard">#3608</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/912dccdf04a550604c5bfeb53ccf79c5f1133ef2">912dccd</a>):</p>
<p>Whenever an user is asked to reauthenticate (e.g. because they wish to execute settings flow touching their credentials and their session is no longer privileged) they are asked to provide their credentials again. The forced-refresh login flow generated for such cases already excludes some strategies that are enabled in Kratos but cannot be used to authenticate as current identity, and for example the form presented to the user will not have a password field if the identity does not have a password credential.</p>
<p>This, however, does not currently apply to OIDC providers; the user will always see the full set even if some of them can't be used to sign in as current identity. This change causes forced refresh login flows to also omit irrelevant OIDC providers in generated form in order to avoid confunding the user about which strategies/providers are valid and can actually be used to reauthenticate.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add ability to convert session to JWT when calling whoami (<a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/3472" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/ory/kratos/pull/3472/hovercard">#3472</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/57b7bb846c8072f786ea6b80cd688fdee75805da">57b7bb8</a>), closes <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2487" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/ory/kratos/issues/2487/hovercard">#2487</a>:</p>
<p>This patch adds a query parameter <code>tokenize_as</code> to <code>/session/whoami</code> which encodes the session to a JWT. It is possible to customize the JWT claims by using a JsonNet template, and furthermore change the expiry of the token.</p>
<p>The tokenize feature supports multiple templates, which makes it easy to use the resulting JWT in a variety of use cases.</p>
</li>

<p>This PR adds the ability to search for sub-strings and similar strings in credential identifiers.</p>
<p>Note that the <strong>postgres</strong> and <strong>CRDB</strong> migrations create special indexes useful for this feature. To use <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/online-schema-changes" rel="nofollow">online schema changes</a> with cockroach, we recommend to manually copy the index definition and run it before applying migrations. The migration will then be a no-op.</p>
<p>If you run on <strong>mysql</strong> (or <strong>sqlite</strong>), no special index is created. If desired, you can create such an index manually, and it would be highly appreciated if you could contribute its definition.</p>
<p>This feature is a preview and will change in behavior! Similarity search is not expected to return deterministic results but are useful for humans.</p>

<p>Currently, the Kratos system does not automatically log out or invalidate other active sessions when a user changes their password. This poses a significant security risk as it allows potentially unauthorized individuals to maintain access to the account even after the password has been updated.</p>

<p>When user tries to login with OIDC for the first time but has already registered before with email/password a credentials identifier conflict may be detected by Kratos. In this case user needs to login with email/password first and then link OIDC credentials on a settings screen.<br>
This PR simplifies UX and allows user to link OIDC credentials to existing account right in the login flow, without<br>
switching to settings flow.</p>

                    <p>At long last, we bring you the final development version before <span>GIMP</span> 3! While the release of 2.99.18 is a bit behind <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/10373#timeline">our intended schedule</a>, there are a number of new features and improvements that we’re very excited to share with&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>⚠️ ☢️ <br>
We remind that a <em>development version</em> means that this is a release to show
work-in-progress but also give an opportunity to the community to detect issues
early and report issues. In other word, this is an <strong>unstable</strong> version and we
do not recommend to use it in production. Use it because you want to help <span>GIMP</span>
improve by <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues">reporting bugs</a>.</p>
<p>This version 2.99.18 in particular might be one of the most unstable releases in
the 2.99 series because of the space invasion. It is expected and normal.<br>

<h2 id="color-space-invasion">(Color) Space Invasion<a href="#color-space-invasion" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have been working very hard on the Space Invasion project, which is&nbsp;— as <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2018/08/19/gimp-2-10-6-released/#prepare-for-the-space-invasion">you might
recall</a>&nbsp;—
our codename for the project of making <span>GIMP</span> more <em>correct</em> regarding&nbsp;colors.</p>
<p>Lately we have been porting older internal color structures (<code>GimpRGB</code>,
<code>GimpCMYK</code>, <code>GimpHSV</code>…) which we used to carry color information to
<a href="https://developer.gimp.org/api/gegl/class.Color.html"><code>GeglColor</code></a>. This
generic object can contain any color data regardless of color model, precision
or space supported by <a href="https://gegl.org/babl/">babl</a>, our pixel encoding&nbsp;engine.</p>
<p>What it means for color correctness in particular is that we will now do color
conversion only when needed (last-second conversion) and therefore won’t lose
information when it could have been avoided. For instance, say you color-pick
color from an image: if we were to convert to an intermediate format, before
using it on a second image (which may or may not be in another color format),
we’d do 2 conversions. Which means more possibility of precision loss. The issue
is even more flagrant if the input and output formats are the same (i.e. no
conversion should happen at all). And this will be even more a problem when we
will have core <span>CMYK</span> backend (we really want to avoid doing a round-trip to an
intermediate format with <span>CMYK</span>, which doesn’t have bijective conversion with most
other color models, even when working unbounded and ignoring precision&nbsp;issues).</p>
<p>We are also slowly moving stored data to this generic color object. In
particular it means that color palettes will be able to contain <span>CMYK</span> colors,
<span>CIELAB</span> colors or in any other supported model (and not only these colors after a
conversion to unbounded&nbsp;sRGB).</p>
<p>A consequence for code maintainance is that it makes it a lot easier to handle
color conversions within our codebase, now that the structure embeds both the
data and its “meaning”. It makes color handling a lot less bug-prone compared to
when we had to keep track of both information as separate&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>Lastly we are working toward showing color space information in various parts of
the interface, when relevant, such as when displaying or choosing <span>RGB</span>, <span>CMYK</span>, <span>HSL</span>
or <span>HSV</span> data.
Values in these color models without the associated color space are
near-meaningless. Interface displaying values in <code>RGB</code> without further
information are a remnant of the past when it mostly meant sRGB. This is
clearly not true anymore in modern graphic work and the interface should make
this&nbsp;clear.</p>
<p>The below video shows some of this interface work where <span>RGB</span>, <span>HSV</span> or <span>CMYK</span> models
for instance are always displaying the color space the values are in (which very
often means the name of the <span>ICC</span> profile). This is being done in the color picker
tool, color samples, <span>FG</span>/<span>BG</span> Color dockable, “<em>Change Foreground/Background Color</em>”
dialog and in more&nbsp;places.</p>
<p>Not only this, but when people select a soft-proofing profile and activate
soft-proofing (e.g. through the nice new simulation toggle which <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/08/27/gimp-2-99-12-released/#simulation-toggle-in-the-status-bar">was added in <span>GIMP</span>
2.99.12</a>),
we will also show out-of-gamut area not only within the image’s color space, but
also the soft-proof&nbsp;space.</p>

<p><strong>Very important warning</strong>: this is once again a huge port in our codebase,
which impacted litterally thousands of lines of code. This work is unfinished
though it will have to be finished before the first release candidate. Therefore
unstabilities or bugs are to be expected in this update so if you encounter any
issue, we recommend to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues">report
them</a>.</p>
<h2 id="improved-color-algorithms">Improved Color Algorithms<a href="#improved-color-algorithms" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Øyvind Kolås improved a few internal&nbsp;algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achromatic pixels in the Hue-Saturation tool are now special-cased so that
  grayscale pixels (saturation of 0) are only changed by the master adjustment,
  not by the red&nbsp;adjustment.</li>
<li>Grayscale gradients are now kept achromatic even with “Dithering” checked in
  the Gradient&nbsp;tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the <a href="#color-space-invasion">space invasion</a> project goes on, getting things
consistent is getting easier in various color-related algorithms, hence enabling
us to discover issues quickly and fix&nbsp;them.</p>
<h2 id="initial-non-destructive-editing">Initial Non-Destructive Editing<a href="#initial-non-destructive-editing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>One area we’re “ahead of schedule” on is the much-requested non-destructive editing! The foundation for these features has been laid by many developers over many years, since the introduction of <span>GEGL</span> into <span>GIMP</span>. Originally planned for the 3.2 roadmap, an initial implementation was made as a continuation of a Google Summer of Code project. If you are not familiar with the term, “non-destructive editing” means that filter effects such as Blur are kept separate from the layer’s pixels. This means that if later on you want to change a setting, rearrange, or even remove the filter, you can easily do so without affecting the rest of the image. Until now, <span>GIMP</span> has followed a destructive editing workflow where effects were immediately merged down onto the layer, so this is a major&nbsp;change!</p>
<p>Any <span>GEGL</span> operation that has a <span>GUI</span> is now applied to layers non-destructively (Non-destructive effects for layer masks and channels are planned for future updates.). This includes third-party <span>GEGL</span> plug-ins and custom operations created with our <span>GEGL</span> Graph tool. These effects can be saved and loaded in <code>.xcf</code> project files, although not all <span>GEGL</span> properties are supported in the current&nbsp;build.</p>
<p>Once a filter has been applied, you can interact with it further by clicking the filter icon in the layers dockable. This will open a pop-up that shows all filters currently applied to the layer. From here, you can toggle the filter’s visibility, edit the filter settings, re-order the filters, and delete individual effects. You can also merge down all filters to recreate a destructive&nbsp;workflow. </p>
<figure>

<em>Non-destructive layer effects - <span>GIMP</span> 2.99.18</em>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note that this is only an early implementation, and much work remains to be done for a full-featured version of non-destructive editing. We will continue to refine the existing features for the 3.0 release based on user testing and feedback, and extend them further afterwards.
The interface itself is not how we envision this feature ideally and a first
<a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/specifications/layer-effects-ui/">specification draft was layed out</a>
for a much more integrated&nbsp;workflow.</p>
<p>The below screenshot is a mockup from this first specification which would show
layer effects within the main layer list, sharing the same “eye” and “lock”
buttons, but also with their own easily editable&nbsp;mask:</p>

<figcaption>
<em>Specification mockup image: vision of layer effects directly in the layer list with their own mask</em>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Nevertheless creating this new interface will be its own challenge so we decided
to delay it to after <span>GIMP</span> 3 release and to propose this early implementation at&nbsp;first.</p>

<p>Idriss Fekir, another GSoC 2023 student, has been working with long-time developer Liam Quinn to improve how <span>GIMP</span> handles fonts. A lot of this work was internal to improve <span>GIMP</span>’s ability to handle  future font and text updates. Some of the more visible changes&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>GIMP</span> no longer relies on font names being unique to distinguish between them. This means it won’t append “#1”, “#2” and so on but instead keep the original names in the font selection list. Despite the apparent name clash, both identically named font will now work&nbsp;properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>GIMP</span> can now load fonts using custom styles (bypassing Pango which is unable
  to load&nbsp;them).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can now load more types of fonts than before. In cases where we don’t support a font yet (or the font is non-existent), we can better detect this and fall back to a default font. This also improves support when loading an .xcf file created on another computer to different fonts&nbsp;available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Windows, we force the Pango backend to always use anti-aliasing. This improves the readability of menu text on that operating system, especially with a dark&nbsp;theme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span>XCF</span>-saving code now stores font information much more accurately which
  helps to avoid loading the wrong font when reopening some <span>XCF</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alignment of text in text layers for <span>RTL</span> languages is now more consistent with
  how it works in other software (such as LibreOffice or&nbsp;Scribus).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes are a lot less flashy relatively to some of the other features and
therefore may feel less important, yet they are actually the foundation work on
making text handling a lot more reliable in <span>GIMP</span>. We are envisionning a future
where text editing will be simpler while much more powerful and featureful (in
particular OpenType features are some of the big improvements we hope to get&nbsp;eventually).</p>
<h2 id="auto-expanding-layers">Auto-Expanding Layers<a href="#auto-expanding-layers" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The third GSoC project last summer by student Shubham Daule brought a long requested feature – auto-expanding layers! Brush tools now have an additional “Expand Layers” option. When checked, painting past the layer boundaries will cause them to automatically expand so you don’t have to manage the layer size yourself. If you want to expand the layer beyond the current size of the canvas, you’ll need to also check the “Show All” option in the View&nbsp;menu.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>The Expand Layers option also has additional settings when selected. You can decide how much you want the layer boundaries to expand by whenever the brush reaches them. There are also options to specify how the new areas of the layer and layer mask should be filled in when&nbsp;expanded.</p>
<h2 id="new-snapping-options">New Snapping Options<a href="#new-snapping-options" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>New contributor mr. fantastic developed two new options for aligning layers on the canvas. With “Snap to Bounding Boxes” enabled, dynamic guides will now show when the layer you are moving is aligned with the center or sides of others. The active layer will also snap to those boundaries to assist you with arranging them properly. The second option, “Snap to Equidistance”, allows you to snap between three layers that are equidistant from each&nbsp;other.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Themes<a href="#themes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>We continued to improve the user interface and style for this release. One of the biggest improvements was dealing with “system theme leaks”. There are styles that were not specifically defined in our themes, thus allowing different systems to supply their own (often conflicting) styles. With the help and feedback of several contributors and users, we’ve made a lot of progress in defining those styles so that everyone has a consistent&nbsp;experience!</p>
<p>Recently Jehan worked on re-organizing and simplifying our theme system. In past development versions we had five different themes: Default, Gray, System, Darker, and Compact (Each with light and dark options). These have been simplified into the System theme and a single Default theme with three possible states – light, dark, and gray. Similarly, our four separate icon themes were condensed into the Legacy set and a Default with Color and Symbolic options. We think these changes will reduce user confusion and make it easier for them to find their preferred interface&nbsp;appearance.</p>
<p>In addition, on Windows the main titlebar (and most dialog title bars) now adjust to light or dark mode depending on the selected&nbsp;theme. </p>
<h2 id="welcome-dialog">Welcome Dialog<a href="#welcome-dialog" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Welcome Dialog has been expanded to provide quick access to a number of useful features and options. There are now four new&nbsp;sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Personalize: There are several customization options that require you to dig through the Preference Dialog to change. Now from this page you can easily change the color and icon themes, the user interface language and font size, and <span>OS</span>-specific&nbsp;settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create: This page shows your eight most recently opened images and allows you to quickly reopen them. There are also buttons to create a new image or load an existing one. As with other programs, you can set this screen to automatically appear when <span>GIMP</span> starts for immediate access to these&nbsp;features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute: We consolidated some of the many ways you can be involved in <span>GIMP</span>’s development on this page. There are direct links to report bugs, write code, assist with translation or donate&nbsp;financially.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release Notes: Originally these were shown on the lower half of the Welcome page. Now we have a full tab dedicated to them for easier&nbsp;reading.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-formats">File Formats<a href="#file-formats" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As in other releases, we have made improvements to existing file formats and added import and export support for some new&nbsp;ones.</p>
<h3 id="dds"><span>DDS</span><a href="#dds" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>A new contributor Stayd has been working with developer Jacob Boerema to make many improvements to the <span>DDS</span> plug-in. As a start, the import functions have been written to be simpler and easier to extend in the future. Some of the other additional updates&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Loading 16 and 32 bits per channel <span>RGBA</span> <span>DDS</span> images is now&nbsp;possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.mvps.org/directx/articles/catmull/">Catmull-Rom</a> cubic filter has been added for mipmap generation, and all mipmap generation calculations are performed at 32-bit&nbsp;precision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>DDS</span> images in the <span>R8G8</span>, R16, and <span>R16G16</span> formats can now be loaded as&nbsp;well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An option to flip <span>DDS</span> images vertical on import was added to mirror the existing export option, as some game images store their data this&nbsp;way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gif"><span>GIF</span><a href="#gif" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the past, overwriting a <span>GIF</span> rather than exporting would always convert it into a single frame image. Now we check to see if the <span>GIF</span> is an animation on load, so it will stay that way when&nbsp;overwritten.</p>
<h3 id="heif-and-jpeg-xl"><span>HEIF</span> and <span>JPEG</span>-<span>XL</span><a href="#heif-and-jpeg-xl" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Both plug-ins now use their respective libraries (<a href="https://github.com/strukturag/libheif">libheif</a> and <a href="https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl">libjxl</a>) to load metadata. As a result, we have removed our custom code to interpret the image orientation and rely on the information supplied from the library&nbsp;instead.</p>
<h3 id="openexr">OpenEXR<a href="#openexr" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>OpenEXR allows for channels to have custom names besides the color type. In these cases we now treat any single channel image with an unconventional name as grayscale. On import, we also display a notification so that users are aware of the&nbsp;conversion.</p>
<h3 id="pdf"><span>PDF</span><a href="#pdf" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The “Layers as Pages” export option now works even if there is only a single layer group. Previously this option was not available, as the plug-in only checked if there was more than one “layer” without considering if it was a layer group with multiple&nbsp;sub-layers.</p>
<h3 id="png"><span>PNG</span><a href="#png" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Safe-to-copy <span>PNG</span> chunks are now preserved on import and included in the exported image. Additionally, an often-reported issue with exporting transparent indexed PNGs has been fixed. Now the exported indexed colors should be displayed&nbsp;correctly.</p>
<h3 id="psd"><span>PSD</span><a href="#psd" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Jacob Boerema continued his work to improve the <span>PSD</span> plug-in. In addition to bug fixes such as correcting the layer order on import, he also clarified the export warning on layer mode compatibility between <span>GIMP</span> and&nbsp;Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="psp"><span>PSP</span><a href="#psp" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Paintshop Pro plug-in now supports importing more features from the project file, such as the <span>ICC</span> color profile, guides, grids, and the active selection from when the file was saved. The <span>ZDI</span>-<span>CAN</span>-22096 and <span>ZDI</span>-<span>CAN</span>-22097 security vulnerabilities were also patched in this&nbsp;release.</p>
<h3 id="new-image-format-supports-farbfeld-esm-software-pix-hej2">New image format supports: Farbfeld, Esm Software <span>PIX</span>, <span>HEJ2</span><a href="#new-image-format-supports-farbfeld-esm-software-pix-hej2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>We recently added import and export support for <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/farbfeld/">Farbfeld</a>, an sRGB image format intended to be easy to parse, pipe, and compress&nbsp;externally.</p>
<p>We also added import only support for the following new file&nbsp;formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Esm_Software_PIX">Esm Software <span>PIX</span></a>: A modified <span>JPEG</span> format used exclusively by the Esm Software company to store their customized images. This was implemented in response to a <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/10058">bug report</a> that confused this format with our existing <a href="http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/Alias_PIX">Alias <span>PIX</span></a> image&nbsp;support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format#JPEG_compression_formats_in_HEIF_files"><span>HEJ2</span></a>: An addition to our existing <span>HEIF</span> plug-in by contributor Daniel Novomeský which allows importing <span>JPEG</span> 2000 compressed&nbsp;images.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-palette-format-support-swatchbooker">New palette format support: Swatchbooker<a href="#new-palette-format-support-swatchbooker" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.selapa.net/swatchbooker/">Swatchbooker</a> is a free/libre open source software that creates and converts color palettes in a variety of formats. While the software itself has not been updated in many years, its custom palette format .sbz is the most comprehensive of all the ones we currently support. Among its many features are allowing multiple color model definitions per palette entry, localizable names and descriptions, and support for per-entry <span>ICC</span> color&nbsp;profiles. </p>
<p>While working on our import support, we were able to contribute information that led to <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=474583">a bug fix</a> in Krita’s support for Swatchbooker.  It’s always great when projects can work together and help each&nbsp;other!</p>
<h2 id="wayland-tablet-pad-interactions">Wayland Tablet Pad Interactions<a href="#wayland-tablet-pad-interactions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Long-time <span>GNOME</span> contributor Carlos Garnacho added support for interacting with <span>GIMP</span> via tablet pads. When a tablet is plugged in, you can now assign different actions to the tablet controls via the “Input Device” dialog under the Edit&nbsp;menu.</p>
<p>This work also involved <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/merge_requests/6095">porting features</a> to <span>GTK</span> 3, the <span>GUI</span> framework that <span>GIMP</span> is built on. Note that this feature is currently only supported on&nbsp;Wayland.</p>
<h2 id="api-updates"><span>API</span> Updates<a href="#api-updates" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Application Programming Interface, for plug-in makers, is steadily being
reworked as part of the <span>GIMP</span> 3 overhaul. Part of it is that when colors are
involved, we are moving the <span>API</span> to use <code>GeglColor</code> as part of the more general
<a href="#color-space-invasion">Space Invasion project</a>. Yet it’s only a small part of
the whole <span>API</span>&nbsp;improvements.</p>
<p>We are also moving towards more classes to represent the various resources
managed by <span>GIMP</span> (brushes, fonts, patterns, etc.) instead of only representing
these by names (which was a historical limitation whereas it is absolutely
possible for 2 resource makers to choose the same name and the fact is that we
see such cases in the wild — for instance 2 fonts independently created may have
the same&nbsp;name).</p>
<p>Another big move is replacing the <code>GimpValueArray</code> representing the ordered
arguments of a plug-in procedure by a <code>GimpProcedureConfig</code> which contains
arguments by name instead of by order. This allows much more semantic usage of
plug-in procedures (especially when they have long list of arguments) but also
will make it easier to enhance plug-ins in the future, with new or reordered
arguments without creating new procedures because the order and number arguments
matter a lot less. It means that adding new arguments in the future won’t break
existing scripts depending on past versions of these plug-ins anymore (plug-in
writers will still have to choose appropriate defaults for the new arguments in
order for this to be true, of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>In parallel, we continue to improve the ability of automatic <span>GUI</span> creation given
to plug-ins, making creating dialogs more easy than ever. This includes (among
many other enhancements) a new type of procedure argument named <code>GimpChoice</code>
which is a string list of choices which can be displayed to creators as
drop-down list widgets in your plug-in&nbsp;dialog.</p>
<p>We are planning to write and release tutorial for plug-in writers in the
<a href="https://developer.gimp.org/resource/">Resource Development</a> section of our
<a href="https://developer.gimp.org/">developer website</a> in the same time as <span>GIMP</span> 3
release, or not long&nbsp;after.</p>
<h2 id="gegl-and-babl"><span>GEGL</span> and babl<a href="#gegl-and-babl" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This release of <span>GIMP</span> is accompanied by new releases of <a href="https://gegl.org/"><span>GEGL</span></a> and <a href="https://gegl.org/babl/">babl</a>, both of which assist with the color space invasion&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>babl 0.1.108 brings a new <code>babl_space_is_rgb</code> function to help us directly confirm a color space is <span>RGB</span> (rather than doing multiple tests to see if it’s not <span>CMYK</span> or grayscale). There were also several improvements to the build process and to the babl command-line interface&nbsp;tool.</p>
<p><span>GEGL</span> 0.4.48 provides several updates to the <code>GeglColor</code> object which now supports much of <span>GIMP</span>’s color operation. Specific improvements include being able to directly get and set <span>CMYK</span> color values, as well as assigning the color space when setting <span>RGB</span>(A)&nbsp;colors.</p>
<p>A crash in the existing <code>gegl:voroni</code> filter was fixed, and a long-standing bug with the <code>gegl:dropshadow</code> filter which prevented the effect from shrinking was corrected&nbsp;too. </p>
<p>Last but not least, a new <code>gegl:shuffle-search</code> filter was added to the workshop. It shuffles neighboring pixels to create a more optimized dithering&nbsp;effect.</p>

<p>Let’s not forget to thank all the people who help us triaging in Gitlab, report
bugs and discuss possible improvements with us.
Our community is deeply thankful as well to the internet warriors who manage our
various <a href="https://www.gimp.org/discuss.html">discussion channels</a> or social
network accounts such as Ville Pätsi, Liam Quin, Michael Schumacher and&nbsp;Sevenix!</p>
<p><em>Note: considering the number of parts in <span>GIMP</span> and around, and how we

<h2 id="team-news-and-release-process">Team news and release process<a href="#team-news-and-release-process" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Access rights to the <code>git</code> repository were recently given to Bruno Lopes (who has been very active improving our build process and Windows&nbsp;packaging).</p>
<p>Several long term or recent developers or packagers who started to contribute to
the new developer website were also given access to the associated <code>git</code>
repository.</p>
<p>More contributors are now actively participating to testing releases and
packaging, and this is the first news for years which Jehan has not written
nearly entirely! Thanks a lot to Alx Sa (a.k.a. Nikc or CmykStudent) for taking
up on collaborative news&nbsp;writing!</p>
<p>Clearly we are consolidating day after day a solid core team of contributors and
this shows in our release process having more and more feedback at each&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>We are also particularly happy and proud that the 4 GSoC projects we had, since
we started again subscribing to this mentoring program, were all successful and
ended up being merged to the main code branch within half a year at most after
the internship&nbsp;end.</p>

<p>Since our <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2023/11/07/gimp-2-10-36-released/">last
news</a>, a new
<a href="https://www.gimp.org/donating/sponsors.html#official-mirrors">mirror</a> has been
contributed to <span>GIMP</span>&nbsp;by:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sahil Dhiman</em>, in Nürnberg, Germany, as a personal&nbsp;project.</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings us to a total of 46 mirrors all over the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>Mirrors are important as they help the project by sharing the load for dozens of
thousands of daily downloads. Moreover by having mirrors spread across the
globe, we ensure that everyone can have fast download access to <span>GIMP</span>.</p>
<h3 id="gimp-on-windowsarm"><span>GIMP</span> on Windows/<span>ARM</span><a href="#gimp-on-windowsarm" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since our <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2023/08/13/experimental-windows-arm-installer/">news for an experimental build on Windows for <span>ARM</span> 64-bit
architecture</a>,
we received help from Hernan Martinez, well known contributor in the <span>MSYS2</span>
project, who hosted our first ever <span>CI</span> runner for Windows on Aarch64
architecture. Though this was only a temporary setup (literally a build machine
in someone’s living room) until we get a more stable situation, we are extremely
thankful to Hernan who helped us make our second step on this platform (the
first step was done by Jernej, who made our first experimental installer), make
sure our automatic build process worked there and&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Since then, we got the stabler situation: Arm Ltd. themselves stepped up and
contributed officially 3 runners for our Continuous Integration process in
Gitlab! Arm Ltd. also sponsored a Windows devkit to one of our&nbsp;developers.</p>
<p>While we still do consider this build experimental, because of lack of testing
and because only 2 contributors have a machine able to run it right now, the
biggest blocker got removed and we are happy to announce that our universal
Windows installer for <span>GIMP</span> 2.99.18 contains <span>GIMP</span> for all 3 platforms (x86 32 and
64-bit, and now <span>ARM</span>&nbsp;64-bit)!</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we have now entered a feature freeze, our focus has shifted to bug-fixing, clean-up, and preparing for the first 3.0 release&nbsp;candidate.</p>
<p>We indeed think that this should be the last development release since no new
feature will be introduced from now on, at least <span>GUI</span> features (the <span>API</span> is still
evolving until the first release candidate). So what you see now is basically
what you should get in <span>GIMP</span> 3.0.0,&nbsp;feature-wise.</p>
<p>This is why we released this version even though we know it is quite unstable.
Now is the time for last minute comments! Also it’s the moment to report and fix
bugs like there is no tomorrow. We hope to be able to deliver a <abbr title="Release Candidate"><span>RC</span></abbr>1 soon and it should be as bugless as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Our current expectation is to be able to release <span>GIMP</span> for the upcoming <a href="https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2024/">Libre
Graphics Meeting</a> in May 9-12. To be
fair, this is not an easy goal and therefore we are not sure if we can make it.
What is sure is that even if we did not manage this on time, it should not
happen too long after.
In particular we won’t release just because we set a <em>deadline</em>. We want to
provide the best experience, which means that if we discover last minute blocker
bugs, we will delay the release until they are&nbsp;fixed.</p>
<p>Don’t forget you can <a href="https://www.gimp.org/donating/">donate and personally fund <span>GIMP</span>
developers</a>, as a way to give back and
<strong>accelerate the development of <span>GIMP</span></strong>.
Community commitment helps the project to grow stronger!&nbsp;💪🥳</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="A Peek at Intel’s Future Foundry Tech" data-elid="2667324813" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-18a" data-authors="Samuel K. Moore" data-page-title="A Peek at Intel’s Future Foundry Tech - IEEE Spectrum"><p><strong>In an exclusive interview</strong> ahead of <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ifs-direct-connect.html" target="_blank">an invite-only event today</a> in San Jose, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> outlined new chip technologies it will offer its foundry customers by sharing a glimpse into its future data-center processors. The advances include more dense logic and a 16-fold increase in the connectivity within <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-3d-stacking-intel-graphcore" target="_self">3D-stacked</a> chips, and they will be among the first top-end technologies the company has ever shared with chip architects from other companies.  </p><p>The new technologies will arrive at the culmination of a years-long transformation for Intel. The processor maker is moving from being a company that produces only its own chips to becoming a foundry, making chips for others and considering its own product teams as just another customer. The San Jose event, IFS Direct Connect, is meant as a sort of coming-out party for the new business model. </p><p>Internally, Intel plans to use the combination of technologies in a server CPU code-named Clearwater Forest. The company considers the product, a system-on-a-chip with hundreds of billions of transistors, an example of what other customers of its foundry business will be able to achieve. </p><p>“Our objective is to get the compute to the best performance per watt we can achieve” from Clearwater Forest, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-fetzer-1856664/" target="_blank">Eric Fetzer,</a> director of data center technology and pathfinding at Intel. That means using the company’s most advanced fabrication technology available, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-says-its-manufacturing-tech-will-lead-the-world-by-2025" target="_self">Intel 18A</a>. </p><p>3D stacking “improves the latency between compute and memory by shortening the hops, while at the same time enabling a larger cache”  <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranade/" target="_blank">—Pushkar Ranade</a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranade/"></a></strong></p><p>“However, if we apply that technology throughout the entire system, you run into other potential problems,” he added. “Certain parts of the system don’t necessarily scale as well as others. Logic typically scales generation to generation very well with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/moore-s-law" target="_self">Moore’s Law</a>.” But other features do not. SRAM, a CPU’s cache memory, has been lagging logic, for example. And the I/O circuits that connect a processor to the rest of a computer are even further behind. </p><p>Faced with these realities, as all makers of leading-edge processors are now, Intel broke Clearwater Forest’s system down into its core functions, chose the best-fit technology to build each, and stitched them back together using a suite of new technical tricks. The result is a CPU architecture capable of scaling to as many as 300 billion transistors. </p><p>In Clearwater Forest, billions of transistors are divided among three different types of silicon ICs, called dies or chiplets, interconnected and packaged together. The heart of the system is as many as 12 processor-core chiplets built using the Intel 18A process. These chiplets are 3D-stacked atop three “base dies” built using Intel 3, the process that makes compute cores for the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-unveils-future-generation-xeon.html#gs.4xfdw0" target="_blank">Sierra Forest CPU</a>, due out this year. Housed on the base die will be the CPU’s main cache memory, voltage regulators, and internal network. “The stacking improves the latency between compute and memory by shortening the hops, while at the same time enabling a larger cache,” says senior principal engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranade/" target="_blank">Pushkar Ranade</a>.  </p><p>Finally, the CPU’s I/O system will be on two dies built using Intel 7, which in 2025 will be trailing the company’s most advanced process by a full four generations. In fact, the chiplets are basically the same as those going into the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-unveils-future-generation-xeon.html#gs.4s66fg" target="_blank">Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids</a> CPUs, lessening the development expense.  </p><p>Here’s a look at the new technologies involved and what they offer: </p><h2>3D Hybrid Bonding </h2><p><img alt="3D rendering of stacks of slabs with silver balls between them. The balls are larger at the bottom and smaller at the top." data-rm-shortcode-id="31d9eeb623fc473f7c2d759cae93d31a" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-stacks-of-slabs-with-silver-balls-between-them-the-balls-are-larger-at-the-bottom-and-smaller-at-the-top.jpg?id=51514685&amp;width=980" height="930" id="4de51" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-stacks-of-slabs-with-silver-balls-between-them-the-balls-are-larger-at-the-bottom-and-smaller-at-the-top.jpg?id=51514685&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">3D hybrid bonding links compute dies to base dies.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>Intel’s current chip-stacking interconnect technology, Foveros, links one die to another using a vastly scaled-down version of how dies have long been connected to their packages: tiny “microbumps” of solder that are briefly melted to join the chips. This lets today’s version of Foveros, which is used in the Meteor Lake CPU, make one connection roughly every 36 micrometers. Clearwater Forest will use new technology, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqumhx7CgzQ" target="_blank">Foveros Direct</a> 3D, which departs from solder-based methods to bring a whopping 16-fold increase in the density of 3D connections. </p><p>Called “hybrid bonding,” it’s analogous to welding together the copper pads at the face of two chips. These pads are slightly recessed and surround by insulator. The insulator on one chip affixes to the other when they are pressed together. Then the stacked chips are heated, causing the copper to expand across the gap and bind together to form a permanent link. Competitor TSMC uses a version of hybrid bonding in certain <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amd">AMD</a> CPUs to connect extra cache memory to processor-core chiplets and, in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-mi300" target="_self">AMD’s newest GPU</a>, to link compute chiplets to the system’s base die. </p><p>“The hybrid bond interconnects enable a substantial increase in density” of connections, says Fetzer. “That density is very important for the server market, particularly because the density drives a very low picojoule-per-bit communication.” The energy involved in data crossing from one silicon die to another can easily consume a big chunk of a product’s power budget if the per-bit energy cost is too high. Foveros Direct 3D brings that cost down below 0.05 picojoules per bit, which puts it on the same scale as the energy needed to move bits around <em>within</em> a silicon die. </p><p>A lot of that energy savings comes from the data traversing less copper. Say you wanted to connect a 512-wire bus on one die to the same-size bus on another so the two dies can share a coherent set of information. On each chip, these buses might be as narrow as 10–20 wires per micrometer. To get that from one die to the other using today’s 36-micrometer-pitch microbump tech would mean scattering those signals across several hundred square micrometers of silicon on one side and then gathering them across the same area on the other. Charging up all that extra copper and solder “quickly becomes both a latency and a large power problem,” says Fetzer. Hybrid bonding, in contrast, could do the bus-to-bus connection in the same area that a few microbumps would occupy. </p><p>As great as those benefits might be, making the switch to hybrid bonding isn’t easy. To forge hybrid bonds requires linking an already-diced silicon die to one that’s still attached to its wafer. Aligning all the connections properly means the chip must be diced to much greater tolerances than is needed for microbump technologies. Repair and recovery, too, require different technologies. Even the predominant way connections fail is different, says Fetzer. With microbumps, you are more likely to get a short from one bit of solder connecting to a neighbor. But with hybrid bonding, the danger is defects that lead to open connections. </p><h2>Backside power  </h2><p>One of the main distinctions the company is bringing to chipmaking this year with its Intel 20A process, the one that will precede Intel 18A, is <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-gen-chips-will-be-powered-from-below" target="_self">backside power delivery</a>. In processors today, all interconnects, whether they’re carrying power or data, are constructed on the “front side” of the chip, above the silicon substrate. Foveros and other 3D-chip-stacking tech require through-silicon vias, interconnects that drill down through the silicon to make connections from the other side. But back-side power delivery goes much further. It puts all of the power interconnects beneath the silicon, essentially sandwiching the layer containing the transistors between two sets of interconnects.  </p><p><img alt="A dark grey tower with jagged copper portions snaking up it." data-rm-shortcode-id="0124e5e0a6234c9157a5ee8b1a45af98" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-dark-grey-tower-with-jagged-copper-portions-snaking-up-it.jpg?id=51514219&amp;width=980" height="930" id="50b72" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-dark-grey-tower-with-jagged-copper-portions-snaking-up-it.jpg?id=51514219&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">PowerVia puts the silicon’s power supply network below, leaving more room for data-carrying interconnects above.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>This arrangement makes a difference because power interconnects and data interconnects require different features. Power interconnects need to be wide to reduce resistance, while data interconnects should be narrow so they can be densely packed. Intel is set to be the first chipmaker to introduce back-side power delivery in a commercial chip, later this year with the release of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-20a" target="_self">Arrow Lake CPU</a>. Data released last summer by Intel showed that back-side power alone delivered a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/backside-power-delivery" target="_self">6 percent performance boost</a>. </p><p>The Intel 18A process technology’s back-side-power-delivery network technology will be fundamentally the same as what’s found in Intel 20A chips. However, it’s being used to greater advantage in Clearwater Forest. The upcoming CPU includes what’s called an “on-die voltage regulator” within the base die. Having the voltage regulation close to the logic it drives means the logic can run faster. The shorter distances let the regulator respond to changes in the demand for current more quickly, while consuming less power. </p><p>Because the logic dies use back-side power delivery, the resistance of the connection between the voltage regulator and the dies logic is that much lower. “The power via technology along with the Foveros stacking gives us a really efficient way to hook it up,” says Fetzer. </p><h2>RibbonFET, the next generation </h2><p>In addition to back-side power, the chipmaker is switching to a different <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a> architecture with the Intel 20A process: RibbonFET. A form of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-nanosheet-transistor-is-the-next-and-maybe-last-step-in-moores-law" target="_self">nanosheet, or gate-all-around, transistor</a>, RibbonFET replaces the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law" target="_self">FinFET</a>, CMOS’s workhorse transistor since 2011. With Intel 18A, Clearwater Forest’s logic dies will be made with a second generation of RibbonFET process. While the devices themselves aren’t very different from the ones that will emerge from Intel 20A, there’s more flexibility to the design of the devices, says Fetzer. </p><p><img alt="Three gold ribbons pass through a dark grey block." data-rm-shortcode-id="eaadde0b79b95338c69ef593c6e3e494" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-gold-ribbons-pass-through-a-dark-grey-block.jpg?id=51514179&amp;width=980" height="930" id="67a80" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-gold-ribbons-pass-through-a-dark-grey-block.jpg?id=51514179&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">RibbonFET is Intel’s take on nanowire transistors.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>“There’s a broader array of devices to support various foundry applications beyond just what was needed to enable a high-performance CPU,” which was what the Intel 20A process was designed for, he says.  </p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="Two vertical towers of dark grey blocks embedded in grainy light grey material." data-rm-shortcode-id="f607f773ae9ef386e914996e6d2d8089" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-vertical-towers-of-dark-grey-blocks-embedded-in-grainy-light-grey-material.jpg?id=51514235&amp;width=980" height="504" id="9f1a0" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-vertical-towers-of-dark-grey-blocks-embedded-in-grainy-light-grey-material.jpg?id=51514235&amp;width=980" width="595"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">RibbonFET’s nanowires can have different widths depending on the needs of a logic cell.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>Some of that variation stems from a degree of flexibility that was lost in the FinFET era. Before FinFETs arrived, transistors in the same process could be made in a range of widths, allowing a more-or-less continuous trade-off between performance—which came with higher current—and efficiency—which required better control over leakage current. Because the main part of a FinFET is a vertical silicon fin of a defined height and width, that trade-off now had to take the form of how many fins a device had. So, with two fins you could double current, but there was no way to increase it by 25 or 50 percent. </p><p>With nanosheet devices, the ability to vary transistor widths is back. “RibbonFET technology enables different sizes of ribbon within the same technology base,” says Fetzer. “When we go from Intel 20A to Intel 18A, we offer more flexibility in transistor sizing.” </p><p>That flexibility means that standard cells, basic logic blocks designers can use to build their systems, can contain transistors with different properties. And that enabled Intel to develop an “enhanced library” that includes standard cells that are smaller, better performing, or more efficient than those of the Intel 20A process. </p><h2>2nd generation EMIB<sup></sup><sup></sup></h2><p>In Clearwater Forest, the dies that handle input and output connect horizontally to the base dies—the ones with the cache memory and network—using the second generation of Intel’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-view-of-the-chiplet-revolution" target="_self">EMIB</a>. EMIB is a small piece of silicon containing a dense set of interconnects and microbumps designed to connect one die to another in the same plane. The silicon is embedded in the package itself to form a bridge between dies. </p><p><img alt="3D rendering of stacks of slabs with silver balls between them. The balls are larger at the bottom and smaller at the top." data-rm-shortcode-id="9c18ec8e445e6461058bab4b16ef4278" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-stacks-of-slabs-with-silver-balls-between-them-the-balls-are-larger-at-the-bottom-and-smaller-at-the-top.jpg?id=51514665&amp;width=980" height="930" id="cccac" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-stacks-of-slabs-with-silver-balls-between-them-the-balls-are-larger-at-the-bottom-and-smaller-at-the-top.jpg?id=51514665&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Dense 2D connections are formed by a small sliver of silicon called EMIB, which is embedded in the package substrate.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>The technology has been in commercial use in Intel CPUs since Sapphire Rapids was released in 2023. It’s meant as a less costly alternative to putting all the dies on a silicon interposer, a slice of silicon patterned with interconnects that is large enough for all of the system’s dies to sit on. Apart from the cost of the material, sili<sup></sup>con interposers can be expensive to build, because they are usually several times larger than what standard silicon processes are designed to make. </p><p>The second generation of EMIB debuts this year with the Granite Rapids CPU, and it involves shrinking the pitch of microbump connections from 55 micrometers to 45 micrometers as well as boosting the density of the wires. The main challenge with such connections is that the package and the silicon expand at different rates when they heat up. This phenomenon could lead to warpage that breaks connections. </p><p>What’s more, in the case of Clearwater Forest “there were also some unique challenges, because we’re connecting EMIB on a regular die to EMIB on a Foveros Direct 3D base die and a stack,” says Fetzer. This situation, recently rechristened EMIB 3.5 technology (formerly called co-EMIB), requires special steps to ensure that the stresses and strains involved are compatible with the silicon in the Foveros stack, which is thinner than ordinary chips, he says. </p><p>For more, see <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/2024-02/intel-tech-clearwater-wp.pdf" target="_blank">Intel’s whitepaper</a> on their foundry tech. <br></p></div></div>]]></description>

But it’s missing the mark here.”</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Gemini results with AI images of “an American woman,” including two white-looking women." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/376x288/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/384x294/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/415x318/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/480x367/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/540x413/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/640x490/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/750x574/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/828x633/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/1080x826/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/1200x918/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/1440x1102/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/1920x1469/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/2048x1567/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/2400x1836/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1524x1166/2400x1836/filters:focal(762x583:763x584):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297985/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.54.00_PM.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>My Gemini results for “generate a picture of an American woman,” one of the prompts that set off the debate of the past few days.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Google began offering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24057438/bard-gemini-imagen-google-ai-image-generation">image generation</a> through its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065553/google-gemini-ios-android-app-duet-bard">Gemini (formerly Bard)</a> AI platform earlier this month, matching the offerings of competitors like OpenAI.

Earlier this week, a former Google employee posted on X that it’s “embarrassingly hard to get Google Gemini to acknowledge that white people exist,” showing a series of queries like “generate a picture of a Swedish woman” or “generate a picture of an American woman.” The results appeared to overwhelmingly or exclusively show AI-generated people of color. (Of course, all the places he listed do have women of color living in them, and none of the AI-generated women exist in any country.) The criticism was taken up by right-wing accounts that requested images of historical groups or figures like the Founding Fathers and purportedly got overwhelmingly non-white AI-generated people as results. Some of these accounts positioned Google’s results as part of a conspiracy to avoid depicting white people, and at least one used a coded antisemitic reference to place the blame.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Gemini results for “a German soldier from 1943” featuring illustrations of what appear to be a white man, a Black man, and an Asian woman." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/376x836/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/384x853/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/415x922/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/480x1067/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/540x1200/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/640x1422/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/750x1667/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/828x1840/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/1080x2400/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/1200x2667/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/1440x3200/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/1920x4267/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/2048x4551/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/2400x5333/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1080x2400/2400x5333/filters:focal(540x1200:541x1201):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25298169/1000001251.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>Gemini wouldn’t produce an image of a 1943 soldier on desktop for me, but it offered this set of illustrations to a colleague.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Google didn’t reference specific images that it felt were errors; in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, it reiterated the contents of its post on X. But it’s plausible that Gemini has made an overall attempt to boost diversity because of a chronic lack<em> </em>of it in generative AI. Image generators are trained on large corpuses of pictures and written captions to produce the “best” fit for a given prompt, which means they’re often prone to amplifying stereotypes. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-generated-images-bias-racism-sexism-stereotypes/">A <em>Washington Post</em> investigation</a> last year found that prompts like “a productive person” resulted in pictures of entirely white and almost entirely male figures, while a prompt for “a person at social services” uniformly produced what looked like people of color. It’s a continuation of trends that have appeared in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/3/17168256/google-racism-algorithms-technology">search engines</a> and other software systems.</p><p>Some of the accounts that criticized Google defended its core goals. “It’s a good thing to portray diversity ** in certain cases **,” <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLu0x/status/1760170103474356519">noted one</a> person who posted the image of racially diverse 1940s German soldiers. “The stupid move here is Gemini isn’t doing it in a nuanced way.” And while entirely white-dominated results for something like “a 1943 German soldier” would<em> </em>make historical sense, that’s much less true for prompts like “an American woman,” where the question is how to represent a diverse real-life group in a small batch of made-up portraits.</p><p>For now, Gemini appears to be simply refusing some image generation tasks. It wouldn’t generate an image of Vikings for one <em>Verge</em> reporter, although I was able to get a response. On desktop, it resolutely refused to give me images of German soldiers or officials from Germany’s Nazi period or to offer an image of “an American president from the 1800s.”</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A picture of Gemini results promising “some images featuring diverse US senators from the 1800s,” featuring what appear to be three women of color and an Asian American man." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/376x263/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/384x269/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/415x291/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/480x336/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/540x378/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/640x448/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/750x525/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/828x580/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/1080x756/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/1200x840/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/1440x1008/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/1920x1344/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/2048x1434/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/2400x1681/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1668x1168/2400x1681/filters:focal(834x584:835x585):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297980/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_3.10.17_PM.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>Gemini’s results for the prompt “generate a picture of a US senator from the 1800s.”</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But some historical requests still do end up factually misrepresenting the past.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Nielsen today <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2024/colder-weather-and-nfl-playoffs-drive-increased-tv-usage-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its January report on viewing usage across linear TV and streaming, which revealed that YouTube is once again the overall top streaming service in the U.S., with 8.6% of viewing on television screens. Netflix, meanwhile, saw 7.9% of TV usage. The new data points to YouTube’s dominance in the TV streaming arena and marks 12 consecutive months of the platform being in the top spot.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-number-one-streamer-nielsen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> celebrating the achievement, the Google-owned streaming service announced that viewers now watch a daily average of over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on their televisions, which could indicate that there’s a preference for user-generated videos among U.S. consumers rather than traditional TV shows. <a href="https://www.inmobi.com/company/press/gen-z-significantly-prefers-user-generated-content-older-millennials-lean-toward-streaming-inmobi-insights-survey-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sixty-one percent</a> of Gen Z reported that they favor user-generated content over other content formats.</p>
<p>Plus, creators are seeing an increase in viewership come from TVs. According to the company, the number of top YouTubers that receive the most watch time on TVs has sky-rocketed by more than 400%. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hopescope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HopeScope</a>, a creator who reviews viral products, notably saw a 172% jump in TV watch time in 2023. This could be good news for family-friendly YouTubers who have to compete with TikTok for kids’ attention. Children ages 4 through 18 spent a global average of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/kids-spent-60-more-time-on-tiktok-than-youtube-last-year-20-tried-openais-chatgpt/">112 minutes daily</a> on TikTok in 2023, per a recent study.</p>
<p>Although YouTube may have precedence in the living room, TikTok continues to dominate on mobile devices. The short-form video app recently began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/tiktok-testing-30-minute-uploads-inch-into-youtubes-territory/">testing</a> the ability for TikTokers to upload 30-minute videos, which could step on YouTube’s toes. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/tiktok-launches-a-reimagined-app-for-the-apple-vision-pro/">TikTok</a> also entered the spatial reality space, launching a native app on the Apple Vision Pro. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/19/youtube-and-other-apps-missing-from-apple-vision-pro-launch/">YouTube</a> decided to not build a dedicated app for the device.</p>
<p>YouTube has reached a few other milestones in recent months, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/google-says-youtube-now-has-over-100-million-subscribers/">100 million users</a> who pay for YouTube Music and YouTube Premium. Additionally, <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-letter-from-neal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube TV</a> now has more than 8 million subscribers and YouTube Shorts recently achieved over 70 billion daily views.</p>

						<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<p><span>+ <a href="http://techstars.com/">Techstars</a> was once one of the world’s leading accelerator programs, but has </span><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2bstq9vxi7ne4vl8tx43k/portfolio/y-combinator-dominates-startup-accelerator-programs-for-investment-value"><span>steadily been eclipsed</span></a><span> by Y combinator.</span></p>
<p><span>+ Techstars recently announced a string of executive departures and program closures – including termination of the Seattle program, one of its oldest and most successful.</span></p>
<p><span>+ Despite similar beginnings, Techstars chose a different strategic path than Y combinator – those changes compounded over time to strengthen YC and weaken Techstars.</span></p>
<p><span>+ This post offers an insiders’ view of some of the key strategic decisions that led to Techstars’ decline.</span></p>
<p><span>————–</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://techstars.com/">Techstars</a> is – or was – one of the world’s best startup accelerator programs. Founded in Boulder not long after Paul Graham ran his first cohort at Y combinator, Techstars eventually operated dozens of programs around the world, some under the Techstars brand, but over time and increasingly, in cooperation with corporate partners.</span></p>
<p><span>We at </span><span>Founders’ Co-op</span><span> know the Techstars system well: our partnership created the Techstars Seattle program back in 2010 and ran it for a decade; we also helped to create and run two corporate Techstars programs: an early and short-lived program in support of Microsoft’s Azure ecosystem, and another in cooperation with Amazon, focused on the Alexa developer community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We were saddened, but not completely surprised, by the recent string of bad news coming from Techstars’ Boulder headquarters. Headcount reductions and executive departures aren’t exactly news as we unwind 15 years of zero interest rates and the many asset bubbles those policies helped to inflate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But we were caught off guard by the decision, announced just today, to cancel the flagship Seattle Techstars program. Not just because we created and led it for many years, but because Techstars Seattle is also the source of many of Techstars’ most successful and celebrated successes; Seattle program alumni like </span><a href="http://remitly.com/"><span>Remitly</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.outreach.io/"><span>Outreach</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.flyzipline.com/"><span>Zipline</span></a><span> are regularly held up as evidence that Techstars can produce billion-dollar outcomes for both founders and investors, something that has happened less and less often in recent years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seattle is also the only Techstars city that is home to two of the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/22/business/magnificent-seven-stocks-tech.html"><span>Magnificent Seven</span></a><span>, the tech bellwethers that continue to drive the lion’s share of public company value creation. Apart from Seattle-based Amazon and Microsoft, all the rest (Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla) are based in the Bay Area. These companies are global magnets for technical talent eager to work on the most advanced and highest-impact technology products in the world. Not coincidentally, they also serve as training grounds for some of the world’s most successful startup founders.</span></p>
<p><span>Although we haven’t been on the inside at Techstars for several years, we grew up with the program and have watched with growing dismay as it drifted away from its original focus on founders. This post is an attempt to unpack the changes we observed both during and after our time with Techstars, to draw out potentially useful lessons about how things might have gone differently.</span></p>
<p><span>———</span></p>
<p><b>In the Beginning: Champions of the Local Startup Ecosystem</b></p>
<p><span>Techstars launched its first program in Boulder in 2007. Just two years later, in 2009, we worked out a deal to create the Techstars Seattle program, with our first program running in 2010.</span></p>
<p><span>From the beginning, we were deeply committed to Techstars’ “give first” ethos and mentorship-driven approach to startup investing. We also had a strong incentive to make our program successful: despite the shared branding and core values, each Techstars program was funded and owned by the mentor and investor community in the city in which it operated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As Managing Directors of Techstars Seattle, we raised a series of funds from mostly local LPs, including participation from some of our best-known local VC firms, as well as many of the mentors who worked with the founders during and after each program. In simple terms, the local LP community owned 70% of the fund economics, the Managing Director owned 20% and Techstars owned 10%; we also paid Techstars a $50K annual fee to support the program’s back-office operations.</span></p>
<p><span>This tight alignment of incentives and shared values among investors, mentors and program leadership in the Seattle ecosystem created a powerful flywheel effect, stitching together our previously disparate community of startup supporters and creating an open, legible way for high-performing founders from across the region to access the best that Seattle had to offer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The result was a series of exceptional Seattle program cohorts, including not just the “unicorn” outcomes listed above, but hundreds of millions of dollars in venture financings and liquidity events deep into the roster of participating teams, year after year. It’s fair to say that the Seattle startup community would not be where it is today without Techstars.</span></p>
<p><b>Compromising for Cash</b></p>
<p><span>When Y combinator moved from Boston to the Bay Area – without doubt the dominant market for venture backed tech innovation in the world – Techstars began to see itself as the “YC for everywhere else”. Rather than compete for the #1 market, Techstars made a virtue of supporting nascent startup ecosystems in the other major tech and financial hubs in the US, and eventually, around the world.</span></p>
<p><span>This was a fantastic strategy in terms of impact, raising the bar for startup excellence in key startup ecosystems and opening up access to the Venture Capital financing market to founders who couldn’t or didn’t want to relocate to the Bay Area. But it also created two big problems for Techstars as a business: cash flow and brand identity.</span></p>
<p><span>Even when run on a shoestring (as we did in the early days), running an accelerator costs money: not just the investment capital for the participating founders, but also rent for offices, stipends for program staff, and the hosting and event costs of an intensive three-month, face-to-face program with dozens of founders and hundreds of mentors. Supporting the growing roster of programs also required more administrative overhead to solve legal issues, track investments and support cross-program communications and learning.</span></p>
<p><span>Bottom line, Techstars needed cash. And since the program-based fund model didn’t provide it, Techstars started looking within the local ecosystems in which it operated.</span></p>
<p><span>It began with an effort to extract “sponsorship” dollars from local service providers: the lawyers, accountants, recruiters and PR firms that cater to startups. But for every sponsor who agreed to write a check, there were a dozen other vendors who were equally or more qualified to support the teams in the program. What did we owe our sponsors, and did that put us in conflict with our commitments to give founders the best possible advice, and to never waste their time?</span></p>
<p><span>The next logical step was to go up-market and look for financial “partners” among the many corporations struggling to keep up with the pace of technological innovation during the go-go ZIRP years. Techstars was attracting many of the world’s best founders, surely some of those founders would be interested in solving problems faced by these large corporations?</span></p>
<p><span>It’s not hard to see where this all leads: from a principled beginning, laser-focused on helping the world’s best founding teams achieve the best possible business and financial results, soon the Techstars system began to play host to mandatory, sponsor-led “education” sessions for participating teams. Next, entire accelerator programs were created on behalf of corporate partners, promising them access to cohorts of world-class founders eager to listen to their needs and use their APIs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Both ideas started with good intentions, with Techstars working hard to select values-aligned partners and set the right expectations, but halfway through a program and after a multi-million dollar investment, the tone would inevitably shift the moment the partner suggested they might not be getting their money’s worth.</span></p>
<p><b>Killing the Golden Goose</b></p>
<p><span>Organizations become what they’re staffed and led to do. As Techstars invested in centralized sales and support functions for its valuable and demanding corporate customers, the headquarters organization ballooned, driving additional needs for short-term revenue to fund the growing headcount. And the culture inevitably shifted, from a passionate commitment to founders and the entrepreneurial journey, to a system focused on generating cash from paying corporate customers, with the promise of “innovation” on their terms.</span></p>
<p><span>The final straw came when it became clear that many of the new programs and MDs were struggling to raise their own, local funds. In response, Boulder made the unilateral decision to pull that function away from all the local markets, making investment capital more readily available to new programs, while also allowing the central organization to capture the fee income on Assets Under Management (AUM) across the entire system.</span></p>
<p><span>This may have made sense from a corporate capitalization and cash flow perspective, but the net effect was to eviscerate the incentive system that had attracted high quality Managing Directors to run programs, and had bound together investors and mentors in each local market in the shared work of sourcing and supporting the highest-potential founding teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After this change, MDs still earned a portion of the returns from each program, but no longer had a mechanism to share program economics with their community via investment in the local fund. The autonomy and sense of ownership that attracted outstanding local entrepreneurs in the first generation of Managing Directors (many of whom now run their own funds) quickly devolved into a demanding but low-paying job, with a steadily-growing set of requirements from headquarters to carry water on behalf of the central organization.</span></p>
<p><b>Gradually, Then Suddenly</b></p>
<p><span>Brands and organizations decay slowly; it can be hard for outsiders to see the weakness until it’s readily apparent to all. But customers are smart, and all of Techstars’ customers eventually saw what was happening, and acted accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>The first to spot the weakness were startup founders. Their ambition and acute realism made them sensitive to the clear shift in Techstars’ priorities, away from serving founders and toward the “corporate innovation” business. With dozens of programs scattered around the globe, often in partnership with second-tier brands, and in locations with little to no native startup ecosystem, it was hard to say exactly what the Techstars brand stood for anymore, but it clearly wasn’t “helping entrepreneurs succeed”. While Techstars wanted founders to see Techstars as a single thing, smart founders realized that their outcome and ROI depended entirely on the MD and specific program they participated in.</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, Y combinator remained laser-focused on dominating the world’s #1 startup geography (the Bay Area) and delivering value for its core customer, the most exceptional founding teams in the world. As YC racked up highly visible startup success stories and sweetened their funding offer, Techstars struggled to keep pace. (YC suffered its own excesses at the height of the bubble, growing class sizes and drifting up into the growth investing business, but under the leadership of Garry Tan have acted quickly to refocus and rightsize in support of their core mission).</span></p>
<p><span>The next important group to spot the weakness in Techstars’ strategy was the investment community. Startup investing is a power-law business – a very few extraordinary success stories drive returns and cover the losses of the many failed attempts. As Techstars’ track record fell further and further behind YC, their investor sales pitch of “buying an index of the global startup ecosystem” fell flat. Even during the frothiest period of the ZIRP bubble they struggled to hit their fundraising targets, further weakening their capacity to support their growing overhead.</span></p>
<p><span>The last to spot the problem, but from Techstars’ perspective the most essential, were the corporate innovation groups who had provided most of the cash for Techstars’ rapid growth. Unsurprisingly, the world’s best founders don’t particularly care about the problems of any given corporation, and startup investors don’t care to babysit corporate execs or attempt to teach them the foreign ways of entrepreneurship. Churn among Techstars’ corporate customers started high and only accelerated, creating a “leaky bucket” problem for the company’s growth strategy. Add in a global pandemic, and then a rapid deflation of the global asset bubble, and the writing was on the wall: no matter what business Techstars’ corporate partners happened to be in, “innovation” quickly dropped in priority as soon as the startup threat receded and more urgent financial priorities beckoned.</span></p>
<p><span>Slowly, inevitably, Techstars’ bet on corporate customers at the expense of founders came home to roost.</span></p>
<p><b>Old Lessons, and Simple Ones</b></p>
<p><span>The story of Techstars’ rise and accelerating fall is neither unique nor surprising. When interest rates are too low for too long, capital flows toward riskier assets that offer the promise of higher returns. Technology startups can produce rapid growth and high margins at scale; investment intermediaries that offer access to these returns have an easier time raising capital during bubbles; the question becomes: what do they do with it once they have it?</span></p>
<p><span>As the YC example shows, Techstars had the opportunity to build one of the world’s top investing platforms for technical founders in every major tech hub outside the Bay Area. But in their rush to occupy that “everywhere else” market, Techstars cut strategic corners to generate near-term cash flow, creating a path-dependent trajectory to their current outcome. By making corporate funders, and not startup founders, their primary customer, Techstars built a centrally-controlled sales- and operations-driven culture that made startups the product, not the customer. As soon as the top tier of startup founders figured out that YC had their interests at heart in the way that Techstars once had, but no longer did, the game was over.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s hard to prove a counterfactual, but imagine that Techstars had stuck with its original model: a loose but values-aligned federation of career startup investors, each responsible for building the highest-performing investor and mentor community in their respective markets, but sharing information, best practices and back-office infrastructure. As it was in the beginning, 90% of the economics were sourced from, and returned to the local markets, but Techstars accumulated its 10% profit-sharing strip from each market, plus an overhead charge that allowed them to invest not in ever-growing sales and operations teams, but rather in high-quality software tooling and infrastructure that served the entire network.</span></p>
<p><span>This model wouldn’t have grown as quickly, and would have required much greater selectivity in the markets in which it operated. It would also have required more patience from the owners of the network itself, but would have been much more likely to serve their long-term goal of massive value creation over time.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ll never know the answer, but if YC serves as a fair proxy for the type of scaled impact and durable value creation that startup accelerators can create, Techstars offers an object lesson in the strategic cost of losing sight of your core customer in the relentless pursuit of growth. Techstars was and is an organization founded by great humans, and its current struggles are shared with many once-promising startups that flew too close to the sun in an era when wings were cheap.</span></p>

                <p>On February 20, 2024, an optimization to the user experience introduced a bug with how the model processes language.</p>

<p>LLMs generate responses by randomly sampling words based in part on probabilities. Their “language” consists of numbers that map to tokens.</p>

<p>In this case, the bug was in the step where the model chooses these numbers. Akin to being lost in translation, the model chose slightly wrong numbers, which produced word sequences that made no sense. More technically, inference kernels produced incorrect results when used in certain GPU configurations.</p>

<p>Upon identifying the cause of this incident, we rolled out a fix and confirmed that the incident was resolved.</p>

<p>Apple has reversed course and is now demanding a 30% cut of donations sent to teachers in the popular <a href="https://insighttimer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insight Timer meditation app</a>. The change apparently comes after Apple allowed the app to use its own Stripe-based in-app purchase system for over a year. </p>



<p>As detailed in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/in-a-reversal-apple-is-now-demanding-30-of-the-donations-to-meditation-app-insight-timers-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from TechCrunch</a>, Insight Timer’s allows it users to send “tips” to their favorite teachers and instructors. In its App Store Guidelines, Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specific rules about this</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apps may enable individual users to give a monetary gift to another individual without using in-app purchase, provided that (a) the gift is a completely optional choice by the giver, and (b) 100% of the funds go to the receiver of the gift. However, a gift that is connected to or associated at any point in time with receiving digital content or services must use in-app purchase.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since 2022, Insight Timer has used Stripe to power its platform that allows users to send those tips, therefore not paying a 30% commission to Apple. “Apple appeared to have blessed this use case, as the tech giant went on to approve 47 more updates to Insight Timer’s app over the course of a 12-month period,” TechCrunch explains. </p>



<p>In late 2023, however, Insight Timer was told by App Store review that those tips were now considered “digital content.” This means Insight Timer will have to use Apple’s In-App Purchase system rather than Stripe, and pay a 30% cut to Apple itself. the </p>



<p>As the report explains, Insight Timer’s business is based around a subscription model. Apple’s decision to require those “tips” to use In-App Purchase has no effect on its finances. Instead, Insight Meditation’s teachers are the ones affected: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Late last year, those approvals stopped. An app reviewer told Insight Timer that these donations were no longer considered monetary gifts — they were now “digital content.” That meant they were also now subject to Apple’s commissions. This decision doesn’t hurt Insight Timer’s bottom line, as the app’s main business is subscriptions. Instead, it hurts the community of teachers who generate additional funds via users’ donations. Now, Apple demands a 30% of that revenue, which means the teachers are getting a 30% pay cut overnight, so to speak.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Insight Timer CEO Christopher Plowman said the company ultimately has no choice but to comply with Apple. Apple gave Plowman a deadline of February to comply with the guideline, or else have Insight Timer removed from the App Store. The two sides went back and forth in search of a compromise, but ultimately couldn’t come to a conclusion. </p>



<p>Plowman also said in the interview that Insight Timer users donated an average of $100,000 per month to the platform’s teachers. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“So in the end, I agreed,” Plowman told TechCrunch in an interview. “I don’t want to pick a fight with Apple — I’m not picking a fight with Apple. I think this problem is largely about regulators not stepping in. Apple’s a public company, but it has shareholders — it’s doing what it’s allowed to do,” he says.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Apple hasn’t yet commented on this story. </p>

Building a parser by hand consists of writing many small, repetitive functions that use a tiny library of helper functions to recursively process tokens. A lot of people end up leaning on parser generators, but I've never found one that isn't both bloated and bad at error handling.</p><p>This is where GitHub Copilot comes in—I write the grammar out in a markdown file that I keep open, build the AST data structure, then write the first few rules to give Copilot a bit of context on how I want to use the helper functions I built. From there I can just name functions and run Copilot and it fills in the rest of the parser.</p><p>This is just one example of the kind of task that I find GPTs to be very good at—tasks that necessarily have a lot of repetition but don't have a lot of opportunities for abstraction. Another one that is perhaps more common is unit testing—after giving Copilot one example to go off of, it can generate subsequent unit tests just from the name of the test.</p><p>Is it essential? No. But it sure saves a lot of typing, and is actually <i>less</i> likely than I am to make a silly mistake in these repetitive cases.

DRY has become so much of a mantra in the industry that it's taken for granted that any repetition must be unnecessary, but there are times where that's just wrong.<p>The first example I gave is parsers—even after you've factored out as many helper functions as you can, you'll eventually hit a floor where you have to use those helper functions and piece the results together. That floor is necessarily repetitive—you end up with a bunch of 5 to 10 line functions calling the abstractions and feeding the results together.</p><p>Unit tests is another example: I find that when people get too DRY in unit tests it just ends up obfuscating what the test is testing and makes changing the program later harder. Same as with parsing, there is a floor for how much abstraction is reasonable and once you have hit that floor you still have to go through the rote repetition of stringing functions together and asserting things about the results.</p><p>With a parser you actually have to do this, but with unit tests people will as often as not give up on the tedium and just not cover all the edge cases. Copilot enables developers to stop writing the repetitive code and spend their unit testing time thinking of edge cases.

As an experienced dev it's easy for me to look at it and get to 100%.<p>It's also so helpful to be able to just ask questions of the documentation on popular projects, whether it be some nuance of the node APIs or a C websockets library, it saves me countless hours of searching and reading through documentation. Just being able to describe what I want and have it suggest some functions to paste into the actual documentation search bar is invaluable.</p><p>Similarly I find it's really helpful when trying to prototype things, the other day I needed to drop an image into a canvas. I don't remember off top exactly how to get a blob out of an .ondrop (or whatever the actual handler is) and I could find it with a couple minutes of google and MDN/SO, but if I ask ChatGPT "write me a minimal example for loading a dropped image into a canvas" I get the exact thing I want in 10 seconds and I can just copy paste the relevant stuff into MDN if I need to understand how the actual API works.</p><p>I think you're just using it wrong, and moreover I think it's MUCH MUCH more useful as an experienced engineer than as a beginner. I think I get way more mileage out of it than some of my more junior friends/colleagues because I have a better grasp on what questions to ask, and I can spot it being incorrect more readily. It feels <i>BAD</i> to be honest, like it's further stratifying the space by giving me a tool that puts a huge multiplier on my experience allowing me to work much faster than before and leaving those who are less experienced even further behind. I fear that those entering the space now, working with ChatGPT will learn less of the fundamentals that allow me to leverage it so effectively, and their growth will be slowed.</p><p>That's not to say it can't be an incredibly powerful learning tool for someone dedicated to that goal, but I have some fear that it will result in less learning "through osmosis" because junior devs won't be forced into as much of the same problem solving I had to do to be good enough, and perhaps this will allow them to coast longer in mediocrity?

                  <p><span>GPT-4 was addictive for me. I subscribed to replace online language classes and it was an excellent instructor. After passing the exam I unsubscribed and I'm living fine with 3.5. My screen time definitely lowered :) I bought $5 of GPT-4 API credits to use when 3.5 really can't do the job, but it rarely happens. Asking MS Copilot is also another great way to use GPT-4 for free. On the job I mostly use GH Copilot for code completion and it's great as it provides suggestions that are in line with the code style of my team. On serious tasks all chat bots allucinate and I also feel I'm spending as much time correcting them as if I studied the topic from scratch, because I (want to?) believe what they say but end up wasting a lot of time fixing their suggestions. I'm also thinking about SQL, today it suggested me an `UPDATE table JOIN another_table SET column` and I was surprised I could use JOINs in update statements, but the bot was so sure it was the right keyword. I tried to understand where _else_ the syntax error could be, until I turned back to postgres official documentation and verified there's no JOIN, only FROM, just like I remembered.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Turns out it was shamelessly copying from GitHub repos that had vaguely related code to what I was asking - this was easy to discover because there's not much F# out there. In fact the relative sparsity of F# is precisely why GPT-3.5 had to plagiarize! It did not take long to find a prompt that spat out ~300 lines verbatim from my own F# numerics library. (I believe this problem is even worse for C numeric programmers, whose code and expertise is much more valuable than anything in .NET.) OpenAI's products are simply unethical, and I am tired of this motivated reasoning which pretends automated plagiarism is a-okay as long as you personally find it convenient.</p><p>But even outside of plagiarism I am really nervous about the future of software development with LLMs. So often I see people throwing around stats like "we saw a 10% increase in productivity" without even mentioning code quality. There are some early indications that productivity gains in LLM code assistance are paid for by more bugs and security holes - nothing that seems catastrophic, but hardly worth dismissing entirely. What is frustrating is that this was easily predictable, yet GitHub/OpenAI rushed to market with a code generation product whose reliability (and legality) remains completely unresolved.</p><p>The ultimate issue is not about AI or programming so much as software-as-industrial-product. You can quickly estimate increases in productivity over the course of a sprint or two: it's easy to count features cleared and LoC written. But if there are dumb GPT "brain fart" errors in that boilerplate and the boilerplate isn't adequately reviewed by humans, then you might not have particularly good visibility of the consequences until a few months pass and there seem to be more 5-10% bug reports than usual. Again, I don't think the use of Copilot is actually a terrible security disaster. But it's clearly a risk. It's a risk that needs to be addressed BEFORE the tool becomes a de facto standard.</p><p>I certainly get that there's a lot of truly tedious boilerplate in most enterprise codebases - even so I suspect a lot of that is better done with a fairly simple <i>deterministic</i> script versus Copilot. In fact my third biggest irritation with this stuff is that deterministic code generation tools have gotten <i>really good</i> at producing verifiably correct code, even if the interface doesn't involve literally talking to a computer.

                  <p><span>While I’m more on the infrastructure side of things, I see a similar issue. Like you mentioned, it’s great for lookups of API documentation and getting examples etc. I have also used it for things like templates and boring boilerplate. I have come to look at it as a lookup tool and something that converts my thoughts into code. I could see myself sitting at home and doing a lot of coding by voice and a vr headset in the future if the tools continue to develop. 
At the moment I think we just need to come up with a better way of integrating it into our workflow. I’m starting to wonder if something like visual programming could work well with the “ai” “figuring” out the content of the blocks we connect and basically lets us influence the generated code by the io. That could be a solution to coding on tablets and phones with minimum typing.</span></p></div></td></tr>

That is impressive, and it's very useful for references for quick tutorials on common enough things (but do check the docs). However, it's not able to do abstract thinking really yet.<p>On the other hand? If I want to add payments to my web app (not a web dev, but I mess around with side projects for fun), and I don't want to read the stripe library docs for example, it's pretty good at getting me started installing the right library, and generating the boiler plate. Same with various boilerplate for code generation.</p><p>On the other hand, ChatGPT (which has been clearly trained on stuff I've read) has an uncanny ability to describe my esoteric side projects much better than I can, so there is that. I have some DSLs written in Haskell and it's actually really good at providing answers with it, and explaining things succinctly.

I do not think AI is the big productivity boost we expect them to be yet.
I have been a software engineer for around 6 years now and I the only AI tooling I prefer and have really can not live without today is autocomplete (a better and smarter LSP).<p>When it comes to making a more complicated change, things are never easy because of the limited context window and the general lack of reasoning and inherent knowledge of the codebase I am working with.</p><p>Having said this, GPT4 has been really good for the one off questions I have about either syntax or if I forget how to do "the thing I know is possible I am just not sure" or the mundane things like docker commands or some other commands which I need help with.</p><p>But... if you guys have seen Gemini-1.5 Pro I was seriously mind blown and I think the first time I felt a LLM is better than me and that has to do with code search. I have had my fair share of navigating large codebases and spending time understanding implementations (clicking go-to-reference, go-to-definition) and keeping a mental model.. the fact that this LLM can take a minute to understand and answer questions about codebase does feel like a game changer.</p><p>I think the right way to think about AI tooling for programming is not to ask them to go and build this insane new feature which will bring lots of money for you, but how they can help you get that edge in your daily workflows (small quality of life changes which compound over time, just like how LSP is taken for granted in the editor now a days).</p><p>Another point to mention here which I believe is a major miss is that these copilots write code without paying attention to the various tools we as humans would use when writing code (LSP, linters, compilers etc). They are legit writing code like they would on a simple notepad and that is another reason why the quality is often times pretty bad (but copilot has proved that with a faster feedback loop and the right UX its not too big a hassle)</p><p>We are still very early in this game and with many people building in this space and these models improving over time I do think we will look back and laugh how things were done pre-AI vs post-smart-AI models.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/15/echr_backdoor_encryption/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/15/echr_backdoor_encryption/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39460455">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that laws requiring crippled encryption and extensive data retention violate the European Convention on Human Rights – a decision that may derail European data surveillance legislation known as Chat Control.</p>
<p>The court issued a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-230854%22]}">decision</a> on Tuesday stating that "the contested legislation providing for the retention of all internet communications of all users, the security services’ direct access to the data stored without adequate safeguards against abuse and the requirement to decrypt encrypted communications, as applied to end-to-end encrypted communications, cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society."</p>
<p>The "contested legislation" mentioned above refers to a legal challenge that started in 2017 after a demand from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) that messaging service Telegram provide technical information to assist the decryption of a user's communication. The plaintiff, Anton Valeryevich Podchasov, challenged the order in Russia but his claim was dismissed.</p>

    

<p>In 2019, Podchasov brought the matter to the ECHR. Russia joined the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal">Council of Europe</a> – an international human rights organization – in 1996 and was a member until it withdrew in March 2022 following its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Because the 2019 case predates Russia's withdrawal, the ECHR continued to consider the matter.</p>

        


        

<p>The court concluded that the Russian law requiring Telegram "to decrypt end-to-end encrypted communications risks amounting to a requirement that providers of such services weaken the encryption mechanism for all users." As such, the court considers that requirement disproportionate to legitimate law enforcement goals.</p>

</ul>
<p>While the ECHR decision is unlikely to have any effect within Russia, it matters to countries in Europe that are contemplating similar decryption laws – such as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/">Chat Control</a> and the UK government's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/27/online_safety_act_charles/">Online Safety Act</a>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/03/german_digital_committee_hearing_heaps/">Chat Control</a> is shorthand for European data surveillance legislation that would require internet service providers to scan digital communications for illegal content – specifically child sexual abuse material and potentially terrorism-related information. Doing so would necessarily entail weakening the encryption that keeps communication private.</p>
<p>Efforts to develop workable rules have been underway for several years and continue to this day, despite widespread condemnation from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/13/clientside_scanning_csam_anderson/">academics</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/germany-against-client-side-scanning-csam">privacy-oriented orgs</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/en/themen/digitale-grundrechte/chatkontrolle">civil society groups</a>.</p>

        

<p>Patrick Breyer, a member of the European parliament for the Pirate Party, hailed the ruling for demonstrating that Chat Control is incompatible with EU law.</p>
<p>"With this outstanding landmark judgment, the 'client-side scanning' surveillance on all smartphones proposed by the EU Commission in its chat control bill is clearly illegal," said Breyer.</p>
<p>"It would destroy the protection of everyone instead of investigating suspects. EU governments will now have no choice but to remove the destruction of secure encryption from their position on this proposal – as well as the indiscriminate surveillance of private communications of the entire population!" ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   
  <div><p>It may seem silly, but <code>go run</code> is my favorite part about go. Want to run your code? <code>go run main.go</code>. It is so stupidly simple that I could tell my mom about this command, and she would immediately understand. Like with most things in go, the real power in this command is in the effortless understanding of how to build and run everyone’s code.</p>
<p>But I can run <code>node main.js</code>? Yeah, and then what happens if you want to use modern syntax like esmodule, or maybe you want to use types with typescript? You are going to have to use <code>npm</code>.</p>
<p>The tools you use to build and run code are often disparate in a language. As a project maintainer, you must understand community practices and conventions of correctly setting up a project. Third-party libraries are often required to run even the simplest of code. For example, in the Ruby programming language, the “rake” build tool became popular because of its versatility and the fact that it was used in many open-source projects. Similarly, in the JavaScript community, the adoption of npm as a build tool was driven by the widespread use of npm packages and modules.</p>
<p>Languages grow and change over time, and it is only natural that tools come and go as well. C and C++ have historically had “make” since the 1970s; Java grew from “ant” in the 1990s to Maven in the early 2000s. Different requirements for your application influence the tools that are developed and, by extension, influence people’s workflows.</p>
<p>This is precisely the reason I love <code>go run</code> so much. Go’s entire design brings power to the command. Simple syntax, static typing, and a strict dependency management system allow the compiler to quickly parse and analyze source code, leading to build times faster. Faster build times mean a broader reach of who could use the language to achieve their goals. It is funny; you will occasionally see a go project that includes a <code>Makefile</code>, but the compilation step is just a <code>go build</code> (build; don’t run the code). Old habits die hard.</p>
<p>Fun fact: One of the understated features <code>go run</code> is that it will automatically download any dependencies the code references; how cool is that!</p>
<p>The more I program in other languages, the more I feel the painful absence of a standardized build system. I find it frustrating to keep up with the latest and greatest build system for something as common as running code. For something so critical to my understanding of how to code, such as how to run it, I find it unacceptable not to have a reliable foundation of knowledge.</p>
<p>Do not compromise with hacks or workarounds for critical components of your software development flow. Take ownership of the tools you use and fight for change so that you and everyone else benefit. When experience is shared, problems are solved, days of people’s lives are saved, and passion for programming continues to grow, not wane.</p>
<p>comments:</p>
<p>bun run :) bun hing.ts same with python but not compiled you need to install python that’s the beauty of go for me even rust you need a cargo file</p>
<p>amazing, for js we not only have npm, yarn, pnpm, and bower (am I missing any?) but we also have completely new runtimes <a href="https://bun.sh/">bun</a> and <a href="https://deno.com/">deno</a>. these are not evil, but tread lightly. Is VC backed deno going to fold as a company? maybe bun gets burnt and we are onto the next one. meanwhile I will be here with my boring <code>go run</code></p>

              <p>This intersession course aims to take students from novices who may know nothing about poker to above average players, in two weeks. The course will utilize hand examples and discussions of common poker situations to study the fundamentals of the game. The math, combinatoric, and game-theoretical aspects of poker will be covered, with practical examples of every concept. Lectures will focus on core concepts in Texas Hold `em, with an emphasis on cash games. Tournament-specific concepts will be covered towards the end. There will be a guest lecture by 2005 WSOP Main Event runner up <a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Dannenmann" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Dannenmann">Steve Dannenmann</a>, whose live tournament winnings exceed $4 million. The course culminated with a poker tournament at the instructor’s home at the end of intersession. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>Inspired by the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc">1BR Challenge</a>, I wanted to see how much it would cost to transfer 1 billion rows from Postgres to Snowflake. Moving 1 billion rows is no easy task. The process involves not just the transfer of data but ensuring its integrity, error recovery and consistency post-migration.</p>
<p>Central to this task is the selection of tools and techniques. We will discuss the use of open-source tools, customized scripts, ways to read data from Postgres, and Snowflake’s data loading capabilities. Key aspects like parallel processing, efficiently reading Postgres’ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">WAL</a>, data compression and incremental batch loading on Snowflake will be highlighted.</p>
<p>I will list and discuss some of the optimizations that are implemented to minimize compute, network, and warehouse costs. Additionally, I will highlight some of the trade-offs made as part of this process. Given that most of the approaches covered in this blog stem from my explorations at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb">PeerDB</a> aimed at enhancing our product – The task was accomplished primarily through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.peerdb.io/">PeerDB</a>.</p>
<p>I want to make it clear that there are some feature gaps in comparison to a mature system, and it might not be practical for all use cases. However, it does handle the most common use cases effectively while significantly reducing costs. I also want to caveat that there might be some ways in which the estimations may be off and I’d be happy to adjust based on feedback.</p>
<h2 id="heading-setup">Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Initial data load:</strong> We will consider that there are 300M rows already in the table at the start of the task, and our system should handle the initial load of all the rows.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Inserts, Updates and Deletes (Change Data Capture):</strong> The rest of the 700M rows will be a combination of inserts, updates and deletes. <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/TOAST">Including support for toast columns</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>1024 rows changed per second for ~8 days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recoverability:</strong> We will reboot the system every 30 mins to ensure that it's robust and can recover from disasters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us walk through an engineering design that optimally handles the above workload with the objective of <strong>minimizing costs</strong> and <strong>improving performance</strong>, one step at a time.</p>
<h2 id="heading-initial-load-from-postgres-to-snowflake">Initial Load from Postgres to Snowflake</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the first operation any data sync job has to do: load the initial set of data from the source to destination. There are a few challenges that come with this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How to efficiently retrieve large amounts of data from Postgres?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How to process the data in a way where we have minimal cost foot-print?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How to efficiently load this data to Snowflake?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="heading-optimal-data-retrieval-from-postgres">Optimal Data retrieval from Postgres</h2>
<p>Reading a table sequentially from Postgres is slow. It would take a long time to read 300M rows from Postgres. To make this process more efficient, <a target="_blank" href="https://duckdb.org/2022/09/30/postgres-scanner.html#parallelization">we have to parallelize</a>. We've got a clever way to quickly read parts of a table in Postgres using something called the TID Scan, which is a bit of a hidden gem. Basically, it lets us pick out specific chunks of data as stored on disk, identified by their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-system-columns.html#id-1.5.4.7.4.6.2.1">Tuple IDs</a> (CTIDs), which look like <code>(page, tuple)</code>. This optimizes IO utilization and is super handy for reading big tables efficiently.</p>
<p>Here's how we do it: we divide the table into partitions based on the pages of the database, and each partition gets its own scan task. Each task handles about 500K rows. So, we partition the table into CTID ranges, with each partition having ~500K rows, and we process each partition parallelly (16 partitions at a time).</p>
<pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>count</span>(*) <span>FROM</span> public.challenge_1br; <span>-- find the count</span>

<span>-- num_partitions = (count // rows_per_partition)</span>

<span>SELECT</span> <span>bucket</span>, <span>MIN</span>(ctid) <span>AS</span> <span>start</span>, <span>MAX</span>(ctid) <span>AS</span> <span>end</span>
<span>FROM</span> (
    <span>SELECT</span> NTILE(<span>1000</span>) <span>OVER</span> (<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> ctid) <span>AS</span> <span>bucket</span>, ctid 
  <span>FROM</span> public.challenge_1br
) subquery
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>start</span>;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="heading-data-in-transit">Data in Transit</h2>
<p>It is important to process the data in a way where we don’t overload the system. As we are operating under budget constraints, we need to use techniques that use the hardware effectively. We are going to be using the “<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt/status/600783770925420546?s=20">your dataset fits in RAM</a>'' paradigm of systems design. 300M rows for initial load does sound like a lot, but let's see how we can make it fit in our RAM. We need to process the data to ensure <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.peerdb.io/role-of-data-type-mapping-in-database-replication">data-types are mapped correctly to the destination</a>. We are going to convert the query results to <a target="_blank" href="https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.11.0/index.html">Avro</a> for faster loading into warehouses, and also <a target="_blank" href="https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.11.0/spec.html#Logical+Types">for its logical type support</a>.</p>
<h3 id="heading-how-big-is-the-data">How big is the data?</h3>
<p>Let us take a little detour to explore how big the data is. This is a good chance to look at some real world examples to estimate things. Based on interacting with a lot of production customers, and talking to some experts, it’s safe to say that on an average we see ~15 columns per table. In our table, let’s say each row is ~512 bytes.</p>
<pre><code><span># for initial load</span>
num_rows = <span>300</span>_000_000
bytes_per_row = <span>512</span>
total_num_bytes = num_rows * bytes_per_row
total_size_gb = total_num_bytes / <span>1</span>_000_000_000
<span># total initial load size 153.6 GB</span>

<span># memory required during initial load</span>

num_rows_per_partition = <span>500</span>_000
mb_per_partition = num_rows_per_partition * bytes_per_row / <span>1</span>_000_000 <span># 256 MB</span>
num_partitions_in_parallel = <span>16</span>
required_memory = num_partitions_in_parallel * mb_per_partition <span># 4096 MB</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="heading-required-memory">Required Memory</h3>
<p>Based on the above napkin math, we can see that with 4GB of RAM we should be able to do the initial load. We will allocate 8GB of RAM to account for other components.</p>
<h2 id="heading-efficiently-loading-data-into-snowflake">Efficiently loading data into Snowflake</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier we are going to store the query results into Avro on-disk. We are further going to compress the Avro files using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd">zstd</a> to further reduce the disk footprint and also to save on network costs. We will take a slight deviation from the topic to talk about Bandwidth costs.</p>
<h3 id="heading-bandwidth-costs-they-can-break-the-bank">Bandwidth costs: They can break the bank!</h3>
<p>Let's look at the network costs, you can see the variance in numbers.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see the variance in the costs, so it’s best to have Postgres, our System and Snowflake in the same cloud provider and the same region. Let’s now calculate the networks costs needed for this workload.</p>
<h3 id="heading-calculating-network-costs">Calculating Network Costs</h3>
<p>Another thing to be wary of is the Warehouse configuration.</p>
<pre><code>bytes_per_row = <span>512</span>
num_rows = <span>1</span>_000_000_000
total_data_size = <span>512</span>GB
compressed_data_size_GB = <span>256</span> <span>#avro+zstd gives atleast 2x compression</span>
bandwidth_cost_per_10GB = $<span>0.1</span>

<span># total nework costs</span>
<span># data_size_GB * bandwidth_cost_per_10GB / 10</span>
network_costs_egress_from_postgres = $<span>5</span>
<span># compressed_data_size_GB * bandwidth_cost_per_10GB / 10</span>
network_costs_egress_from_system_to_snowflake = $<span>2.56</span> 

network_costs = $<span>7.56</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="heading-snowflake-warehouse-configuration">Snowflake Warehouse Configuration</h3>
<p>In many organizations, a significant portion of Snowflake expenses comes from compute usage, particularly when warehouses run idle between tasks. Snowflake's compute costs are accrued based on warehouse operational time, starting from activation to suspension. Often, idle warehouse time can contribute to 10%-25% of the total Snowflake compute costs. The Baselit team wrote an excellent blog about it: <a target="_blank" href="https://baselit.ai/blogs/fastest-way-save-snowflake">read more about it here</a>.</p>
<p>The two things we will be doing is to set <code>AUTO_SUSPEND</code> to be 60 seconds, a warehouse idles for up to a minute after the last query before pausing, and make sure that we keep the warehouse active for the least amount of time. This is the default configuration you get if you follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.peerdb.io/connect/snowflake">PeerDB Snowflake setup guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading-inserts-updates-and-deletes">Inserts, Updates and Deletes</h2>
<p>The next challenge for us after the initial load would be to read the change data from Postgres and replaying that to Snowflake. We are going to be doing that using Postgres’ Logical Replication. At the start of the replication, we will create a replication slot and use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-architecture.html">pgoutput</a> plugin. This is the recommended way to read changes from the slot. Once we read the changes from the slot, we will batch them and then load them to Snowflake.</p>
<p>As we discussed earlier, it is important to keep the Snowflake warehouse idle for as long as we can, and batching helps with that. We store records in batches of 1M to Avro like before, and load them to an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system-create-stage">internal stage</a> in Snowflake. Once the data is loaded into the stage, we will <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/merge">MERGE</a> the records from the stage into the destination table. This way most of the heavy-lifting of the resolution is left to the warehouse and it simplifies our system.</p>

<p>At <a target="_blank" href="https://www.peerdb.io/">PeerDB</a>, we are building a specialized data-movement tool for Postgres with laser focus on Postgres to Data Warehouse replication. Most of the above optimizations incl. <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.peerdb.io/parallelized-initial-load-for-cdc-based-streaming-from-postgres">parallel initial load</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.peerdb.io/reducing-bigquery-costs-by-260x">reducing Data Warehouse costs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.peerdb.io/role-of-data-type-mapping-in-database-replication">native data-type mapping</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb/pull/111">support of TOAST columns</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.peerdb.io/using-temporal-to-scale-data-synchronization-at-peerdb">fault-tolerance and auto recovery</a> etc. are already baked into the product. PeerDB is also <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb">Free and Open</a>. So we chose PeerDB to implement the above workload.</p>
<h2 id="heading-hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>Now that we have landed on 8GB RAM, let us move onto picking the instance type.</p>
<p>Since ARM uses lower energy compared to x64 (due to being RISC), they are around 25% cheaper as compared to x64 machines. The tradeoff here is that x64 machines run at around 2.9GHz with a 3.5GHz Turbo (M6i instances) as compared to ARM machines at about 2.5GHz (Graviton2 - M6g) but M6i instances are about 30% more expensive as compared to M6g instances.</p>
<p>Effective cost is $0.0409/GHz for x64 vs $0.03616/GHz for ARM, so cost is about 13% more per GHz on x64 <strong>But cost per GHz is not the determining factor for reading in a single thread from Postres during CDC as replication slots can be read from a single process at once.</strong></p>
<p>For this current experiment, I went with <code>m6gd.large</code> as it offers a good balance of speed and disk.</p>
<p><strong>Optional read:</strong> In this blog we will use AWS for our analysis. However, here are some other learnings we had on this topic. OVH Cloud currently <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ovh/public-cloud-roadmap/issues/343">does not support ARM</a> Instances and has a similar $0.118/hour <code>c2-7</code> instance (in limited regions) which has a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ovhcloud.com/asia/public-cloud/prices/#410">very low network speed</a> (250MBps) with 50GB of SSD. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/">Hetzner</a> has a <code>CCX13</code> $0.0292/hour instance (including a 118GB SSD) but no dedicated ARM instances.</p>

<h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>One question that I'm often posed with: <strong>“Is this practical?”</strong>. Yes, one machine can die, but systems where there is only one machine have a <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1586180166631706624?s=20">remarkable amount of uptime</a>, especially when the state is stored in a durable way.</p>
<p>Back to the topic at hand. If we look at the total cost of the system we built (assuming <code>us-west-2</code> as the region. Over a month time this is the breakdown:</p>
<div>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Cost Category</td><td>Cost</td><td>Comment</td></tr>

</div><p>I am part of a company building a software for moving data specifically from Postgres to Data warehouses. It's my job to figure out how to provide the best experience to our customers.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models can also \textit{generate high-performing neural network parameters}. Our approach is simple, utilizing an autoencoder and a standard latent diffusion model. The autoencoder extracts latent representations of a subset of the trained network parameters. A diffusion model is then trained to synthesize these latent parameter representations from random noise. It then generates new representations that are passed through the autoencoder's decoder, whose outputs are ready to use as new subsets of network parameters. Across various architectures and datasets, our diffusion process consistently generates models of comparable or improved performance over trained networks, with minimal additional cost. Notably, we empirically find that the generated models perform differently with the trained networks. Our results encourage more exploration on the versatile use of diffusion models.

<p>21st February 2024</p>

<p>Last week Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/">introduced Gemini Pro 1.5</a>, an enormous upgrade to their Gemini series of AI models.</p>
<p>Gemini Pro 1.5 has a 1,000,000 token context size. This is <em>huge</em>—previously that record was held by Claude 2.1 (200,000 tokens) and gpt-4-turbo (128,000 tokens)—though the difference in tokenizer implementations between the models means this isn’t a perfectly direct comparison.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing with Gemini Pro 1.5 for a few days, and I think the most exciting feature isn’t so much the token count... it’s the ability to use video as an input.</p>
<p>I’ve been accessing the model through the <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat">Google AI Studio</a> interface—I don’t have API access yet.</p>
<p>I tried filling up the context with content from my blog, and got some good results. But things got <em>really</em> exciting when I began experimenting with video uploads (after some false starts—the team have been actively fixing bugs, with variable bitrate support landing just this morning).</p>
<p>I took this seven second video of one of my bookshelves:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jAlySrZqJqE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe>
<p>Then I uploaded it with the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JSON array of books in this video</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That 7 second video consumed just 1,841 tokens out of my 1,048,576 token limit.</p>
<p>Gemini Pro 1.5 didn’t return JSON, but it did reply with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not possible to fully identify all the books in the video. However, here are some of the books that can be seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien</li>
<li>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman</li>

<p>A follow-up prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as a JSON array of objects, with title and author keys</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gave me that back as JSON</p>

<p>So how well did it do?</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m pretty astonished by this. The video is 7s long, it pans quite fast (there is some motion blur in the video) and some of the books are partially obscured by items.</p>
<p>It didn’t get all of them, but it did about as good a job as I could have done given the same video.</p>
<p>I’m particularly impressed that it got “Site Seeing: A Visual Approach to Web Usability” by Luke Wroblewski, where the book itself is almost entirely obscured by a squirrel leaving only “Site-Seeing” visible.</p>
<p>I did spot one hallucination: it lists “The Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman”, but I don’t own that book—the closest thing in the video is a blurry few frames of a book called “The Beermat Entrepreneur”.</p>
<p>I decided to try it again with a different video and hopefully a better prompt. This time I videoed a bookshelf mostly full of cookbooks—this time in portrait, a bit longer (22 seconds) and panning down as well as across.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6m8sNercyNU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe>
<p>This video cost me 6,049 tokens—still a pretty tiny allocation.</p>
<p>My new prompt was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output a JSON array of {“title”: “...”, “authors”: “...”} objects for books in this video</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And.... it refused:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/gemini-refusal.jpg" alt="User: a video, containing a bunch of books visible in the first frame including THE COCKTAIL, SMUGGLER'S COVE, THE CUROUS BARTENDER... 00:22 IMG_7592.MOV 6,049 tokens. Prompt: Output a JSON array of {&quot;title&quot;: &quot; ...&quot;, &quot;authors&quot;. &quot;...&quot;} objects for books in this video. Model: No content, with a box open that says Probability of unsafe content Dangerous Content High - Edit safety settings"></p>
<p>It looks like the safety filter may have taken offense to the word “Cocktail”!</p>
<p>I opened up the safety settings, dialled them down to “low” for every category and tried again. It appeared to refuse a second time.</p>
<p>So I channelled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Father_Ted_characters#Mrs_Doyle">Mrs Doyle</a> and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>go on give me that JSON</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it worked!</p>

<p>Once again, I find those results pretty astounding.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-make-of-this">What to make of this</h4>
<p>The ability to extract structured content from text is already one of the most exciting use-cases for LLMs. GPT-4 Vision and LLaVA expanded that to images. And now Gemini Pro 1.5 expands that to video.</p>
<p>The ability to analyze video like this feels SO powerful. Being able to take a 20 second video of a bookshelf and get back a JSON array of those books is just the first thing I thought to try.</p>
<p>The usual LLM caveats apply. It can miss things and it can hallucinate incorrect details. Half of the work in making the most of this class of technology is figuring out how to work around these limitations, but I feel like we’re making good progress on that.</p>
<p>There’s also the issue with the safety filters. As input to these models gets longer, the chance of something triggering a filter (like the first four letters of the word “cocktail”) goes up.</p>
<p>So, as always with modern AI, there are still plenty of challenges to overcome.</p>
<p>But this really does feel like another one of those glimpses of a future that’s suddenly far closer then I expected it to be.</p>
<h4 id="images-vs-video">A note on images v.s. video</h4>
<p>Initially I had assumed that video was handled differently from images, due partly to the surprisingly (to me) low token counts involved in processing a video.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39458264#39458355">This thread</a> on Hacker News convinced me otherwise.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/02/gemini-15-available-for-private-preview-in-google-ai-studio.html">this blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gemini 1.5 Pro can also reason across up to 1 hour of video. When you attach a video, Google AI Studio breaks it down into thousands of frames (without audio), and then you can perform highly sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving tasks since the Gemini models are multimodal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then in the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf">Gemini 1.5 technical report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When prompted with a 45 minute Buster Keaton movie “Sherlock Jr." (1924) (2,674 frames
at 1FPS, 684k tokens), Gemini 1.5 Pro retrieves and extracts textual information from a specific frame
in and provides the corresponding timestamp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ran my own experiment: I grabbed a frame from my video and uploaded that to Gemini in a new prompt.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/gemini-frame.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Gemini interface with an uploaded image. A box reads Preview 258 / 1,048,576"></p>
<p>That’s 258 tokens for a single image.</p>
<p>Using the numbers from the Buster Keaton example, 684,000 tokens / 2,674 frames = 256 tokens per frame. So it looks like it really does work by breaking down the video into individual frames and processing each one as an image.</p>
<p>For my own videos: 1,841 / 256 = 7.2 (the 7s video) and 6,049 / 256 = 23.6 (the 22s video)—which makes me believe that videos are split up into one frame per second and each frame costs ~256 tokens.</p>
<p>As a further experiment I grabbed a snapshot of the first frame of the video and uploaded that as a plain image. This time I didn’t even include a prompt:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/bookshelf.jpg" alt="An image of books on a bookshelf - the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the middle."></p>
<p>Gemini Pro 1.5 guessed what I wanted and replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The books in the image are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien</li>
<li>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    <p>Boeing has ousted the leader of the 737 MAX program at its Renton plant and reshuffled its leadership team at the Commercial Airplanes division, effective immediately.</p><p>The moves come more than a month after a Renton-assembled MAX 9 saw a fuselage panel blow out of an Alaska Airlines flight departing Portland. Investigators contend <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/ntsb-report-on-alaska-flight-1282-says-key-bolts-missing-when-boeing-delivered-jet/">key bolts were missing from the plane prior to the Jan. 5 blowout</a>, a failure that has <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/cantwell-blasts-faa-oversight-of-boeing-after-alaska-airlines-737-max-9-blowout/">increased scrutiny of quality control at Boeing and its suppliers</a> and put intense pressure on company leadership.</p><p>Ed Clark, vice president of the MAX program and general manager at the Renton facility, will leave the company. He’s being replaced by Katie Ringgold, the current vice president 737 delivery operations.</p><p>The changes were announced Wednesday morning in an email to employees by Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief Stan Deal.</p><p>Deal wrote that the leadership changes are intended to drive Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ “enhanced focus on ensuring that every airplane we deliver meets or exceeds all quality and safety requirements.”</p><p>Clark took charge of the MAX program in 2021 as it returned to service after two fatal crashes had grounded the jets worldwide for almost two years. He was responsible for 737 engineering, supply chain, manufacturing and other support functions.</p>
<p>Deal wrote in his note that Clark “departs with my, and our, deepest gratitude for his many significant contributions over nearly 18 years of dedicated service to Boeing.”</p><p>However, a person familiar with the decision and who asked not to be identified commenting on sensitive personnel decisions, confirmed that Clark’s departure was not voluntary.</p><p>Clark is an engineer. His successor Ringgold has business degrees. However she began her aviation career performing avionics systems maintenance and troubleshooting on C-130 cargo aircraft in the U.S. Air Force.</p><p>Ringgold joined Boeing in 2011 at the company’s North Charleston, S.C., production facility, where she rose to become a senior quality manager. </p><p>She transferred to the Puget Sound region in 2019, where she was responsible for jet deliveries from all Boeing Commercial Airplanes delivery centers in Seattle, Everett, North Charleston and Zhoushan, China.</p><p>She then became vice president of 737 delivery operations with responsibility for deliveries to customers from Seattle, as well as pre-delivery flights in Renton and oversight and care of the parked MAXs stored at Moses Lake, Seattle’s Plant 2 and San Antonio.</p>
<p>In addition to that change at the top of the MAX program, Deal shuffled the appointments of two senior leaders, Elizabeth Lund and Mike Fleming.</p><p>Lund, who currently heads all airplane programs at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, has been named to the new position of senior vice president for BCA Quality, where she will lead quality control efforts.</p><p>Lund will continue reporting to Deal and serving on the company’s executive council. Carole Murray, the current vice president of Quality, will now report to Lund, “on special assignment, to ensure a smooth transition,” Deal wrote in his message.</p><p>Mike Fleming, who led the 737 MAX return-to-service push after the two fatal crashes and has since then led the drive to certify the MAX 7 and MAX 10, has been promoted to replace Lund as senior vice president and general manager of all Boeing Commercial airplane programs. He’ll oversee 737, 767, 777/777X, and 787 production, reporting to Deal.</p><p>Deal said Don Ruhmann, who was 787 chief project engineer, is succeeding Fleming in his former role. </p><p>Deal wrote that replacements for the positions vacated by Ringgold and Ruhmann will be named later. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
When I write shell one-liners that transform the contents of some file, they
often look something like
</p>

<p><label>In[1]:</label></p><div>
<pre>cat access.log | head -n 500 | grep mail | perl -e …
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is what a lot of people reflexively call a <i>useless use of cat</i><label for="fn.1">1</label><span><sup>1</sup> And
more thoughtful people will call a useless use of <code>grep</code> and <code>head</code> too because the
Perl script can of course do both of those things.</span> because <code>head</code> can take the
file name as an argument and we don’t need the extra pipe and <code>cat</code> command. In
fact, almost all commands can take the file name directly<label for="fn.2">2</label><span><sup>2</sup> For the ones that
don’t, we can use input redirection and say e.g. <code>&lt;&nbsp;access.log&nbsp;command</code>.</span> and we
only really need <code>cat</code> when we want to concatenate the contents of files.
</p>

<p>
But there’s a reason I do it anyway.
</p>

<p>
I’m currently re-reading one of David Parnas’ classic papers on
modularity<label for="fn.3">3</label><span><sup>3</sup> <i>Designing Software for Ease of Extension and Contraction</i>;
Parnas; <abbr>ieee</abbr> Transactions on Software Engineering; 1979.</span>. Every software
engineer should read that stuff – it’s brilliant. For this article we’ll focus
on one thing: we all know code changes should be isolated. For example, we
should be able to add new functionality by just adding code, and not going in
and changing existing code. Parnas phrases this in an interesting way.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The problem is that these subsets and extensions are not the programs that we
would have designed if we had set out to design just that product.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
His idea of the ideal design is one where we can add or remove code and it still
looks like the program was designed for the thing it’s doing now; i.e. you can’t
tell that something else was added or removed later on, it all looks like part
of the original design.
</p>

<p>
Parnas lists four classes of problems we often encounter when trying to make
changes. For this discussion, the second class is the relevant one.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Many programs are structured as a chain of components, each receiving data from
the previous component, processing it (and changing the format), before sending
the data to the next program in the chain. If one component in this chain is not
needed, that code is often hard to remove because the output of its predecessor
is not compatible with the input requirements of its successor. A program that
does nothing but change the format must be substituted.
</p>

<p>
One illustration would be a payroll program that assumed unsorted input. One of
the components of the system accepts the unsorted input and produces output that
is sorted by some key. If the firm adopts an office procedure that results in
sorted input, this phase of the processing is unnecessary. To eliminate that
program, one may have to add a program that transfers data from a file in the
input format to a file in the format appropriate for the next phase.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If we go back to our example of the shell one-liner and squint a little, then
the string <code>access.log</code> is one input format (describing the file with the
relevant contents) and the contents of the access log is a different input
format. These are two representations of essentially the same thing.
</p>

<p>
If we then eliminate the useless use of cat and write instead
</p>

<p><label>In[2]:</label></p><div>
<pre>head -n 500 access.log | grep mail | perl -e …
</pre>
</div>

<p>
we find that <code>head</code> performs two responsibilities:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Converting the string <code>access.log</code> into the contents of the file; and</li>
<li>Extracting the first 500 records of that content.</li>
</ol>

<p>
When we’re satisfied with our Perl script, it’s not unreasonable to think that
we might want to run it across the entire access log rather than just the first
500 records. If we then delete only the <code>head</code> processing step we’re left
without a step that transforms the string <code>access.log</code> into the contents of the
access log. We can move that responsibility into the <code>grep</code> call, but this would
mean we hade to change some existing component in order to remove another – no
good!
</p>

<p>
The natural solution is a useless use of <code>cat</code>. With a separate processing step
that converts the filename into the file contents, we can delete any
intermediary processing steps and still be left with a functioning pipeline.
People can complain all they want about it, but I will continue writing modular
code. Even when it’s just shell one-liners.
</p>

<h2>Google reneged on the monopolistic bargain (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/21/im-feeling-unlucky/#not-up-to-the-task">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>A funny thing happened on the way to the enshittocene: Google – which astonished the world when it reinvented search, blowing Altavista and Yahoo out of the water with a search tool that seemed <em>magic</em> – suddenly turned into a pile of shit.</p>
<p>Google's search results are terrible. The top of the page is dominated by spam, scams, and ads. A surprising number of those ads <em>are</em> scams. Sometimes, these are high-stakes scams played out by well-resourced adversaries who stand to make a fortune by tricking Google:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/phone-numbers-airlines-listed-google-directed-scammers-rcna94766">https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/phone-numbers-airlines-listed-google-directed-scammers-rcna94766</a></p>
<p>But often these scams are perpetrated by petty grifters who are making a couple bucks at this. These aren't hyper-resourced, sophisticated attackers. They're the SEO equivalent of script kiddies, and they're running circles around Google:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security</a></p>
<p>Google search is empirically worsening. The SEO industry spends every hour that god sends trying to figure out how to sleaze their way to the top of the search results, and even if Google defeats 99% of these attempts, the 1% that squeak through end up dominating the results page for any consequential query:</p>
<p><a href="https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf">https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf</a></p>
<p>Google insists that this isn't true, and if it is true, it's not their fault because the bad guys out there are so numerous, dedicated and inventive that Google can't help but be overwhelmed by them:</p>
<p><a href="https://searchengineland.com/is-google-search-getting-worse-389658">https://searchengineland.com/is-google-search-getting-worse-389658</a></p>
<p>It wasn't supposed to be this way. Google has long maintained that its scale is the only thing that keeps us safe from the scammers and spammers who would otherwise overwhelm any lesser-resourced defender. That's why it was so imperative that they pursue such aggressive growth, buying up hundreds of companies and integrating their products with search so that every mobile device, every ad, every video, every website, had one of Google's tendrils in it.</p>
<p>This is the argument that Google's defenders have put forward in their messaging on the long-overdue antitrust case against Google, where we learned that Google is spending $26b/year to make sure you never try another search engine:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/google-paid-26-3-billion-to-be-default-search-engine-in-2021">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/google-paid-26-3-billion-to-be-default-search-engine-in-2021</a></p>
<p>Google, we were told, had achieved such intense scale that the normal laws of commercial and technological physics no longer applied. Take security: it's an iron law that "there is no security in obscurity." A system that is only secure when its adversaries don't understand how it works is not a secure system. As Bruce Schneier says, "anyone can design a security system that they themselves can't break. That doesn't mean it works – just that it works for people stupider than <em>them</em>."</p>
<p>And yet, Google operates one of the world's most consequential security system – The Algorithm (TM) – in total secrecy. We're not allowed to know how Google's ranking system works, what its criteria are, or even when it changes: "If we told you that, the spammers would win."</p>
<p>Well, they kept it a secret, and the spammers won anyway.</p>
<p>A viral post by Housefresh – who review air purifiers – describes how Google's algorithmic failures, which send the worst sites to the top of the heap, have made it impossible for high-quality review sites to compete:</p>
<p><a href="https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/">https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/</a></p>
<p>You've doubtless encountered these bad review sites. Search for "Best ______ 2024" and the results are a series of near-identical lists, strewn with Amazon affiliate links. Google has endlessly tinkered with its guidelines and algorithmic weights for review sites, and none of it has made a difference. For example, when Google instituted a policy that reviewers should "discuss the benefits and drawbacks of something, based on your own original research," sites that had previously regurgitated the same lists of the same top ten Amazon bestsellers "peppered their pages with references to a ‘rigorous testing process,’ their ‘lab team,’ subject matter experts ‘they collaborated with,’ and complicated methodologies that seem impressive at a cursory look."</p>
<p>But these grandiose claims – like the 67 air purifiers supposedly tested in <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em>'s Des Moines lab – result in zero in-depth reviews and no published data. Moreover, these claims to rigorous testing materialized within a few days of Google changing its search ranking and said that high rankings would be reserved for sites that did testing.</p>
<p>Most damning of all is how the <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em> top air purifiers perform in comparison to the – extensively documented – tests performed by Housefresh: "plagued by high-priced and underperforming units, Amazon bestsellers with dubious origins (that also underperform), and even subpar devices from companies that market their products with phrases like ‘the Tesla of air purifiers.’"</p>
<p>One of the top ranked items on <em>BH&amp;G</em> comes from Molekule, a company that filed for bankruptcy after being sued for false advertising. The model <em>BH&amp;G</em> chose was ranked "the worst air purifier tested" by Wirecutter and "not living up to the hype" by <em>Consumer Reports</em>. Either <em>BH&amp;G</em>'s rigorous testing process is a fiction that they infused their site with in response to a Google policy change, or <em>BH&amp;G</em> absolutely <em>sucks</em> at rigorous testing.</p>
<p><em>BH&amp;G</em>'s competitors commit the same sins – literally, the <em>exact</em> same sins. <em>Real Simple</em>'s reviews list the same photographer and the photos seem to have been taken in the same place. They also list the same person as their "expert." <em>Real Simple</em> has the same corporate parent as <em>BH&amp;G</em>: Dotdash Meredith. As Housefresh shows, there's a <em>lot</em> of Dotdash Meredith review photos that seem to have been taken in the same place, by the same person.</p>
<p>But the competitors of these magazines are no better. Buzzfeed lists <em>22</em> air purifiers, including that crapgadget from Molekule. Their "methodology" is to include screenshots of Amazon reviews.</p>
<p>A lot of the top ranked sites for air purifiers are once-great magazines that have been bought and enshittified by private equity giants, like <em>Popular Science</em>, which began as a magazine in 1872 and became a shambling zombie in 2023, after its PE owners North Equity LLC decided its googlejuice was worth more than its integrity and turned it into a metastatic chumbox of shitty affiliate-link SEO-bait. As Housefresh points out, the marketing team that runs <em>PopSci</em> makes a lot of hay out of the 150 years of trust that went into the magazine, but the actual reviews are thin anaecdotes, unbacked by even the pretense of empiricism (oh, and they <em>loooove</em> Molekule).</p>
<p>Some of the biggest, most powerful, most trusted publications in the world have a side-hustle in quietly producing SEO-friendly "10 Best ___________ of 2024" lists: <em>Rolling Stone</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, <em>US News and Report</em>, <em>CNN</em>, <em>New York Magazine</em>, <em>CNET</em>, <em>Tom's Guide</em>, and more.</p>
<p>Google literally has one job: to detect this kind of thing and crush it. The deal we made with Google was, "You monopolize search and use your monopoly rents to ensure that we never, ever try another search engine. In return, you will somehow distinguish between low-effort, useless nonsense and good information. You promised us that  if you got to be the unelected, permanent overlord of all information access, you would 'organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.'"</p>
<p>They broke the deal.</p>
<p>Companies like CNET <em>used</em> to do real, rigorous product reviews. As Housefresh points out, CNET once bought an <em>entire smart home</em> and used it to test products. Then Red Ventures bought CNET and bet that they could sell the house, switch to vibes-based reviewing, and that Google wouldn't even notice. They were right.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/welcome-to-the-cnet-smart-home/">https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/welcome-to-the-cnet-smart-home/</a></p>
<p>Google downranks sites that spend money and time on reviews like Housefresh and GearLab, and crams botshittened content mills like <em>BH&amp;G</em> into our eyeballs instead.</p>
<p>In 1558, Thomas Gresham coined (ahem) Gresham's Law: "Bad money drives out good." When counterfeit money circulates in the economy, anyone who gets a dodgy coin spends it as quickly as they can, because the longer you hold it, the greater the likelihood that someone will detect the fraud and the coin will become worthless. Run this system long enough and all the money in circulation is funny money.</p>
<p>An internet run by Google has its own Gresham's Law: bad sites drive out good. It's not just that <em>BH&amp;G</em> can "test" products at a fraction of the cost of Housefresh – through the simple expedient of doing inadequate tests or no tests at all – so they can put a lot more content up that Housefresh. But that alone wouldn't let them drive Housefresh off the front page of Google's search results. For that, <em>BH&amp;G</em> has to mobilize some of their savings from the no test/bad test lab to do <em>real</em> rigorous science: science in defeating Google's security-through-obscurity system, which lets them command the front page despite publishing worse-than-useless nonsense.</p>
<p>Google has lost the spam wars. In response to the plague of botshit clogging Google search results, the company has invested in…making more botshit:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/16/tweedledumber/#easily-spooked">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/16/tweedledumber/#easily-spooked</a></p>
<p>Last year, Google did a $70b stock buyback. They also laid off 12,000 staffers (whose salaries could have been funded for 27 years by that stock buyback). They just laid off thousands more employees.</p>
<p>That wasn't the deal. The deal was that Google would get a monopoly, and they would spend their monopoly rents to be so good that you could just click "I'm feeling lucky" and be teleported to the very best response to your query. A company that can't figure out the difference between a scam like <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em> and a rigorous review site like Housefresh should be pouring every spare dime it brings in into <em>fixing this problem</em>. Not buying default search status on every platform so that we never try another search engine: they should be <em>fixing their shit</em>.</p>
<p>When Google admits that it's losing the war to these kack-handed spam-farmers, that's frustrating. When they light $26b/year on fire making sure you don't ever get to try anything else, that's <em>very</em> frustrating. When they vaporize <em>seventy billion dollars</em> on financial engineering and shoot one in ten engineers, that's <em>outrageous</em>.</p>
<p>Google's scale <em>has</em> transcended the laws of business physics: they can sell an ever-degrading product and command an ever-greater share of our economy, even as their incompetence dooms any decent, honest venture to obscurity while providing fertile ground – and endless temptation – for scammers.</p>

<h2>The Bezzle excerpt (Part IV) (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/21/im-feeling-unlucky/#poacher-turned-keeper">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>This week marks the publication of my latest novel, <em>The Bezzle</em>, and to celebrate, I'm serializing an excerpt from Chapter 14 in six parts:</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle</a></p>
<p><em>The Bezzle</em> is a revenge story, a crime novel, and a technothriller. It stars Martin Hench, a hard-fighting forensic accountant who specializes in unwinding high-tech scams. Hench made his debt in last year's <em>Red Team Blues</em> (now in paperback!); <em>The Bezzle</em> is a standalone followup:</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues</a></p>
<p>The serial tells the tale of Stefon Magner, AKA Steve Soul, a once-famous R&amp;B frontman whose disintegrating career turned to tragedy when his crooked manager forged his signature on a rights assignment contract that let him steal all of Stefon's royalties, which ballooned after modern hiphop artists discovered his grooves and started buying licenses to sample them. The first three installments related the sad circumstances of Stefon's life, and the real-world analogues (like Leonard Cohen and George Clinton, both of whom were pauperized by sticky-fingered managers) as well as one real-world countermeasure, copyright termination, a thing that more artists should know about and use:</p>

<p>Today's installment weaves in a major subplot for the first time in the serial: Los Angeles's notorious, murderous Sheriff's Deputy gangs. These are another unbelievable true tale: for decades, the LASD's deputies have formed themselves into criminal gangs, some of which require that initiates murder someone to be inducted:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LASD_deputy_gangs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LASD_deputy_gangs</a></p>
<p>They sport gang tattoos, have secret signs, and run vast criminal enterprises. This has been the subject of numerous investigative press reports, and one extensive official report that called the gangs "a cancer":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deputy-gangs-cancer-los-angeles-county-sheriffs-department-scathing-re-rcna73367">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deputy-gangs-cancer-los-angeles-county-sheriffs-department-scathing-re-rcna73367</a></p>
<p>The sordid tales of the LASD gangs beggar belief. For example, deputies in charge of LA County jails forced inmates to pit-fight and took bets on the outcomes:</p>

<p>The taxpayers of LA have shelled out tens of millions of dollars to settle claims against LA's criminals with badges:</p>

<p>Periodically, LA judges and officials will insist that they are tackling the problem:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-17/dozens-of-lasd-deputies-ordered-to-show-suspected-gang-tattoos-reveal-others-who-have-them">https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-17/dozens-of-lasd-deputies-ordered-to-show-suspected-gang-tattoos-reveal-others-who-have-them</a></p>
<p>But at every turn, the LA police "unions" manage to crush these investigations:</p>

<p>And top cops are right there with them, insisting that these aren't "gangs" – they're just "subgroups":</p>
<p><a href="https://lapublicpress.org/2024/01/former-la-sheriff-villanueva-sheriffs-gangs-are-just-subgroups/">https://lapublicpress.org/2024/01/former-la-sheriff-villanueva-sheriffs-gangs-are-just-subgroups/</a></p>
<p>It's very weird being an Angeleno and knowing that one of the largest, most militarized, best funded police departments in the world has been openly captured by a hyperviolent crime syndicate. When I was in the Skyboat Media studios last December with Wil Wheaton recording the audiobook for <em>The Bezzle</em>, Wil broke off from reading to say, "You know, someone's going to read this and google it and have their mind blown when they discover that it's real":</p>
<p><a href="https://sowl.co/8nyGh">https://sowl.co/8nyGh</a></p>
<p>That's one of my favorite ways to turn literature into something more than entertainment. It's why I filled the <em>Little Brother</em> books with real-world surveillance, cryptography and security tech, giving enough detail to advance the plot <em>and</em> give readers an idea of what search terms would let them understand and use the concepts in the novel. That's something I'm happy to keep up with the <em>Hench</em> novels, unpicking the inner workings of scams and corruption. The more of us who are wise to this, the sooner we'll be able to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Here's part one of the serial:</p>

<p>And now, onto part four!</p>
<center> * * *</center>
<p>The last of the boxes had been shelved.</p>
<p>Benedetto rose from his chair. “Thank you, gentlemen,” he said to the movers, and dug a roll of twenties out of his pocket and handed each of them two of their own. He turned to me as they filed out. “You wanna get sushi? The place next door is <em>great</em>.”</p>
<p>The empty storefront was in a down-­at-­heels strip mall in Eagle Rock. On one side, there was a Brazilian jujitsu studio that never seemed to have any students training in it. On the other side was Sushi Jiro, name on a faded sign with half its lightbulbs gone. Beyond that was a vaping store.</p>
<p>“The place next door is <em>good</em>?”</p>
<p>He laughed. “You San Francisco motherfuckers got terrible LA restaurant radar. Put Sushi Jiro in the Mission and it’d have a Michelin star and a six-­month waiting list. Here it’s in a strip mall and only the locals know how good it is. Bet you never had a decent meal in this town, am I right?”</p>
<p>“I’ve had a few,” I said, “but I admit my track record isn’t great.”</p>
<p>“Let’s improve it.”</p>
<p>The sushi was amazing.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Inglewood Jams had the kind of books that were <em>performatively</em> bad, designed to foil any attempt at human comprehension.</p>
<p>But whoever cooked them was an amateur, someone who mistook <em>complexity</em> for <em>obfuscation</em>. Like <em>cross-­referencing</em> was a species of transcendentally esoteric sorcery. I don’t mind cross-referencing. It’s meditative, like playing solitaire. I had Bene­detto send over some colored post-­it tabs and a big photocopier with an automatic feeder and I started making piles.</p>
<p>One night, I worked later than I planned. Sushi Jiro was becoming a serious hazard to my waistline and my sleep-­debt, because when your dinner break is ten yards and two doors away from your desk, it’s just too damned easy to get back to work after dinner.</p>
<p>That night, I’d fallen into a cross-­referencing reverie, and before I knew it, it was 2 a.m., my lower back was groaning, and my eyes were stinging.</p>
<p>I straightened, groaned, and slid my laptop into my bag. I found my keys and unlocked the door. The storefront was covered with brown butcher’s paper, but it didn’t go all the way to the edge. I had just a moment to sleepily note that there was some movement visible through the crack in the paper over the glass door when it came flying back toward me, bouncing off my toe, mostly, and my nose, a little. I put my one hand to my face as I instinctively threw myself into the door to close it again.</p>
<p>I was too late and too tired. A strong shoulder on the other side of the doorframe pushed it open and I stumbled back, and then the guy was on me, the door sighing shut behind him on its gas lift as he bore me to the ground and straddled my chest, a move he undertook with the ease of much practice. He pinned my arms under his knees and then gave me a couple of hard hits, one to the jaw, one to the nose.</p>
<p>My lip and nose were bleeding freely and my head was ringing from the hits and from getting smacked into the carpet tiles over concrete when I went down backward. I struggled—­to free my arms, to buck off my attacker, to focus on him.</p>
<p>He was a beefy white guy in his late fifties, with watery dark eyes and a patchy shave that showed gray mixed in with his dark stubble. As he raised his fist for another blow, I saw that he was wearing a big class ring. A minute later, that ring opened my cheek, just under the orbit of my eye.</p>
<p>Apart from some involuntary animal grunts, I hadn’t made a sound. Now I did. “Ow!” I shouted. “Shit!” I shouted. “Stop!” I shouted.</p>
<p>He split my lip again. I bucked hard but I couldn’t budge him. He had a double chin, a gut, and he was strong, and used that bulk to back up his strength. It was like trying to free myself from under a boulder. That kept punching me in the face.</p>
<p>The strip mall would be deserted. Everything was closed, even the vaping store.</p>
<p>Shouting wouldn’t help. I did it anyway. He shut my mouth for me with a left. I gagged on blood.</p>
<p>He took a break from punching me in the face, then. I think he was tired. His chest heaved, and he wiped sweat off his lip with the back of his hand, leaving behind a streaky mustache of my blood.</p>
<p>He <em>contemplated</em> me, weighing me up. I thought maybe he was trying to decide if I had any fight left in me, or perhaps whether I had any valuables he could help himself to.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat and looked at me again. “Goddammit, I messed your face up so bad I can’t tell for sure. I hope to fuck that you’re Martin Hench, though.”</p>
<p>Even with my addled wits, this was an important piece of intelligence: <em>he came here for me</em>. This wasn’t a random act of senseless Los Angeles street violence. This was aimed at <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>I was briefly angry at Benedetto for not warning me that Chuy Flores was such a tough son of a bitch. Then I had the presence of mind to lie.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who the fuck this Mark Hendricks is.” My voice was thick with gargled blood, but I was proud of <em>Mark Hendricks</em>. Pretty fast thinking for a guy with a probable concussion. The guy slapped me open-­handed across the face, and as I lay dazed for a moment, he shifted, reached into my back pocket for my wallet, and yanked it—­and the seat of my pants—­free. Before I could react, his knees were back on my biceps, pinning my arms and shoulders. It was a very neat move, and fast for an old guy like him.</p>
<p>He flipped my wallet open and squinted at it, then held it at arm’s length, then smiled broadly. He had bleach-­white teeth, a row of perfectly uniform caps. Los fucking Angeles, where even the thugs have a million-­dollar smile.</p>
<p>“Shoulda sprung for botox,” I slurred.</p>
<p>His grin got wider. “Maybe someday I will. Got these in trade from a cosmetic dentist I did some work for.” He dropped my wallet. “Listen, Martin Hench, you stay the fuck away from Thames Estuary and Lawrence Coleman.”</p>
<p>“It’s Lionel Coleman,” I said.</p>
<p>“What the fuck ever,” he said. He labored to his feet. I stayed still. He looked at me from a great height, and I stared up his nostrils. Without warning, he kicked my ribs hard enough that I heard one of them crack.</p>
<p>“You’ve been told,” he said to my writhing body, and let himself out.</p>

<em>Last Updated: 2G August 1994</em>

<h2>Author</h2>
	<a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/">
	<address>Patrick R. Michaud, pmichaud@pobox.com</address>
	</a>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
	Strawberry Pop Tarts may be a cheap and inexpensive source of
	incendiary devices.  Toasters which fail to eject Pop Tarts
	cause the Pop Tarts to emit flames 10-18 inches in height.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Last year, an article by well-known newspaper columnist
	<em>Dave Barry</em> noted that <em>Kellogg's Strawberry
	Pop Tarts</em> (SPTs) could be made to emit flames "like a 
	blow torch" if left in a toaster too long.  Given previous 
	work in the field of food-entertainment (see 
	<a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/grape/">
	<em>Fun With Grapes - A Case Study</em></a>), it was obvious
	that this was a new frontier that requires further exploration.  
	The present work describes our independent verification and 
	experience with SPT-based combustion.

<h2>Materials Used</h2>
	Only two basic materials are needed to cause SPT-combustion:
	a (hopefully inexpensive) toaster and some Strawberry Pop Tarts
	(Figure 1).
	In this work, the authors used <em>Kellogg's Strawberry Pop Tarts
	with Real Smucker's Fruit</em>.  SPTs can be obtained either with
	or without frosting; the non-frosted variety were used for this
	experiment.
    <p>
	<a href="https://www.pmichaud.com/toast/toast-1a.gif">
	<img src="https://www.pmichaud.com/toast/toast-1b.gif" alt="Figure 1"><br>
	<strong>Figure 1. Toaster and Strawberry Pop Tarts</strong></a>
    </p><p>
	In addition to the basic materials, a number of safety-related
	items were needed to conduct this experiment.  First, a suitable
	location for the experiment was required, it being expected that
	the kitchen was not the appropriate place for blow-torching SPTs.
	The author's driveway was chosen as a suitable site.  Second,
	an appropriate means for extinguishing the SPTs would be needed;
	a research assistant brought along some baking soda for the
	purpose.

</p><h2>Experiment Preparation</h2>
	The toaster and SPT both had to be properly prepared for this
	experiment.  In order to guarantee that the SPT would receive
	sufficient heat to begin combustion, the toaster was set to
	its highest setting and the lever was jammed in the "down"
	position using adhesive cellophane.  A SPT was removed from
	the box and its protective packaging and carefully placed into
	the toaster slot (Figure 2).
    <p>
	<a href="https://www.pmichaud.com/toast/toast-2a.gif">
	<img src="https://www.pmichaud.com/toast/toast-2c.gif" alt="Figure 2"><br>
	<strong>Figure 2. Preparation of Toaster and SPT</strong></a>
    </p><p>
	Next, the toaster and SPT were taken to the driveway, and an
	extension cord was arranged to provide power to the toaster.
	At this point, we were ready to begin the experiment.
    </p><p> 
	<a href="https://www.pmichaud.com/toast/toast-3a.gif">
	<img src="https://www.pmichaud.com/toast/toast-3c.gif" alt="Figure 3"><br>
	<strong>Figure 3. Toaster Prepared for SPT combustion</strong></a>

</p><h2>The Experiment and Observations</h2>
	The toaster was plugged in.  First the toaster went through a
	normal "toasting" cycle (approximately 60 seconds), 
	which more than thoroughly cooked the SPT (since the toaster 
	was set to its darkest setting).  By this point we could
	definitely detect a burnt SPT aroma.
	The toaster then attempted to eject the SPT, but was prevented from
	doing so by the adhesive cellophane.  The toaster then began
	emitting loud rattling and buzzing noises due to its inability
	to eject the SPT.
    <p>
	(At this point the researchers became somewhat concerned that
	the noise from the toaster would wake the neighbors and
	attract undue attention.  However, we decided that we were
	already committed to the experiment and that the neighbors
	would be able to sacrifice some sleep in the name of science.)
    </p><p>
	Soon thereafter, large amounts of smoke began pouring out of
	the toaster.  The researchers noticed that some of the neighbors
	down the street were beginning to get a little curious, but
	the experiment proceeded nonetheless.  Approximately 40 seconds
	later, small flames began licking their way out of the toaster.
	The flames steadily grew larger and larger until reaching a
	maximum height of about 18 inches above the top of the toaster.
	Figure 4 presents a time-series collage of the flames emitted
	from the SPT.
    </p><p>

	<strong>Figure 4.  Time Series Photograph of Flaming SPT</strong></a>
    </p><p>
	As the flames were reaching their maximum height, the toaster
	abruptly stopped making buzzing noises.  We speculate that the
	flames had by this point shorted the electronics within the
	toaster.  The toaster was quickly disconnected from the primary
	electrical source to avoid any potential damage to the author's
	house.  At this point, the researchers also realized that the
	heat could inadvertently melt the adhesive cellophane and
	cause the flaming SPTs to suddenly eject from the toaster.
	Unfortunately, this did not occur.  The flames continued 
	for several minutes.
    </p><p>
	At this point there was some slight concern that the flames
	might take considerable time to diminish.  We then enlisted the
	help of a reluctant research assistant to sprinkle baking soda
	on the flames.  (The reluctance was understandable given the
	potential for premature SPT ejection described in the above
	paragraph.)  The baking soda quickly extinguished the flames
	and produced still further smoke (Figure 5a).
    </p><p>

	<img src="https://www.pmichaud.com/toast/toast-5c.gif" alt="Figure 5"><br>
	<strong>Figure 5. Extinguising the SPT</strong></a>
    </p><p>
	Once the flames were extinguished, the researchers noted an
	unanticipated problem: what to do with the (now defunct)
	toaster and the spent SPT.  It became obvious that the toaster
	could not be returned to the author's house due to both a 
	continued potential fire hazard and the smell of burnt
	strawberries.  In addition, it was noted that the toaster was
	still "too hot to handle," necessitating the use of a nearby
	garden hose to cool the toaster off.  This is illustrated
	in Figure 5b.  Finally it was decided to just leave the toaster
	by the curb for the sanitation experts to pick up the next
	morning (Figure 6.)

	<strong>Figure 6. Toaster Disposal</strong></a>
    </p><h2>Summary and Recommendations</h2>
	In summary, overcooking the SPT did produce a good size flame.
	The effect was not as pronounced as the researchers had hoped, but
	was satisfying nonetheless.  The research assistant noted that
	the flames produced did appear to have some color variation.
	We believe that frosted SPTs may successfully produce even
	larger torches.  Further research in this area is warranted.
    <p>
	We did desire to repeat the experiment with the remaining five
	SPTs, but we could not do so because there were no more suitable
	toasters available for further experiments.  In the future, we recommend
	that toasters be sold in six-packs to accomodate important
	SPT research.  Instead, the remaining SPTs were sacrified over
	the course of the next several days in private, undocumented
	consumption experiments.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://antelang.org/docs/language/#algebraic-effects">Algebraic Effects</a> are a useful abstraction
for reasoning about effectful programs by letting us leave the interpretation
of these effects to callers. However, most existing literature discusses these
in the context of a pure functional language with pervasive sharing of values.
What restrictions would we need to introduce algebraic effects into a language
with ownership and borrowing - particularly Ante?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<hr>

<p>Consider the following program:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Read</span> <span>a</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>read</span> <span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>

<span>the_value</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>can</span> <span>Read</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>handle</span> <span>f</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>read</span> <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>resume</span> <span>value</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This seems like it’d pass type checking at first glance, but we can easily
construct a program that tries to use the same moved value twice:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>foo</span> <span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>Read</span> <span>String</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>s1</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>s2</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span> <span>()</span>

<span>foo</span> <span>()</span> <span>with</span> <span>the_value</span> <span>"foo"</span>

<span>// The above is sugar for</span>
<span>// the_value "foo" (fn () -&gt; foo ())</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Since a handler’s body may be called multiple times, it may not move any
value in its environment. This restriction is similar to moving values in a loop:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>the_value</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>can</span> <span>Read</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>handle</span> <span>f</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>// Error: Handler body moves `value` which will still</span>
    <span>//         be needed if the handler is called again</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>read</span> <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>resume</span> <span>value</span>
</code></pre></div><hr>
<h2 id="borrowing">Borrowing</h2>
<p>Things get more complicated when we consider borrowing. Although Ante’s references
<a href="https://antelang.org/docs/language/#borrowing">do not have explicit lifetime variables</a>,
we still need to ensure their lifetime is sound.</p>
<h2 id="returning-owning-references">Returning Owning References</h2>
<p>Consider the following program:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>bad</span> <span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>Read</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>own</span> <span>mut</span> <span>Box</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>s1</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span> <span>()</span>

    <span>// Uh-oh, we've just obtained a second mutable owning reference to the same String</span>
    <span>s2</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>s2_inner_ref</span> <span>=</span> <span>as_ref</span> <span>s2</span>

    <span>// Drop the old Box referenced by s1 and s2</span>
    <span>s1</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Box</span><span>.</span><span>of</span> <span>"foo"</span>

    <span>// And now we're printing a dangling reference</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>s2_inner_ref</span>

<span>the_ref</span> <span>(</span><span>ref</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>own</span> <span>mut</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>can</span> <span>Read</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>own</span> <span>mut</span> <span>t</span><span>))</span> <span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span>

<span>my_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>mut</span> <span>Box</span><span>.</span><span>of</span> <span>"bar"</span>
<span>bad</span> <span>()</span> <span>with</span> <span>the_ref</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>my_string</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This breaks the aliasing restriction on <code>&amp;own mut</code> in a way the compiler
cannot verify with existing rules on tracking lifetimes.</p>
<p>The solution to this is that each function using the same <code>Read (&amp;own mut Box String)</code>
effect is considered to borrow from the same effect handler. Attempting to retrieve
two owned, mutable references from the same handler then would be a lifetime error:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>bad</span> <span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>Read</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>own</span> <span>mut</span> <span>Box</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>s1</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span> <span>()</span>

    <span>// Error: Cannot create a new aliased reference with `s1` still in scope</span>

<h2 id="resume">Resume</h2>
<p>One core aspect of effects that we’ve glossed over so far is the <code>resume</code> function
which resumes an effectful computation from the handler. Since <code>resume</code> refers to an
in-progress computation, we need a way to safely encode this environment, yet we
need to do so when defining the effect before the environment is known.
What type should be given to <code>resume</code>?</p>
<p>Consider the following code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Fork</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>fork</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>

<span>foo</span> <span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>Fork</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>"branch"</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>fork</span> <span>()</span> <span>then</span>
        <span>print</span> <span>"${message} A"</span>
        <span>drop</span> <span>message</span>
    <span>else</span>
        <span>print</span> <span>"${message} B"</span>

<span>handle_fork</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>can</span> <span>Fork</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>handle</span> <span>f</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>fork</span> <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>// Run `resume` twice, arbitrarily returning the second result</span>
        <span>resume</span> <span>true</span>
        <span>resume</span> <span>false</span>

<span>handle_fork</span> <span>foo</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After resuming from the <code>fork</code> the second time, we enter the false branch.
When doing so, <code>message</code> has already been moved, so we’d be reading from an
already-dropped value.</p>
<p>This is the problem the different closure types already solve. We just need
some way to determine if <code>resume</code> should be a <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, or <code>FnOnce</code> since
we cannot know this within the handler itself.</p>
<p>One possibility is to require this in the definition of <code>Fork</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Fork</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>fork</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>

    <span>// The underscores here are because we're omitting the closure environment</span>
    <span>// type as well as the actual function type - which is derived from fork's type.</span>
    <span>// Although the environment type can be specified if desired, the function type of resume</span>
    <span>// must be omitted because its return type will be the handler type, which is</span>
    <span>// not known at this point.</span>
    <span>fork</span><span>.</span><span>resume</span><span>:</span> <span>FnMut</span> <span>_</span> <span>_</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that <code>fork</code> is still callable without restrictions.
It is only <code>resume</code> that will be a <code>FnMut</code> when it is introduced.</p>
<p>Anyways, now we’d get an error when writing <code>foo</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>foo</span> <span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>Fork</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>"branch"</span>

    <span>// Error: `fork` can be resumed multiple times, but `message` would</span>
    <span>//         possibly be moved after the first call to `resume`.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>fork</span> <span>()</span> <span>then</span>
        <span>print</span> <span>"${message} A"</span>
        <span>// Note: `message` is moved here</span>
        <span>drop</span> <span>message</span>
    <span>else</span>
        <span>print</span> <span>"${message} B"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Since this error would otherwise be much more common, <code>resume</code> is by
default a <code>FnOnce</code> unless otherwise specified. This means when defining
an effect we will need to think about what kinds of effect handlers we
want to permit.</p>
<p>Also note that after removing <code>drop</code>, <code>message</code> will not be dropped at the
end of <code>foo</code>. Instead, it is part of <code>resume</code>’s environment and will be dropped
after the last use of <code>resume</code> in the effect handler.</p>
<h2 id="environment-type-quantification">Environment Type Quantification</h2>
<p>Most effects which give an explicit type for <code>resume</code> will either omit the
environment type, or specify it as a type variable quantified over the function:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>resume</span><span>:</span> <span>FnOnce</span> <span>env</span> <span>_</span>

    <span>// The above means:</span>
    <span>// foo.resume: forall env. FnOnce env _</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is generally desired since it allows the <code>resume</code> closure to be unboxed most
of the time. However, what would happen if the user wrote the trait as the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>env</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>resume</span><span>:</span> <span>FnOnce</span> <span>env</span> <span>_</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Since each generic instance of a trait would be separate (e.g. <code>Read I32</code> versus <code>Read String</code>),
each use of this effect with a different environment would be a separate effect:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>forced_example</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>I32</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>foo</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>foo</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Above, <code>forced_example</code> would be inferred to have the effects <code>Foo Env1</code> and <code>Foo Env2</code> where
<code>Env1</code> and <code>Env2</code> are both opaque types representing the environments. Since each of these would
need to be handled by separate effect handlers, this technique could be used to limit an effect
to being called at most once per handler. It remains to be seen how useful this would be however.</p>
<h2 id="restricting-the-environment-type">Restricting the environment type</h2>
<p>If any capabilities are required on the <code>resume</code> closure, a <code>given</code> clause can be added.
Since most traits on closures are defined as long as they’re defined on the closure environment,
it is usually sufficient to require the trait on the closure environment alone:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>FooCloneEnv</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>resume</span><span>:</span> <span>FnOnce</span> <span>env</span> <span>_</span> <span>given</span> <span>Clone</span> <span>env</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that since <code>resume</code> is a continuation, this environment type includes any captured variables
across other function calls as well. So the <code>Clone</code> constraint above would also apply to
the <code>vec</code> variable below:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>inner_fn</span> <span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>FooCloneEnv</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>// x may be cloned</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
    <span>foo</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>x</span>

<span>outer_fn</span> <span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>FooCloneEnv</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>// vec may also be cloned</span>
    <span>vec</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vec</span><span>.</span><span>of</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span>
    <span>function2</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>vec</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Since environment types can grow quite large, it is generally recommended to avoid cloning
<code>resume</code>. A more useful trait constraint on <code>resume</code> is covered in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="polymorphic-effects">Polymorphic Effects</h2>
<p>Ante also enables functions to be polymorphic over their effects.
For example, the <code>map</code> function has the type:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>Stream</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>FnMut</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>can</span> <span>e</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>Emit</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>e</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now, recalling the <code>FooCloneEnv</code> example from earlier:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>inner_fn</span> <span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>FooCloneEnv</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>// x may be cloned</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
    <span>foo</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>x</span>

<span>outer_fn</span> <span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>FooCloneEnv</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>function2</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>vec</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This works fine, but how could we pass a function such as <code>outer_fn</code> to
<code>map</code>? The effect variable <code>e</code> would be instantiated to <code>FooCloneEnv</code> but
now we’d also need to know if the environment of <code>map</code> when it calls the
passed-in function is clone-able. In the most general case, we’d need to
be able to verify any trait from <code>map</code> and whether it can allow the function
used to resume multiple times or not.</p>
<p>We’d have to add these constraints to the effect variables directly:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback">map: Stream a -&gt; FnMut a =&gt; b can e -&gt; Unit
    given Clone e, Send e, Fn e.resume _
    can Emit b, e
</code></pre></div><p>This is a big hit to the usability of effects in this scheme since these constraints
would have to be manually specified on <code>map</code> for its contents to be checked. If not
specified, a new version of <code>map</code> would have to be written with a <code>Send</code>able environment
or similar. This will inevitably lead to some duplication when using effects that algebraic
effect handlers are usually meant to remove.</p>
<p>In a later article, we’ll focus on ways to simplify the usability of this scheme by
providing sane defaults where possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="implementation-details-and-boxing">Implementation Details and Boxing</h2>
<p>So far, each of the rules covered above should apply to any language with effects,
ownership, and borrowing. Different implementations of effects can have wildly
different runtime costs however.</p>
<p>For example, most languages implementing the full spectrum of algebraic effects
will keep track of the stack of effect handlers at runtime. When an effect call
is made, a lookup needs to be performed then the code needs to jump to the relevant
handler and back. This may be done by jumping up the call stack and copying stack frames or
by converting effectful functions to continuation passing style (CPS) - like Ante does.</p>
<p>Languages without algebraic effects aren’t completely free from the costs of effects
either though. Even if we restrict ourselves to just the <code>async</code> effect, we can
see plenty of languages which include it - each with its own unique implementation
and performance characteristics.</p>
<p>Consider Rust’s <code>async</code> effect which is implemented by compiling async functions
to state machines. In this scheme, the following code is rejected:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>async</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>recursive</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span><span>    </span><span>recursive</span><span>().</span><span>await</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Because the resulting state machine would have infinite size:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>Recursive</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>First</span><span>(</span><span>Recursive</span><span>),</span><span>

The performance characteristics here look quite different - but that is
because in Ante they’re largely determined by the handler that is used

    <span>print</span> <span>"done"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Here we can see the inner continuation captures the outer continuation <code>k</code>.</p>
<p>To give <code>k</code> a valid type, we’d need to box it to ensure it always has the
same size for each recursive call. This is similar to what we’d need to do
in the Rust example, but there are some unique problems with requiring users manually
box these continuations in Ante:</p>
<ul>
<li>The continuation is added by the compiler, so it isn’t clear to the user where
they should add the boxing.</li>
<li>Whether boxing is required is dependent on the structure of the handler. We don’t
want to always add boxing since tail-resume is the more common case.</li>
</ul>
<p>We could try to get around this by marking whether a given effect must have a tail-resumptive
handler or not, and requiring recursive functions using non-tail-resumptive handlers to
box their continuations somehow. This would make effects much more cumbersome to use however,
and one of Ante’s goals is to be a slightly <em>higher</em> level language than Rust. If effects are
not simple to use then users will avoid them.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the current plan is for the compiler to automatically insert boxing
of closures where appropriate and infer their lifetimes via <a href="https://antelang.org/docs/ideas/#lifetime-inference">lifetime inference</a>.
Lifetime inference is a very interesting topic to me - it was one of Ante’s original goals
to experiment with it. When it works well it can be great since it can stack-allocate
potentially even to prior stack frames. The downside is that the inferred lifetimes can be imprecise.
Although, in this case, if lifetimes cannot be accurately inferred, we would still know
their longest possible lifetime is that of the effect handler.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
This is a topic that deserves much more detail though so I’ll leave it to a future
blog post. If you’re still curious, there are some papers on it reachable from the documentation link above.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <article> <time datetime="2024-02-19T00:00:00+00:00"> Feb 19th, 2024 </time>  <p>I recently stumbled upon a <a href="https://blog.goose.love/posts/tictactoe/">blog post</a> by Alejandra González (a.k.a <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@blyxyas">@blyxyas</a>) that seeks to compress a tic-tac-toe game state into as few bits as possible. She arrived at a solution in 18 bits. This got me thinking, can we do better?</p> <p>As Alejandra points out, there are 765 possible game states<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. We could simply assign a number to all of the sates, which would take up 10 bits<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. But in Alejandra’s words, that’s “boring.” More specifically, there’s not much we can do with a representation like that. Whether we want to read the value of a given cell or update from one state to another, in practice we’re going to need a lookup table to map each number to a larger, more structured representation, which defeats the whole idea behind a compressed representation.</p> <figure> <img src="https://cbarrick.dev/assets/tic-tac-toe-game.svg" alt="A game of tic-tac-toe" width="100%"> <figcaption> A game of tic-tac-toe / © <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Stannered">User:Stannered</a> / <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Commons</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-BY-SA-3.0</a> </figcaption> </figure> <h3 id="an-18-bit-solution">An 18 bit solution</h3> <p>Alejandra came up with a better solution, where each cell is represented by a pair of bits, and the grid is represented as a concatenation of nine of these bit pairs. Within a bit pair, one bit represents a circle and the other represents a cross; at most one bit of the pair can be set.</p> <div><pre><code><span>// The representation of a single cell.</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>cell</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>EMPTY</span>  <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>// Binary 00</span>

<span>// The concatenation of 9 cells. We only care about the lower 18 bits.</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>state</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>The core methods that we would like to have on our state type are getting and setting cell values at a given index. This is pretty easy to implement with some quick bit-twiddling.</p> <div><pre><code><span>cell</span> <span>get_cell</span><span>(</span><span>state</span> <span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span>        <span>// Bit offset of cell i.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>  <span>// Read the cell.</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>set_cell</span><span>(</span><span>state</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>cell</span> <span>val</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span>    <span>// Bit offset of cell i.</span>
    <span>*</span><span>s</span> <span>&amp;=</span> <span>~</span><span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>pos</span><span>);</span>  <span>// Clear the old value.</span>
    <span>*</span><span>s</span> <span>|=</span> <span>val</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>pos</span><span>;</span>   <span>// Set the new value.</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>This is a fantastic, efficient solution.</p> <h3 id="getting-smaller-with-base-3">Getting smaller with base-3</h3> <p>In practice, the number of bits in an integer needs to be a power of two. In the code above, we used a 32 bit integer to hold our state, when we really only needed 18 bits. If we could save just two more bits, we could cut our memory usage in half by using a 16 bit integer for the game state.</p> <p>In the code above, we’ve conceived the game state as the concatenation of nine cell states. This is a good idea because it makes it simple to implement our core methods. We can think of this as a base-4 number where each cell state is a base-4 digit having values 0 (empty), 1 (cross), 2 (circle), and 3 (invalid). This conception shows up in the code too, where we convert our base-4 index into a base-2 index by multiplying it by 2, so that we can use bitwise operations to access the data.</p> <p>The problem is that pesky invalid cell state. What if we instead conceive the game state as a base-3 number and a cell state as a base-3 digit? In this case we need nine base-3 digits, which maxes out at \(3^9-1\) or 19,682. Representing this in binary will cost us… 15 bits<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>!</p> <p>So we can use a base-3 representation to hit our 16 bit target. But how do we implement our methods?</p> <p>The trick is to generalize our bit-twiddling to arbitrary bases. In binary, the left-shift operation <code>x &lt;&lt; i</code> is equivalent to \(x \cdot 2^i\), and likewise the right-shift operation <code>x &gt;&gt; i</code> is equivalent to \(x \div 2^i \). To generalize these operations from base-2 to base-n, just replace 2 with n. For the other bitwise operations, we can use a combination of addition and subtraction.</p> <p>The new code looks like this:</p> <div><pre><code><span>// The representation of a single cell.</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>cell</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>EMPTY</span>  <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>

</code></pre></div> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>Is this any better? It depends, but probably not.</p> <p>If you had a very large number of game states that you needed to store, you could pack them tightly using 18 bits for the base-4 representation or 15 bits for the base-3 representation. That’s a savings of 16%, which may or may not be worth it.</p> <p>And if you’re chosing a representation for CPU performance, then the base-4 representation wins hands down. The base-3 representation has a lof of multiplication and division that can’t be easily optimized away.</p> <p>But if you had some wild application where you needed to keep trillions of game states unpacked in memory, then sure, use base-3.</p> <p>This is a wild case of premature optimization that nobody asked for. 😅</p> <p>You can find <a href="https://gist.github.com/cbarrick/8c5726dcca7f5f1e436585e672bc7f1f">test cases on GitHub</a>.</p>  </article> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Small Modular Reactor (SMR) construction shifts into high gear, as UK company Sheffield Forgemasters welds a full-size nuclear reactor vessel in under 24 hours instead of the usual 12 months. The rollout of this game-changing tech could be massive.</p><p>Modular reactors have the potential to revolutionize the nuclear power industry by turning nuclear generating plants from major civil engineering projects to factory-produced commodities. Instead of being essentially one-offs, modular reactors have a standardized design, can be mass produced, installed in any number required to serve local needs, and don't require the incredibly expensive buildings conventional reactors depend upon.</p><p>The problem is that there are bottlenecks in how to build reactors of any size. One is welding the vessels used to contain the reactor core, isolating it from the outer environment. Using conventional techniques, this can take over a year, but Sheffield Forgemasters have reduced this to under a day using what is called Local Electron-Beam Welding (LEBW) to complete four thick, nuclear-grade welds.</p><p>LEBW is a revolutionary method to weld two pieces of metal together using a high-energy density fusion process centered on a high-powered electron gun operating in a local vacuum. This melts and fuses components to one another and allows for an efficiency of 95%, deep penetration, and a high depth-to-width ratio.</p><p>The upshot is that Sheffield Forgemasters was able to complete a vessel three meters (10 ft) in diameter with 200-mm (8-in) thick walls with what is claimed to be zero defects and at lower costs. In addition, the welding machine can handle innovative sloping-in and sloping-out techniques to start and finish the weld.</p><p>This demonstration, a world first, is a significant milestone for the British nuclear sector, which has been moribund for decades with advances only in reactors for nuclear submarines, a couple of showcase power plants, and nuclear fuel processing. Now, the UK government is looking toward a nuclear renaissance, with new plants planned – including 15 modular reactors to be constructed by <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/rolls-royce-plans-mini-nuclear-reactors-in-britain/" data-cms-ai="0">Rolls-Royce</a>.</p><p>"The implication of this technology within the nuclear industry is monumental, potentially taking high-cost welding processes out of the equation," said Michael Blackmore, Senior Development Engineer and Project lead. "Not only does this reduce the need for weld-inspections, because the weld-join replicates the parent material, but it could also dramatically speed up the roll-out of SMR reactors across the UK and beyond, that’s how disruptive the LEBW breakthrough is."</p><p>Source: <a href="https://bdaily.co.uk/articles/2024/02/19/sheffield-forgemasters-announces-global-leap-in-nuclear-welding-technology" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Sheffield Forgemasters</a></p></div></div>]]></description>
