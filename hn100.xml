So I thought to myself:</p><blockquote><p>When Everybody Is Digging for Gold, It’s Good To Be in the Pick and Shovel Business</p></blockquote><p>I had experience with designing and building different web apps so I know exactly what I wanted to do full time - <b>make Shopify apps</b>. ✨ </p><p>✍️&nbsp;I drew the following plan:</p><ol start="1"><li>Create a small Shopify app and get some customers to get a feel for the market</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Create a bigger Shopify app that’s successful and generates enough money so I don’t have to be worried about working for a living</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Create a business that changes the game</li></ol><p><em>( Future me is so proud to see points 1 and 2 completed ✅&nbsp;</em>🙏<em> )</em></p><p>So I got thinking.

And it worked! </p><p>Over the next couple of months I got a couple of hundred of merchants and I was making $1k-$2k a month from it.

        <h2>About AlpacaEval</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval" target="_blank">AlpacaEval</a>
            an LLM-based automatic evaluation that is fast, cheap, and reliable.
            It is based on the
            <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/05/22/alpaca-farm.html">AlpacaFarm</a>
            evaluation set,
            which tests the ability of models to follow general user instructions.
            These responses are then compared to reference Davinci003 responses by
            the provided GPT-4 or Claude or ChatGPT based auto-annotators,
            which results in the win rates presented above.
            AlpacaEval displays a high agreement rate with ground truth human annotations,
            and leaderboard rankings on AlpacaEval are very correlated with leaderboard rankings
            based on human annotators.
            Please see our
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#analysis" target="_blank">documentation</a>
            for more details on our analysis.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding new models</h2>
        <p>
            We welcome new model contributions to the leaderboard from the community!
            To do so, please follow the steps in the
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#contributing" target="_blank">contributions
                section</a>.
            Specifically, you'll need to run the model on the evaluation set,
            auto-annotate the outputs, and submit a PR with the model config and leaderboard results.
            We've also set up a
            <a href="https://discord.gg/GJMxJSVZZM" target="_blank">Discord</a>
            for community support and discussion.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding new evaluators or eval sets </h2>
        <p>
            We also welcome contributions for new evaluators or new eval sets!
            For making new evaluators, we release our ground-truth
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#data-release" target="_blank">human annotations</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#analyzing-an-evaluator" target="_blank">comparison
            metrics</a>.
            We also release a
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#analyzing-an-eval-set" target="_blank">rough guide</a>
            to follow for making new eval sets.
            We specifically encourage contributions for harder instructions distributions and for safety testing of
            LLMs.
        </p>
        <h2>AlpacaEval limitations</h2>
        <p>
            While AlpacaEval provides a useful comparison of model capabilities in following instructions,
            it is not a comprehensive or gold-standard evaluation of model abilities.
            For one, as detailed in the
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14387" target="_blank">AlpacaFarm paper</a>,
            the auto annotator winrates are correlated with length.
            Though human annotations also display this bias,
            it is unclear if more verbose answers add utility in downstream tasks.
            Additionally, the AlpacaFarm eval set, though diverse, consists mainly of simple instructions.
            We encourage the community to contribute new, more complex eval sets, such as for tool use.
            Finally, AlpacaEval does not evaluate the safety of any of the models.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
              <p>In a paper posted on arXiv on 2023-07-23, three researchers from the Quantum Energy Research Centre, Inc. and KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, report the production and test of a lead-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite">apatite</a> material which they claim exhibits all of the phenomena of superconductivity at room temperatures and above (they state its critical temperature, below which it is a superconductor, as 400 K, or 127° C) and ambient atmospheric pressure at sea level.  Here is the paper.</p>


<p>Full text, in PDF form, is available at the link.  The abstract is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the room-temperature superconductor (<span>T_c\geq 400 {\rm K}</span>, 127∘ C) working at ambient pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. The superconductivity of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature (<span>T_c</span>), Zero-resistivity, Critical current (<span>I_c</span>), Critical magnetic field (<span>H_c</span>), and the Meissner effect. The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute structural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), not by external factors such as temperature and pressure. The shrinkage is caused by <span>{\rm Cu}^{2+}</span> substitution of <span>{\rm Pb2}^{+}</span>(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate and it generates the stress. It concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the cylindrical column resulting in distortion of the cylindrical column interface, which creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat capacity results indicated that the new model is suitable for explaining the superconductivity of LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99 that allows the minute distorted structure to be maintained in the interfaces is the most important factor that LK-99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity at room temperatures and ambient pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These illustrations from the paper show the structure of the synthesised material.</p>

<p>This paper is the first scientific disclosure of these results.  The posting on arXiv lists no submission to or acceptance of the paper by a peer-reviewed journal.  However, <a href="https://scanalyst.fourmilab.ch/u/ctlaw">@CTLaw</a> has found three filings with the Korean patent office regarding this work, all filed in March 2023 with a “Priority date” (whatever that is) of 2021-08-25:</p>

<p>This silent video from the Quantum Energy Research Centre, institution of two of the co-authors, purports to show repulsion of a copper disc with a thermally deposited coating of the LK-99 material from a permanent magnet, as would be expected to occur from a superconductor manifesting the Meissner effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtVjGWpbE7k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <img src="https://scanalyst.fourmilab.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c041c1386da5be461c67b3717899195072130095.jpeg" title="Magnetic Property Test of LK-99 Film" data-dominant-color="555953" width="690" height="388">
  </a>
</p>

<p>Another video, which cannot be embedded here, claims to show levitation of a sample of LK-99 above a permanent magnet: “<a href="https://sciencecast.org/casts/suc384jly50n">Superconductor <span>{\rm Pb}_{10−x}{\rm ​Cu}_x​({\rm PO}_4​)_{6 O}​</span> showing levitation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and mechanism</a>”.  Note that the corner of the material never actually rises above the magnet.</p>
<p>In both of these magnetic repulsion videos, keep in mind that magnetic repulsion and/or levitation are not, by themselves, probative of superconductivity: a diamagnetic material such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolytic_carbon#Magnetic_levitation">pyrolytic graphite</a>, <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2013-03/001428.html">can be made to levitate</a> in a magnetic field without being superconductive.</p>
<p>Here are some additional causes for caution by “some guy on the Internet”.</p>

</ul>
<p>Unlike earlier claims, which were based upon material under extreme pressure in a diamond anvil cell, this paper claims superconductivity under ordinary laboratory conditions, and rather than exotic materials such as lutetium hydride compounds, uses a phosphate of lead doped with copper, which a competent chemist should be able to whip up and test for themselves, which I presume is going on as I write in laboratories around the world.</p>
<p>There’s no need among this audience to explain the technological consequences of discovery of room temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity.  If the effect is genuine, and materials can be engineered which retain their superconductivity under the high magnetic fields of power transmissions (which has been a limitation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuprate_superconductor">cuprate superconductors</a> that operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures), this may spark a revolution in electronics as significant as the invention of the transistor, vacuum tube, and induction motor.</p>
<p>We’ll see.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Google's Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal, according to one of the developers working on the controversial fraud fighting project, aims to make the web "more private and safe."</p>
<p>Ben Wiser, a software engineer at the Chocolate Factory, responded on Wednesday to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/25/google_web_environment_integrity">serious concerns</a> about the proposal by insisting that WEI aims to address online fraud and abuse without the privacy harms enabled by browser fingerprinting and cross-site tracking.</p>
<p>"The WEI experiment is part of a larger goal to keep the web safe and open while discouraging cross-site tracking and lessening the reliance on fingerprinting for combating fraud and abuse," he explained in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues/28#issuecomment-1651129388">GitHub Issues post</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The WEI experiment is part of a larger goal to keep the web safe and open</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Fraud detection and mitigation techniques often rely heavily on analyzing unique client behavior over time for anomalies, which involves large collection of client data from both human users and suspected automated clients."</p>
<p>WEI is an attestation scheme. It provides a way for a web publisher to add code to a website or app that checks with a trusted third party, like Google, to see whether a visitor's software and hardware stack meets certain criteria to be deemed authentic.</p>

    

<p>Technically speaking, attestation is just a matter of transmitting <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949">a token</a> with a value – derived from as-yet-undisclosed hardware and software characteristics – that indicates whether or not the client is trustworthy. It's then up to the website publisher to decide how to respond to that signal.</p>

        


        

<p>In theory, if effectively implemented, WEI could allow a web game publisher to check whether game players are cheating through the use of unsanctioned hardware or software. Or it might be used by a content publisher to check whether ads are being displayed to real visitors or fraudulent bots.</p>
<p>The worry is that WEI could potentially be used to disallow ad blocking, to block certain browsers, to limit web scraping (still largely legal, though often disallowed under websites' terms-of-service), to exclude software for downloading YouTube videos or other content, and impose other limitations on otherwise lawful web activities.</p>

        

<p>What WEI's attestation check actually looks for has not been revealed. Nor is it evident from the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/6f47a22906b2899412e79a2727355efa9cc8f5bd">WEI code</a> that has been added to the Chromium open source project. But Wisner insists, "WEI is not designed to single out browsers or extensions" and is not designed to block browsers that spoof their identity.</p>
<p>However, the intended use of a technology isn't necessarily a limitation on it being employed in tricky new ways.</p>
<h3>Sounding the alarm</h3>
<p>Those in the technical community who have expressed alarm about the proposal argue that the web should not be brought under a permission-based regime, where a third party renders judgment on the worthiness of users – without consultation, based on opaque criteria.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The use cases listed seem very reasonable, the solution proposed is absolutely terrible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The idea of it is as simple as it is dangerous. It would provide websites with an API telling them whether the browser and the platform it is running on that is currently in use is trusted by an authoritative third party (called an attester)," wrote Julien Picalausa, a software developer at browser maker Vivaldi, in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/googles-new-dangerous-web-environment-integrity-spec/">a post</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The details are nebulous, but the goal seems to be to prevent 'fake' interactions with websites of all kinds. While this seems like a noble motivation, and the use cases listed seem very reasonable, the solution proposed is absolutely terrible and has already been equated with DRM for websites, with all that it implies."</p>
<p>Dangerous though the idea may be, attestation has already been implemented on native platforms (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity">Android</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_server">iOS</a>) – some would say autocratic regimes compared to the relatively open web.</p>

</ul>
<p>But attestation has even made it to the web. Tim Perry, creator of dev tool HTTP Toolkit, noted in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/apple-private-access-tokens-attestation/">blog post</a> on Tuesday that Apple offers <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=huqjyh7k">Private Access Tokens</a> for its Safari browser. Network security firm Cloudflare uses Private Access Tokens as a way to avoid showing people CAPTCHA puzzles to prove that they're not robots.</p>
<p>Perry argues that Apple's scheme is less of a concern because Safari's market share (~20 percent of mobile and desktop browsers) is far less than Chrome/Chromium (~70 percent of web clients). Nonetheless, he opposes attestation for being fundamentally anti-competitive.</p>

        

<p>"Fraud and bots on the web are a real problem, and discussion on ways to defend against that is totally reasonable, and often very valuable!" Perry declared.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Removing all user control over their own devices is not a reasonable tradeoff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"It's a hard problem. That said, this has to be carefully balanced against the health of the web itself. Blocking competition, hamstringing open source and the open web, and removing all user control over their own devices is not a reasonable tradeoff."</p>
<p>Google considers Apple Private Access Tokens to be too private. The WEI proposal says, "due to the fully masked tokens, this technology assumes that the attester can produce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from websites about gaps such as false positives or false negatives."</p>
<p>Apple's Private Access Tokens <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/">do not involve the exchange of device data</a> between the device maker (Apple, as an attester) and Cloudflare. Google argues that masking token data in this manner denies feedback from websites involved in the attestation process that may be able to use withheld device data to minimize incorrect trust verdicts.</p>
<p>In fact, Wiser suggests privacy improvements are what prompted WEI. "Privacy features like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/">user-agent reduction</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ip-protection">IP reduction</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/storage-partitioning/">preventing cross-site storage</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/3-fingerprint-randomization/">fingerprint randomization</a> make it more difficult to distinguish or reidentify individual clients, which is great for privacy, but makes fighting fraud more difficult," he claimed.</p>
<p>The result of this, he argues, is that websites – determined to fight fraud – have responded by increasing their usage of sign-in gates, invasive fingerprinting techniques, and intrusive challenges like CAPTCHAs and SMS verification. Wiser argues these defenses make the web experience worse.</p>
<p>"We believe this is a tough problem to solve, but a very important one that we will continue to work on. We will continue to design, discuss, and debate in public," he said.</p>
<h3>A fundamental flaw</h3>
<p>Jon von Tetzchner, CEO of Vivaldi, told <em>The Register</em> in an interview that while Google has yet to specify exactly what WEI will be measuring to render trust verdicts, the details don't really matter – the entire approach is flawed.</p>
<p>"A big part of the reason why there is a problem is the surveillance economy," he explained, "and the solution to the surveillance economy seems to be more surveillance."</p>
<p>Von Tetzchner said that Google wants to know who is seeing its ads when it should, in his opinion, focus on where its ads get shown – often on web spam pages to be viewed by bots involved in ad fraud.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The solution is to get away from the surveillance economy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He recalled when he was involved with the Opera browser and had to deal with Google Docs not working on the browser. "When we started with Vivaldi, my thinking was okay, we are using Chromium, this is not going to be a problem," he said.</p>
<p>But compatibility issues remained, he said, and Vivaldi had to hide its identity (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://vivaldi.com/press/releases/vivaldi-2-10-no-strings-attached/">spoof its default User-Agent string</a>) to enable users to access popular Google services. And he's concerned WEI represents more of the same.</p>
<p>Von Tetzchner argues that attestation is not the proper response to online fraud.</p>
<p>"I just don't think this is a solution," he said. "The solution is to get away from the surveillance economy. We've been trying to ban the surveillance economy and ban the collection of data and making profiles on end users and utilizing it for advertisements. I really don't really see any reason why that should be legal in society.</p>
<p>"The surveillance economy is highly toxic," he added. "It has created significant issues for society. And I think that the obvious thing should be to stop using the technology. It doesn't make any sense to use it and there are other ways to do advertising that work just as well. But there is a lot of money for certain companies and they don't want to give up what they have." ®</p>

<p>How cool is this! Popularized in England, these wavy walls actually use less bricks than a straight wall because they can be made just one brick thin, while a straight wall—without buttresses—would easily topple over. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinkle_crankle_wall">Wikipedia</a>, these wavy walls are also known as: crinkle crankle walls, crinkum crankum walls, serpentine walls, or ribbon walls. The alternate convex and concave curves in the wall provide stability and help it to resist lateral forces. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinkle_crankle_wall">source</a>]</p>
<p>The county of Suffolk seems to be home to countless examples of these crinkle crankle walls. On <a href="http://www.freston.net/blog/index.php?y=2016&amp;m=01&amp;d=04">freston.net</a> you can find 100 wavy walls that have been documented and photographed. In the United States, the best known serpentine wall can be found at the University of Virginia where Thomas Jefferson incorporated the wavy walls into the architecture. Although some authorities claim that Jefferson invented this design, he was merely adapting a well-established English style of construction. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinkle_crankle_wall">source</a>]</p>
<p>As for the mathematics behind these serpentine walls and why the waves make them more resistant to horizontal forces like wind vs straight walls, check out this post by <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/11/19/crinkle-crankle-calculus/">John D. Cook</a>.</p>
<p>Below you will find additional examples of these intriguing wavy walls that lawnmowers surely detest! </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The European Commission is opening a formal antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s bundling of its Teams software with its Office productivity suite. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333989/slack-microsoft-eu-competition-complaint-teams-office">Slack originally filed an anti-competitive complaint</a> against Microsoft with the European Commission in July 2020, just months after a global pandemic began and the Microsoft Teams userbase started to grow rapidly.</p><p>The European Commission will <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3991">now carry out an in-depth investigation</a> into whether Microsoft may have breached EU competition rules by tying or bundling Microsoft Teams to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.</p><p>“Remote communication and collaboration tools like Teams have become indispensable for many businesses in Europe,” explains Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of competition policy at the European Commission. “We must therefore ensure that the markets for these products remain competitive, and companies are free to choose the products that best meet their needs. This is why we are investigating whether Microsoft’s tying of its productivity suites with Teams may be in breach of EU competition rules.”</p><p>Microsoft has responded to the EU’s complaint. “We respect the European Commission’s work on this case and take our own responsibilities very seriously,” says Microsoft spokesperson Robin Koch, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “We will continue to cooperate with the Commission and remain committed to finding solutions that will address its concerns.”</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Microsoft Teams stock" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/376x251/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/384x256/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/415x277/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/480x320/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/540x360/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/640x427/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/750x500/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/828x552/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1080x720/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1200x800/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1440x960/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1920x1280/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/2048x1365/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/2400x1600/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/2400x1600/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>Microsoft has previously bundled Teams with its Office subscriptions.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333989/slack-microsoft-eu-competition-complaint-teams-office">Slack’s original complaint</a> alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.” Now EU regulators are fully investigating the situation, after Microsoft reportedly offered a concession to the EU to stop bundling Teams with Office. This clearly wasn’t enough to avoid an official antitrust investigation — the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/014172b7-d125-442a-addd-85b7a71d34b1"><em>Financial Times </em>reported</a> recently that EU regulators and Microsoft couldn’t agree on whether the removal of bundling would be limited to just the EU and how prices might be impacted to ensure competition is still fair.</p><p>Microsoft also recently decided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23761859/microsoft-windows-11-teams-chat-integration-deprecation">remove its Microsoft Teams integration in Windows 11</a>. The Chat functionality in Windows 11 was only ever available for consumers and not the key enterprise users that were the focus of Slack’s complaint. But Microsoft could have enabled enterprise support in the future in this built-in version, and it’s possible the EU probe might have spooked Microsoft into killing the integration altogether. </p><p>This is the first time Microsoft has faced an antitrust investigation in the EU for nearly 15 years, following two big cases related to Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer bundling. In 2004 the European Commission ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without Media Player bundled. This resulted in a Windows XP N version available in EU markets. </p><p>In 2009, the EU also investigated the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows and Microsoft ended up selling a Windows 7 E version of its operating system in Europe without Internet Explorer bundled. Microsoft was also forced to implement a&nbsp;browser ballot box&nbsp;in its Windows operating system to ensure users were presented with a choice of web browsers.&nbsp;Microsoft was eventually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/6/4069126/eu-fines-microsoft-for-windows-7-sp1-browser-ballot">fined $730 million</a> for failing to include the browser ballot in Windows 7 SP1.</p><p><em><strong>Update, July 27th 8:08AM ET</strong>: Article updated with comment from Microsoft.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="paragraph-0">AUSTIN, Texas</p>
<p id="paragraph-1">In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.</p>
<p id="paragraph-2">He soon realized he was sometimes&nbsp;getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.</p>
<p id="paragraph-3">“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.</p>
<p id="paragraph-4">Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-5">What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.</p>
<p id="paragraph-6">The Austin, Texas-based&nbsp;electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-8">Inside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.</p>
<p id="paragraph-9">Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.</p>
<p id="paragraph-10">In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.</p>
<p id="paragraph-11">Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.</p>

<p id="paragraph-13">Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.</p>
<p id="paragraph-14">Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-15">The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-16">“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-17">Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.</p>
<p id="paragraph-18">Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-20">At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.</p>
<p id="paragraph-21">Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel&nbsp;before their batteries run out.</p>
<p id="paragraph-22"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/south-korea-fines-tesla-22-mln-exaggerating-driving-range-evs-2023-01-03/" id="article-link-0">Tesla was fined</a> earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models&nbsp;averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.</p>
<p id="paragraph-23">The U.S. Environmental&nbsp;Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.</p>
<p id="paragraph-24">Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their&nbsp;estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.</p>
<p id="paragraph-25">Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures.&nbsp;Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.</p>
<p id="paragraph-26">Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.</p>
<p id="paragraph-27">Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/range" id="article-link-1">“Range Tips”</a> section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.</p>
<p id="paragraph-28">Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-29">Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters – &nbsp;including&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.</p>
<p id="paragraph-30">Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-32">Failed tests and false advertising</p>
<p id="paragraph-33">Tesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.</p>
<p id="paragraph-34">One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a <a href="https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2023-01-0349/" id="article-link-2">study</a> of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.</p>
<p id="paragraph-35">The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.</p>
<p id="paragraph-36">The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-37">Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.</p>

    <blockquote id="JEUJMAJ611_4">
        <p>“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-39">EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers&nbsp;can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.</p>
<p id="paragraph-40">Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-41">Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it&nbsp;believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.</p>
<p id="paragraph-42">Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-44">Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.</p>
<p id="paragraph-45">EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.</p>
<p id="paragraph-46">The&nbsp;EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers.&nbsp;“That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market &nbsp;and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-47">The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.</p>
<p id="paragraph-48">Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-49">“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-50">Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone&nbsp;after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.</p>
<p id="paragraph-51">All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.</p>
<p id="paragraph-52">Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.</p>
<p id="paragraph-53">Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/testing-teslas-range-anxiety.html" id="article-link-3">reported in March 2021</a>. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.</p>
<p id="paragraph-54">Edmunds has <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/electric-car-range-and-consumption-epa-vs-edmunds.html" id="article-link-4">continued to test electric vehicles</a>, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-55">“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-56">South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that&nbsp;showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.</p>
<p id="paragraph-57">The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.</p>
<p id="paragraph-58">Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-60">Creating a diversion</p>
<p id="paragraph-61">By last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.</p>
<p id="paragraph-62">As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-63">Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.</p>
<p id="paragraph-64">Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”</p> 
<p id="paragraph-71">Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the&nbsp;Las Vegas “Diversion Team”&nbsp;to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p id="paragraph-72">The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had&nbsp;purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-73">Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.</p>
<p id="paragraph-74">If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving&nbsp;range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.</p>
<p id="paragraph-75">Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-77">The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-78">The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.</p>
<p id="paragraph-79">In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-80">“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-81">Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.</p>
<p id="paragraph-82">Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.</p>

<p id="paragraph-87">On the road</p>
<p id="paragraph-88">By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.</p>
<p id="paragraph-89">Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two&nbsp;weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.</p>
<p id="paragraph-90">Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-91">“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.</p>
<p id="paragraph-92">“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”</p>
<p id="paragraph-93">The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.</p>
<p id="paragraph-94">Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-95">After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.</p>
<p id="paragraph-96">“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”</p>

<p>Over the past six years, we’ve seen Transformers take the world by storm. Transformers have been the workhorse architecture behind modern foundation models and have seen impressive empirical success across diverse applications – from pretrained language models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>, <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416">Flan-T5</a>, to image models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643">SAM</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752">stable diffusion</a>. We think Transformers are great (and have had lots of fun <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">optimizing</a> <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/07/17/flash2.html">them</a>), but we’ve also been thinking about a deeper <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-23-ai-everywhere">question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Are Transformers the only way to get this amazing performance?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the first reason we’ve been poking around at this is because it’s really interesting! Diving into the inner workings of the architectures could help us understand what makes our current generation of models really tick and learn how to train or use them better. And we’ve been really excited by a lot of the work looking into new architectures, from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">S4</a> to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10544">BiGS</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10655">Mega</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12951">Liquid</a>, and more. It’s great to live in a world where there are so many great ideas!</p>
<p>But we’re also interested in this question for some core efficiency reasons. Ideally, an alternative to Transformers would scale more efficiently while still matching in quality. One strong motivation for us has been scaling in sequence length – hence the line of work in our lab looking into replacing attention with a sub-quadratic operator (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">S4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15794">HyenaDNA</a>). And we’re encouraged by the groundswell of work into new architectures for long sequences, from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621">RetNet</a> to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048">RWKV</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15595">positional interpolation</a> – just to name a few!</p>
<p>MLPs – the other core building block of Transformers – also introduce an efficiency bottleneck, which becomes more acute as we continue to optimize attention. MLPs are quadratic in the model width, which means they grow more expensive as you make models wider. This is why models like GPT-3 are so expensive, and why GPT-4 has allegedly started using techniques like mixtures of experts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What if there were a model that were sub-quadratic along both sequence length and model dimension, and could match Transformers in quality?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we’re excited to present a little teaser of some work in this direction – Monarch Mixer BERT (M2-BERT). M2-BERT is sub-quadratic in sequence length and model dimension, has 25% fewer parameters/FLOPs than BERT, and matches in quality (potentially exceeding a little bit when parameter-matched). We’re still very early days, so come talk to us if you find these questions exciting! And if you’re reading this the week of release, we’ll be at ICML – come find us in Hawaii, we’ll be putting up a poster at the <a href="https://es-fomo.com/">ES-FoMo</a> workshop!</p>
<p>This blog post highlights a small portion of the Monarch Mixer line of work. Full arXiv coming soon, and this would not have been possible without the <a href="#ack">full team</a>!</p>
<h2>Monarch Mixer</h2>
<p>Our basic idea is to replace the major elements of a Transformer with Monarch matrices — which are a class of structured matrices that generalize the FFT and are sub-quadratic, hardware-efficient, and expressive. A key property of Monarch matrices is that they can be computed using a series of <em>block-diagonal</em> matrices, interleaved with permutations:</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2023-07-25-m2-bert/m2-diagram.png"></figure>
<p>In Monarch Mixer (M2), we use layers built up from Monarch matrices to do both mixing across the sequence (what attention does in Transformers) and mixing across the model dimension (what the MLP does in Transformers). This is similar in spirit to great work like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601">MLP Mixer</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09792">ConvMixer</a>, which similarly replaced everything with a single primitive for vision tasks (but went for quadratic primitives).</p>
<p>Why go for a fully sub-quadratic architecture now? We’re continuing off a recent line of work in our lab (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10544">and</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13947">elsewhere</a>) that replaces attention with long convolutions – which is implemented efficiently with the FFT. Critically, Monarch matrices can implement the FFT – which gives us hope that a fully Monarch-based architecture can get there.</p>
<h2>Revisiting BERT with Monarch Mixer</h2>
<p>As a first proof-of-concept of our ideas, we’re going to roll the clock back to 2018, and look at one of the first big applications of pretrained Transformers – language modeling with BERT! Despite its (relative) age, BERT is still a workhorse model for applications such as text classification, retrieval, search, and more (see <a href="https://sayanchak.medium.com/practical-uses-of-bert-c384ae3a5c2a">this</a> great summary – and this great <a href="https://twitter.com/marktenenholtz/status/1682436003158433816">tweet</a> on why we love BERT).</p>
<p>For our model, we’ll replace the attention block with a layer inspired by previous work in attention-free models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a> &amp; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena</a>), and replace the fully-connected layers in the MLP with some simple block-diagonal matrices. All of these operations can be implemented with Monarchs, and the rest is standard stuff like element-wise multiplication, and simple pointwise operators.</p>
<p>Our sequence mixer block builds off H3 and Hyena. Our <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-01-20-h3">previous</a> <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-07-hyena">blogs</a> give some intuition about what the architecture is doing – in brief, the short convolutions allow the model to do a quick lookup of nearby tokens, while the long convolutions allow global information to pass over the sequence.</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2023-07-25-m2-bert/m2-arch.png"></figure>
<p>The deltas between our sequence mixer the original H3/Hyena layer are a bit interesting, so we’ll go over them briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FFT -&gt; Monarch:</strong> in H3 and Hyena, the long convs are computed using the FFT, e.g. <code>iFFT(FFT(x) * FFT(k))</code>. In M2-BERT, we compute these FFTs with Monarchs!</li>
<li><strong>Causal vs. bidirectional:</strong> in H3 and Hyena, the long convs are <em>causal</em> (for the autoregressive language modeling loss). This is done by padding the inputs of the FFTs with zeros, since the FFT implements a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem">circular</a> convolution. In M2-BERT, we make the convolutions <em>non-causal</em> by making the convolution kernel twice the length of the input, which makes the weights wrap around.</li>
<li><strong>Convolution kernel:</strong> For the actual kernels <code>k</code>, we use a CKConv parameterization with an exponential, similar to Hyena! In our bidirectional setup, this makes the convolution kernels focus on nearby tokens in the input.</li>
<li><strong>Extra convolution connection:</strong> for BERT, we found that adding an extra convolution (a “residual” so to speak) improved performance on synthetic tasks and pretraining loss.</li>
<li><strong>Average pooling in fine-tuning:</strong> Transformer-based BERT models are traditionally fine-tuned using the embedding of the CLS token. We find that taking the average pool of the embeddings in the input can work a bit better for M2-BERT on downstream tasks that require comparing information spread across multiple sentences such as GLUE NLI tasks (one intuition is that the convolutions spread the information across more tokens).</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, the dimension mixer looks a lot like a normal MLP with GLU, but replaces the fully-connected layers with block-diagonal layers – which drastically reduces the parameters and makes the model more efficient!</p>
<p>So then the natural questions are – given the drastic parameter reduction, how does quality compare to a standard BERT model, and how much faster is it?</p>
<h2>Quality on GLUE</h2>
<p>So our first evaluation was pretraining some M2-BERT models and comparing their downstream GLUE scores after fine-tuning.</p>
<p>When we take our M2-BERT models with the same model width and depth as a standard BERT model, we get some pretty decent parameter savings – M2-BERT-base with 12 layers and model with 768 has 80M parameters, compared to a standard BERT-base of 110M parameters. We pretrained M2-BERT-base (80M) on 36.5B tokens of C4, at sequence length 128, as well as an M2-BERT parameter-matched to BERT-base.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we can get pretty decent results, even with fewer parameters – M2-BERT-base (80M) matching the original BERT-base scores from Devlin 2018 BERT, and the parameter-matched M2-BERT-base sees further lift (see the end of the blog post for full numbers):</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Model</strong></th><th>Average GLUE Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BERT-base (110M)</td><td>79.6</td></tr><tr><td>Crammed BERT-base (110M)</td><td>79.1</td></tr><tr><td>M2-BERT-base (80M)</td><td>79.9</td></tr><tr><td>M2-BERT-base (110M)</td><td><strong>80.9</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>There’s still a lot we don’t know about these models, so quality could get even better. We mostly took standard Transformer BERT-base hyperparameters, besides some basic hyperparameter sweeps on fine-tuning. The Transformer hyperparameters have been optimized by the community in tons of ways over the past five years, so there’s a lot still to learn about what the best hyperparameters and training formulae are for M2 (e.g., we observed up to half-point swings in average GLUE score during our sweeps). And there’s been great work in the community about exactly how much gating you need for different tasks (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10544">BiGS, section 7.2</a>, so lots more to explore here).</p>
<h2>Long Sequence Preview</h2>
<p>So what does this new architecture buy us? One possibility is speed, and scaling to longer sequences. Since M2 is sub-quadratic in model dimension, we see a FLOP reduction (which is reflected in the lower parameter count). But the sequence mixer is also sub-quadratic in sequence length, which means the potential to scale to longer sequences.</p>
<p>We’ll be exploring long-sequence M2-BERT models more in-depth in the coming weeks, but for now here’s a simple preview of throughput at different sequence lengths, compared to the HuggingFace BERT-base and a more optimized FlashAttention BERT-base, for various sequence lengths. Here, we’re looking at throughput in terms of tokens/ms, on a single A100.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>512</th><th>1024</th><th>2048</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HF BERT-base (110M)</td><td>206.5</td><td>130.8</td><td>71.3</td></tr><tr><td>FlashAttention BERT-base (110M)</td><td>380.7</td><td>359.7</td><td>265.3</td></tr><tr><td>M2-BERT-base (80M)</td><td><strong>386.3</strong></td><td><strong>380.7</strong></td><td><strong>378.9</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Today we’re releasing two initial M2-BERT checkpoints pretrained on short sequences, but M2-BERT has the potential to scale to much longer sequences. We’ve started using these scaling properties to experiment with data recipes for long-sequence M2-BERT’s – stay tuned!</p>
<h2>What's Next</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are releasing code for BERT and checkpoints for 80M and 110M models today, pretrained using a standard recipe at sequence length 128 – stay tuned for longer sequences! Check out our <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/m2">code</a> and checkpoints (<a href="https://huggingface.co/danfu09/m2-bert-80M">80M</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/danfu09/m2-bert-110M">110M</a>).</li>
<li>In the coming weeks, watch out for further releases, as we train up long-sequence BERT’s and start tracing the history of Transformers forward – on ImageNet, causal language modeling, T5-style models, as well as explorations of the long sequence capabilities</li>
<li>As part of this release, you’ll find some optimized CUDA code for the forward pass of the M2 layer (which we used for the benchmarks) – we’ll continue to optimize and release updates over the coming weeks. Expect another series of blogs and materials on these soon as we explore the computational tradeoff space!</li>
<li>And of course, full arXiv coming soon!</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his
salary depends on his not understanding it!—Upton Sinclair,

</blockquote>
<p>I've been <a href="https://jlericson.com/2015/07/21/vacation.html/2015/07/21/vacation.html">on
vacation</a>, so I
haven't been following <a href="https://jlericson.com/tag/strike.html">the Stack Overflow moderator
strike</a>.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Not there has been
much progress. Negotiations stalled for <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/390106/moderation-strike-update-data-dumps-choosing-representatives-gpt-data-and-wh/390704#390704">a variety of
reasons</a>. Meanwhile
Stack Overflow's CEO, Prashanth Chandrasekar, dug the company's hole a
bit deeper <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stack-overflow-ceo-teases-generative-ai-tools-addresses-moderator-protest/">during an interview with
VentureBeat</a>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://jlericson.com/2020/02/04/misunderstanding_meta.html">the last time I analyzed an
interview</a>, I assume the
author accurately represented Prashanth. I'd prefer an unedited
transcript because it allows the reader to interpret in the original
context but we must play the hand we are dealt. I will pull out the
quotes and offer my analysis below.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's definitely a question around how we leverage [generative AI]
technology to deliver on our mission of helping build technology
through collective knowledge. This intersection between the power of
community on one side and AI on the other side—from my
standpoint, human-generated community content has taken us to this
level, we have a large impact, but there are also so many problems
we can solve by leveraging this technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before I jump in, please take a moment to read <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/introducing-stackoverflow-com/">Jeff
Atwood's</a>
and <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/">Joel
Spolsky's</a>
introductions of Stack Overflow.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>  Did you
notice what I did? Both describe Stack Overflow as the solution to a
very specific problem: programming knowledge locked up in minds and
forums whence it's difficult to retrieve. They also explain how they
intend to solve the problem including using their combined audience to
form the core of the community of programmers to answer questions. As
someone who was there at the time, it was easy to envision how the project
might solve the problem even if that was an unlikely outcome.</p>
<p>By contrast Prashanth regularly talks about combining community and AI
without going into detail about how that solves the problem at
hand. Neither does he go into much detail about the problems the
company intends to solve. I suspect one reason is that Prashanth, who
has spent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pchandrasekar/details/experience/">most of his career in
management</a>,
has become something of an <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/">architecture
astronaut</a>. As
Joel puts it, "architecture people are solving problems that they
think they can solve, not problems which are <em>useful</em> to solve." Since
there is overlap between a Q&amp;A site and generative artificial
intelligence, there must be a way of jamming them together.</p>
<p>But there's another factor. In May I <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/05/17/so_business.html">wrote about Stack Overflow's
business</a>, which lost $42 million over 6
months and had just laid off 10% of its employees. Since then, <a href="https://prosus-ir.com/results/2023/Prosus-annual-results-2023/pdf/booklet.pdf">the
company's fiscal year-end results came
out</a>. Despite
growing revenue, it lost $84 million over the year ending on March
31, 2023. In fact Prosus' <em>entire education technology segment</em> lost
money despite growing income:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On an economic-interest basis, Edtech segment revenues grew by 28%
(18%) to US$545m and trading losses increased to US$258m. Growth was
affected by decreased demand in the macroeconomic downturn. Our
portfolio companies have reacted quickly to changing market conditions
and are rationalising their cost structures and investments. At the
same time, our businesses are shifting resources to take advantage of
new AI technologies which promise to transform the industry. By
deploying GenAI technologies, our companies can better personalise the
content and user feedback on their platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.prosus.com/~/media/Files/P/Prosus-CORP/latest-financial-results/results-call-transcript.pdf">most recent earnings
call</a>,
Larry Illg, the CEO of the segment and Prashanth's boss, commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Stack specifically, we think that Gen AI is going to be an
important evolution to how developers work and learn in the future,
helping them to be more efficient and also learn new techniques
while they're in the flow of work. We think, and the Stack team
believes the developer community can play a crucial role in how AI
evolves and accelerates, ultimately, with the community being
helpful in ensuring the quality of Gen AI offerings. And Stack
itself sees its role as is bringing the power of its developer
community—and it's important to remember that they have assembled
one of the biggest developer communities in the world—bringing
that community together with the technology power of AI with the
goal of creating highly trusted solutions to technology
problems. And the team is working and launching a variety of AI
solutions and more to come here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it might be that the shift to allow AI answers has more to do with
Stack Overflow's parent company than its CEO. Or maybe Prashanth has
been pushing this as a solution to Stack Overflow's financial
problems. Either way, it appears the company hopes the community will
cooperate by vetting artificially generated content. It doesn't appear
they have put much thought into why the community might want to do
this, though it's important to remember these are comments directed to
investors, not developers.</p>
<p>The call happened on June 27, a month after <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/389582/what-is-the-network-policy-regarding-ai-generated-content">the policy allowing AI
content</a>. I
can only speculate, but a reasonable interpretation would be that the
company found it could not solve its financial problems by <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">selling
data</a> and looked for other ways it could
provide something to sell to LLM developers. Given Stack Overflow's
voting system, it's natural to wonder if that data could be fed back
into the models. (And even better if Stack Overflow can be paid for
that data.) But you can't very well do that if machine-generated
content is absolutely disallowed.</p>
<p>Let's pop the stack back to Prashanth's interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to do it responsibly and safely and have the right use case
to solve specific user and customer problems. It's going
to be very, very exciting—I can't wait for the world to know and
for our community to use the things that we're about to announce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is clearly referencing Prashanth's keynote address on July 27
when he's planning on making an announcement. I
<a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">predicted</a> the announcement would be
adding Prosus' LLM technology to Stack Overflow. That wouldn't help
with revenue, but it's the easiest way for Stack Overflow to
demonstrate the potential value of using voting data. In order to
maximize press coverage on the day of the announcement, the company
can only tease without breaking the news early. That's a pretty
terrible communication strategy for a community, however. Unless your
community trusts you without reservation (and Stack Overflow is
nowhere near that blessed state) the teases will only increase
anxiety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're probably talking about 30 million official developers based on
our own data sets, but that number is probably going to at least
triple because there are so many people that are going to come into
the field of writing code because it's so much easier to begin to
write a baseline level of quality of code. And I think
the watermark has just sort of gone up in terms of the expectations
for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stack Overflow has <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#users">21 million
users</a>, so that's not where the
30 million comes from. A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+developers+are+in+the+world">quick Google
search</a>
puts the number of developers worldwide at 27 million. Since the world
population stands at <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">8
billion</a>, roughly 3
of every thousand people on Earth are developers. I don't know if that
sounds like a large or a small number to you, but given there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Programmers">no
programmers before
1945</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD340.PDF">not many
more added in the
1950s</a>, the
profession has grown at a goodly rate.</p>
<p><img src="https://jlericson.com/images/arrow_tech.jpg" alt="Display of arrowhead technology at Guernsey State Park, Wyoming."></p>
<p>In a blog earlier this year, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/?p=21973">Prashanth compared AI to the
introduction of tractors</a> in that
they made the job easier. I pointed out that <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/388401/new-blog-post-from-our-ceo-prashanth-community-is-the-future-of-ai/389224#389224">tractors reduced the
number of
farmers</a>.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
Tripling the number of programmers would imply a rather dramatic
change to the world economy. What sort of work would they be doing? As
a lapsed programmer, I do find myself reaching for the old tools to
help a colleague from time to time. But I don't envision my co-workers
becoming programmers no matter how easy it becomes. If I weren't
around to ask, they'd reach for other tools or just go without.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you want to definitely be adopting these tools to get more
productive and efficient and learn faster in your role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another way of expressing the well-worn idea: <a href="https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1610984481342771200">"AI will not
replace you. A person using AI
will."</a>
Remember there used to be an occupation called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation)">"computer"</a>. The
people who had those jobs (often women) lost them to devices also
called "computers". AI enthusiasts aim for a happy medium where the
technology is disruptive enough to demand attention, but tame enough
that everyone who adopts it will prosper.</p>
<p>Since the invention of writing, there were scribes who specialized in
using (and creating) the tools required to make legible marks. They
were hired to take dictation and copy manuscripts. It was technical
and highly-specialized work. With improvements in technology
(including <a href="https://www.bl.uk/history-of-writing/articles/a-brief-history-of-writing-materials-and-technologies">the printing press and mass-produced metal
nibs</a>)
more people could write for themselves and "scribe" took on a
metaphorical meaning for someone who makes a living cranking out the
written word. Technology dramatically increased the production of
writing at the cost of people making a living doing that work.</p>
<p>After using ChatGPT for a few months to <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/03/29/coding_ai.html">help me write
code</a>, I'm not sure
it will have the same impact as metal nibs had on writing. For common
questions, it's impressive but <a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/the-miracle-of-chatgpt">blind spots can be easily
found</a>. The
primary advantage of LLMs (their output can be copied and used without
modification) also makes them poor tools for effective learning. They
create <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf">cargo
cults</a> from
their training materials. They sometimes produce useful results if
circumstances are favorable, but provide no help otherwise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision to ban ChatGPT was the “right decision” back in
December, said Chandrasekar. But now, he explained, the company has
slowly been working with the community, doing research and getting
input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the primary spot I wish VentureBeat had provided a
transcript. I think Prashanth has <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/labs/">Stack Overflow
Labs</a> in mind here. If so, the
feedback from the community was largely "please don't do this". It's
hard to see how any of what happened after reversing the ban on
ChatGPT is working <em>with</em> the community. "Against" seems the more
appropriate preposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have gotten feedback on how best to make sure that we will trust
generative AI products, from a Stack Overflow standpoint, and that's
what we're going to announce in about a month's time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is fairly vague, but despite the context I suspect the feedback
came from people working with LLMs. It certainly hasn't come from the
community since their elected moderators were told their judgment was
unreliable. In that light "make sure that we will trust generative AI
products" feels a lot more sinister than it first appears. Perhaps
what Prashanth meant was simply "improve the trustworthiness of
generative AI products", which once again signals using Stack Overflow
voting to provide feedback to some model or other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[False negatives are] causing a really negative impact because when
a legitimate human being coming on the website wants to ask a
question, we don't want to shoo them away. We want to share the
question, we want to serve our purpose and mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[The decision to create a new AI policy was] not an easy decision by
any means—but we just thought that the cost of dissuading
people from asking a question on Stack Overflow was too high. And it
was happening very alarmingly high rate based on the analysis that
we looked at.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I can tell, most suspected machine-generated content comes
in the form of an answer, not a question. Nevertheless, incorrectly
flagged content does have a negative impact on the humans that
produced it. I believe, however, the company is <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/26/problem_ai.html">underestimating the
number of answers copied from ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've taken a public position around this subject, saying that we
always want to be open and free with our data with our developer
community. However, large AI companies building models—we
absolutely want to work with them in a more formal way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this might be the company's public position, <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/391634/the-companys-commitment-to-the-data-dumps-the-api-and-sede/391640#391640">Prashanth
privately wanted to limit who can access the
data</a>. On
March 28, 2023, he ordered the data dump not be uploaded to
Archive.org. The DBA who turned it off warned that the community would
notice and it did. Rather than having an answer prepared, the company
publicly struggled for an answer. <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">Internal
communication</a> shows most of the company
was as surprised as the rest of us.</p>
<p>The harsh reality is that Stack Overflow's CEO hasn't listened to the
people who best understand Stack Overflow. He appears to have a
surface-level grasp of the site, the community and the culture. As a
result, he's made decisions that harm the value of Stack
Overflow. This isn't necessarily malicious, but rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">incompetence
of some sort</a>.</p>
<p>Prashanth has already demonstrated skill in selling Stack
Overflow. That was an impressive feat. But nobody can excel at
everything and he hasn't shown an aptitude for running a
community-centered company. It requires <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/391626/historical-policy-on-the-use-of-gpt-generators/391654#391654">much more than platitudes and
boundless
enthusiasm</a>.</p>

<pre>I promised a post-mortem three weeks ago after I brought the Tarsnap service
back online.  It took me an unforgivably long time to get around to writing
this, but here it is.

At approximately 2023-07-02 13:07:58 UTC, the central Tarsnap server (hosted
in Amazon's EC2 us-east-1 region) went offline suffering a "failed system
status check".  As a virtual machine, this could mean many things, including
a power outage, a hardware failure on the physical server, or an outage in
EC2's network; all I can say is that since I haven't seen reports of any
widespread EC2 issues at the same time, it was most likely just an isolated
hardware fault.

Tarsnap's monitoring systems detected the failure at 2023-07-02 13:10 UTC (I
have monitoring writing/reading/deleting archives every 5 minutes from a
different EC2 region) and alerted me.  (The text message at 13:10 UTC didn't
wake me up, but the phone call at 13:15 UTC did.)  My initial investigation
didn't reveal any clearly transient errors so I assumed the system was dead
and started spinning up a replacement EC2 instance.

At approximately 2023-07-02 13:52 UTC (45 minutes after the initial outage)
Amazon restarted the failed server on a new EC2 instance; this brought up the
operating system (FreeBSD) but did not restart the Tarsnap server code since I
don't have the system configured to start that automatically -- if anything
causes the system to unexpectedly reboot, I want to check things over before
any tarsnap traffic gets handled, since "preventing data loss if something
breaks" is far more important than "maximize service availability".

The server logs after rebooting showed filesystem corruption; it's clear that
whatever took the system offline either killed the hardware or severed it from
the Elastic Block Store which holds its filesystems.  I decided to continue
with setting up a new server rather than attempting to recover the old one.

The Tarsnap service stores data in Amazon S3 as a log-structured filesystem
with each S3 object consisting of a header with metadata for all of the log
entries, followed by (optionally) data for the log entries.  For example, a
"start write transaction" log entry has a header identifying the machine and
transaction nonce but has no log data, while a "store data block" log entry
has a header identifying the machine and block name, along with the block
data.  Under normal conditions, the log entry metadata is also cached in EC2
and is never read from Amazon S3; the only reads from Amazon S3 are to read
block data in response to requests from the tarsnap client.

The process of recovering the EC2 instance state consists of two steps: First,
reading all of the metadata headers from S3; and second, "replaying" all of
those operations locally.  (These cannot be performed at the same time, since
the use of log-structured storage means that log entries are "rewritten" to
free up storage when data is deleted; log entries contain sequence numbers
to allow them to be replayed in the correct order, but they must be sorted
into the correct order after being retrieved before they can be replayed.)

The first step proceeded without incident, completing at 2023-07-03 01:49:49
UTC.  In hindsight it probably could have been faster: I had the recovery
process configured to make 250 simultaneous requests to Amazon S3 because that
is what Amazon S3 could sustain a decade ago, but I suspect that this could be
significantly increased now.

The second step failed almost immediately, with an error telling me that a
replayed log entry was recording data belonging to a machine which didn't
exist.  This provoked some head-scratching until I realized that this was
introduced by some code I wrote in 2014: Occasionally Tarsnap users need to
move a machine between accounts, and I handle this storing a new "machine
registration" log entry and deleting the previous one.  Unfortunately while
I had tests for this, I never tested regenerating the server state after a
machine is "re-owned" *while having data stored* -- and since the new machine
"registration" log entry has a higher sequence number, the server was quite
right in objecting that data was stored belonging to a machine which didn't
exist... yet.

Once I figured out what was going on, I disabled that "seatbelt" and resumed
the state reconstruction process.  It then failed again almost immediately
complaining that it couldn't find data in Amazon S3, because my attempt at
"resuming" the process involved skipping the downloading-data-from-S3 step
and thereby left a "maximum log entry sequence number" value uninitialized
(and therefore set to zero).  A short time later I had that fixed and the
state reconstruction process continued properly.

This process was also somewhat slower than it should have been; had I realized
that it was disk throughput bound I would have configured the relevant EBS
volume for higher throughput.  Unfortunately by this point I was quite sleep
deprived so I wasn't monitoring the process closely -- otherwise I would have
noticed this (in both gstat(8) and Amazon CloudWatch) and reconfigured the
EBS volume.

By about 2023-07-03 15:10 UTC (I didn't record the exact time) the state
reconstruction process had completed.  I ran some quick tests with the server
in read-only mode and compared against the old server state (to make sure that
things matched up aside from the old server's filesystem having lost the last
few seconds of data when the server failed), and then I brought it online.
The first live post-outage traffic was at 2023-07-03 15:25:58 UTC, roughly
26 hours and 16 minutes after the outage started.

Following my ill-defined "Tarsnap doesn't have an SLA but I'll give people
credits for outages when it seems fair" policy, on 2023-07-13 (after some dust
settled and I caught up on some sleep) I credited everyone's Tarsnap accounts
with 50% of a month's storage costs.

As always, feel free to email me if you have any questions.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>tl;dr: <a href="#two-ways-to-ask-for-explanations">part 1</a> explains what an explanation algorithm is, and <a href="#an-open-source-implementation-of-diff">part 2</a> describes an open source SQL data differ.</em></p>

<h2 id="why-did-this-happen-what-changed">“Why did this happen?” “What changed?”</h2>

<p>In the data world, most reporting starts by asking <em>how much?</em>: “how many new customers purchase each week?” or “what is the monthly cost of medical care for this group?”</p>

<p>Inevitably the initial reports result in questions about <em>why?</em>: “why did we see less purchases last week?” and “why are the medical costs for this group increasing?”</p>

<p>The academic community has an answer to such <em>why?</em> questions: explanation algorithms. An explanation algorithm looks at columns/properties of your dataset and identifies high-likelihood explanations (called “predicates” in database-speak). For example, the algorithms might find that you got less customers in the segment of people who saw a new marketing campaign, or that the medical costs for the group you’re studying can largely be attributed to costly treatments in a subgroup.</p>

<p>The academic interest is founded in real pain. When a journalist, researcher, or organization asks <em>why?</em>, the resulting data anlysis largely goes into issuing ad hoc GROUP BY queries or unscientifically creating pivot tables to try to slice and dice datasets to explain some change in a dataset over time. Companies like <a href="https://sisudata.com/">Sisu</a> (founded by Peter Bailis, one of the authors of the DIFF paper discussed below) are built on the premise that data consumers are increasingly asking <em>why?</em></p>

<p>You can rephrase lots of different questions in the form of an explanation question. This is an area I’ve been interested in for a while, especially as it might help people like journalists and social scientists better identify interesting trends. In <a href="https://blog.marcua.net/2015/06/02/a-data-differ-to-help-journalists.html">A data differ to help journalists</a> (2015), I said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be nice to have a utility that, given two datasets (e.g., two csv files) that are schema-aligned, returns a report of how they differ from one-another in various ways. The utility could take hints of interesting grouping or aggregate columns, or just randomly explore the pairwise combinations of (grouping, aggregate) and sort them by various measures like largest deviation from their own group/across groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time of that post, I hadn’t yet connected the dots between the desire for such a system and the active work going on in the research world. Thanks to database researchers, that connection now exists! In this post, I’ll first cover two approaches to explanation algorithms, and then introduce an open source implementation of one of them in my <a href="https://github.com/marcua/datools">datools library</a>.</p>

<h2 id="two-ways-to-ask-for-explanations">Two ways to ask for explanations</h2>

<p>In 2013, Eugene Wu and Sam Madden introduced <a href="http://sirrice.github.io/files/papers/scorpion-vldb13.pdf">Scorpion</a>, a system that explains why an aggregate (e.g., the customer count last week) is higher or lower than other example data. Figure 1 in their paper explains the problem quite nicely. They imagine a user looking at a chart, in this case of aggregate temperatures from a collection of sensors, and highlighting some outliers to ask “compared to the other points on this chart, why are these points so high?”</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://blog.marcua.net/assets/images/diff/scorpion-figure1.png" alt="A figure from the Scorpion paper that shows how a user might highlight outliers on a chart"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A figure that shows how a user might highlight outliers on a chart (source: Scorpion paper)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Scorpion has two nice properties. First, it operates on aggregates: it’s not until you look at some weekly or monthly statistics that you notice that something is off and search for an explanation. Second, it’s performant on a pretty wide variety of aggregates, with optimizations for the most common ones (e.g., sums, averages, counts, standard deviations). I believe that of all the explanation algorithms, Scorpion pairs the most intuitive phrasing of the question (“why so high/low?”) with the most intuitive experience (highlighting questionable results on a visualization).</p>

<p>The challenge in implementing Scorpion is that, as presented, it does its processing outside of the database that stores the data. Specifically, the way Scorpion partitions and merges subsets of the data to identify an explanation requires decision trees and clustering algorithms that traditionally execute outside of the database<sup id="fnref:madlib" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:madlib" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It is also specific to aggregates, which are commonly the source of <em>why</em> questions, but aren’t the only places that question arises.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/diff-vldb2019.pdf">DIFF</a> comes in. In 2019, Firas Abuzaid, Peter Kraft, Sahaana Suri, Edward Gan, Eric Xu, Atul Shenoy, Asvin Ananthanarayan, John Sheu, Erik Meijer, Xi Wu, Jeff Naughton, Peter Bailis, and Matei Zaharia introduced an explanation algorithm in the form of a database operator called DIFF that can be expressed in SQL. If you’re so inclined, here’s the syntax for the DIFF operator:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://blog.marcua.net/assets/images/diff/diff-figure1.png" alt="The syntax for the DIFF operator "></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The syntax for the DIFF operator (source: DIFF paper)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>An example with SQL might help in understanding how it works:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://blog.marcua.net/assets/images/diff/diff-example.png" alt="A simple example of the DIFF operator in action (source: DIFF paper)"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A simple example of the DIFF operator in action (source: DIFF paper)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In this example, the DIFF operator compares the crash logs of an application from this week to those of last week, considering columns like application version, device, and operating system for an explanation. The most likely explanation happened 20x more this week than last week (<code>risk_ratio = 20.0</code>), and explains 75% of this week’s crashes (<code>support = 75%</code>).</p>

<p>DIFF requires that we do some mental gymnastics to transform “why was X so high?” into “how are these two groups different?”. It also requires the user to wrap their head around statistics like risk ratios and support. In exchange for that mental overhead, DIFF is exciting for its praticality. As the example shows, DIFF’s authors envision it being expressed in SQL, which means it could be implemented on top of most relational databases. While a contribution of the paper is a specialized and efficient implementation of DIFF that databases don’t have today, it can also be implemented entirely in the database as a series of SQL GROUP BY/JOIN/WHERE operators.</p>

<p>If you have a relational database, love SQL, and want to run an explanation algorithim, DIFF is exciting because those three things are all you need. Luckily for you, dear reader, I had a relational database, loved SQL, and wanted to run an explanation algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="an-open-source-implementation-of-diff">An open source implementation of DIFF</h2>
<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been implementing DIFF as a thin Python wrapper that generates the SQL necessary to compute the difference between two schema-aligned queries. <a href="https://github.com/marcua/datools/blob/main/datools/explanations.py">The core of the implementation to do this</a>, including comments, requires a little under 300 lines of code. To see a full example of the tool in action, you can check out this <a href="https://github.com/marcua/datools/blob/main/examples/diff/intel-sensor.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>, but I’ll show snippets below to give you a sense of how it works.</p>

<p>First, we need a dataset. For that, I took inspiration from the Scorpion paper’s experiments, one of which relied on <a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/labdata/labdata.html">sensor data from Intel</a> collected by my grad school advisor Sam Madden (and a few collaborators). Using Simon Willison’s excellent <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/">sqlite-utils</a> library, I load the data into SQLite and inspect it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># Retrieve and slightly transform the data</span>
wget http://db.csail.mit.edu/labdata/data.txt.gz
<span>gunzip </span>data.txt.gz
<span>sed</span> <span>-i</span> <span>'1s/^/day time_of_day epoch moteid temperature humidity light voltage\n/'</span> data.txt
<span>head </span>data.txt

<span># Get it in SQLite</span>
pip <span>install </span>sqlite-utils
sqlite-utils insert intel-sensor.sqlite readings data.txt <span>--csv</span> <span>--sniff</span> <span>--detect-types</span>
sqlite-utils schema intel-sensor.sqlite
</code></pre></div>

<p>That last <code>sqlite-utils schema</code> shows us what the newly generated <code>readings</code> table looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>"readings"</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>[</span><span>day</span><span>]</span> <span>TEXT</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>time_of_day</span><span>]</span> <span>TEXT</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>epoch</span><span>]</span> <span>INTEGER</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>moteid</span><span>]</span> <span>INTEGER</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>temperature</span><span>]</span> <span>FLOAT</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>humidity</span><span>]</span> <span>FLOAT</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>light</span><span>]</span> <span>FLOAT</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>voltage</span><span>]</span> <span>FLOAT</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK! So we have a row for each sensor reading, with the <code>day</code> and <code>time_of_day</code> it happened, an <code>epoch</code> to time-align readings from different sensors, a <code>moteid</code> (the ID of the sensor, otherwise known as a mote), and then the types of things that sensors tend to sense: <code>temperature</code>, <code>humidity</code>, <code>light</code>, and <code>voltage</code>.</p>

<p>In the Scorpion paper (Sections 8.1 and 8.4), a user notices that various sensors placed throughout a lab detect too-high temperature values (reading <a href="https://github.com/sirrice/scorpion/blob/ba1af715ebc33bc4c4a63612d63debd8650ee1cf/scorpion/tests/gentestdata.py#L80">the experiment code</a>, this happens in the days between 2004-03-01 and 2004-03-10). A natural question is why this happened. The Scorpion algorithm discovers that <code>moteid = 15</code> (a sensor with ID 15) was having a bad few days.</p>

<p>Can we replicate this result with DIFF? Let’s see! The DIFF implementation is part of a library I’ve been building called <code>datools</code>, which is a collection of tools I use for various data analyses. Let’s install datools:</p>



<p>Now let’s use it!</p>

<p>What’s <code>diff</code> have to say?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Explanation</span><span>(</span><span>predicates</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>Predicate</span><span>(</span><span>moteid</span> <span>=</span> <span>15</span><span>),),</span> <span>risk_ratio</span><span>=</span><span>404.8320855614973</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Wow! <code>moteid = 15</code> is the top predicate that <code>datools.diff</code> identified as being the difference between the <code>test_relation</code> and <code>control_relation</code>! With a <code>risk_ratio = 404.83</code>, we learn that sensor 15 is about 400 times more likely to appear in the set of records with high temperature readings than in the set of records with low temperature readings. Hooray for replicating the Scorpion result! Poor sensor 15!</p>

<p>Let’s break that call to <code>diff</code> down a bit so we understand what’s going on:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>engine</code>: a <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> engine that’s connected to some database, in this case the SQLite database.</li>
  <li><code>test_relation</code>: the “test set,” which is a query with records that show a particular condition. In our case, it’s the higher-temperature records during the period of interest. This could alternatively be a SQL query for “patients with high medical costs” or “customers who purchased.”</li>
  <li><code>control_relation</code>: the “control set,” which is a query with records that don’t show that particular condition. In our case, it’s the lower-temperature records during the period of interest. This could alternatively be a SQL query for “patients who don’t have high medical costs” or “leads who haven’t purchased.”</li>
  <li><code>on_column_values</code>: these are set-valued columns you want to consider as explanations. In our case, we’re considering the <code>moteid</code> column, so we can identify a specific sensor thats misbehaving.</li>
  <li><code>on_column_ranges</code>: these are range-valued columns you want to consider as explanations. <code>diff</code> will bucket these columns into 15 equi-sized buckets, which works well for continuous variables like <code>{Column('humidity'), Column('light'), Column('voltage'),}</code>. In this example, we don’t provide any (more on why later), but in the Jupyter Notebook, you can see this in action.</li>
  <li><code>min_support</code>: The smallest fraction ([0, 1]) of the test set that the explanation should explain. For example, <code>min_support=0.05</code> says that if an explanation doesn’t include at least 5% of the test set, we don’t want to know about it.</li>
  <li><code>min_risk_ratio</code>: The smallest risk ratio that the explanation should cover. For example, <code>min_risk_ratio=2.0</code> says that if an explanation isn’t at least 2 times as likely to appear in the test set than in the control set, we don’t want to know about it.</li>
  <li><code>max_order</code>: How many columns to consider for a joint explanation. For example, in the Scorpion paper, the authors find that not just sensor 15 (one-column explanation), but sensor 15 under certain light and voltage conditions (three column-explanation), is the best explanation for outlier readings. To analyze three-column explanations, you’d set <code>max_order=3</code>. Sadly and hopefully temporarily, while <code>max_order</code> is the most fun, interesting, and challenging-to-implement parameter of the DIFF paper, <code>datools.diff</code> only supports <code>max_order=1</code> for now.</li>
</ul>

<p>An astute reader will note that I coaxed the results in my example a bit by asking DIFF to consider only <code>moteid</code> explanations (<code>on_column_values={Column('moteid'),}</code>). The Scorpion paper considers the other columns as well and still gets the strongest signal from <code>moteid</code>. In the <a href="https://github.com/marcua/datools/blob/main/examples/diff/intel-sensor.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>, we dive into this more deeply and run into an issue replicating the Scorpion results with <code>diff</code>. I offer some hypotheses for this in the notebook, but to have a more informed opinion, we’ll have to wait until <code>datools.diff</code> supports <code>max_order &gt; 1</code>.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here?</h2>
<p>Before we go off and celebrate the replication of the Scorpion paper’s findings with the DIFF paper’s algorithm, you should know that it’s not all roses. Luckily, I’m just as excited about improving <code>datools.diff</code> as I was when I first wrote it, so consider the list below to be both limitations of the current version and a roadmap for the library. If you’re curious, <a href="https://github.com/marcua/datools/projects/1">this project board</a> tracks the things I’m working on most actively.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Make <code>diff</code> work on more than just SQLite</strong>. <code>diff</code> generates SQL, and I’d love for that SQL to run on any database. This is largely a matter of improving the test harness to provision other databases and fixing whatever breaks. The next few databases I’m targeting are DuckDB, Postgres, and Redshift, but if you’re interested in collaborating on something else, I’d love to help.</li>
  <li><strong>Support <code>max_order &gt; 1</code></strong>. One of the DIFF paper’s contributions is in how to spar with the combinatorial explosion you encounter in looking for multi-column explanations. I’d love to support at least 2- or 3-column explanations.</li>
  <li><strong>Use <code>diff</code> on more datasets</strong>. If you’ve got a dataset (especially a public one) you’re hoping to try this on, let me know!</li>
  <li><strong>Replicate <code>diff</code> on Scorpion’s analysis after implementing higher-order explanations</strong>. The full Jupyter Notebook shows that <code>diff</code> can’t yet replicate Scorpion’s results when we ask it to consider more columns than <code>moteid</code>. The notebook offers explanations ranging from “DIFF and Scorpion are different algorithms and have different tradeoffs” to “Why are we considering an output measure as an explanation?” I think it’s worth revisiting this after implementing <code>max_order &gt; 1</code>, so that we can see how <code>datools.diff</code> handles more complex explanations.</li>
  <li><strong>Share more about <code>datools</code></strong>. <code>diff</code> is part of the <code>datools</code> package, but I haven’t told you much about <code>datools</code>. Countless words have been spilled about how SQL, despite being here to stay, also has its rough edges. <code>datools</code> smooths some of these rough edges out<sup id="fnref:datools-example" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:datools-example" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ewu/">Eugene Wu</a> not only introduced me to the concept of explanation algorithms, but also patiently guided me through starts and stops as I tried to implement various papers. <a href="http://www.bailis.org/">Peter Bailis</a> not only showed that the need for explanation algorithms is felt broadly, but also supportively contextualized DIFF relative to even more recent state-of-the-art solutions. I’m grateful to both of them for their feedback.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
      <article role="main">
        <p>Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft but not on Windows or Edge. I also don’t have
a full understanding about Web Environment Integrity, but am basing this off
what I understand. This article states my opinions, as opposed to that of my
employer.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been under a rock, you may have heard about Google’s evil
<a href="https://stackdiary.com/web-environment-integrity/">Web Environment Integrity</a>
“proposal”. Supposedly, this is to make sure a browser environemnt can be
“trusted”, but it seems Google wants this so they can kill ad blockers.</p>
<p>This looks a lot like Microsoft’s ill-fated “Palladium” they wanted to ship
with Vista. Palladium was an attempt to improve Windows security by adding
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc723472.aspx">attestation and integrity</a>,
but could also be abused to enforce DRM everywhere on your PC, block competing
but “untrusted” applications such as Firefox. The only saving grace was Vista’s
very painful and long development period where
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/whatever-happened-to-microsofts-drm-plan/">Palladium was eventually killed</a>
so Vista could actually ship.</p>
<p>Palladium was renamed “Next-Generation Secure Computing Base” but it’s easier
to call it by the former name so I’ll just use that. Also, some features such
as BitLocker, UEFI Secure Boot (Windows 8), and TPM requirements (Windows 11)
did make their way, but they can be disabled or bypassed.</p>
<p>While I was only a young child during the development of Windows Vista, I am
pretty good at reading up on tech history.</p>
<p>Going back, Google takes
<a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md">“inspiration”</a>
from their infamous Play Integrity API (also known as
SafetyNet) used on Android, which is often used to block rooted phones from
using certain apps such as Netflix, Google Pay, and banking apps.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? People who root their devices and use custom ROMs like
LineageOS (myself included) nowadays hide root from bad apps and can pass these
checks anyways. I use Google Pay all the time on my OnePlus 11 running an
unofficial LineageOS build, thanks to root hiding. Does Google not realize how
commonly bypassed Play Integrity is? In fact, it is easy even on Google’s very
own Pixel devices, as someone who previously used multiple generations of Pixel
devices, including the Pixel 7.</p>
<p>Unless you can only use an official signed Google Chrome binary, what’s
stopping people from modifying Chromium and faking these checks? Unless that’s
the strategy.</p>
<p>Even on the web today, there are bad actors like Chase Bank who claims to
<a href="https://www.chase.com/digital/resources/privacy-security/security/system-requirements">“require” only Windows or Mac</a>
(like it’s still 2003)
and uses this as justification to block BSD and Linux-on-ARM without user agent
switchers. The only reason why this isn’t in the media is because Chase allows
Linux-on-x86 and Chrome OS, due to both having &gt;2-3% market share each. In fact,
I can log into Chase.com on my Fedora laptop fine without modifications.</p>
<p>If Chase was equipped with Web Environment Integrity, they could impose the
worst of the early 2000s web on their customers, maybe only making “exceptions”
for Chromebooks and common Linux distros to avoid the obvious uproar. Or worse,
Chase could mandate your PC has Secure Boot and no ad blocker in order to pay
your credit card or mortgage. And not just Chase, but any bank. It would be
even worse for certain fintechs which require their app for customer service
and bill payments: look at the X1 credit card.</p>
<p>In many ways, if we get Web Environment Integrity, we’ll need every government
to regulate Google, Apple, Microsoft, and adtech in every way possible, and
also add unbundling requirements so any browser can attest as long as it’s not
obvious malware.</p>
<p>After all, going back to the Windows 8 era, UEFI Secure Boot couldn’t lock out
Linux since we put pressure on Microsoft to sign Linux distros. There was also
an antitrust fear if desktop Linux went extinct, which helped. We could force
Google to bless small browsers like Vivaldi and Tor Browser the same way.</p>
<p>Better off Web Environment Integrity API becomes Palladium and dies in a
long-abandoned Chromium branch. After all, Windows Longhorn pre-reset, compete
with Palladium probably still exists in source, but is full of cobwebs rotting
away on some long-forgotten-about Azure DevOps server.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible to win this fight, we won the fight against Palladium, even
with a well-resourced Microsoft combined with the PC industry, if not the NSA
and MPAA. If we fight hard, we can win against Google’s anti-user Web Integrity
attempts also.</p>
<p>So, get the EFF and FSF involved: we need to be loud.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Reactive Runtime</h3>
<p dir="auto">At its core, Chidori brings a reactive runtime that orchestrates interactions between different agents and their components. The runtime is comprised of "nodes", which react to system changes they subscribe to, providing dynamic and responsive behavior in your AI systems.
Nodes can encompass code, prompts, vector databases, custom code, services, or even complete systems.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Monitoring and Observability</h3>
<p dir="auto">Chidori ensures comprehensive monitoring and observability of your agents. We record all the inputs and outputs emitted by nodes, enabling us to explain precisely what led to what, enhancing your debugging experience and understanding of the system’s production behavior.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Branching and Time-Travel</h3>
<p dir="auto">With Chidori, you can take snapshots of your system and explore different possible outcomes from that point (branching), or rewind the system to a previous state (time-travel). This functionality improves error handling, debugging, and system robustness by offering alternative pathways and do-overs.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Code Interpreter Environments</h3>
<p dir="auto">Chidori comes with first-class support for code interpreter environments like <a href="https://deno.land/" rel="nofollow">Deno</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark/blob/master/spec.md">Starlark</a>. You can execute code directly within your system, providing quick startup, ease of use, and secure execution. We're continually working on additional safeguards against running untrusted code, with containerized nodes support coming soon.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="motorway" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f6e3.png">🛣️</g-emoji> Roadmap</h2>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is an early open source release and we're looking for collaborators from the community.
A good place to start would be to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/CJwKsPSgew" rel="nofollow">discord</a>!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Another AI Framework?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Chidori focuses on the specifics of how LLM+code execution operates rather than providing specific compositions of prompts. Other frameworks haven’t focused on this space, and it's an important one. We reduce accidental complexity in building systems for long-running agents; this helps developers build successful systems.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Chidori?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Chidori is the name of the lightning blade technique used by Kakashi in the Naruto anime series.
It also happens to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chidori" rel="nofollow">mean Thousand Birds in Japanese</a>, which is a nice coincidence.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Well then why Thousand Birds?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Thousand Birds is a reference to flocks of birds (or a murmuration) and the emergent behavior that arises from their interactions.
We think this is a good metaphor for the behavior of long running agents, the internal units of LLM execution within them, and the emergent behavior that arises from their interactions.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Rust?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Rust is a great language for building systems, we like the type system and the guarantees provided by it.
We also like the performance characteristics of Rust, and the ability to build a single binary that can be deployed anywhere.
The Rust ecosystem makes it fairly easy to provide bindings to other languages, which is important for us to provide a good developer experience.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Inspiration</h2>
<p dir="auto">Our framework is inspired by the work of many others, including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://temporal.io/" rel="nofollow">Temporal.io</a> - providing reliability and durability to workflows</li>
<li><a href="http://witheve.com/" rel="nofollow">Eve</a> - developing patterns for building reactive systems and reducing accidental complexity</li>
<li><a href="https://timelydataflow.github.io/timely-dataflow" rel="nofollow">Timely Dataflow</a> - efficiently streaming changes</li>
<li><a href="https://www.langchain.com/" rel="nofollow">Langchain</a> - developing tools and patterns for building with LLMs</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">License</h2>
<p dir="auto">Thousand Birds is under the MIT license. See the <a href="https://github.com/ThousandBirdsInc/chidori/blob/main/LICENSE">LICENSE</a> for more information.</p>

<p>I've <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/future-proof-languages.html">spent</a> <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/future-proof-languages-2.html">some</a> <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/future-proof-languages-3.html">time</a> contemplating future-proof programming languages because I want to enusre that code I write will be usable in the future. Generally, if I want to build something and share it with others, I'm a pragmatist, so I'll <del>use JavaScript</del> choose a programming language that is popular, portable, and convenient.</p>
<p>But <em>other times</em>, I just want to have fun and experiment with other programming languages and tools. In that vein, I've been monitoring a few single-syllable, intriguing-but-maybe-not-future-proof programming languages such as <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> and <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>. Sometimes these experiments open my eyes to new ways of programming or new tools that eventually become indispensible.</p>
<h2 id="janet">Janet</h2>
<p>Very recently, I ran across a newly-published (free) book about the <a href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a> programming language called <a href="https://janet.guide/">Janet for Mortals</a> and it piqued my interest. Janet is a relatively small Lisp/Clojure-inspired scripting language that tries to fill a similar niche to Lua, but with an actual standard library (and, of course, Lisp-style metaprogramming and compile-time execution via macros).</p>
<p><strong>Janet for Mortals</strong> is an entertaining and informative read, and it gave me the nudge I needed to become interested in Lisps again. I had previously abandoned using Scheme because, frankly, I ran out of free time for exploratory programming. But while I was reading about Janet, I kept coming back to one question: why should I use Janet instead of an established Lisp, e.g. Scheme?</p>
<p>For me, the most attractive qualities of Janet (other than general Lispiness) are portability, embeddability, and <a href="https://janet-lang.org/docs/peg.html">Parsing Expression Grammars</a>. Realistically, however, I don't currently have any need to embed a language, so that leaves portability and parsing. As far as portability, <a href="http://www.call-cc.org/">CHICKEN Scheme</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/clisp/">CLISP</a>, and <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> looked acceptable. For parsing, <a href="https://bford.info/packrat/">Packrat</a> looked reasonable.</p>
<p>At this point, I started to run out of reasons to pursue Janet instead of an established Lisp.</p>
<h2 id="common-lisp">Common Lisp</h2>
<p>During my research, I ran across a <a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/">blog post describing Common Lisp's (mostly) unique REPL-driven workflow</a>. In that post, the author describes handling a runtime error by just fixing the broken code--in-place, without any restarts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a function, foo, that calls some other function, bar, that is not yet defined. Now call foo. What happens?</p>
<p>Obviously, the call to foo breaks, because bar is not defined. But what happens when it breaks?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The answer to that question is the differentiating point of repl-driven programming. In an old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk environment, the break in foo drops you into a breakloop.</p>
<p>A breakloop is a full-featured repl, complete with all of the tools of the main repl, but it exists inside the dynamic environment of the broken function. From the breakloop you can roam up and down the suspended call stack, examining all variables that are lexically visible from each stack frame. In fact, you can inspect all live data in the running program.</p>
<p>What's more, you can edit all live data in the program. If you think that a break was caused by a wrong value in some particular variable or field, you can interactively change it and resume the suspended function.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Moreover, because the entire language and development system are available, unrestricted, in the repl, you can define the missing function bar, resume foo, and get a sensible result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen various (often unreliable) "edit and continue" features over the years, but I didn't realize that Common Lisp was built with this sort of workflow in mind.</p>
<p>When I first learned to program, I used "printf debugging", where I'd temporarily add in code to log values, recompile, run, and inspect the output to troubleshoot problems. Eventually, I ran into scenarios where I couldn't modify the program or rerun it, so I learned to use a debugger. Using a real debugger is definitely the right thing to do, but setting up a debugging environment is often painful (and sometimes impossible).</p>
<p>Common Lisp seems to take debugging a step further. Sure, I've modified memory in a debugger to test out potential fixes, but being able to rewrite code and patch into a live process <em>in a sane way</em> sounds amazing--almost too good to be true.</p>
<p>That new workflow is my motivation for learning Common Lisp. I want to try interactively building a program to see if it's a pleasant way to work.</p>
<p>Is it a good idea to learn a new programming language and standard library just to explore a new workflow? Maybe not, but I'm not sure there's a great alternative. I'm sure similar REPL-editor integrations exist in other languages, but I also suspect that they're buggier because they've been bolted on, rather than supported from the beginning. Additionally, if I put in the work and am not satisfied with the workflow after all, I can rest assured that I gave it the best possible chance, using standard tools.</p>
<p>Regardless, it should be an interesting adventure!</p>

Hi,

I noticed that the remote for the Exway Flex has a missing resistor on the USB-C port. This makes it so that it will not charge with a type-C to C cable. Is this problem fixed with newer revisions of the remote?

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Exway,

I think you misunderstood my question. My remote does indeed have a USB-C port. However, it is missing the proper resistor that tells the connected type-C cable that it draws power. As a result the remote does not charge with a type-C-to-C cable.

My question was, whether or not this is fixed in newer revisions of the remote. 

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Exway,

Thank you for the confirmation. Is a fix planned in future revisions? Because the device violates USB-C specifications by not charging with C-to-C cables.

Hi Leo,

Yes, I understand that a firmware update will not resolve this issue, as it is a hardware problem.

However, for future revisions of this remote, this problem should be fixed, as USB-C spec conformity is very important for all devices shipping with a type-C port. I hope that this is forwarded over to the engineers so that they can incorporate it in future remote revisions. In fact, devices that do not meet this spec can be determined as defective in some jurisdictions.

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Eric,

I have reported your request and I referred this to the tech team, but I  got a negative answer, sorry about that

Leo
</code></pre><p>So, as of right now, it seems Exway’s stance on this issue is that it is a known issue, but not something they’re willing to address, and something they have no future plans to fix.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-problem-again">What is the problem again?</h2><p>USB-C ports are different from other ports [citation needed]. Specifically, unlike USB-A ports that give out 5 volts of power by default, USB-C requires a negotiation process before it’ll start handing out power. You may have heard about this on branding material of USB-C chargers: USB-PD, or USB Power Delivery, is the spec that devices must adhere to.</p><p>But PD negotiation chips are expensive, when compared to the overall price of the device. The electric skateboard remote in question probably costs five dollars or so to make. (In reality, it’s probably much less than that, if you mass-manufacture it.) Having a chip that costs half a dollar takes up a ton of the budget in the BoM (bill-of-materials).</p><p>But obviously, the USB-IF board thought of that, and they provide guidance on how devices should behave (or in this case, identify themselves) if they just want 5V of power, no power delivery negotiation required.</p><p>This is done by pulling down the CC pins to ground with 5.1K resistors. (Because there are two CC pins –&nbsp;CC1 and CC2 - you need two of them.) Failure to do so means that with a type-C-to-C cable and charger won’t work with said device – the charger will check the CC lines over the type-C cable, find it “floating” (as in, not pulled down with a resistor), and not send over the required 5V. (And if your device shipped with one resistor, <a href="https://medium.com/@leung.benson/how-to-design-a-proper-usb-c-power-sink-hint-not-the-way-raspberry-pi-4-did-it-f470d7a5910">or shares a resistor for the two CC pins</a> (ugh Raspberry Pi Foundation!!!), then it can lead to all sorts of wonky behavior, like the device refusing to charge if the cable is plugged in one way and charging normally when the port is flipped.)</p><p>In this case, Exway didn’t put in the required two resistors on the CC pins of the remote, and as a result it won’t charge with USB-C-to-C cables.</p><h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2><p>I know what you’re thinking. “Just charge it with a USB-A to C cable! What’s the big deal here?”</p><p>Sure, you can charge the remote with this workaround. But let’s look at the bigger picture.</p><p>These resistors cost <del>pennies</del> <a href="https://github.com/ericswpark/ericswpark.github.io-comments/issues/3#issuecomment-1652743946">a fraction of a penny</a> (thanks @rickcox on GitHub!) to include. And the instructions on how to do that is a simple Google search away. In fact, if you’re a competent electrical engineer designing circuits, you know your first job is to read the specifications before implementing them on your device.</p><p>Which means one of the following is true:</p><ul><li>Exway hired incompetent engineers that do a poor job, or</li><li>The engineers warned that the port did not follow specifications, but Exway decided not to fix it to save money, or</li><li>The engineering team at Exway made a geniune mistake and forgot to include the resistors, or didn’t know about this particular specification (I mean, the USB-C spec is really long, and probably very complicated thanks to the USB-IF committee).</li></ul><p>But I don’t think the third one is likely. Nobody caught the problem while testing this product during development? Nobody used a type-C-to-C cable to charge the remote while using engineering samples? No, it is borderline impossible for Exway to not be aware of this problem, <em>unless</em> they don’t do any sort of testing, which again I find hard to believe. (And if they don’t test their products, that’s even more horrifying.)</p><p>And now we know they’re aware of it, but they don’t care. They don’t plan to fix the problem, even when they’re made aware of it.</p><p>If they’re willing to cut corners on stuff like <em>this</em>, do you really want to risk your life and ride a electric skateboard from them, equipped with their battery? Even if we give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they did everything possible in regards to safety, I don’t think they would be very receptive to a fix if the battery spontaneously combusted, especially given the response above.</p><h2 id="so-what-can-i-do">So what can I do?</h2><p><strong>If you have an Exway board that is affected by this problem</strong>, then contact Exway and let them know that this is unacceptable. The product is defective by design, and they need to fix it.</p><p>Also, consider discontinuing the use of their skateboards.</p><p><strong>If you were considering purchasing an electric skateboard</strong>, consider alternative brands.</p><p>But most importantly, it’s important to spread the word and let manufacturers know that <strong>not conforming to USB-C spec in 2023 is absolutely unacceptable.</strong> Countless forum posts have been made about this exact issue, and there’s even a subreddit called r/USBCHardware that has constant threads on defective products like these. Help people that might not understand why their device won’t charge with certain cables by not letting these companies get away with bad design.</p><h2 id="links">Links</h2><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Exway/comments/15a5myg/exway_doesnt_care_about_usbc_conformity/">Discussion on r/Exway</a></p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/15a5o3f/oc_exway_doesnt_care_about_usbc_conformity/?">Discussion on r/USBCHardware</a></p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36886859">Discussion on Hacker News</a></p><h3>Related Posts</h3><ul><li><a href="https://ericswpark.com/blog/2021/2021-01-11-msi-laptop-usb-c-charger-design-problem/">MSI laptop USB-C charger design problem</a></li></ul></div></main></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>I</span></span> recently completed the road trip of a lifetime. I struck out from Napanee, Ontario, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Los Angeles</a>, California – a 2,800-mile trip that I had been planning since before Covid times. I wanted to take this time to think deeply about our overreliance on cars and our love affair with the open road.</p><p>There was a catch: as a non-driver, I would be crossing the country by Greyhound bus. It would have the advantage of getting me closer to the people I wanted to talk to, and the issues I knew I’d witness.</p><p>When I headed from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/detroit" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Detroit</a> towards Los Angeles, I knew I would encounter ecological catastrophe. I expected the poisoning of rivers, the desecration of desert ecosystems and feedlots heaving with antibiotic-infused cattle.</p><p>What I found was more complex, nuanced and intimate.</p><hr><p><span><span>H</span></span>istorically, chroniclers of the road have travelled by car – intrepid individuals in charge of their destinies. They also tend to be male. The only book I could find by a woman about crossing the US was <a href="https://archive.org/details/americadaybyday0000beau" data-link-name="in body link">America Day by Day</a><em><a href="https://archive.org/details/americadaybyday0000beau" data-link-name="in body link"> </a></em><a href="https://archive.org/details/americadaybyday0000beau" data-link-name="in body link">by Simone de Beauvoir</a>. It is also the only Great American Road Trip book that features Greyhound bus travel. Simone became my companion on the road.</p><gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/07/archive-zip/giv-13425IwRkLfFezTZ7/&quot;,&quot;scriptUrl&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Map of road trip’s path across USA&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;supporting&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:4,&quot;design&quot;:10},&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;4dcc848a-e240-4a65-950b-31fe24ee19d8&quot;,&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false}"><figure id="4dcc848a-e240-4a65-950b-31fe24ee19d8" data-alt="Map of road trip’s path across USA" data-cypress="interactive-element-Map%20of%20road%20trip%E2%80%99s%20path%20across%20USA" data-spacefinder-role="supporting"><a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/07/archive-zip/giv-13425IwRkLfFezTZ7/">Map of road trip’s path across USA</a></figure></gu-island><p>My first stop was Detroit. I was unable to find a clean, cheap hotel in the centre of town. My only option was to download an app by Sonder, which offered affordable Airbnb-style apartments with kitchens (thus saving me money on food). I handed over my debit card details to this San Francisco-based hospitality company and received a code with instructions to a room in a faceless building. I would not meet another human during my stay.</p><p>This atomisation, and the reliance on tech for our most basic human needs, unnerved me. It became a leitmotif during my trip, and also spoke to something I saw repeatedly: the exclusion of those without smartphones or credit cards. The cashless society appears to be winning.</p><p>From Detroit, I headed to St Louis, via <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/columbus" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Columbus</a>, Ohio, where the Greyhound would hit Route 66. My 20-minute stopover in Columbus was where a picture began to form of what Greyhound travel looks like today. The bus station consisted of a parking garage the size of a small airplane hangar. At both ends, electric doors opened and closed when a bus entered or exited. Between the two bus lanes sat a small concrete island where passengers were disgorged. There was a chemical toilet, no drinking fountain, very few seats and no windows. The air was choked with exhaust. A police van was parked at one end of the tunnel and armed policemen stood against a wall facing us.</p><figure id="1cf52802-8cc9-441a-8247-d187cd13aa00" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="colourful building in a parking lot" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Jefferson Avenue, in Detroit.</span> Photograph: Joanna Pocock</figcaption></figure><p>If you had commissioned an urban planner to design the most hostile, uncomfortable and unhealthy environment for passengers, this would be the result. I guess this is what you get when you travel in a seat costing $35 as opposed to a $200 plane ticket or in a car with a full tank of gas.</p><p>My next bus was scheduled to leave for St Louis – a mere 530-mile trip – at 3.00pm. I looked around at my fellow island-dwellers: an elderly man with four large zip-up bags printed with “Patient Belongings”; a couple travelling with a large fluffy blanket propped up against the Porta-Potti as a makeshift bed; a mother and her teenage son carrying large cardboard boxes. The sign on the empty Greyhound kiosk read: “As of 25 January 2023 – you will need photo ID to buy tickets.” Yet another barrier between those with little money, no fixed address, no car, no passport or credit card and their ability to travel.</p><p>Five pm and still no bus. Another passenger, a university student from India, had been checking his app, which showed that the bus had been and gone. How could we have missed it when we hadn’t left our island? Ruben, a young Amish man, approached. I gave him my phone so he could tell his family he would be late. A one-handed man asked us if we knew what was going on. We didn’t, so he told us his story: he had lost his wife and daughter recently and had just emerged from a 14-month coma – the result of being electrocuted at work, which also saw his hand melt. Like so many of the people I met on the road he had suffered extreme anguish, but had found God. “I am now never alone,” he told me.</p><figure id="0980333a-f67b-43ef-ae55-1d1c833c43db" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="concrete hangar" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The station in Columbus, Ohio.</span> Photograph: Joanna Pocock</figcaption></figure><p>The four of us were discussing tactics when a Greyhound employee showed up.

Apparently, its faulty hold had opened and bags had scattered along the highway – or so the story went. You never quite know on a Greyhound. The rides can take on a mythical dimension. Our driver had never done the Columbus–St Louis route before and we wound our way through unlit back roads until a marine on board snapped and ordered her to use his GPS.</p><p>At Indianapolis, the driver – shaken and angry – quit. A replacement was found, and we got into St Louis as the sun was rising. An eight-hour trip had stretched into 24.</p><hr><p><span><span>M</span></span>y motel in St Louis was a run-down Americas Best Value Inn &amp; Suites wedged between Interstate 44 and the Mississippi River. It was the cheapest motel I could find; there were conferences and ball games in town which meant prices had been jacked up. My filthy, dark room set me back $180 (and another “accidental” $415 taken from my debit card which took weeks to sort out).</p><p>After a sleepless night worrying about bedbugs, I got to the bus station at 6.00am. Several buses had been cancelled and the station was heaving. The vibe was nervy and angry. Miraculously, a coffee counter was open. In most stations, the diners are closed and the vending machines border on empty. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese as a skinny man with eyes the size of silver dollars started yelling about a lost cellphone which had his ticket on it.</p><figure id="be37f2c2-7dd4-464c-994c-754485ef663d" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="At the Louisville station." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>At the Louisville station.</span> Photograph: Joanna Pocock</figcaption></figure><p>The security guard, a tall trans woman with bright nail polish, calmly walked over to him. The guy next to me at the coffee counter nudged my arm and pointed: “Her revolver is the same as my grandad’s,” he laughed. “It’s old. Probably doesn’t even work.” The man was now pounding the wall while the security guard kept one hand on her holster.</p><p>We could relate to the screaming man – somewhat. “The problem is, it’s all digital now. They just look at their computer,” the guy said, miming someone typing officiously on a keyboard. “‘Sorry I can’t help you,’ they say if it’s not right there on their screen. Nobody cares.”</p><p>The combination of cancelled buses, a customer care phone line that is impossible to penetrate, an online system that can’t track bus routes accurately, and exasperated and unsupported Greyhound staff leads to desperation for travellers. Even for those with smartphones who can download the app, the information on it is often wrong.</p><hr><p>From St Louis to Albuquerque, I had over 1,000 miles to cover. I had planned to read, but none of the overhead lights worked. Many of the buses are slowly falling apart.</p><p>The company has been struggling for a while thanks to cheap flights and a pandemic which reframed close quarters with strangers as a potential death trap. Greyhound was bought in 2021 by the German-owned FlixBus. They don’t own the physical stations, however, and are fast becoming another Uber-style company, connecting consumers online with a service. One of my bus stops consisted of coordinates along a four-lane road.</p><figure id="6a049141-13ff-4af7-ba24-04eae08d6dca" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:29,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/31/vanlife-nomad-living-us-families&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;They changed everything and adopted #vanlife.

In the early 1960s, Greyhound buses were used by the Congress of Racial Equality for their Freedom Rides. Members rode through the south to ensure stations were complying with the US supreme court rulings to allow Black and white people to mix – sometimes leading to violence against the freedom riders.</p><p>None of this oppression is touched upon in the literature of the Great American Road Trip, because in your car you are removed from the communal, from the people who, behind the scenes, are keeping much of the country going: the cleaners, care workers, manual labourers and those doing necessary work – with little fanfare and often for very little money.</p><hr><p><span><span>A</span></span>s you approach Albuquerque, just beyond the 100th longitudinal meridian – the dividing line between east and west – the light changes, the horizon retreats, the emerald greens turn minty, and your heart opens a little. At the Texas panhandle, the ground takes on a deep red hue, and by the time you reach New Mexico, the colours have become psychedelic. You’ve arrived in the west.</p><p>My hotel in Albuquerque was an Econo Lodge on Central Avenue (AKA Route 66), tucked under the I-25. A five-minute walk from my front door was what I took to be an abandoned motel. As I took some photos, a guy in a pickup rolled up. “Are you looking for Jesse?” he asked. Not being a Breaking Bad fan, I didn’t get the connection. Pickup guy was the owner of the Crossroads Motel. “This is where Jesse stayed,” he said. If buildings could be method actors, the Crossroads would win an Oscar, with the glowing pink Sandia Mountains and golden light in supporting roles. As with most of my stops, I only allowed myself a night in Albuquerque, but I had wished for more. I never like leaving New Mexico. Simone de Beauvoir called it the “Land of Dreams”, a place that made her “muse about the mysterious marriage binding our species to this planet”.</p><p>The only direct Greyhound bus you can book from Albuquerque to Vegas takes a minimum of 21 hours and does a bizarre route via San Bernardino.

A city bus honked and pulled up next to me. The driver motioned for me to get on rather than walk alone in the dark. What I didn’t know was that Greyhound stations now often close between buses to keep homeless people out – yet another communal space closed to those without the money to access private spaces. Dozens sat on the steps of the station shivering; some were lying in the foetal position; others hopped from foot to foot like their feet were on fire. I gave what food I had to anyone who wanted it, but I still had an hour before my bus.</p><p>I remembered Beauvoir’s descriptions of bus stations with restaurants, juke boxes, showers and lockers she compares to columbariums. Columbariums! I walked to a cafe where I very slowly nursed a cup of chamomile tea as part of my near-dehydration diet which had managed so far to keep me from having to use a bathroom on the bus.</p><hr><p><span><span>I</span></span> was arriving in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Las Vegas</a> on a Thursday, when the prices rise, so I booked the cheapest off-Strip motel I could find. As the bus approached town, I decided to read the reviews: “Filthy hotel … Wish I would have read reviews before I went to this dump.” Stained sheets and gunshots were mentioned. I panicked and texted a writer friend in Vegas who told me about the HotelTonight app. Once again, I succumbed to the appification of travel, which saw me bag a room at the Tropicana for $50 – far less than the price of my now-cancelled room at the Wyndham Super 8.</p><p>In 2021, Vegas’s Greyhound station at the Plaza Hotel moved 10 miles south of the city’s downtown. With its xeriscaped native plants, the building is a glass and steel model of a functional civic space – albeit one removed from the centre of the city. After two nights in Vegas, I filed on to the Los Angeles-bound bus for the final leg of my trip, and watched a ticketless young woman with very swollen ankles beg the driver to take her out of town. We pulled away, leaving her crying quietly on a bench. The city disappeared behind concrete highways, eventually giving way to a vast desert draped in a strawberry-coloured dawn.</p><hr><p><span><span>W</span></span>hen Beauvoir first arrived in the US, she wrote about seeing “all of America on the horizon. As for me, I no longer exist. There.

That sense of escaping the enterprise we call “our life” – that is the pull. Although, for many, their journey <em>is</em> their life. What I found on this trip was a changed landscape: gone are the small, clean, cheap motels in the centre of cities, gone are public spaces where anyone can find a water fountain, a bathroom, a place to nurse a cheap cup of coffee and human company. And yet the camaraderie on the Greyhound is just about hanging on – but I wonder for how long?</p><p>When you find yourself gazing at the horizon as the sun rises, each little sage bush with its purple shadow stretching into a seemingly infinite sandy blur, a quiet descends. Everyone feels the power of these landscapes. Maybe that’s what’s unique about road tripping by Greyhound. There are other places we think we’d rather be, but here we are in the moment, trundling along all of us together looking out at the same earth, breathing the same air, all of us knowing deep down that where we are really is where we’d like to be.</p><p>There is no app for this feeling and, thankfully, there never will be.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Oops, I think I just turned the legendary personal wiki system into an offline-first, installable, encrypted, synchronized Progressive Web App</p><div>
		<p><em>tl;dr: go play with the new thing <a href="https://tiddly.packett.cool/">there</a>, report issues <a href="https://codeberg.org/valpackett/tiddlypwa/issues">there</a> and support me <a href="https://www.patreon.com/valpackett">there</a> :3 but please do read the full story below!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> is quite a famous note-taking system.
Describing itself as “a non-linear personal web notebook”, it’s actually quite a bit more than that.
Thanks to a plugin system, it’s basically an app platform, and plenty of <a href="https://thaddeusjiang.github.io/Projectify/">cool stuff</a> has been made for it.</p>
<p>And it exists as a unique thing: a self-contained web application—a single HTML file with both the app and the content—that you can take around on a USB flash drive.
Oh wait… who even uses those anymore for anything other than OS installers and bringing files to a print shop?</p>
<p>So of course, a bunch of storage solutions have sprung up.
There’s an official node.js based server mode where it becomes more like a traditional web app,
there are browser extensions and even modules inside of TW itself for saving the updated single file to a server,
there are mobile and desktop apps that try to combine that saving with some kind of offline support,
there are people using a file sync solution like Syncthing – I’ve even heard of some people using Syncthing with the server version,
syncing the <code>.tid</code> files between devices and <em>running the server in <a href="https://termux.dev/en/">Termux</a> on their phones</em> to access them on mobile.
Oof. While I’m nerdy enough to <em>be able</em> to do that, I’m also enough of a spoiled basic consumer to know that that’s not the user experience <em>I want</em>.</p>
<p>What I want is something that works like <em>an app</em>. Fully working offline, syncing <em>efficiently</em> (not by POSTing a multi-megabyte HTML file), quickly and reliably when online.
And with client-side encryption, because there’s just <em>no reason</em> to let the server side read the contents here.</p>
<p>There has actually been one good attempt at bringing this kind of sync to TiddlyWiki: <a href="https://noteself.org/">NoteSelf</a>, which integrated <a href="https://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a> for storage.
I liked the sound of it, but in practice it wasn’t up to my standards.
It’s a heavyweight modification of TiddlyWiki that doesn’t keep up with latest core updates, PouchDB/CouchDB feel a bit heavy themselves, there’s no encryption, and the offline support is just “run it from your hard drive”.</p>
<p>So… this is where I come in.
Last year, looking to try TiddlyWiki once again, looking through the options and getting frustrated with the aforementioned everything, one thing inspired me.
I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/3420">a basic IndexedDB plugin</a> which made me realize that there is an API for storage backends inside TiddlyWiki.
I realized that there’s no need for core modifications, that I could just start with this and—knowing what I know about the web platform—take it to the next level.
Make a plugin that combines IndexedDB, encryption, a sync engine (with a custom super-lightweight server counterpart for it), and adds a Service Worker and a Web Manifest
to turn TW into a <a href="https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/">Progressive Web App</a> that works offline and installs on mobile with “add to home screen”.
That was a whole Vision. And I knew it had to be done. It just had to exist. So I got to work, putting aside my typical FreeBSD system-level work to get back to good old web dev.</p>
<p>Now, a whole year after that inspiring moment, having gone through huge personal life changes and a reverse putting-aside in favor of my other work again…
it’s finally ready for the public to see.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p><a href="https://tiddly.packett.cool/">Here it is.</a>.</p>

<p>It’s still rough around the edges, but I’ve put <em>a lot</em> of effort into the setup experience, hiding all the complexity of the flexibility available with how the system is structured
and presenting a very simple “happy path” where if you open the app from a sync server it’s already preconfigured to sync with that server and so on.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried to document it, though I have to say that detailing the security model was a lot easier than trying to explain the whole synchronization/server/content-versus-app thing.
Hopefully at least for those familiar with TiddlyWiki it’s not too hard to understand that there’s the “app wiki” with the core/plugins/themes and the separate encrypted content,
and that the sync server can work with both (differently).</p>
<p>Now, to justify the whole existence of this blog post, let me also list some random fun facts and whatnot – everything that didn’t fit in the documentation itself :)</p>
<h2 id="random-development-tidbits-ha" tabindex="-1"><a href="#random-development-tidbits-ha"><span>Random Development Tidbits (ha)</span></a></h2>
<p>Because of how browsers work, I’ve had to take extra care to make the storage work across multiple running tabs without corrupting anything.
Moreover, I made it all explicitly work together well and it’s kind of a hidden feature now.
Thanks to a combination of BroadcastChannels and Web Locks, you can enjoy a multi-tab experience.
Browse the same wiki simultaneously in two tabs, the navigation will be independent but any changes will be visible everywhere.</p>
<p>This whole <a href="https://codeberg.org/valpackett/argon2ian">argon2ian</a> thing you might’ve seen was indeed created for TiddlyPWA!
I’ve started out using PBKDF2 because it’s available in the Web Crypto API, but eventually decided to upgrade to a modern password hash rather than cranking out iteration counts.
I wasn’t satisfied with the state of existing Argon2 WASM+JS wrappers, so I set out to make my own, code-golfed to the tiniest size possible.
The <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9g8r2ffu4o">yak shaving stack</a> got even deeper during that subproject.
Also, I have used the very new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Compression_Streams_API">Compression Streams API</a> to be able to bundle the Wasm binary as compressed while not having to bunlde a decompressor.
And this has led to the creation of a very funny bug…</p>
<p>…so since that API was already used there I started using it to compress long-enough tiddler contents as well.
Stream APIs are kind of annoying when you don’t want to stream, so I went with the whole “a stream is an async iterator” thing.
When I first gave TiddlyPWA to an external tester I got a report of not being able to save a particular tiddler.
Turns out, that iterator thing is only available in Firefox as of right now.
I accidentally made it so that <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9gv2anuoss"><em>tiddlers longer than 240 bytes would only work in Firefox</em></a>. :D</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9gjs72259o">really funny bug</a> is something I <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1840934">bugzilled here</a> for Firefox Android.
When using <a href="https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard">FlorisBoard</a>, pressing “enter” would result in the password mask (bullet ••• characters) becoming the actual value of the input.
This is something that I have discovered while typing passwords into my TiddlyPWA password prompt!
I also ran into an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/issues/15244">already reported</a> <code>prompt()</code> bug in Firefox on iOS.</p>
<p>The server was initially written with SQLite as it is now, but when Deno KV was announced I got excited and rewrote it to use KV, hoping to leverage Deno Deploy for an easy server hosting experience.
I quickly ran into a 64KiB limit per entry when trying to do the whole “save the HTML page” thing, but I found <a href="https://github.com/kitsonk/kv-toolbox">kv-toolbox</a>, a module that would do chunking for me.
Then, after everything was ready, already with the aforementioned other person testing it, I discovered (and <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9h1dr9g4jq">ranted about</a>) the undocumented <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/19284">10 mutations in a transaction</a> limitation.
I wasn’t about to give up on atomicity, so I just rewrote everything back to SQLite in a burst of anger and now I hold a bit of a grudge against Deno KV &gt;_&lt;
Even though I recognize that, obviously, it’s just that <em>my use case is absolutely not the intended one</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/68695508">This TypeScript thing</a> that I <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9h1fdi76dt">referenced on fedi</a> was actually for the SQLite part of the TiddlyPWA server.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9hlma651nz">very last minute</a> backwards-incompatible change I suddenly managed to do right before release.</p>
<h2 id="so-tiddlypwa-needs-you" tabindex="-1"><a href="#so-tiddlypwa-needs-you"><span>So, TiddlyPWA Needs YOU!</span></a></h2>
<p>I probably could’ve tried to make it as a commercial product with a centrally hosted server, but that’s not what I made.
TiddlyPWA is fully free (both “as in beer” and “as in freedom”) because I believe in software that empowers everyone to own their data <em>and the software itself</em>, that <s>is never gonna give you up</s> doesn’t die for business reasons.</p>
<p>Right now TiddlyPWA is still early in its development, still missing a lot of things, but hopefully is solid enough to make you check it out.
If you like what you see, please consider helping me continue working on it:</p>
<ul>
<li>go ahead and <a href="https://tiddly.packett.cool/">try TiddlyPWA</a> first of course!</li>
<li>report issues, read the code and suggest code changes <a href="https://codeberg.org/valpackett/tiddlypwa">on Codeberg</a>;</li>
<li>support me <a href="https://www.patreon.com/valpackett">on Patreon</a> :3 I’m trying to do this open source thing full time, which is only possible with your support!</li>
<li>follow me <a href="https://blahaj.zone/@valpackett">on the fediverse</a>;</li>
<li>share TiddlyPWA with anyone who might be interested.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://dwdraju.medium.com/?source=post_page-----1b9a340ca43d--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="Raju Dawadi" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*r7hrULSjglXP2M63J8Txug.png" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy"></p></div></a></div><p id="5b1f">You had things running with occasional glitches and there was always an excuse “It works in my machine” as there is rarely identical machine &amp; OS for all. So, you need a solution to avoid same excuse when code breaks. Now, someone told about a blue chip solution called “Container” which will have all dependencies packaged, works on any machine, maintains parity on dev to production environment, no conflicts at all. So stay chill !!!</p><figure></figure><p id="73ee">And you started building container images, grabbed the concept of writing Dockerfile, port mapping, package installation commands, decrease image size, follow best practices and yay its real !!!</p><figure></figure><p id="7bd8">Gradually, other developers also started using container and after sometime, you started using docker in production. Cool story !!!</p><h2 id="23a2">But … After a month …</h2><p id="74b7">People start to spend an hour daily on fixing container issue. And the voice starts raising — “<strong>It works in my container</strong>”</p><figure></figure><h2 id="8233">So, what happened?</h2><p id="4e61">Was it too early to adopt container technologies(like docker hype)? Do you need a professional before diving? Is there any issue from application or flaw in container? No ….</p><p id="7cc7"><strong>Let’s dive into why the “It works in my container” situation arises</strong></p><h2 id="576b"><strong>1. Using <em>latest</em> image tag</strong></h2><p id="935c">Yes. It’s number one thing to always keep in mind. While starting to learn we use <em>latest</em> tag of every image. But it’s like to put axe on your own foot. Consider an example:</p><pre><span id="9d76">From node:latest</span></pre><p id="4904">At the time you started to use docker, the <em>latest</em> tag was for NodeJS version let’s say 10 but after a month when someone formatted her laptop or a new guy is on-boarded, the <em>latest</em> tag is now version 12. But your application is best suite for the previous version. All of the people are using same Dockerfile but this is the reason why you are forced to say loud “It works in my container”.</p><p id="cf56">So, always use versioned tag. Use <code>ubuntu:16.04</code> or <code>node:12-alpine</code> but never <code>ubuntu:latest</code> or <code>node:alpine</code></p><h2 id="e641">2. <strong>Container engine and other environment version</strong>:</h2><p id="e214">In case of Docker, it tries to make releases with backward compatibility in concern and feature removal is communicated three releases in advance. This could be a reason if the engine is not upgraded since long time.</p><p id="bb0f">If you use Docker Compose, the changes and versioning of yml files is very important. While versioning docker-compose file, its always a good practice to specify minor release. Like, not use <code>version: “3”</code> but <code>version: "3.7"</code> because by default the prior means <code>version: "3.0"</code> and there are many updates on each release of docker-compose which is supported by the upgraded version only. It’s a way to avoid ping. <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Here</a> is the compose versioning and compatibility matrix guide.</p><h2 id="fc34">3. <strong>Dealing with variables</strong>:</h2><p id="24ad">In general, we read variables &amp; secret for applications through config file like: <code>config.json</code> or <code>.env</code> . But with docker, there are are multiple ways, that is run time and build time environment variables. A simple way to pass environment variable is:</p><pre><span id="c1a2">docker run -it -e KEY=VALUE --name nginx nginx:1.15-alpine /bin/sh -c "env | grep KEY"</span></pre><p id="945d">And through docker compose:</p><pre><span id="e8e1">web:<br>  environment:<br>    - KEY=VALUE</span></pre><p id="c00a">Additionally, with compose we can pass variables of a file:</p><pre><span id="47bf">web:<br>  env_file:<br>    - web-variables.env</span></pre><p id="a8a1">Also, we can use variables of file to another key:</p><pre><span id="5fda">web:<br>  image: "nginx:${NGINX_VERSION}"</span></pre><p id="a46e">In this case, by default compose reads <code>.env</code> file and checks for the value of <code>NGINX_VERSION</code> and adds it.</p><p id="db0e">One major difference in reading directly from file and environment variables is - in case of file, the changes in file are reflected immediately if volume is shared but if we use docker environment variables, it requires docker restart. So, in case of compose:</p><p id="0962"><code>$ docker-compose restart web</code></p><p id="c24e">Then only, new variables are available for the environment reading through <code>PROCESS.ENV</code></p><p id="074d">Additionally, there’s another variable called <code>ARG</code> which is available only at build time so that the variable is not available during run time. But <code>ENV</code> is available both during build &amp; run time.</p><h2 id="aaca">4. <strong>Image build process</strong>:</h2><p id="9898">Official docker images are not always enough. We need some customization and additional packages which takes long time and resources if we do each step on everyone’s system. So, we take a base image and build our own image by customization. Here, manual addition and commit of packages should always be avoided:</p><pre><span id="f27b">$ docker run -it --name alpine alpine:3.8 /bin/sh</span><span id="e60b">/ # apk add busybox-extras</span><span id="cc93">[CTRL+p CTRL+q]</span><span id="82d4">$ docker commit alpine alpine-custom</span><span id="ad51">$ docker push alpine-custom</span></pre><p id="5897">Here, you lost the track of state. Also, the version of <code>busybox-extras</code> that you installed now may not be available later. So, always use Dockerfile with versioning of package:</p><pre><span id="e4b1">FROM alpine:3.8<br>RUN apk add busybox-extras-1.28.4-r3</span></pre><h2 id="89f4">5. Files and folders permission:</h2><p id="a915">Let’s dive with an example:</p><pre><span id="dbdf">#docker-compose.yml<br>version: "3"<br>services:<br>  myapp:<br>    image: node:11-alpine<br>    container_name: "myapp"<br>    volumes:<br>      - ./:/app<br>    entrypoint: /bin/sh<br>    command: -c "sleep 5 &amp;&amp; cd /app &amp;&amp; yarn &amp;&amp; yarn start"</span></pre><p id="7201">After running <code>docker-compose up -d</code> , let’s check files &amp; folders permission</p><figure><figcaption>files &amp; folder permission in shared docker volume</figcaption></figure><p id="7d95">Here, we can see <code>node_modules</code> and <code>yarn.lock</code> is owned by root user as these folder &amp; file were created inside of docker. Similarly, if there are any uploads that would be owned by root(Same issue will arise only on Linux machine but not on MacOS). This will cause problem when you have to edit or add file from host system and also git will detect changes. We cannot afford to change permission each time but bring the owner of every files &amp; folders to current user. Here is how we can do that:</p><pre><span id="746c">#Updated docker-compose.yml<br>version: "3"<br>services:<br>  myapp:<br>    image: node:11-alpine<br>    container_name: "myapp"<br>    volumes:<br>      - ./:/app<br>    entrypoint: /bin/sh<br>    command: -c "sleep 5 &amp;&amp; cd /app &amp;&amp; yarn &amp;&amp; yarn start"<br>    user: ${CURRENT_UID}</span></pre><p id="40c2">Export a variable with current user and group id</p><pre><span id="a172">export CURRENT_UID=$(id -u):$(id -g)</span></pre><p id="1467">And start container</p><pre><span id="4680">CURRENT_UID=$CURRENT_UID docker-compose up -d</span></pre><p id="bb7c">Now, we can see all the files and folders owned by current host user.</p><h2 id="9b82">6. Sharing between host and container volume:</h2><p id="3dc9">Though docker was introduced with the concept of — run once &amp; run everywhere — while using volumes, there’s difference in case of MacOS. It uses osxfs as shared file system solution on Docker Desktop for Mac edition. While mounting host path inside container, additional step is to be performed. Let’s take an example:</p><p id="c35e">docker-compose.yml</p><pre><span id="cc85">version: "3.2"<br>services:<br>  myapp:<br>    container_name: myapp<br>    image: node:11-alpine<br>    volumes:<br>      - ./:/app</span></pre><p id="976b">If you run <code>docker-compose up</code> , it will throw error:</p><pre><span id="4350">ERROR: for myapp  Cannot start service myapp: b'Mounts denied: \r\nThe path /private/tmp/docker/myapp\r\nis not shared from OS X and is not known to Docker.\r\nYou can configure shared paths from Docker -&gt; Preferences... -&gt; File Sharing.\r\nSee <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces</a> for more info.\r\n.'</span></pre><p id="5808">But with same case, it runs fine on Linux environment. For mac, the path has to be added from Docker preferences menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; File sharing.</p><figure><figcaption>Add bind mount on macOS</figcaption></figure><p id="2478">Also, if there is hard coded volume path, its common to create problem for other users.</p></div><div><p id="ad72">There are other issues which might arise like:</p><ul><li id="388e">Port conflict if you have any processes running on host machine and docker uses same port</li><li id="8413">Proxy or load balancer used for sending traffic to different containers based on virtual hosts urls. There might be upload limits, additional or modified header sent by proxy</li><li id="a1c1">Using dual packages: host installed and from inside docker commands which could have different versions.</li></ul><p id="d46a">If you have any issues faced while running applications on container which raised “It works in my container” talk, feel free to share on comment.</p><p id="5e25">Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwdraju/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dwdraju" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter</a> where I share interesting updates.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <div><p><span>Congress has </span><a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/D89FC49B-0714-4124-B8B1-4F35A85F5E02"><span>resurrected the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)</span></a><span>, a bill that would increase surveillance and restrict access to information in the name of protecting children online. KOSA was introduced in 2022 but failed to gain traction, and today its authors, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), have reintroduced it with slight modifications. Though some of these changes were made in response to </span><a href="https://cdt.org/insights/coalition-letter-on-privacy-and-free-expression-threats-in-kids-online-safety-act/"><span>over 100</span></a><span> civil society organizations and LGBTQ+ rights groups’ criticisms of the bill, its latest version is still troubling. Today’s version of KOSA would still require surveillance of anyone sixteen and under. It would put the tools of censorship in the hands of state attorneys general, and would greatly endanger the rights, and safety, of young people online. And KOSA’s burdens will affect adults, too, who will likely face hurdles to accessing legal content online as a result of the bill.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-kosa-will-censor-the-internet-but-won-t-help-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TELL CONGRESS:&nbsp;OPPOSE THE KIDS ONLINE SAFETY ACT</a></p>
<h3><b>KOSA Still Requires Filtering and Blocking of Legal Speech</b></h3>
<p><span>Online child safety is a complex issue, but KOSA attempts to boil it down to a single solution. The bill holds platforms liable if their designs and services do not “prevent and mitigate” a list of societal ills: anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance use disorders, physical violence, online bullying and harassment, sexual exploitation and abuse, and suicidal behaviors. Additionally, platforms would be responsible for patterns of use that indicate or encourage addiction-like behaviors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Deciding what designs or services lead to these problems would primarily be left up to the Federal Trade Commission and 50 individual state attorneys general to decide. Ultimately, this puts platforms that serve young people in an impossible situation: without clear guidance regarding what sort of design or content might lead to these harms, they would likely censor </span><i><span>any </span></i><span>discussions that could make them liable. To be clear: though the bill’s language is about “designs and services,” the designs of a platform are not causing eating disorders. As a result, KOSA would make platforms liable for the content they show minors, full stop. It will be based on vague requirements that any Attorney General could, more or less, make up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Attorneys General Would Decide What Content is Dangerous To Young People</b></h3>
<p><span>KOSA’s co-author, Sen. Blackburn of Tennessee, has referred to education about race discrimination as “</span><a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/7/why-is-critical-race-theory-dangerous-for-our-kids"><span>dangerous for kids</span></a><span>.” Many states have agreed, and recently moved to limit public education about the history of </span><a href="https://news.trust.org/item/20211001103420-4bdez"><span>race</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/594980-florida-isnt-the-only-state-with-a-dont-say-gay-bill-15"><span>gender, and sexuality</span></a><span> discrimination. If KOSA passes, platforms are likely to preemptively block conversations that discuss these topics, as well as discussions about substance use, suicide, and eating disorders. As we’ve written in </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/kids-online-safety-act-heavy-handed-plan-force-platforms-spy-young-people"><span>our previous commentary on the bill</span></a><span>, KOSA could result in loss of access to information that a majority of people would agree is not dangerous. Again, issues like substance abuse, eating disorders, and depression are complex societal issues, and there is not clear agreement on their causes or their solutions. To pick </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/07/645609248/whats-the-evidence-that-supervised-drug-injection-sites-save-lives"><span>just one example</span></a><span>: in some communities, safe injection sites are seen as part of a solution to substance abuse; in others, they are seen as part of the problem. Under KOSA, could a platform be sued for displaying content about them—or about needle exchanges, naloxone, or other harm reduction techniques?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The latest version of KOSA tries, but ultimately fails, to address this problem in two ways: first, by clarifying that the bill shouldn’t stop a platform or its users from “providing resources for the prevention or mitigation” of its listed harms; and second, by adding that claims under the law should be consistent with evidence-informed medical information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, were an Attorney General to claim that content about trans healthcare (for example) poses risks to minors’ health, they would have no shortage of ‘evidence-informed' medical information on which to base their assertion. Numerous states have laws on the books claiming that gender-affirming care for trans youth is child abuse. In an article for the </span><i><span>American Conservative</span></i><span> titled “</span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/how-big-tech-turns-kids-trans"><span>How Big Tech Turns Kids Trans</span></a><span>,” the authors point to numerous studies that indicate gender-affirming care is dangerous, despite leading medical groups </span><a href="https://transhealthproject.org/resources/medical-organization-statements/"><span>recognizing the medical necessity</span></a><span> of treatments for gender dysphoria. In the same article, the authors laud KOSA, which would prohibit “content that poses risks to minors’ physical and mental health.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The same issue exists on both sides of the political spectrum. KOSA is ambiguous enough that an Attorney General who wanted to censor content regarding gun ownership, or Christianity, could argue that it has harmful effects on young people.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-kosa-will-censor-the-internet-but-won-t-help-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TELL CONGRESS:&nbsp;OPPOSE THE KIDS ONLINE SAFETY ACT</a></p>
<h3><b>KOSA Would Still Lead to Age Verification On Platforms</b></h3>
<p><span>Another change to KOSA comes in response to concerns that the law would lead to age verification requirements for platforms. For a platform to know whether or not it is liable for its impact on minors, it must, of course, know whether or not minors use its platform, and who they are. Age verification mandates </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/age-verification-mandates-would-undermine-anonymity-online"><span>create many issues</span></a><span> — in particular, they undermine anonymity by requiring all users to upload identity verification documentation and share private data, no matter their age. Other types of “age assurance” tools such as age estimation also require users to upload biometric information such as their photos, and have accuracy issues. Ultimately, no method is sufficiently reliable, offers complete coverage of the population, and has respect for the protection of individuals' data and privacy and their security.&nbsp; France’s National Commission on Informatics and Liberty, CNIL, reached this conclusion in a recent analysis of current age verification methods.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In response to these concerns, KOSA’s authors have made two small changes, but they’re unlikely to stop platforms from implementing age verification. Earlier versions would have held platforms liable if they “knew or should have known” that an impacted user was sixteen years of age or younger. The latest version of KOSA adds “reasonableness” to this requirement, holding platforms liable if they “know or </span><i><span>reasonably</span></i><span> should know” a user is a minor. But legally speaking, this doesn't result in giving platforms any better guidance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The second change is to add explicit language that age verification is not required under the “Privacy Protections” section of the bill. The bill now states that a covered platform is not required to implement an age gating </span><i><span>or</span></i><span> age verification functionality.&nbsp;</span><span>But there is essentially no outcome where sites don’t implement age verification. There’s no way for platforms to block nebulous categories of content for minors without explicitly requiring age verification.&nbsp;</span><span>If a 16-year-old user truthfully identifies herself, the law will hold platforms liable, unless they filter and block content. If a 16-year-old user identifies herself as an adult, and the platform does not use age verification, then it will still be held liable, because it should have “reasonably known” the user’s age.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A platform could, alternatively, skip age verification and simply institute blocking and filtering of certain types of content for all users regardless of age—which would be a terrible blow for speech online for everyone. So despite these bandaids on the bill, it still leaves platforms with no choices except to institute heavy-handed censorship and age verification requirements. These impacts would affect not just young people, but every user of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>There Are Better Ways to Fix The Internet</b></h3>
<p><span>While we appreciate that lawmakers have responded to concerns raised about the bill, its main requirements—that platforms must “prevent and mitigate” complex issues that </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/04/25/1171773181/social-media-teens-mental-health"><span>researchers don’t even agree the platforms are responsible for</span></a><span> in the first place—will lead to a more siloed, and more censored, internet. We also stand by our </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/kids-online-safety-act-heavy-handed-plan-force-platforms-spy-young-people"><span>previous criticisms of KOSA</span></a><span>—that it unreasonably buckets all young people into a single category, and that it requires surveillance of minors by parents. They&nbsp; remain troubling aspects of the law.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no question that some elements of social media today are toxic to users. Companies want users to spend as much time on their platforms as possible, because they make money from targeted ad sales, and these ad sales are fueled by invasive data collection. EFF has long supported&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/party-its-1979-og-antitrust-back-baby"><span>stronger competition laws</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/effs-recommendations-consumer-data-privacy-laws"><span>comprehensive data privacy legislation</span></a><span> in part because they can open the field to competitors to today’s social media options, and force platforms to innovate, offering more user choice. If users are unhappy with the content or design of current platforms, they should be able to move to other options that offer different forms of content moderation, better privacy protections, and other features that improve the experience for everyone, including young people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>KOSA would not enhance the ability of users to choose where they spend their time. Instead, it would shrink the number of options, by making strict requirements that only today’s largest, most profitable platforms could follow. It would solidify today’s Big Tech giants, while forcing them to collect more private data on all users. It would force them to spy on young people, and it would hand government the power to limit what topics they can see and discuss online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is not a safety bill—it is a surveillance and censorship bill. Please tell your Senators and representatives not to pass it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<article id="post-103226">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>This post is an update to the proposal for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/12/lets-make-wordpress-officially-support-sqlite/">officially support SQLite in WordPress</a>. The initial implementation was included in the <a href="https://w.org/plugins/performance-lab">Performance Lab</a> <span tabindex="0">plugin<span> <span>A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party</span></span></span> and then released as a <a href="https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/">stand-alone plugin</a>.</p>



<p>That initial implementation was based on <a href="https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-sqlite-db">wp-sqlite-db</a> by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aaemnnosttv/">@aaemnnosttv</a>, which in turn, was a fork of an <a href="https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-integration/">older plugin</a>. </p>



<p>Over the course of the last 6 month, issues with that implementation surfaced and the project experienced some limitations. As a result, we (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/zieladam/">@zieladam</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aristath/">@aristath</a>) decided to rewrite it using a more future-proof concept.</p>



<p>The code has been completely rewritten to use an SQL Lexer and is now stable and able to handle all WordPress queries properly. The SQL Lexer is part of the <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/sql-parser">PHPMyAdmin/SQL-Parser</a> project (licensed under the <span tabindex="0">GPL<span> <span>GNU General Public License. Also see <a href="#copyright-license">copyright license</a>.</span></span></span> 2.0) and it was adapted for WordPress, effectively implementing a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/sqlite-database-integration/pull/9">MySQL to SQLite translation engine</a>. This provides improved security, as well as compatibility.</p>



<p>The update has already been released in the standalone plugin and will soon be ported to the Performance Lab plugin. Most WordPress Unit Tests now pass, with the exception of a few that require patching WordPress <span tabindex="0">Core<span> <span>Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress.</span></span></span>.</p>



<p>The next step would be to implement these changes to WordPress core instead of using a plugin. To that end, we have a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220">draft Pull Request</a> and an accompanying <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57793">Trac ticket</a>.</p>



<h2>Why should this be in Core and not as a plugin?</h2>



<p>In its current form, the SQLite implementation is a plugin. Just like all plugins, it can only be installed on a pre-existing website. As a result, a site can only use an SQLite database if it already has a <span tabindex="0">MySQL<span> <span>MySQL is a relational database management system. A database is a structured collection of data where content, configuration and other options are stored. <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">https://www.mysql.com/</a>.</span></span></span> database – effectively negating all the benefits that SQLite can bring to WordPress.</p>



<p>Using the&nbsp;<em>featured</em>&nbsp;plugin is a great way to allow users to test the implementation and iron out any issues etc. However, long-term, it doesn’t make sense to use it as a plugin.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What are the next necessary decisions?</h2>



<p>There needs to be a decision, if the WordPress project wants to provide an option to users during WordPress installation, so they can choose whether they want to use a MySQL or an SQLite database. If no option is available in the <span tabindex="0">UI<span> <span>User interface</span></span></span>, then users would have to manually add <code>define( 'DB_ENGINE', 'sqlite' );</code> in their <code>wp-config.php</code> file.</p>



<p>Adding an option to select the database type may initially raise some eyebrows thinking that the famous 5-minute installation process will become more complicated, but in fact, it’s the exact opposite: If users pick SQLite as their database, they don’t need to create a MySQL db or enter their credentials in the installation screen, as no separate server is required.</p>



<p>A prototype of the UI changes are already available via the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220">pull request in WordPress Core</a>, to showcase how easy it would be to install WP using SQLite instead of MySQL. </p>



<p>The proof-of-concept UI in that implementation checks if the server supports SQLite and MySQL: </p>



<ul><li>If SQLite is supported but not MySQL, then it defaults to SQLite and no UI option is shown to users. This is for example what happens in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://playground.wordpress.net/" target="_blank">WordPress Playground</a>&nbsp;– it is vanilla WordPress that defaults to&nbsp;SQLite.</li>



<li>Similarly, if the server supports MySQL and not SQLite, then the installation will use MySQL and no option will be shown to users.</li>



<li>The UI option will only show if both SQLite and MySQL are supported by the server.</li>
</ul><h2>How can this implementation be tested? </h2>



<p>The next step would be to thoroughly test the implementation with all the plugins you normally use. You can use the <a href="https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/">SQLite Database Integration plugin</a> to test an SQLite database on your existing website, or better yet – you can test the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220">pull request in WordPress Core</a>.</p>



<p>If you test the plugin, keep in mind that it does not copy your current data from MySQL to SQLite, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/12/20/help-us-test-the-sqlite-implementation/#faq">as mentioned in the call-for-testing post</a>.</p>

I cannot bear the silence and isolation.</span></em></p><p><em><strong>Death:</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Emptiness is a mirror turned to your own face.&nbsp;</em></p><p>— Ingmar Bergman’s workbook, April 5, 1955</p></blockquote><p>In the early 2010s, a popular idea was to provide coworking spaces and shared living to people who were building startups. That way the founders would have a thriving social scene of peers to percolate ideas with as they figured out how to build and scale a venture. This was attempted thousands of times by different startup incubators. There are no famous success stories.</p><p>In 2015, Sam Altman, who was at the time the president of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that has helped scale startups collectively worth $600 billion, tweeted in reaction that “not [providing coworking spaces] is part of what makes YC work.” Later, in a 2019 interview with Tyler Cowen, Altman was asked to explain why.</p><blockquote><p><span>SAM ALTMAN: Good ideas — actually, no,&nbsp;</span><em>great&nbsp;</em><span>ideas are fragile. Great ideas are easy to kill. An idea in its larval stage — all the best ideas when I first heard them sound bad. And all of us, myself included, are much more affected by what other people think of us and our ideas than we like to admit.</span></p><p>If you are just four people in your own door, and you have an idea that sounds bad but is great, you can keep that self-delusion going. If you’re in a coworking space, people laugh at you, and no one wants to be the kid picked last at recess. So you change your idea to something that sounds plausible but is never going to matter. It’s true that coworking spaces do kill off the very worst ideas, but a band-pass filter for startups is a terrible thing because they kill off the best ideas, too.</p></blockquote><p>This is an insight that has been repeated by artists, too. Pablo Picasso: “Without great solitude, no serious work is possible.” James Baldwin: “Perhaps the primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid: the state of being alone.” Bob Dylan: “To be creative you’ve got to be unsociable and tight-assed.”</p><p>When expressed in aphorisms like this, you almost get the impression that creativity simply requires that you sit down in a room of your own. In practice, however, what they are referring to as solitude is rather something like “a state of mind.” They are putting themselves in a state where the opinions of others do not bother them and where they reach a heightened sensitivity for the larval ideas and vague questions that arise within them.&nbsp;</p><p><span>To get a more visceral and nuanced understanding of this state, I’ve been reading the working notes of several highly creative individuals. These notes, written not for publication but as an aid in the process of discovery, are, in a way, partial windows into minds who inhabit the solitary creative space which the quotes above point to. In particular, I’ve found the notes of the mathematician&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck" rel="">Alexander Grothendieck</a><span>&nbsp;and the film director&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" rel="">Ingmar Bergman</a><span>&nbsp;revealing. They both kept detailed track of their thoughts as they attempted to reach out toward new ideas. Or rather, invited them in. In the notes, they also repeatedly turned their probing thoughts onto themselves, trying to uncover the process that brings the new into the world. </span></p><p>This essay is not a definite description of this creative state, which takes on many shapes; my aim is rather to give a portrait of a few approaches, to point out possibilities.</p><blockquote><p>It is as if there existed, for what seems like millennia, tracing back to the very origins of mathematics and of other arts and sciences, a sort of “conspiracy of silence” surrounding [the] “unspeakable labors” which precede the birth of each new idea, both big and small[.]</p><p><span>— Alexander Grothendieck,&nbsp;</span><em>Récoltes et Semailles</em></p></blockquote><p><span>In June 1983, Alexander Grothendieck sits down to write the preface to a mathematical manuscript called&nbsp;</span><em>Pursuing Stacks</em><span>. He is concerned by what he sees as a tacit disdain for the more “feminine side” of mathematics (which is related to what I’m calling the solitary creative state) in favor of the “hammer and chisel” of the finished theorem. By elevating the finished theorems, he feels that mathematics has been&nbsp;</span><em>flattened</em><span>: people only learn how to do the mechanical work of hammering out proofs, they do not know how to enter the dreamlike states where truly original mathematics arises. To counteract this, Grothendieck in the 1980s has decided to write in a new way, detailing how the “work is carried day after day [. . .] including all the mistakes and mess-ups, the frequent look-backs as well as the sudden leaps forward”, as well as “the early steps [. . .] while still on the lookout for [. . .] initial ideas and intuitions—the latter of which often prove to be elusive and escaping the meshes of language.”</span></p><p><span>This was how he had written&nbsp;</span><em>Pursuing Stacks,&nbsp;</em><span>the manuscript at hand, and it was the method he meant to employ in the preface as well. Except here he would be probing not a theorem but his psychology and the very nature of the creative act. He would sit with his mind, observing it as he wrote, until he had been able to put in words what he meant to say. It took him 29 months.</span></p><p><span>When the preface, known as&nbsp;</span><em>Récoltes et Semailles,&nbsp;</em><span>was finished, in October 1986, it numbered, in some accounts, more than 2000 pages. It is in an unnerving piece of writing, seething with pain, curling with insanity at the edges—Grothendieck is convinced that the mathematical community is morally degraded and intent on burying his work, and aligns himself with a series of saints (and the mathematician Riemann) whom he calls&nbsp;</span><em>les mutants</em><span>. One of his colleagues, who received a copy over mail, noticed that Grothendieck had written with such force that the letters at times punched holes through the pages. Despite this unhinged quality, or rather because of it,&nbsp;</span><em>Récoltes et Semailles</em><span>&nbsp;is a profound portrait of the creative act and the conditions that enable our ability to reach out toward the unknown.

This happened in his late teens. It was, he writes, this profound contact with himself which he established between 17 and 20 that later set him apart—he was not as strong a mathematician as his peers when he came to Paris at 20, in 1947. That wasn’t the key to his ability to do great work.</p><blockquote><p>I admired the facility with which [my fellow students] picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them from the cradle—while for myself I felt clumsy, even oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things that I had to learn (so I was assured), things I felt incapable of understanding[.]</p></blockquote><p><span>Grothendieck was, to be clear, a strong mathematician compared to most anyone, but these peers were the most talented young mathematicians in France, and unlike Grothendieck, who had spent the war in an internment camp at Rieucros, near Mende, they had been placed in the best schools and tutored. They were talented and well-trained. But the point is: being exceptionally talented and trained was, in the long run, not enough to do groundbreaking work because&nbsp;</span><em>they lacked the capacity to go beyond the context they had been raised in.</em></p><blockquote><p>In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more brilliant than I have gone on to become distinguished mathematicians. Still, from the perspective of 30 or 35 years, I can state that their imprint upon the mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve all done things, often beautiful things, in a context that was already set out before them, which they had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To have broken these bounds they would have had to rediscover in themselves that capability which was their birth-right, as it was mine: the capacity to be alone.</p></blockquote><p><em>The capacity to be alone.&nbsp;</em><span>This was what Grothendieck had developed. In the camp during the war, a fellow prisoner named Maria had taught him that a circle can be defined as all points that are equally far from a point. This clear abstraction attracted him immensely. After the war, having only a limited understanding of high school mathematics, Grothendieck ended up at the University of Montpellier, which was not an important center for mathematics. The teachers disappointed him, as did the textbooks: they couldn’t even provide a decent definition of what they meant when they said&nbsp;</span><em>length!</em><span>&nbsp;Instead of attending lectures, he spent the years from 17 to 20 catching up on high school mathematics and working out proper definitions of concepts like arc length and volume. Had he been in a good mathematical institution, he would have known that the problems he was working on had already been solved 30 years earlier. Being isolated from mentors he instead painstakingly reinvent parts of what is known as measurement theory and the Lebesgue integral.&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p>A few years after I finally established contact with the world of mathematics at Paris, I learned, among other things, that the work I’d done in my little niche [. . . had] been long known to the whole world [. . .]. In the eyes of my mentors, to whom I’d described this work, and even showed them the manuscript, I’d simply “wasted my time”, merely doing over again something that was “already known”. But I don't recall feeling any sense of disappointment. [. . .]</p></blockquote><p>The three years of solitary work at Montpellier had not been wasted in the least: that intellectual isolation was what had allowed him to access the cognitive space where new ideas arise. He had made himself at home there.</p><blockquote><p>Without recognizing it, I’d thereby familiarized myself with the conditions of solitude that are essential for the profession of mathematician, something that no-one can teach you. [. . .]</p><p><span>To state it in slightly different terms: in those critical years I learned how to&nbsp;</span><em>be alone.</em></p><p>[. . .] these three years of work in isolation, when I was thrown onto my own resources, following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously invented, instilled in me a strong degree of confidence, unassuming yet enduring, in my ability to do mathematics, which owes nothing to any consensus or to the fashions which pass as law....</p></blockquote><p><span>This experience is common in the childhoods of people who go on to do great work, as I have&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/childhoods" rel="">written elsewhere</a><span>. Nearly everyone who does great work has some episode of early solitary work. As the philosopher Bertrand Russell remarked, the development of gifted and creative individuals, such as Newton or Whitehead, seems to require a period in which there is little or no pressure for conformity, a time in which they can develop and pursue their interests no matter how unusual or bizarre. In so doing, there is often an element of reinventing the already known. Einstein reinvented parts of statistical physics. Pascal, self-teaching mathematics because his father did not approve, rederived several Euclidean proofs. There is also a lot of confusion and pursuit of dead ends. Newton looking for numerical patterns in the Bible, for instance. This might look wasteful if you think what they are doing is research. But it is not if you realize that they are building up their</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>ability to perceive the evolution of their own thought, their capacity for attention.</span></p><p><span>One thing that sets these intensely creative individuals apart, as far as I can tell, is that when sitting with their thoughts they are uncommonly willing to linger in confusion.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>To be curious about that which confuses. Not too rapidly seeking the safety of knowing or the safety of a legible question, but waiting for a more powerful and subtle question to arise from loose and open attention. This patience with confusion makes them good at surfacing&nbsp;</span><em>new questions.&nbsp;</em><span>It is this capacity to surface questions that set Grothendieck apart, more so than his capacity to answer them. When he writes that his peers were more brilliant than him, he is referring to their ability to&nbsp;</span><em>answer</em><span>&nbsp;questions</span></p><p><span>. It was just that their questions were unoriginal. As Paul Graham observes:</span></p><blockquote><p>People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who’d never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Grothendieck had a talent to notice (and admit!) that he was subtly bewildered and intrigued by things that for others seemed self-evident (what is length?) or already settled (the Lebesgue integral) or downright bizarre (as were many of his meditations on God and dreams). From this arose some truly astonishing questions, surfacing powerful ideas, such as topoi, schemas, and K-theory.</p><p><span>So far, we’ve talked about solitary work. But that has its limitations. If you want to do great work you have to interface with others—learn what they have figured out, find collaborators who can extend your vision, and other support. The trick is doing this without losing yourself. What solitude gives you is an opportunity to study&nbsp;</span><em>what personal curiosity feels like</em><span>&nbsp;in its undiluted form, free from the interference of other considerations. Being familiar with the character of this feeling makes it easier to recognize if you are reacting to the potential in the work you are doing in a genuinely personal way, or if you are giving in to  impulses that will raise your status in the group at the expense of the reach of your work.</span></p><p><span>After his three years of solitary work, Grothendieck did integrate into the world of mathematics. He learned the tools of the trade, he got up to date on the latest mathematical findings, he found mentors and collaborators—but he was doing that from&nbsp;</span><em>within</em><span>&nbsp;his framework. His peers, who had been raised within the system, had not developed this feel for themselves and so were more susceptible to the influence of others. Grothendieck knew what he found interesting and productively confusing because he had spent three years observing his thought and tracing where it wanted to go. He was not at the mercy of the social world he entered; rather, he “used” it to “further his aims.” (I put things in quotation marks here because what he’s doing isn’t exactly this deliberate.) He picked mentors that were aligned with his goals, and peers that unblock his particular genius.&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><span>I do not remember a single occasion when I was treated with condescension by one of these men, nor an occasion when my thirst for knowledge, and later, anew, my joy of discovery, was rejected by complacency or by disdain.&nbsp;</span><strong>Had it not been so, I would not have “become a mathematician” as they say—I would have chosen another profession, where I could give my whole strength without having to face scorn.&nbsp;</strong><span>[My emphasis.]</span></p></blockquote><p>He could interface with the mathematical community with integrity because he had a deep familiarity with his inner space. If he had not known the shape of his interests and aims, he would have been more vulnerable to the standards and norms of the community—at least he seems to think so.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png" width="1200" height="803.5714285714286" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:975,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Ingmar Bergman inspects the shark used in the production of Steven Spielberg’s </em><span>Jaws.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Yet. Even if you know what it feels like to be completely open to where your curiosity wants you to go, like Grothendieck, it is a fragile state. It often takes considerable work to keep the creative state from collapsing, especially as your work becomes successful and the social expectations mount. When I listen to interviews with creative people or read their workbooks, there are endless examples of them lamenting how hard it is. They keep coming up with techniques, rituals, and narratives to block off and protect the mental space they need.</p><p><span>This is evident in the workbooks that Ingmar Bergman kept from 1955 to 2001. Starting around the time he wrote&nbsp;</span><em>The Seventh Seal</em><span>, where a young Max von Sydow plays chess against Death, Bergman kept detailed notes of his thoughts, ending after he’d finished the script to his final film,&nbsp;</span><em>Saraband.</em><span>&nbsp;It is a very fluid and loose set of notes. There is no logic or structure. One second, Bergman will be writing about his frustrations with the work, and then without warning, the voice will subtly shift into something else—he’s drifting into a monologue. (Werner Herzog does the same in his diaries, making notes about his day and then abruptly veering off into narrative and feverish metaphors.) These fragments that unexpectedly ooze out of Bergman gradually coalesce into films.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png" width="1166" height="1600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:1166,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>One of Ingmar Bergman’s workbooks from 1966</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Bergman’s notebooks are filled with admonitions he gives himself, for example here, on March 18, 1960: “(I will write as I feel and as my people want. Not what outer reality demands.)” Or here, on July 16, 1955: “I must not be intimidated. It’s better to do this than a lousy comedy. The money I give no fuck about.” Being highly impressionable and introverted, he is crafting a defiant personality in the notebooks, a protective gear that allows his larval ideas to live, even those who seem too banal (“a man learns that he is dying and discovers that life is beautiful,” which turns into&nbsp;</span><em>Seventh Seal</em><span>).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Another introverted and impressionable writer is Karl Ove Knausgaard. In </span><a href="https://lithub.com/karl-ove-knausgaard-on-the-genius-of-ingmar-bergman/" rel="">a perceptive essay</a><span> about Bergman’s workbooks (an essay that is, I should point out, partly fabulated in a way that perhaps says more about how Knausgaard works than Bergman), Knausgaard makes a remark about the reminders Bergman writes himself (“I must not be intimidated” etc). These kinds of reminders are, Knausgaard claims, of little use because they “belong to thought and have no access to those cognitive spaces where the creative act takes place, but can only point to them.” To access these spaces, the thought “I will write as I feel and as my people want” is not enough. Rather, Knausgaard writes:</span></p><blockquote><p>In order to create something, Bergman had to go sub-Bergman, to the place in the mind where no name exists, where nothing is as yet nailed down, where one thing can morph into another, where boundlessness prevails. The workbook is this place—in it, Bergman could put anything he wanted, the entries he made there could be completely inane, cringingly talentless, heartrendingly commonplace, intensely transgressive, jaw-droppingly dull, and this was in part their purpose: they had to be free of censorship, in particular self-censorship, which sought to lay down constraints on a process that needed to be wholly unconstrained.</p></blockquote><p>There is a difference between knowing what you need to do (be independent and true to the potential in your ideas) and something else entirely to know how to embody that. Orienting in the right way to your thoughts is a skill. Like all skills, it takes practice. You also need to have a rich mental representation of how it is supposed to feel to embody the state so that you can orient toward that. This feeling is what you use to measure the relative success of whatever techniques you employ.</p><p>To slip more easily into the state, many develop strict habits around their work, rituals even. This is also what Bergman does.</p><p>The first few years, in the late 50s, the entries in his workbook are sparse. But as he pushes into the height of his creative career Bergman sets up a strict routine where he writes in the book for three hours every day, from 9 to 12 am, stopping mid-sentence at the strike of the clock. The book becomes the main technique he uses to induce the state where films and plays and books can be born. A non-judgemental zone. He writes that the workbook needs to be “so unpresumptuous and undemanding and is intended to sustain like the mellowest woman almost any number of my peculiarities.” </p><p>This is a fairly common practice, crafting a ritual where you sit down at the same time every day, in the same chair, writing in the same kind of notebook, creating a repetitiveness that borders on self-hypnosis. This is what Hemingway did, it is what Mario Vargas Llosa does.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some other techniques people use to access and maintain the zone:</p><ul><li><p><span>Introducing a long delay between when you do the work and when it is shown to the world. Annie Ernaux writes about this in&nbsp;</span><em>A Simple Passion,&nbsp;</em><span>a memoir about how she becomes obsessed in a banal way with a man who is having an affair with her—the thought that others will read these notes about the tacky sex life of a middle-aged woman feels, to her, almost fictional. She will be far away when it happens. Therefore, she doesn’t feel a need to protect herself.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p>Thinking of the work in religious terms, as a service to, or a search for, God. Bergman, Grothendieck, and Pascal all do this. It might be easier to summon the awe and daring necessary to push out into the unknown and against social pressure if the alternative is failing God. Or a fiendish muse.</p></li><li><p>Working with talented and open-minded collaborators, if you have the chance, can be a way to enter the zone. Nick Cave, when asked how he’s been able to reinvent himself so many times as a musician, says that his bandmates, especially Warren Ellis, simply will not play anything that sounds like what he’s done before. He has surrounded himself with people whose influence is the inverse of the social pressure of normal society and his audience.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><span>Another idea if you want to push against the mental pressure that kills good ideas, from Paul Graham’s recent essay on how to do good work: “One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for&nbsp;</span><em>someone else</em><span>&nbsp;to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to protect you.” I don’t know of anyone using this technique, but it might work.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Actively subvert expectations. Kristian Mattsson, who performs under the moniker Tallest Man on Earth, says he pays close attention to his emotions as he’s writing new songs. If he gets excited,&nbsp;</span><em>purely</em><span>, he immediately puts the guitar down—excitement means what he is playing something he knows others will like, something that retreads paths he has already explored and been socially validated for. The songs he’s looking for are the ones that he’s ashamed of liking.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Noticing these subtle differences in creative excitement requires subtle introspection. But you can be even more subtle. If we think of creative introspection as having three levels, Mattsson is on level two. (Level one is just noticing that you find an idea interesting or exciting.) Level two is noticing that your longing to be accepted can fool you to get excited about an idea that you are not actually excited about. Level three is Andrei Tarkovsky. In his diary, during preproduction of his masterpiece&nbsp;</span><em>Solaris</em><span>, the Soviet filmmaker writes that he has met a sound engineer that he considers brilliant. The sound engineer told Tarkovsky that they shouldn’t use Bach in the film because “everyone is using Bach in their films at the moment.” In the diary, Tarkovsky makes no further note, but in the film, the music is—Bach. Tarkovsky realized it didn’t matter that Bach was a popular choice that people would praise him for. It was just the right thing. This is very hard to do, so most creatives stay on level 2 and learn that what is popular is a trap. This does lead to good ideas being needlessly killed. But likely more would die if they had let what is popular kill unpopular ideas.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Work so fast that you don’t have time to self-censor. While writing the intensely confessional&nbsp;</span><em>My Struggle,&nbsp;</em><span>Knausgaard forced himself to write five pages a day to overcome his tendency to freeze up in shame. Every time he acclimated to the pace of his writing, he increased the quota so he would always be overwhelmed—at one point he forced himself to write 25,000 words in 24 hours, about a third of a normal-sized novel. It is not the best writing he has done; it kind of melts at the edges. But it is true literature and, like&nbsp;</span><em>Récoltes et Semailles&nbsp;</em><span>and Bergman’s workbooks, it is a rare opportunity to observe an uncommon and fertile mind in real-time.</span></p></li></ul><p>The mental states where new ideas can be born are hard to open up. And they are continually collapsing. The things you have to do to keep them from caving in will make people frown upon you—your tendency for isolation, working deep in the night, breaking norms. The zone is a place at the margin of society. But strangely enough, this fragile margin is where the ideas that make our society possible come from. Almost everything that makes up our world first appeared in a solitary head—the innovations, the tools, the images, the stories, the prophecies, and religions—it did not come from the center, it came from those who ran from it.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/good-ideas?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/good-ideas?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>If you’ve made it all the way down here and don’t feel like you’ve just wasted twenty minutes, consider giving the essay a like or sharing it with a friend.

On Wednesday, Grusch repeated some of those claims – although not all – under oath.</p><p>“I was informed, in the course of my official duties, of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program, to which I was denied access,” Grusch told the committee.</p><p>The hearing attracted intense global interest, and provided speculation and claims that the US is hiding evidence of alien life and technology – mixed with large doses of skepticism.</p><p>Grusch filed a whistleblower complaint in 2022. He said that in his role in the government he had been charged with investigating what military, defense and other agencies knew about aliens and alien craft, but alleged he had been prevented from accessing secret government UFO programs.</p><p>Speaking on Wednesday, Grusch said he has faced “very brutal” retaliation as a result of his allegations.</p><p>“It hurt me both professionally and personally,” Grusch said.</p><p>Under questioning, Grusch confirmed that he had knowledge of “people who have been harmed or injured” in the course of government efforts to conceal UFO information.</p><p>Asked by an oversight committee member if he had “feared for his life”, Grusch replied: “Yes definitely.”</p><p>Grusch added: “I am hopeful that my actions will ultimately lead to a positive outcome of increased transparency.”</p><p>Grusch’s allegation, aired in interviews with the Debrief and <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/we-are-not-alone-the-ufo-whistleblower-speaks/" data-link-name="in body link">NewsNation</a>, that the federal government was hiding this evidence of alien craft from Congress sparked a firestorm in June, prompting the Republican-led oversight committee to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/ufo-house-representatives-hearing-investigation" data-link-name="in body link"> launch an immediate investigation</a>.</p><p>Since then, the intrigue around what evidence the government has, or doesn’t have, around UFOs has only intensified.</p><p>Tim Burchett, a Republican congressman from Tennessee who is co-leading the UFO investigation, has claimed in recent weeks that the US had evidence of technology that “defies all of our laws of physics”, and that alien craft possess technology that could “turn us into a charcoal briquette”.</p><p>On Wednesday, however, Burchett sought to downplay, somewhat, what people would hear.</p><p>“We’re not bringing little green men or flying saucers into the hearing. Sorry to disappoint about half y’all. We’re just going to get to the facts,” Burchett said.</p><p>That announcement drew a chuckle, but Burchett became more serious as he accused government agencies of a lack of cooperation with the oversight committee investigation.</p><p>“It’s been so difficult to get here today. In the Baptist church we say that the devil is in our way, and the devil has been in our way for this thing. We’ve run into roadblocks from members, the intelligence community, [and] the Pentagon.</p><p>While there were no little green men in the hearing, Grusch did claim that the US has recovered alien beings.</p><p>After Grusch had reiterated his position that the government had possession of crashed extraterrestrial vehicles, he was asked if “we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft?”</p><p>“As I’ve stated publicly already in my NewsNation interview, biologics came with some of these recoveries,” Grusch said.</p><p>These biologics, Grusch said, were: “Non-human, and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to, that are currently still on the program.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-23" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="958eb75b-9e1e-4205-86f5-ec7e7f5269bc" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-1"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Tim Burchett, centre, who is co-leading the UFO investigation." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.152099609375" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Tim Burchett, centre, who is co-leading the UFO investigation.</span> Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>He said the government had probably had knowledge of “non-human” activity since the 1930s. At times, however, Grusch was less forthcoming under oath than he had been in media interviews.</p><p>In the interview with NewsNation in June, Grusch claimed the government had “very large, like a football-field kind of size” alien craft, while he told <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/sciences/david-grusch-lanceur-dalerte-sur-des-ovnis-ca-peut-etre-extraterrestre-ou-autre-chose-mais-pas-humain-07-06-2023-P73S2REKZJDGNGCEJQBDEIQJTU.php" data-link-name="in body link">Le Parisien</a>, a French newspaper, that the US had possession of a “bell-like craft” which Benito Mussolini’s government had recovered in northern Italy in 1933.</p><p>On Wednesday, Grusch seemed unwilling to go into details on those claims, citing issues of security. Grusch told the hearing he was prepared to elaborate in private, but his reticence prompted speculation from doubters.</p><p>Garrett Graff, a journalist and historian who is writing <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/UFO/Garrett-M-Graff/9781982196776" data-link-name="in body link">a book</a> on the government’s hunt for UFOs, tweeted: “Very interesting to me that Dave Grusch is unwilling to state and repeat under oath at the #UFOHearings the most explosive (and outlandish) of his claims from his NewsNation interview. He seems to be very carefully dancing around repeating them.”</p><p>The run-up to the hearing had been marked by accusations from Burchett and his co-investigator, Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican congresswoman from Florida, that they had been “stonewalled” by federal officials.</p><p>Yet after the hearing, Burchett, who has previously claimed alien craft possess technology that could “turn us into a charcoal briquette”, and alleged that the US has been hiding evidence of UFOs since 1947, seemed fairly satisfied.</p><p>Speaking to the Guardian, he said he had found Grusch’s claims about the recovery of “non-human” bodies to be credible.</p><p>“I don’t want to oversimplify it, but how are you going to fly one [spaceship]? You got to have somebody in it. That seems to be pretty simple,” Burchett said.</p><p>Asked what he had learned about alien craft in the course of his investigation, Burchett said: “I believe they exist. I knew that before I came in here. I didn’t learn a lot because I knew the answers already, but I was glad they put it in the record.”</p><p>The Pentagon has denied Grusch’s claims of a cover-up. In a statement, a defense department spokeswoman, Sue Gough, said investigators had not discovered “any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently”.</p><p>Other witnesses at the hearing were David Fravor, a former navy commander who on Wednesday recalled seeing a strange object in the sky while on a training mission in 2004, and Ryan Graves, a retired navy pilot who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNsxtNUeFB4" data-link-name="in body link">has claimed</a> that he saw unidentified aerial phenomena off the Atlantic coast “every day for at least a couple years”.</p><p>Graves, who has since founded Americans for Safe Aerospace, a UAP non-profit, said he was appearing “to voice the concerns of more than 30 commercial aircrews and military veterans who have confided their similar encounters with me”.</p><p>Asked if there were similarities between his sightings and others that have been reported, he said many of the UFOs reported were “dark grey or black cubes inside of clear sphere” where “the apex or tips of the cube were touching the inside of the sphere”.</p><p>For all the excitement and inevitable media speculation, some had cautioned against reading too much into what we might hear.</p><p>Grusch has not seen the alleged alien craft himself – he says his claims are based on “extensive interviews with high-level intelligence officials” – and skeptics have noted that accusations that the government is hiding information on UFOs are nothing new.</p><p>“The story aligns with a lot of similar stories that have played out, going back to the 1980s and 1970s, that together allege that the US government has kept an incredible secret, the literal most extraordinary secret that mankind could have, for not just weeks or months, but years and decades, with no meaningful leak or documentary evidence to ever come forward,” Graff previously told the Guardian.</p><p>“I think when you look at the government’s ability to keep secret other really important secrets, there’s a lot of reason to doubt the capability of the government to do that.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>People want to get along. </p><p>Few people, if they are shown some respect, will figure out a way to make peace with their coworkers. As the leader of a team wanting to create a toxic culture and have it still be going when you return from prison, you need to create a team that never reaches this peace.</p><p><strong>Foster a culture of inconsistent goals</strong></p><p>The definition of quality work should not be consistent and well-understood. Imagine that you are a working at a restaurant making soup, and a head chef decides if your soup is good enough everyday and you only get paid if it is. You make the soup the same everyday, but some days it isn't good enough. You start to imagine reasons - maybe the chef doesn't like you, maybe someone is messing with your ingredients, maybe you don’t know what you are doing, maybe you have angered the soup God - the stress of this situation given the stakes will create a paranoid and uncollaborative workforce.</p><p><span>This is your goal - create a culture in which only your approval is a measure of good or bad. Make this approval infrequent and inconsistent. As soon as the soupmaker starts to feel empowered, spit out his soup. Occassionly say things like “this soup is OK, but Barbara doesn’t like it”. Extra points if there is no coworker named Barbara. This single action will kill any hopes of a team with ownership - after all, if it isn't good enough often enough they will never feel like it is </span><em>their soup</em><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Discourage creativity</strong></p><p>If something goes wrong, start an investigation. Figure out who to blame and do it publically. Raise your voice, send nasty emails, mean-mug without delay. Anytime there is a failure, don't miss an opportunity to assert your authority. Attach ideas to specific people, not to the team. The team may come up with an idea, but failure falls to one person.</p><p>This will prevent the team from trying new things and keep making soup while hoping for the best. Eventually, they will also get better at investigations than making food.</p><p><strong>Go away, then return with chaos</strong></p><p>If you lead the team, don't show up. Don't tell anybody. In general be very hard to reach. Move or cancel meetings, then show up late to the ones you do attend. Don’t let meetings start without you, then change the subject ten minutes after you arrive. Make it so that people simply do not know what you are about to say, then surprise them.</p><p><strong>Prepare the team for their next leader</strong></p><p>If you do these steps, the next leader will be easy to find - he or she can only be found from outside the team. Nobody left on the team can be head chef, they only know how to fearfully make crappy soup and run internal investigations. Congratulations - you have properly prepared the team for their next leader.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/apple-app-store-wechat-china">https://reclaimthenet.org/apple-app-store-wechat-china</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36882467">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="72631a75" data-element_type="section" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default" data-settings="{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}">
			
<p>Apple is notoriously strict with iPhones. You may own the phone, but it’s Apple that gets to decide what apps you’re allowed to run on it.</p>
<p>If Apple decides an app isn’t allowed in the App Store, you’re not allowed to use it.</p>
<p>While many app developers have spent months or even years working on apps for iPhones, only to find that <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/apple-bans-pewdiepies-new-game-poopdie-from-the-app-store/">Apple rejects their app</a> and <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/shadow-banned-from-app-store/">refuses their access to the market</a> – Apple seems to be making exceptions for China’s WeChat app.</p>
<p>Why would notoriously-draconian Apple allow China’s most popular app to skirt the rules?</p>
<p>WeChat is so popular that Chinese citizens beg to be allowed back on the platform <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/wechat-users-banned-coronavirus/">when they get banned for criticizing the Chinese government</a>, or when they <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/wechat-coronavirus-censorship/">try to warn people about certain viral outbreaks</a>, or when they <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/wechat-is-censoring-us-citizens-hong-kong/">support Hong Kong.</a></p>
<p>Ironically, Apple, which helped the mobile app gain popularity, is now being seriously threatened by the app’s popularity.</p>
<p>WeChat is developed by Chinese state-backed Tencent and combines the functionality of messaging, social media, and e-payments.</p>
<p>Due to these functionalities, WeChat has become the most important application for many Chinese smartphone users. WeChat became widely popular especially when its iPhone app was launched several years ago.</p>
<p>In itself, WeChat is a stand-alone app. But it is also capable of running mini-programs within the app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat.png" alt="" width="1513" height="1040" srcset="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat.png 1513w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat-300x206.png 300w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat-1024x704.png 1024w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat-768x528.png 768w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat-360x247.png 360w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat-545x375.png 545w" sizes="(max-width: 1513px) 100vw, 1513px"></p>
<p>But here’s the rub, for Apple:</p>
<p>Since these are “apps within an app”, many of these mini-programs are flouting the App Store rules since they were not downloaded from the App Store.</p>
<p>Some representatives of Tencent hoodwinked Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2017 that these “mini-programs” are not apps so Apple doesn’t have to worry about them being used on WeChat.</p>
<p>But these mini-programs have evolved through time. Whereas before, these “mini-programs” didn’t compete with full-blown apps, now they do.</p>
<p>Some of these mini-programs are even capable of live video streaming, augmented reality and other advanced functionality.</p>
<p>Shanghai-based app developer Sinia Spasojevic told <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-tencents-wechat-poses-creeping-threat-to-apple">The Information</a> that WeChat is breaking App Store rules through the propagation of these mini-programs.</p>
<p>We already know Apple is willing to take drastic action <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/facebook-research-app-scandal/">against the US’s own Facebook for breaking the rules</a>, so why not China’s WeChat?</p>
<p>WeChat and its mini-programs are starting to become so important to Chinese users that most are starting to put more importance on the capability of a smartphone to run WeChat regardless of whether its an iPhone or Android.</p>
<p>Today, there are more than 2.4 million mini-programs that can be run within WeChat. If this trend continues, there will come a time when developers will concentrate on developing new useful mini-programs to run on WeChat instead of stand-alone apps which have to abide by certain rules before it becomes available on the App Store.</p>
<p>If Apple cracks down on WeChat’s practices, Chinese customers will have little reason to ever buy an iPhone.</p>
<p>So, if Apple wants the Chinese to continue to buy iPhones, they have to let WeChat – one of the most privacy-invasive and censorship driven apps on the planet, continue to ignore its App Store rules.</p>
<p>And with <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/apple-rejects-freedom-of-expression/">Apple’s shareholders not in agreement</a> to actually put their money where their mouth is when it comes to human rights, it’s not likely Apple is going to go against China anytime soon.</p>
