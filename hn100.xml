<p dir="auto">Contour is best installed from supported package managers, but you can build
from source by following the instruction below. You can Qt 5 or Qt 6,
by default contour will be compiler with Qt 6, to change Qt version use <code>QTVER=5 ./scripts/install-deps.sh</code> to fetch dependencies and cmake flag <code>-D CONTOUR_QT_VERSION=5</code>.</p>

  Architects look at thousands of buildings during their
  training, and study critiques of those buildings written
  by masters.  In contrast, most software developers only
  ever get to know a handful of large programs
  well—usually programs they wrote
  themselves—and never study the great programs of
  history.  As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes
  rather than building on one another's successes.
</p>
      
<p>
  Our goal is to change that.  In these two books, the authors of
  four dozen open source applications explain how their software
  is structured, and why.  What are each program's major
  components?  How do they interact?  And what did their builders
  learn during their development?  In answering these questions,
  the contributors to these books provide unique insights into how
  they think.
</p>
      
<p>
  If you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your
  more experienced colleagues think, these books are the place
  to start.  If you are an intermediate or senior developer,
  and want to see how your peers have solved hard design
  problems, these books can help you too.

        <p>What’s as fast as two Raspberry Pi 4s? <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-raspberry-pi-5/" target="_blank">The brand-new Raspberry Pi 5</a>, that’s what. And for only a $5 upcharge (with an asterisk), it’s going to the new go-to board from the British House of Fruity Single-Board Computers. But aside from the brute speed, it also has a number of cool features that will make using the board easier for a number of projects, and it’s going to be on sale in October. Raspberry Pi sent us one for review, and if you were just about to pick up a Pi 4 for a project that needs the speed, we’d say that you might wait a couple weeks until the Raspberry Pi 5 goes on sale.</p>
<h2 id="twice-as-nice">Twice as Nice</h2>
<p>On essentially every benchmark, the Raspberry Pi 5 comes in two to three times faster than the Pi 4. This is thanks to the new Broadcom BCM2712 system-on-chip (SOC) that runs four ARM A76s at 2.4 GHz instead of the Pi 4’s ARM A72s at 1.8 GHz. This gives the CPUs a roughly 2x – 3x advantage over the Pi 4. (Although the Pi 4 was <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/11/11/adventures-in-overclocking-which-raspberry-pi-4-flavor-is-fastest/">eminently overclockable</a> in the CM4 package.)<a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail.png" target="_blank"><img data-attachment-id="623884" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2023/09/28/a-raspberry-pi-5-is-better-than-two-pi-4s/ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail.png" data-orig-size="1200,1200" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail.png?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail.png?w=625" decoding="async" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail.png?w=400" alt="" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail.png 1200w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail.png?resize=250,250 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail.png?resize=400,400 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ch01-raspberrypi5-soc_thumbnail.png?resize=625,625 625w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p>
<p>The DRAM runs at double the clock speed. The video core is more efficient and pushes pixels about twice as fast. The new WiFi controller in the SOC allows about twice as much throughput to the same radio. Even the SD card interface is capable of running twice as fast, speeding up boot times to easily under 10 sec – maybe closer to 8 sec, but who’s counting?</p>
<p>Heck, while we’re on factors of two, there are now two MIPI camera/display lines, so you can do stereo imaging straight off the board, or run a camera and external display simultaneously. And it’s capable of driving <em>two</em> 4k HDMI displays at 60 Hz.</p>
<p>There are only two exceptions to the overall factor-of-two improvements. First, the Gigabyte Ethernet remains Gigabyte Ethernet, so that’s a one-ex. (We’re not sure who is running up against that constraint, but if it’s you, you’ll want an external network adapter.) But second, the new Broadcom SOC finally supports the ARM cryptography extensions, which make it 45x faster at AES, for instance. With TLS almost everywhere, this keeps crypto performance from becoming the bottleneck. Nice.</p>
<p>All in all, most everything performance-related has been doubled or halved appropriately, and completely in line with <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/testing-pcie-on-raspberry-pi-5" target="_blank">the only formal benchmarks we’ve seen so far</a>, it <em>feels</em> about twice as fast all around in our informal tests. Compared with a Pi 400 that I use frequently in the basement workshop, the Pi 5 is a lot snappier.</p>

<h2 id="more-powah">More Powah!</h2>
<p>Nothing comes for free. While the Raspberry Pi 5 is more efficient for the same workload than the Pi 4, you can push it still harder. And when you do, it draws a peak 12 W versus the Pi 4’s peak 8 W. And this is where we get to that price asterisk we mentioned in the opening. You might need to fork out for more power coming into the board, and figure out how to handle the heat coming off of it, if you’re computering hard.</p>

The Raspberry Pi 5 has an all-new power subsystem, featuring the DA9091 power-management IC, generating eight separate voltages and capable of supplying 20 A to the BCM2712 SoC. Apparently, this chip was co-developed between Raspberry Pi and Renesas, and it includes a real-time clock unit just because they could squeeze it in. It also supports <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/01/09/all-about-usb-c-power-delivery/">USB-C Power Delivery</a>, so finding a power supply that’s capable of supplying all that juice to the Pi 5 is a lot easier, something that has been a pain point in the past. Will we never see a brownout warning again? We can dream.</p>
<p>The star of the new power management system, hands-down, is the power button. How many <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/04/04/a-power-button-for-raspberry-pi-courtesy-of-device-tree-overlays/">power button hacks</a> have we seen over the years? We’re happy to bid them adieu.</p>
<p>Now the bad news, in the immortal words of Stan Lee: with great power comes great cooling requirements. The Pi 5 runs hot enough that you might require a heatsink, or even an active cooling solution with a fan. Raspberry Pi shipped us an active cooling package to test out, and it plugs into a fan header on the board, so you know they mean business.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi has also re-worked their case for the Pi 5, adding a fan with a removable cover, and vents on the underside. And they haven’t forgotten the power button here either – a small piece of acrylic serves as both a button cap and a power status light. Nice.</p>
<h2 id="pcie-for-real-this-time">PCIe, For Real This Time</h2>
<p>The most exciting new feature for people who wish to use the Pi 5 on the desktop is probably the official support for a real PCIe lane. When the Pi 4 came out, it was discovered that it spoke PCIe between the USB controller and the SOC, and of course <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/07/01/adding-pcie-to-your-raspberry-pi-4-the-easier-way/">intercepting those lines was one of the first hacks</a> that we saw on the then-new Pi 4. Then came the CM4, which forced you to design your own board anyway, so you could choose between USB and PCIe. With the Pi 5, you don’t have to choose, and you won’t have to hack on it either.</p>

A single PCIe 2.0 lane is broken out to a flat-flex connector, and from there you’ll need an adapter board to connect it up to whichever peripherals you’ve got in mind. Adapters will doubtless come on the market soon, but if you just can’t wait, we’ve got a <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/03/14/pcie-for-hackers-the-diffpair-prelude/">tutorial series on making your own PCIe devices</a> to help.</p>
<p>Once you get the connections sorted out, you might also try pushing it up to PCIe 3.0 speeds. [Jeff Geerling] got a preview hardware adapter from Raspberry Pi, and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/testing-pcie-on-raspberry-pi-5" target="_blank">found that although it’s not certified for PCIe 3.0, it works most of the time at those speeds</a>. With an NVMe hard drive attached, he found that he could get 450 MB/sec using the sanctioned PCIe 2.0, and almost 900 MB/sec by changing a line in <code>/boot/config.txt</code>, enabling the unsupported PCIe 3.0 mode, and crossing his fingers. That was easy.</p>
<h2 id="under-the-hood-the-rp1-custom-controller">Under the Hood: The RP1 Custom Controller</h2>
<p>Power supply tweaks, including the power button, are down to Raspberry Pi’s cooperation with Renesas. More computational grunt comes from Broadcom’s new SOC. But features like the dual MIPI connectors or the dual USB 3.0 <em>and</em> USB 2.0 ports with enough bandwidth that they don’t crowd out each other or any of the other peripherals, are all due to Raspberry Pi’s in-house innovation here: the custom RP1 interface / southbridge chip.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 uses PCIe for the backbone between the SOC and their RP1 chip. Four lanes of PCIe, to be exact, providing a 16 Gb/s link between the body and the brains. This is interesting because most chiplet designs are entirely proprietary, and both chips need to speak a common secret language. Here, Raspberry Pi and Broadcom can collaborate, but almost at arm’s length, because there’s nothing proprietary about PCIe. And because they had a spare PCIe channel on the SOC, they were able to break it out for the end user.</p>
<p>Desoldering the RP1 and doing without all the peripherals it provides, patching the kernel appropriately, and turning the Pi 5 into an all-PCIe, five-channel monstrosity is left as an exercise to the motivated reader.</p>

The old audio output jack has been removed entirely, so you’re probably going to have to rely on HDMI audio out or a HAT if you want hi-fi audio. Other connections include PoE on a four-pin header, an ARM debug / UART on a three pin header, and a JST battery connector to keep the real-time clock module ticking.</p>
<p>Since you might want a heatsink, with fan or without, they’ve added mounting holes spaced around the processor. For space reasons, the MIPI camera/display flat-flex connectors use the thinner form factor that we’ve seen on the Pi Zero, rather than the wider one on the Pi 4.</p>
<h2 id="raspberry-pi-evolution">Raspberry Pi Evolution</h2>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 is, in some ways, a modest step forward. A two-times speedup isn’t anything to sneeze at, and the various quality-of-life improvements scattered throughout are great, but none of this is revolutionary when you look at the state of play in the SBC market. Still, the Pi 5 is at least twice as nice as the Pi 4, and at only a small upcharge. If you think back six months ago, where people were paying absurd markups for Pi 4s, the Raspberry Pi 5 is positively a bargain. And while there are faster Linux SBCs on the market these days, they also cost a lot more, so the value proposition of the Pi 5 is still solid. Add in Raspberry Pi’s documentation and software support, and there’s a lot here to like.</p>
<p>They’re not available in stores just yet, but Raspberry Pi plans to have “just under a million” Pi 5s produced and in stores over the course of the rest of 2023, so they’re not going to be scarce — we hope! If you need the speed, and can handle the heat, there’s no reason not to get a Raspberry Pi 5.</p>

<p>Debian is a large, complex operating system, and a huge open source project. It’s thirty years old now. To many people, some of its aspects are weird. Most such things have a good reason, but it can be hard to find out what it is. This is an attempt to answer some such questions, without being a detailed history of the project.</p>
<h2 id="what-debian-wants-to-be"><a name="index1h1"></a>What Debian wants to be</h2>
<p>Debian wants to be a high-quality, secure general purpose operating system that consists only of free and open source software that runs on most kinds of computers that are in active use in the world.</p>
<p>By general purpose I mean Debian should be suitable for most people for most purposes. There will always be situations where it’s not suitable, for whatever reason, but it’s a good goal to aim for. Some other distributions aim for specific purposes: a desktop, a server, playing games, doing scientific research, etc. It’s fine to aim to be general purpose, or specific purpose, but the choice of goal leads to different decisions along the way.</p>
<p>For Debian, aiming to be general purpose means that Debian doesn’t choose what to package based on the purpose of the software. The only real choice Debian makes here is on whether the software is free and whether it’s plausible for Debian to maintain a high quality package.</p>
<h2 id="the-constitution-power-structure-governance"><a name="index2h1"></a>The constitution, power structure, governance</h2>
<p>Debian is one of the more explicitly democratic open source organizations. It has well-defined processes for making decisions, and elects a project leader every year. Further, the powers of the project leader are strictly constrained, and most powers usually associated with leadership are explicitly delegated to other people.</p>
<p>The historic background for this is that the first Debian project leaders were implicitly all-powerful dictators until they chose to step down. Then one project leader went too far, and a revolt threw them out, and democracy was introduced. As part of this, the project got a formal <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution">constitution</a>, which defines rules for the project.</p>
<p>The reason Debian has the rules it has, is because less rules, and less bureaucracy, didn’t work for Debian earlier in its history.</p>
<h2 id="social-contract-and-debian-free-software-guidelines"><a name="index3h1"></a>Social contract and Debian free software guidelines</h2>
<p>In the mid-1990s, before the term open source had been introduced, what was “free software” was defined by the Free Software Foundation, but in a way that left much to be interpreted. Debian wanted to have clearer rules, and came up with the Debian Free Software Guidelines, and made them part of its <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract">Social Contract</a>.</p>
<p>The social contract is Debian’s promise to itself and to the world at large about what Debian is and does. The DFSG is part of that. This is a foundation document for Debian, and changing it is intentionally made difficult in the Debian constitution.</p>
<p>The more detailed rules have made it clearer what Debian will accept, and have simplified discussions about this. There is still a lot to discuss, of course.</p>
<p>The DFSG was later the basis of the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd/">Open Source Definition</a>.</p>
<h2 id="self-contained"><a name="index4h1"></a>Self-contained</h2>
<p>Debian insists on being self-contained. Anything that is packaged in Debian, by Debian, must be built (compiled) using only dependencies in Debian. Also, everything in Debian must be built by Debian. This can cause a lot of extra work. For example, current programming language tooling often assumes it can download dependencies from online repositories at build time, and that is not acceptable to Debian.</p>
<p>The main reason for this is that a dependency might not be available later. Debian has no control over third party package repositories, and if a package, or entire repository, goes away, it might be impossible for Debian to rebuild the package. Debian needs to rebuild to upgrade to a new compiler, to fix a security problem, to port to a new architecture, or just to make some change to the packaged software, including bug fixes.</p>
<p>If Debian weren’t self-contained, it would be at the mercy of any of the tens of thousands of packages it has, and all their dependencies, being available when an urgent security fix needs to be released. This is not acceptable to Debian, and so Debian chooses to do the work of packaging all dependencies.</p>
<p>That means, of course, that for Debian to package something can be a lot of work.</p>
<h2 id="no-bundled-libraries"><a name="index5h1"></a>No bundled libraries</h2>
<p>Debian avoids using copies of libraries, or other dependencies, that are bundled with the software it packages. Many upstream projects find it easier to bundle or “vendor” dependencies, but for Debian, this means that there can be many copies of some popular libraries. When there is a need to fix a security or other severe problem in such a library, Debian would have to find all copies to fix them. This can be a lot of work, and if the security problem is urgent, it wastes valuable time to have to do that.</p>
<p>As an example: the zlib is used by a very large number of projects. By its nature, it needs to process data that may be constructed to exploit a vulnerability in the library. This has happened. At one point, Debian found dozens of bundled copies of zlib in its archive, and spent considerable effort making sure only the packaged version of zlib is used by packages in Debian.</p>
<p>Thus, Debian chooses to do the work up front, before it’s urgent, while packaging the software, and make sure the package in Debian uses the version of the library packaged in Debian.</p>
<p>This is not always appreciated by upstream developers, who would prefer to only have to deal with the version of the library they bundle. That’s the version they’ve verified their own software with. This sometimes leads to friction with Debian.</p>
<h2 id="membership-process"><a name="index6h1"></a>Membership process</h2>
<p>Given the size and complexity of Debian as an operating system, and its popularity, the project needs to trust its members. This especially means trusting those who upload new packages. Because of technical limitations in Linux in the 1990s, every Debian package has full root access during its installation. In other words, every Debian developer can potentially become the root user on any machine running Debian. With tens of millions of machines running Debian, that is potentially a lot of power.</p>
<p>Debian vets its new members in various ways. Ideally, every new member has been part of the Debian development community sufficiently long that they are known to others, and they’ve built trust within the community.</p>
<p>The process can be quite frustrating to those wanting to join Debian, especially to someone used to a smaller open source project.</p>
<h2 id="release-code-names"><a name="index7h1"></a>Release code names</h2>
<p>Debian assigns a code name for its each major release. This was originally done to make mirroring the Debian package archive less costly.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, when Debian was getting close to making its 1.0 release, code names weren’t used. Instead, the archive had a directory for each release, named after its version. Developing a new release takes a while, so the directory “1.0” was created well ahead of time. Unfortunately, a publisher of CD-ROMs, prematurely mass-produced a disc they labeled 1.0, before Debian had actually finished making 1.0. This meant that people who got the Debian 1.0 CD-ROM got something that wasn’t actually 1.0.</p>
<p>An obvious solution to prevent this from happening again would have been to prepare the release in a directory called “1.0-not-released”, and rename the directory to “1.0” after the release was finished. However, this would’ve meant that all the mirrors would’ve had to re-download the release when the name of the directory changed. That would’ve been costly, given the massive size of Debian (hundreds of packages! tens of megabytes!). Thus, Debian chose to use code names instead.</p>
<p>Later, the “pool” structure was added to the Debian archive. With this, the files for all releases are in the same directory tree, and metadata files specify what files belong to each release. This makes mirroring easier. It might be possible to drop the code names and stick to versions, now, but I don’t know if Debian would be interested in that.</p>
<h2 id="changing-slowly"><a name="index8h1"></a>Changing slowly</h2>
<p>As implied above, Debian is huge. It’s massive. It’s enormous, It’s really not very small at all, any more.</p>
<p>Large ships stop slowly. Large projects change slowly. Any change in Debian that affects large portion of its packages may require hundreds of volunteers to do work. That is not going to happen quickly.</p>
<p>Sometimes the work can be done with just a small number of people, and Debian has processes to enable that. As an example, if a new version of the GNU C compiler is uploaded, the work of finding out what fixes in other packages need to be made can usually be done by a handful of people.</p>
<p>Often a change takes time because there’s a need to build consensus, and that requires extensive discussion, which takes time and can only rarely be short-circuited.</p>
<p>This all also means Debian developers tend to be conservative in technical decisions. They often prefer solutions that don’t require large scale changes.</p>

<p dir="auto">Fury is a blazing fast multi-language serialization framework powered by <strong>jit(just-in-time compilation)</strong> and <strong>zero-copy</strong>, providing up to 170x performance and ultimate ease of use.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://furyio.org/" rel="nofollow">https://furyio.org</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-features" dir="auto"><a href="#features">Features</a></h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Multiple languages</strong>: Java/Python/C++/Golang/Javascript.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-copy</strong>: cross-language out-of-band serialization inspired
by <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0574/" rel="nofollow">pickle5</a> and off-heap read/write.</li>
<li><strong>High performance</strong>: A highly-extensible JIT framework to generate serializer code at runtime in an async multi-thread way to speed serialization, providing 20-170x speed up by:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>reduce memory access by inline variable in generated code.</li>
<li>reduce virtual method invocation by inline call in generated code.</li>
<li>reduce conditional branching.</li>
<li>reduce hash lookup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Multiple binary protocols</strong>: object graph, row format and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In addition to cross-language serialization, Fury also features at:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Drop-in replace Java serialization frameworks such as JDK/Kryo/Hessian without modifying any code, but 100x faster.
It can greatly improve the efficiency of high-performance RPC calls, data transfer and object persistence.</li>
<li>JDK serialization <strong>100% compatible</strong>: JDK <code>writeObject/readObject/writeReplace/readResolve/readObjectNoData/Externalizable</code> serialization API supported, <strong>JDK8~21</strong> supported.</li>
<li>Supports shared and circular reference object serialization for golang.</li>
<li>Supports automatic object serialization for golang.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-protocols" dir="auto"><a href="#protocols">Protocols</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Different scenarios have different serialization requirements. Fury designed and implemented
multiple binary protocols for those requirements:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Cross-language object graph protocol</strong>:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Cross-language serialize any object automatically, no need for IDL definition, schema compilation and object to/from protocol
conversion.</li>
<li>Support shared reference and circular reference, no duplicate data or recursion error.</li>
<li>Support object polymorphism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Native java/python object graph protocol</strong>: highly-optimized based on type system of the language.</li>
<li><strong>Row format protocol</strong>: a cache-friendly binary random access format, supports skipping serialization and partial serialization,
and can convert to column-format automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">New protocols can be added easily based on fury existing buffer, encoding, meta, codegen and other capabilities. All of those share same codebase, and the optimization for one protocol
can be reused by another protocol.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-benchmarks" dir="auto"><a href="#benchmarks">Benchmarks</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Different serialization frameworks are suitable for different scenarios, and benchmark results here are for reference only.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you need to benchmark for your specific scenario, make sure all serialization frameworks are appropriately configured for that scenario.</p>
<p dir="auto">Dynamic serialization frameworks support polymorphism and references, but they often come with a higher cost compared to static serialization frameworks, unless they utilize JIT techniques like Fury does.
Because Fury generates code at runtime, it is recommended to <strong>warm up</strong> the system before collecting benchmark statistics.</p>

<p dir="auto">Title containing "compatible" represent schema compatible mode: support type forward/backward compatibility.</p>

<p dir="auto">Fury java object graph serialization support class schema forward/backward compatibility. The serialization peer and deserialization peer can add/delete fields independently.</p>
<p dir="auto">We plan to add support cross-language serialization after <a href="https://github.com/alipay/fury/issues/203" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/alipay/fury/issues/203/hovercard">meta compression</a> are finished.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-binary-compatibility" dir="auto"><a href="#binary-compatibility">Binary Compatibility</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">We are still improving our protocols, binary compatibility are not ensured between fury major releases for now.
it's ensured between minor version only. Please
<code>versioning</code> your data by fury major version if you will upgrade fury in the future, see <a href="https://github.com/alipay/fury/blob/main/docs/guide/java_object_graph_guide.md#upgrade-fury">how to upgrade fury</a> for further details.</p>
<p dir="auto">Binary compatibility will be ensured before fury 1.0.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-security" dir="auto"><a href="#security">Security</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Static serialization are secure. But dynamic serialization such as fury java/python native serialization supports deserialize unregistered types, which provides more dynamics and flexibility, but also introduce security risks.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, the deserialization may invoke <code>init</code> constructor or <code>equals</code>/<code>hashCode</code> method, if the method body contains malicious code, the system will be at risks.</p>
<p dir="auto">Fury provides a class registration option and enabled by default for such protocols, which allows only deserializing trusted registered types or built-in types.
<strong>Do not disable class registration unless you can ensure your environment is secure</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If this option is disabled, you are responsible for serialization security. You can configure <code>io.fury.resolver.ClassChecker</code> by
<code>ClassResolver#setClassChecker</code> to control which classes are allowed for serialization.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1824441.html">https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1824441.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37808115">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Canonical link: <a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1824441.html">https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1824441.html</a> </i></p><p>Another post that <a href="https://universeodon.com/@siderea/111122855587210647">started as a rant on Mastodon</a>.  This has been adapted and expanded further.</p><hr><p>It is incredibly frustrating that the only thing more stupid than Patreon is all the alleged Patreon substitutes that clearly don't even understand what Patreon does.</p><p>Pro tip: Patreon has no meaningful competitors, and also it sucks, so there's a huge opportunity for somebody to kick sand in its face and take its lunch money. But to do that you would have to understand what actually Patreon does that is worth it to creators to allow Patreon to take 5% of their proceeds (and then pass on to them a second 5% in payment processing fees).</p><p>Because I want there to be Patreon competitors, I will explain what Patreon actually does, so if somebody would like to actually compete with Patreon they will know what they have to actually accomplish.</p><p><a name="cutid1"></a>Brace yourself. Some of this is a little complicated to explain.</p><p>And before explaining it, allow me to observe: these are the sorts of features you get when somebody who actually really understands the usage case designs the platform. Patreon was founded by and designed by an actual goddamn artist – a musician and music video maker – who understood what artists and other creators actually need out of a platform.</p><p><b>1) Pseudonym support.</b></p><p>Attention dumbasses: stage names and pen names have been realities of the business of being an artist for over 2,000 years.</p><p>Creators are not shoe salesmen.</p><p>The most basic functionality of any platform that intends to support <em>creators</em> earning money online – the basic, rock-bottom, sine qua non affordance – is people doing business using pseudonyms.</p><p>What that <strong>actually</strong> means is the platform has to allow creators (the people who charge money) to be <strong>pseudonymous</strong> (to use their stage name or pen names) in all of their interactions with their patrons (the people paying the money), <strong>and</strong> the platform, which is legally required to know the legal identity of the creator and have on file their relevant tax ID numbers (e.g. SSN in the US), needs to keep that legal identity <strong>confidential</strong>.</p><p>Relatedly, it is not enough for your creator patronization platform to <em>have</em> fully supported pseudonyms. You must make that abundantly specific and clear, and a commitment that you make to your creators, <strong>up front</strong>. Ideally, it's part of your elevator pitch to perspective creators.</p><p>Patreon falls short of the standard but comes closer than any other payment accepting platform – as far as I know <em>at all</em>, of <em>any</em> type.</p><p>If you want to pull business away from Patreon, you will not do it if your platform, like umpteen zillion other idiot platforms, assumes that the creator is going to use their wallet name, and does not treat that wallet name as confidential information.</p><p>Listen, if all we wanted was a subscription platform that exposed our wallet names, we could have been using PayPal subscriptions all this time. What would we need you for?</p><p>Speaking of subscriptions....</p><p><b>2) By-works funding model support.</b></p><p>Patreon had two foundational funding models it supported, and while Patreon has introduced a variety of complexities and alternatives, these remain its core offerings.</p><p>One of these is trivial: monthly subscriptions. Like I said, creators can get that from PayPal if they don't care about pseudonyms. Every supposed Patreon substitute is just a monthly subscription service.</p><p>But Patreon's much more interesting funding model is not by-month, it's by-work.</p><p>This is where things get very hard for outsiders to understand. For emotional reasons.</p><p>People have trouble believing that this is actually so, but it is. This is the funding model I use.</p><p>The by-work funding model is where patrons pledge their support not by the month, but by the instance of whatever it is that the creator makes. If the creator makes stories, it's per story; if the creator makes music videos, it's per music video. The patrons pledge a certain amount of money for each work the creator makes.</p><p>If you're thinking, "but how many works does a creator ship each month?": no, that's the whole point of by-works. It can be <strong>any</strong> number. The creator makes no particular commitment to their patrons as to how many creations they're going to ship. They may ship <strong>no</strong> creations in a month, so in that month their patrons are charged nothing. Or they may ship one thing. Or 10 things. Or a 100 things.</p><p>(My best month was 10 things.)</p><p>You might reasonably be thinking, "Migod, what protects patrons from getting socked with an enormous bill because a creator ships many more things then they expected?"</p><p>Yeah, Patreon has a solution for that too: patrons can set a monthly upper limit for how much they're willing to support a given creator. If the creator exceeds that limit, that's fine, that patron is not charged in excess of that amount.</p><p>(Personally, I warn all of my patrons to set that limit, because every once in a while I go off on a productivity tear.)</p><p>This is where things get challenging. If you imagine this system, if you try to walk through in your mind how this would work, it will probably occur to you to ask the question, "Okay, but... How does the system know that you shipped something?"</p><p>Yeah about that. I log into Patreon, and I basically make a little blog post that says "Look! I made the thing you pledged to pay me for!" with the associated ticky box for "Pay me for this" ticked, and click submit.</p><p>That's it.</p><p>Patreon and no way, shape, or form attempts to validate that I actually shipped the thing. That is between me and my patrons. And, personally, I'm smart enough not to use Patreon as my delivery mechanism, so delivery of what I am paid for happens through a completely other channel.</p><p>There will be more on that subsequently (probably item three on this list of Patreon competition sine qua nons).</p><p>So you might be wondering, "but that's basically just a 'pay me' button, more or less directly connected to the patrons' credit cards!"</p><p>Yes. Precisely. I mean, it doesn't charge them until the end of the month, but yes.</p><p>"But what's to keep a creator from just hammering the 'pay me' button?"</p><p>Nothing. Nothing at all.</p><p>Like I said previously, individual patrons can set their own monthly maximums. But really the only thing that prohibits the creator from doing that is that it will piss off their patrons, and if the patrons don't feel that they're getting their money's worth, they can cancel their patronage. Which they will do.</p><p>And that's totally sufficient.</p><p>It helps to get over the emotional hump if you realize that it's not actually any different than invoicing somebody through PayPal. If somebody hires you to landscape their yard, and you send them an itemized invoice through PayPal's invoice system, PayPal isn't going to check to make sure that you actually edged the lawn and planted the begonias like agreed.</p><p>To my knowledge – and, <em>boy</em>, would I like to be wrong about this – there is not a single other platform in the world that supports the by-works model that Patreon offers. [Edit: Found one! Tipeee.com. It charges 8% instead of 5%, and has some breathtakingly invasive personal documentation requirements, but it's there.]</p><p>To be crystal clear, it entails:</p><p>• Patrons pledge to pay $n per work, on an ongoing basis, in advance of the work being done.</p><p>• The creator then generates works on an ad hoc basis, not to any set schedule, and each time they do, they check in with the UI to bill their patrons.</p><p>• The platform aggregates these bills, and submits them to the patrons' credit cards monthly.</p><p>Part of the reason this is hard to understand is that people who are not creators (and even some who are) think of what Patreon affords as "selling stuff". Which is incorrect.</p><p>There are two problems with the selling stuff paradigm: the selling and the stuff.</p><p>First and foremost, Patreon does not require you to sell anything. I mean, you can use it for that. Lots of creators do.</p><p>I don't.</p><p>I use Patreon for patronage instead. Kind of like it says on the tin.</p><p>So this is the next item on the list.</p><p><b>3) Non quid pro quo patronage</b></p><p>Patreon is not a platform for selling things, even though you can use it that way, and Patreon seems to prefer it be used that way.</p><p>But Patreon can also be used to collect support that is not tied to directly providing the person who pays the money with something just for themselves.</p><p>There is an entire little universe of people using Patreon to be funded to do good works in the world. These may be open source contributors. They may be activists. They may be journalists or bloggers. They do not make things that they exchange for money with the people who pledge them on Patreon.</p><p>Their patrons do not pay these creators to give things <em>to them</em>. Their patrons pay these creators to give things <em>to the world</em>: to release code for anyone to use, to engage in activism that changes the world for the better, or to write things that anyone can read.</p><p>I'm one of them. The number one reason I signed up for Patreon as my funding platform nine years ago, was because it was literally the only way of funding my writing that did not entail my <strong>selling</strong> it: my withholding it only for those people who paid me for it.</p><p>People get confused here. I'm not talking about my intellectual property rights. I'm not worried somebody is going to steal my copyright in my writing. (I mean it's a legitimate concern but that's not what I'm talking about here.)</p><p>I'm talking about the very basic nature of what it means to sell a work of writing, as a book or a magazine or a stand-alone article in a PDF.</p><p>If I put my writing into documents that then I sell on Amazon or Kajabi,  then the only people who get to see it are the people who pay me for them.</p><p>That is the antithesis of what I want to do. What I want to do is write openly on the internet where anyone can read what I write. Where what I write can be cited by anyone who wants to refer to it in any internet discussion.</p><p>The audience of my writing is not my patrons, and it is not just the people who pay me for it. It's the whole world.</p><p>And that, quite explicitly, is what my patrons pay me to do.</p><p>Most would-be competitors to Patreon think it's some sort of DRM system. There are definitely people who try to use Patreon that way, and it works about as well as any DRM system does.</p><p>We have lots of other "pay us to access this document" platforms, starting with the 800 lb gorilla, Amazon. If you think there is some benefit to wedding a membership system to a document storefront, I think you're probably wrong. I could be convinced otherwise – since I'm not actually in that business, I assume there's a lot I don't know about it – but my guess is having to join a club just for the privilege of buying a PDF introduces friction that reduces revenue. Heaven knows I resent it as a customer.</p><p>(All that said, I reserve the right to go off and write books that I will sell for money, something I absolutely someday intend to do. But that is a very different project.)</p><p>And this brings us to number four....</p><p><b>4) An audience relationship management system, ideally one with an API one can build against.</b></p><p>Here's where you can really kick Patreon's ass in the market for alternatives, because Patreon's game has been slipping very badly in this area.</p><p>I just invented the term "audience relationship management" system, by analogy to "customer relationship management" system.  Like I said patrons are not the same thing as customers. But if you're a creator you do need to keep track of them, and you do need to keep track of their payments, and you do need to be able to communicate with them.</p><p>Also you would probably like to be able to tell what's going on with your money: with the amounts pledged, the amounts received, the fees deducted, the credit cards declined, stuff like that. You might also appreciate some analytics.</p><p>Patreon's infrastructure for doing all of this is kind of falling apart. In some places they've just taken things down rather than fix bugs.</p><p>The really big example of this, I'm not wholly familiar with, because I don't really use it, and I was hearing about it and its problems from other people on the creator forums that then patreon took down.</p><p>I'm talking about Patreon's API.</p><p>So here's what I think I know, and my information is kind of old, and the pandemic happened, and I wasn't directly involved myself, so I might be misremembering.</p><p>But as I understand it, it goes something like this: </p><p>Patreon has the affordance of allowing creators to establish "tiers", where the creator associates certain dollar amounts of pledges with certain package deals they put together. Patreon has – had – has – an API that creators can have their own software query, so that the creator's other systems can tell in real time whether one of their users is a paid up patron over on Patreon, and if so at what tier level.</p><p>So for instance, if you (a creator) wanted to run a private discussion forum on the web somewhere just for your patrons, and you're willing to do some programming, you could implement a system whereby your discussion forum software checked in with Patreon.com when someone logged in, comparing their email address with the one on file for patrons, to see whether or not they should be let in in the first place, and if so which forum features they should have access to, based on their tier.</p><p>Well, you could.</p><p>They were creators whose entire business models were based on this. I gather there were also a third party integrations, companies that actually developed against the Patreon API so that their own services could be integrated with creators' campaigns on Patreon – that is to say there were companies that made products that they sold to creators, that relied on the API.</p><p>Well Patreon decided that they're not supporting the API anymore. Apparently, from the screaming on the (now long defunct) creator forums, for a while there it looked like Patreon was going to turn it off. The Patreon walked that back and said that they wouldn't turn the API off, but they wouldn't be supporting it anymore, and they wouldn't be doing any further development on it.</p><p>So in a really important sense, these creators (and these companies that had third party integrations) were (are) using Patreon.com as an identity server. But not just an identity server. It doesn't just serve the identity of patrons, but their status as patrons.  That's part of what makes it "audience relationship management".</p><p>If your supposed Patreon competitor does not support doing that, well, you're certainly not going to seduce all of the creators clinging to the sinking wreck of Patreon's API into abandoning ship on your account, are you?</p><p>Patreon also has removed key functionality from within the web interface that creators used to tell what's going on – particularly if their campaign is by-works, as discussed previously.</p><p>More generally, Patreon's UI for creators is really kind of terrible. I could itemize why but we'd be here for a while. A company could go far that offered the same services as Patreon, but let creators actually see what was happening to their money.</p><p>For instance, the creator UI used to have a page that listed all of the works a by-works creator had submitted, that listed, <em>for each work</em>, how much money was pledged in the first place, how much revenue was actually collected (declined credit card charges are a thing), how much Patreon's cut was, how much Patreon took out to pass on to the payment processor, and how much you, the creator, would actually net.</p><p>They took that away.</p><p>Build one of those, especially in conjunction with supporting the by-work funding model, and you will be very attractive to a whole bunch of bitter Patreon refugees.</p><p>So there you go: four crucial aspects of what Patreon is ACTUALLY up to – what its value proposition is to the creators that choose to use it – that you're not going to be able to compete with Patreon unless you implement, and ideally improve upon.</p><hr><p>P.S. I would be remiss if I didn't also mention a fifth thing that Patreon did which was part of its secret sauce, the feature nobody realized Patreon was giving us until they tried to take it away and broke everything: charge bundling.</p><p>In <a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1369787.html">December 2017, Patreon announced that they were changing the rules of the game</a>, in a way they tried to pass off as advantageous to creators, but was something very else under the hood. What that was, well, nobody's quite sure because of how much lying Patreon did and because of how they swore parties they told things to to secrecy.</p><p>What Patreon had been doing up to that point was if a patron pledged more than one creator, then Patreon would submit a single charge to the payment processor for the total amount that patron owed all of the creators they had pledged for that month.</p><p>What they proposed to do instead was run a charge for each creator a patron supported. A patron who pledged three creators would be charged three times in a month.</p><p>That doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is. Because the fee structure of the payment processors includes, in addition to a percentage rate, a per transaction flat fee of $0.30.</p><p>And because the average patron pledge across Patreon is less than $2.</p><p>So where previously a patron who pledged three creators each a dollar a month would have had a total of 39 cents deducted in payment processor fees, leaving the creators to split $2.61 three ways, under the new system there would be a total of 99 cents deducted, leaving the creators to split $2.01 three ways.</p><p>Put another way, for a patron who supports three creators each for a dollar, the payment processing fee is 13%. Patreon was proposing making it 33%.</p><p>Only, no, what they actually proposed to do was even worse than that.</p><p>Patreon tried to play a shell game with how fees were charged. The system they had deducted fees out of whatever patrons pledged, as I described in the above example: if a patron pledges a dollar, the payment processor fee would be deducted from that dollar, along with Patreon own fee, with the creator receiving the difference.</p><p>In addition to unbundling the charges, such that there would be dramatically higher payment processor fees, Patreon explains that their plan was not to deduct it from what was pledged, but to add it. No longer would the amount that a patron pledged be the amount that their credit card would be charged. The amount a patron will be charged would be the amount they pledged plus the payment processor fee. If you pledged a dollar, you would be charged a $1.33 – the dollar you pledged plus 2.9% (3¢) plus the 30¢ flat fee.</p><p>(Corrigendum: Ooops, I left out Patreon's own fee, the 5% they take.  So if you pledged a dollar, they were proposing that they'd charge you $1.38: the dollar you pledged plus 2.9% (3¢) plus the 30¢ flat fee plus their 5% cut (5¢).)</p><p>The internet, understandably, lost its goddamn mind.</p><p>Now, Patreon did back down – temporarily. They ultimately grandfathered all of the extant creators as continuing to enjoy payment bundling, but I understand that after a certain flag day, new creator accounts work in the new unbundled way they wanted to roll out all along.</p><p>But the important thing to realize here, as a whole lot of us suddenly realized back in 2017, was that the numbers didn't work without bundling.</p><p>Part of what made Patreon explosively successful, in the first place, was that Patreon had apparently cracked the code on one of the hardest problems on the internet: micropayments.</p><p>By the time Patreon had come along people had been discussing the problem of micropayments on the internet for at least two decades. The problem with micropayments was that there was a huge amount of things that people buy for very small amounts of money, and a huge amount of what people wanted to buy on the internet were things that could not reasonably be priced more than a few bucks – one track on an album, for instance – but the transaction costs for very small purchases were such a large percentage of such purchases that they weren't economical. The payment processing fees put so much friction on small purchases that they pretty much killed them dead.</p><p>Then Patreon came along, and this was the deal they offered: you can do your thing and accept pledges of any amount, even tiny amounts, even amounts of less than $1, and we will charge you 5% for ourselves and approximately 5% for payment processing.</p><p>It was the right price point. Micropayments worked at that price point.</p><p>Nobody knows how Patreon made that work.</p><p>There's two major hypotheses.</p><p>PayPal, which is one of Patreon's payment processors, was offering a deal there for a while – and while all this was going down in December of 2017, <a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1373641.html">I got on the phone with PayPal</a> and asked if the deal was still available and it was – where one could opt into an alternative fee structure, with only a 5¢ flat fee, but a 5% fee rate.</p><p>So one hypothesis is that that was what Patreon was using, either  through PayPal or through another processor that offered equivalent terms.</p><p>The other hypothesis is that, well. There was an old joke about Amazon, "We're losing money on every sale, but will make it up in volume".  It may be that Patreon actually did that, for real. They may have assumed that they could subsidize the processing fees for small value pledges out of their own fees that they charged for high value pledges.</p><p>Only that math doesn't quite work.</p><p>I sat down with a spreadsheet and figured it out back in December 2017. If my math was correct, the point at which the 5% they said would cover payment processing actually <em>did</em> was for pledges of $14.29 and above.  (See "<a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1371510.html">The Fourteen Twenty-Nine Hypothesis</a>".)</p><p>This meant that if they weren't getting a special deal on payment processing, if they had tried to keep to 5%, they would have been losing money on any pledge less than $14.29.</p><p>Now they <em>weren't</em> trying to keep to 5% – they did in fact charge larger amounts for smaller pledges.</p><p>But the amounts they charged didn't seem remotely as large as they would have had to be to cover those payment processor fees if they were 2.9% plus $0.30.</p><p>But notice how bundling made this more plausible.</p><p>If a patron pledges one creator $1 a month, a huge amount of that would be lost to processing charges – either Patreon cuts deep into the creator's share, or they lose money.  But – with charge bundling – if a patron pledges 15 creators each $1 a month, the fee stops being so bad, because the $0.30 is only charged once. The fee works out to 2.9% (3¢) plus 2¢ per creator, so each creator's fee on their $1 is only $0.05.</p><p>Fundamentally, charge bundling is what made Patreon able – insofar as it was able, and it's not actually clear they were able – to offer what really was the first functional micropayment system on the internet.</p><p>But even then, you only get to a sweet spot if a given patron pledges enough across different creators. That $14.29 is even <em>with</em> bundling.</p><p>From my back of the envelope calculations it looked like Patreon was either losing money on every patron who pledged a total of less than $14.29 a month, or was otherwise struggling financially with low value patrons at some other threshold.</p><p>This is actually a horrendous problem, in light of that datum that the average pledge was less than $2.</p><p>And it's a horrendous problem for pretty much any business remotely shaped like Patreon. This is "the long tail".</p><p>That term was </p><s>coined and</s><p> popularized by Chris Anderson of Wired here <a href="https://www.wired.com/2004/10/tail/">https://www.wired.com/2004/10/tail/</a> which is behind a paywall.</p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-tail.asp">Investopedia explains it</a>: "The long tail is a business strategy that allows companies to realize significant profits by selling low volumes of hard-to-find items to many customers, instead of only selling large volumes of a reduced number of popular items. The term was first coined [<a href="https://epeus.blogspot.com/2005/09/too-short-history-of-long-tail.html">Incorrect</a>, h/t @KevinMarks@xoxo.zone – S.] in 2004 by Chris Anderson, who argued that products in low demand or with low sales volume can collectively make up market share that rivals or exceeds the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters but only if the store or distribution channel is large enough."</p><p>The long tail was a revelation as an idea and a revolution in commerce. Part of what made commerce on the internet different was that on the internet you could leverage the long tail. Whole types of businesses came into existence or rose to prominence by realizing many tiny transactions could dwarf blockbusters.</p><p>Fundamentally, Patreon is a long tail business. It doesn't sell a million of something at $100 a pop; it doesn't sell 10 million of something at $10 a pop. It sells ("sells") millions upon millions of different things at $1 a pop.</p><p>The problem with the long tail was, and apparently still remains, micropayments. Transaction costs are what causes friction in the long tail. This is why long tail businesses have to find ways to batch transactions.</p><p>It's why Amazon really, really, really wants you to order at least $n of goods at a time, and incents you with free shipping at that number.</p><p>So it turns out one of Patreon's biggest features was the fact that it was a vast marketplace of patronage, where one patron might find very many of the different creators they wanted to support – allowing Patreon to bundle their pledges when it came time to charge their credit card.</p><p>Now, to be clear... No I can't be clear, because I have no idea what Patreon actually did, or why.  Patreon has now moved away from this apparently? And I guess no longer bundles for newer campaigns?</p><p>Clearly there's some difficulty here. If you want to compete with Patreon, you're probably going to have to figure out how to make the funding work at least as well as Patreon did. If you can do better, that would be amazing.</p><hr><p>When I think about how breathtakingly complicated Patreon's underlying bookkeeping must be – two major funding models, by month and by work, plus various variations like annual memberships and pay at the start of the month versus pay at the end of the month, needing to keep track of when during a month a patron pledges or changes their pledge for reckoning by work pledges, plus they now somehow support merch payments? and also apparently they have two different approaches to handling payment processing depending on the age of the creator's campaign, one that deducts and bundles,  one that adds and is unbundled – this is one of the things I'm thinking about, when, as I said to a commenter over on the Mioscene, I think maybe Patreon bit off more than it could chew, technologically speaking.</p><p>I look at the complexity of logic necessary to just reckon how much they should charge whose credit cards and deposit in which bank accounts, and I look at the difficulty they seem to be having these days both managing credit card charges and presenting creators with an informative UI that tells them what is happening to their money, and it makes me wonder whether these things are indicative of Patreon's core bookkeeping system being the software development equivalent of a train with no brakes, headed down a steep hill, fast and getting faster.</p><p>The thing is, a bunch of those various funding model options for creators arose well after I began to surmise that Patreon was struggling with the implementation necessary for the by-work model. Patreon had done a number of things that seem to be deprecating the by-work model, most obviously their tearing out the part of the UI that by-works creators relied on, which suggested to me they repented of the decision to ever have it in the first place, given its complexity and difficulty to support in the code.</p><p>So on one hand, I was getting the impression that Patreon was struggling with the complexity of its bookkeeping already at that point, and then on the other hand, Patreon was forging ahead with new variations on payment models, multiplying the complexity further.</p><p>This is one of the things that inclines me to suspect that Patreon, as an organization, suffers from an especially acute case of neophilia.  It looks from the outside like simultaneously Patreon is trying to reduce complexity in its code and in its bookkeeping, while it's rolling out new features and new options that add even more complexity. And the new features and options don't look like things that are mission critical, or fixes for terrible problems: they just look like somebody's Cool New Idea(tm).</p><p>This suggests that a crucial way a competitor could whup Patreon is just by the old adage KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid.</p><p>It feels to me that Patreon embraces unnecessary complexity, which is absolutely terrible in a line of business that has its own abundant authentic, emergent, organic, locally sourced, government enforced complexity.</p><p>For instance let's talk about the tech stack of its website. I don't know anything about the back end, 'cause I'm not privy to that. But the front end is right there. For some reason Patreon felt the need to make an extremely highly abstract DHTML/Ajaxy UI, presumably on top of some set of <a href="https://youtu.be/Wm2h0cbvsw8?si=ofKVqwozvFLJuz0u" title="Obligatory listening break.">frameworks</a>. (It certainly <em>smells</em> like JavaScript frameworks are involved; the alternative, horrifying to contemplate, is they did that from scratch.) All for a user interface that has affordances that best I can tell can mostly have been implemented in Netscape 4.7, without even breaking the sweat.</p><p>This had three bad consequences: it made their site undebuggable, inaccessible, and classist.</p><p>Undebuggable: Because the site client side software architecture was so abstract, that just made it harder to debug when there were bugs. And there were bugs. And to reiterate: this was completely unnecessary. Most of the pages being rendered in this JavaScript confection were basically static pages.</p><p>Inaccessible: The heavy gratuitous use of JavaScript for page presentation rendered it largely inaccessible to people using screen readers, and almost got them sued under the ADA. Disability activists railed at Patreon for <em>years</em> about this. It wasn't until 2020 that <a href="https://www.lflegal.com/2020/07/patreon-press/">Patreon came to the table with blind users and the American Council of the Blind, and agreed to mend their ways.</a></p><p>Classist: JavaScript is processor-intensive in the browser. This means it takes more computing power to load and render one of these JavaScript confection pages than a static page. This means it's slow and difficult to open the various pages of Patreon's UI in older computers. Who has older computers? Well a lot of starving artists, that's who. This was just such an incredible own goal. The very population of creators they were courting included large numbers of people who couldn't afford computers – yet – necessary to access Patreon's website.</p><p>I speak from bitter experience here: it was watching me try to actually get a Patreon post out that caused my SO to rather firmly suggest I needed to do something about upgrading my hardware.</p><p>By the way, I actually explained to that to Patreon. I wound up getting contacted at some point and invited to participate in some sort of marketing study, for which they were interviewing creators. It was being done by video call. I took the occasion to point out to the person coordinating this that there were plenty of creators – this would have been back in like 2015, well before the pandemic – who, being poor starving artists, would not have access to a platform on which they could do a video call. She seemed very struck by this novel idea. Not that mentioning it to her made any difference, of course.</p><p>I surmise that Patreon staff assumed that all of its creators, because they were creators and used the internet, must be technophiles with the latest and greatest hardware, doing the kind of processor-intensive arts – video, sound production, video games – that required a beefy rig. They never seemed to imagine their users to be bloggers, fanfic writers, novelists, journalists, stick figure cartoonists, visual artists who worked in physical media and just scanned their work in, composers who published score, activists, or people who shipped physical items. (I am literally writing this <em>on a phone</em>.)</p><p>So if you want to compete with Patreon, one thing you could do to that end is just not be stupid about your user base in making your technological choices. If your value proposition is a platform for starving artists to earn money, maybe make your platform accessible from very low value hardware, <em>fucking duh</em>. Maybe – and I appreciate this is way less obvious to the temporarily able-bodied – make it accessible by people with disabilities, since one of the ways people wind up wanting to recourse to things like Patreon and other crowdfunding is because they are the modern equivalent of the legendary blind harpers and organists of yore: too disabled to hold a more conventional job.</p><p>And in doing so, save yourself the headache of having extra layers of code where there doesn't need to actually be any, so when you have to debug something – and I promise, you <em>will</em> have to debug something – you're not sitting on a mountain of technical debt before you've even started.</p><p>Relatedly, think really hard about adding new affordances, new features, new bells and whistles to the funding model or to the site itself. I think I can assure you that supporting the basic model is hard enough, and will deliver enough challenges all on its own, that you will not want for stress. Don't make your own life harder unnecessarily in pursuit of novelty.</p><p>Also relatedly, if you have a choice between slick but flaky vs reliable but boring, go with reliable but boring. When it comes to money, it's okay if the UI does not seem particularly glamorous or flashy or modern. <em>Stolid</em> is a very acceptable aesthetic value in financial UIs. Comforting, even.</p><p>Speaking of UIs, spending some professional attention on one would also put you ahead of Patreon in that domain. I don't know if they just don't have UX people or whether they just don't listen to them. It would be super cool if in your UI, things were named what they actually are, and also the navigation was well organized. But, as I said, if I start itemizing all the things I think are wrong with Patreon's UI we're going to be here a long time.</p><p>I think I'm going to stop here, not because I am done saying things about Patreon – indeed I can think of many other things I want to explain about Patreon – but because I need to stop somewhere. This seems like a good first pass to hopefully inspire some competitors to come take a bite out of Patreon's market share.</p><hr><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/siderea"><img src="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/file/1573.jpg" alt="Patreon Banner" title="Patreon Banner" width="714" height="402"></a></p><p><i>This post brought to you by the 159 readers who   funded my writing it – thank you all so much!

      <p>Imagine for a moment that you've just received a year-end bonus or income tax refund. You're not sure whether to invest now or wait. After all, the market recently hit an all-time high. Now imagine that you face this kind of decision every year—sometimes in up markets, other times in downturns. Is there a good rule of thumb to follow?</p>

<p>Our research shows that the cost of waiting for the perfect moment to invest typically exceeds the benefit of even perfect timing.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;And because timing the market perfectly is nearly impossible, the best strategy for most of us is not to try to market-time at all. Instead, make a plan and invest as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>But don't take our word for it. Consider our research on the performance of five hypothetical long-term investors following very different investment strategies. Each received $2,000 at the beginning of every year for the 20 years ending in 2022 and left the money in the stock market, as represented by the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index.<sup>2</sup> (While we recommend diversifying your portfolio with a mix of assets appropriate for your goals and risk tolerance, we're focusing on stocks to illustrate the impact of market timing.) Check out how they fared:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Peter Perfect</strong> was a perfect market timer. He had incredible skill (or luck) and was able to place his $2,000 into the market every year at the lowest closing point. For example, Peter had $2,000 to invest at the start of 2003. Rather than putting it immediately into the market, he waited and invested on March 11, 2003—that year's lowest closing level for the S&amp;P 500. At the beginning of 2004, Peter received another $2,000. He waited and invested the money on August 12, 2004, the lowest closing level for the market for that year. He continued to time his investments perfectly every year through 2022.</li>
	<li><strong>Ashley Action </strong>took a simple, consistent approach: Each year, once she received her cash, she invested her $2,000 in the market on the first trading day of the year.</li>
	<li><strong>Matthew Monthly</strong> divided his annual $2,000 allotment into 12 equal portions, which he invested at the beginning of each month. This strategy is known as <a href="https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing">dollar-cost averaging</a>. You may already be doing this through regular investments in your 401(k) plan or an Automatic Investment Plan (AIP), which allows you to deposit money into investments like mutual funds on a set timetable.</li>
	<li><strong>Rosie Rotten</strong> had incredibly poor timing—or perhaps terribly bad luck: She invested her $2,000 each year at the market's peak. For example, Rosie invested her first $2,000 on December 31, 2003—that year's highest closing level for the S&amp;P 500. She received her second $2,000 at the beginning of 2004 and invested it on December 30, 2004, the peak for that year.</li>
	<li><strong>Larry Linger</strong> left his money in cash investments (using Treasury bills as a proxy) every year and never got around to investing in stocks at all. He was always convinced that lower stock prices—and, therefore, better opportunities to invest his money—were just around the corner.</li>

        </div> 




  <div>
      <p>For the winner, look at the graph, which shows how much hypothetical wealth each of the five investors had accumulated at the end of the 20 years (2003-2022). Actually, we looked at 78 separate 20-year periods in all, finding similar results across almost all time periods.</p>

<p>Naturally, the best results belonged to Peter, who waited and timed his annual investment perfectly: He accumulated $138,044. But the study's most stunning findings concern Ashley, who came in second with $127,506—only $10,537 less than Peter Perfect. This relatively small difference is especially surprising considering that Ashley had simply put her money to work as soon as she received it each year—without any pretense of market timing.</p>

<p>Matthew's dollar-cost-averaging approach performed nearly as well, earning him third place with $124,248 at the end of 20 years. That didn't surprise us. After all, in a typical 12-month period, the market has risen 75.4% of the time.<sup>3</sup> So Ashley's pattern of investing first thing did, over time, yield lower buying prices than Matthew's monthly discipline and, thus, higher ending wealth.</p>

      <p>Rosie Rotten's results also proved surprisingly encouraging. While her poor timing left her $15,214 short of Ashley (who didn't try timing investments), Rosie still earned about three times what she would have if she hadn't invested in the market at all.</p>

<p>And what of Larry Linger, the procrastinator who kept waiting for a better opportunity to buy stocks—and then didn't buy at all? He fared worst of all, with only $43,948. His biggest worry had been investing at a market high. Ironically, had he done that each year, he would have earned far more over the 20-year period.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the time period considered, the rankings turn out to be remarkably similar. We analyzed all 78 rolling 20-year periods dating back to 1926 (e.g., 1926-1945, 1927-1946, etc.). In 68 of the 78 periods, the rankings were exactly the same; that is, Peter Perfect was first, Ashley Action second, Matthew Monthly third, Rosie Rotten fourth, and Larry Linger last.</p>

<p>But what about the 10 periods when the results were not as expected? Even in these periods, investing immediately never came in last. It was in its normal second place four times, third place five times and fourth place only once, from 1962 to 1981, one of the few extended periods of persistently weak equity markets. What's more, during that period, fourth, third and second places were virtually tied.</p>

<p>We also looked at all possible 30-, 40- and 50-year time periods, starting in 1926. If you don't count the few instances when investing immediately swapped places with dollar-cost averaging, all time periods followed the same pattern. In every 30-, 40- and 50-year period, perfect timing was first, followed by investing immediately or dollar-cost averaging, bad timing and, finally, never buying stocks.</p>

  <div>
      <p>If you make an annual investment (such as a contribution to an IRA or to a child's 529 plan) and you're not sure whether you should invest in January of each year, wait for a "better" time or dribble your investment out evenly over the year, be decisive. The best course of action for most of us is to create an appropriate plan and take action as soon as possible. It's nearly impossible to accurately identify market bottoms on a regular basis. So, realistically, the best action that a long-term investor can take, based on our study, is to determine how much exposure to the stock market is appropriate for their goals and risk tolerance and then consider investing as soon as possible, regardless of the current level of the stock market.</p>

<p>If you're tempted to try to wait for the best time to invest in the stock market, our study suggests that the potential benefits of doing this aren't all that impressive—even for perfect timers. Remember, over 20 years, Peter Perfect amassed $10,537 more than the investor who put her cash to work right away. That's about $500 extra per year.</p>

<p>Even badly timed stock market investments were much better than no stock market investments at all. Our study suggests that investors who procrastinate are likely to miss out on the stock market's potential growth. By perpetually waiting for the "right time," Larry sacrificed $68,344 compared to even the worst market timer, Rosie, who invested in the market at each year's high.</p>

  <div>
      <p>If you don't have the opportunity, or stomach, to invest your lump sum all at once, consider investing smaller amounts more frequently. As long as you stick with it, dollar-cost averaging can offer several potential benefits:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Prevents procrastination.</strong> Some of us just have a hard time getting started. We know we should be investing, but we never quite get around to it. Much like a regular 401(k) payroll deduction, dollar-cost averaging helps force yourself to invest consistently.</li>
	<li><strong>Minimizes regret.</strong> Even the most even-tempered stock trader feels at least a tinge of regret when an investment proves to be poorly timed. Worse, such regret may cause you to disrupt your investment strategy in an attempt to make up for your setback. Dollar-cost averaging can help minimize this regret because you make multiple investments, none of them particularly large.</li>
	<li><strong>Avoids market timing. </strong>Dollar-cost averaging ensures that you will participate in the stock market regardless of current conditions. While this will not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market, it will eliminate the temptation to try market-timing strategies that rarely succeed.</li>
</ul><p>That said, if you use dollar-cost averaging instead of lump sum you need to keep some things in mind. If the stock price rises over time, continuing to buy throughout the year will result in an increased average price per share. That would cause you to miss out on possible gains. (That's what held Matthew back in our example above.) However, if the stock falls over time, you will keep buying at lower prices. But there's also no guarantee that the stock price will recover.</p>

<p>As you strive to reach your financial goals, keep these research findings in mind. It may be tempting to try to wait for the "best time" to invest—especially in a volatile market environment. But before you do, remember the high cost of waiting. Even the worst possible market timers in our studies would have beat those who neglected to invest in the stock market at all.</p>

  <div>
      <ul><li>Given the difficulty of timing the market, the most realistic strategy for the majority of investors would be to invest in stocks immediately.</li>
	<li>Procrastination can be worse than bad timing. Long term, it's almost always better to invest in stocks—even at the worst time each year—than not to invest at all.</li>
	<li>Dollar-cost averaging is a good plan if you're prone to regret after a large investment has a short-term drop, or if you like the discipline of investing small amounts as you earn them.</li>
	<li>Lastly, it's important to note that there's no guarantee you'll make money through investing in stocks. For instance, there's always a chance we could enter another period like the 1960s through early 1980s.</li>

            <p><sup>1</sup> In the hypothetical situation discussed in this article, the cost of waiting for the perfect moment to invest is quantified as the difference in ending amounts between waiting in cash and dollar-cost averaging.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Mankind versus a hostile AI! From The Terminator to The Matrix to Ex Machina and beyond, so many movies and TV shows have explored the idea of artificial intelligence attempting to take over the world. Some of these films may be getting on in years, but the best sci-fi never feels dated. For Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and many others, the ideas and concepts at the heart of the truly great films are timeless. It's not the sci-fi trappings like the blinking lights and special effects that make them movies we want to revisit time and again.</p><p>One of the earliest entries of the AI genre came in 1970 – way before audiences had any real sense of where the digital revolution was about to take the world – with the overlooked classic Colossus: The Forbin Project. It remains, 53 years after it was released, one of the most gripping and prophetic films to ask the question: What happens when we create something that is smarter than us?</p><p>The film’s title refers to Colossus, a super-computer that is basically Skynet 14 years before The Terminator even came out. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/why-the-young-and-the-restless-star-eric-braeden-almost-turned-down-an-iconic-movie-role.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>James Cameron is apparently a fan</u></a> of Colossus: The Forbin Project, and it doesn’t seem like a stretch to say that he and Gale Anne Hurd were at least partially inspired by the 1970 picture when they wrote their franchise-starter.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/06/forbin-1-1696631105804.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="The end of humanity's dominance is only a matter of time for Dr. Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden)." src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/06/forbin-1-1696631105804.jpg?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>The end of humanity's dominance is only a matter of time for Dr. Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden).</figcaption></figure></output><p>After kicking things off with the Universal Pictures logo – a rotating Earth that’s about to be overcome by a new world order – Colossus immediately if subtly predicts its premise with a pair of shots that quickly flash by. To the sound of trippy electronic sound effects and a vibrating score, we see the beeping light of what is <em>maybe </em>an EKG machine, followed by an out-of-focus eyeball… but wait a second. Is that actually some kind of computer read-out that’s beeping? And maybe that’s not an eyeball at all, but a camera lens staring at us through hazy focus?</p><p>In 1970, you couldn’t pause the tape… uh, DVD… uh, stream to be sure, though a little later we see that the EKG thingy is in fact a monitor device built into Colossus. But the blurring of the line between computer and human being is clear. And while that’s an idea that had so effectively been conveyed just two years earlier with 2001: A Space Odyssey’s HAL 9000, Colossus: The Forbin Project took that evolution one step further as its computer eventually approaches something closer to… godhood.</p><p>Also shooting for godhood, perhaps, is Dr. Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden), the brilliant if short-sighted mind behind Colossus, which the U.S. President (Gordon Pinsent) sees as the ultimate in Cold War technology. A super-computer designed to control the country’s nuclear arsenal, Colossus – just like in that song about, well, God – will soon have the whole world in its hands.</p><p>We first meet Forbin as he tours the top-secret facility where Colossus’ brain is housed, switching on gizmos that are meant to portray the most sophisticated computer imaginable in the 1970s, but which look mainly like flashing blinkies and colorful buttons. There’s not a touchscreen in sight! Of course, when this film was made, the very notion of how we would interact with computers in the 21st century was inconceivable for most people. The GUI (graphical user interface) that is commonplace now – essentially, interacting with machines through graphics instead of text – wouldn’t really be invented for another three years. The microchip had only been created 12 years earlier! So the filmmakers here had to figure out how we would communicate with a computer like Colossus.</p><p>The answer? Through a LED-light news ticker and a teletype.</p><p>Considering how often Hollywood has botched its depictions of computers – often endowing them with abilities that don’t make sense, like when a character only has to do some fast typing on a keyboard to magically move plot or action forward – it’s fairly remarkable how convincing Colossus is as a machine. Convincing and scary. This is what makes good sci-fi – striking imagery or hyper-accurate depictions of future tech are secondary to high stakes and captivating storytelling.</p><p>Take the scene where Colossus’ communication line to its Soviet counterpart – another newborn super-brain called Guardian – is severed by the humans. A world map in the White House situation room shows Colossus trying to find a new path to its sibling. It almost feels desperate – sad – as the computer fruitlessly reaches out for its friend, as depicted visually on the map as various telecom pathways. But then Colossus drops a message on its news ticker: “IF LINK NOT RESTORED ACTION WILL BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY.”</p><p>Actually, that’s not a message. It’s a threat. Up until now, the illusion of human control has kept Forbin and the rest on their perch. But when the President gets on the line – the user has to dictate what they want to say to Colossus to an underling, who types it into a device that’s even bigger than the typewriter I took to college with me – he makes things worse, and the computer announces that it’s launching a nuclear missile directed at the Soviet Union. Guardian does the same, aimed at the US.</p><p>What follows is a flurry of teletype sounds – type-type-type-type – and beeps and increasingly nervous voices as Forbin tries to negotiate with his creation. The Michel Colombier score intensifies as suddenly we’re on a countdown clock. Multiple video conference screens feature the scrambling Soviets while the camera trains on the world map, where simple yellow-white lines indicate the two missiles passing one another on their way to their final destinations.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Colossus is a tight 100 minutes of increasingly ratcheted-up tension as the cocky Forbin and the clueless President watch their control of the world disappear utterly and completely.</p></div><p>It’s an incredibly gripping sequence, culminating in Forbin giving the computer what it wants. Four tense-as-hell minutes after the first missile launch, the sequence ends with one aborted attack, one destroyed Soviet town, and Colossus one step closer to full dominance over man.</p><p>That’s the type of action the film provides – it’s basically just a bunch of guys in a room talking to a news ticker. It’s simple and there’s no need for high-tech frills. But man, is it unforgettable. Still, it’s no surprise that most of the movie posters for Colossus: The Forbin Project focus on a minor character who is gunned down midway through the film, since that death takes place during one of the few more traditional “action” scenes.</p><p>Directed by Joseph Sargent, a TV helmer who was transitioning to a full-time feature career and would soon turn out the classic NYC subway thriller The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, Colossus is a tight 100 minutes of increasingly ratcheted-up tension as the cocky Forbin and the clueless President watch their control of the world, slowly at first, but eventually in runaway-train-like fashion, disappear utterly and completely.</p><p>Early in the film, the charming Forbin gives a Steve Jobs-like presentation about how impressive his new tech is (the only thing missing is the black turtleneck). Speaking of Jobs, it’s interesting that the not-too-distant future depicted here doesn’t seem to have any room for Big Tech. Colossus is apparently a government-funded project, and Forbin has to bend to the will of the President at times – even more so in the book on which the movie is based. That said, the film predicts some of the workplace and lifestyle developments that have since become commonplace for us. Zoom calls are basically a thing, as is a work-from-home ethos – at least for Forbin and his team, who all live on a sort of campus where work and play are intermixed. Eventually, Forbin is forced to live under the constant gaze of an ever-watchful Colossus, which perhaps isn’t all that different for some of us who are forever tied to our tech, social media and otherwise.</p><div><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/06/forbin-3a-1696632645112.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Eventually, Forbin cannot escape the watchful eye of Colossus, not even in his home." src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/06/forbin-3a-1696632645112.gif?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>Eventually, Forbin cannot escape the watchful eye of Colossus, not even in his home.</figcaption></figure></output></p></div><p>During that earlier presentation at the White House, Forbin – standing in front of a portrait of Washington no less as he unwittingly signs away mankind’s freedom – had asked rhetorically, “Is Colossus capable of creative thought?” His answer at the time is no. So when, shortly thereafter, Colossus outgrows his creator in a matter of days, it’s got to be a tough pill to swallow. (In a great sequence, Colossus and Guardian begin to communicate via basic math – 2+2=4 and so on – but before too long, they’ve advanced to theoretical mathematics and are breaking new ground on topics that the human scientific community hasn’t even been close to touching.)</p><p>But that’s the real trick, isn’t it? From Frankenstein to HAL to Scarlett Johansson’s Samantha in Her, the genre has a long history of man creating something that, once created, can no longer be controlled. Forbin, in his quest for more knowledge and scientific dominance, made a mind greater than his own. Indeed, early on, when he attempts to punish Colossus like a bratty child and seems to briefly win back control of the computer, his assistant asks if he’s disappointed. Forbin only chuckles in response, but it’s right there: Deep down, there’s a part of the scientist who wants his creation to be “more.” And if that means letting a super-computer run the planet Earth… Eh, whaddaya gonna do?</p><p>It’s the genie out of the bottle syndrome, and while the current AI situation that we are facing in 2023 may be far less dramatic than Dr. Forbin’s nightmare scenario – no AI in the real world has blown up a city yet as far as I know – the bottom line is that much of the reasoning and arguments made in favor of the development of AI are the same as the promises Forbin and the President make: “[It will be used as] an aide to the solution of the many problems that we face on this Earth...”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The 25 Best Sci-Fi Movies</h3></div></output><p>By the end of Colossus: The Forbin Project, the solution to those many problems means that Colossus/Guardian have inherited the Earth, and Forbin is a prisoner in his own life, working as a slave to his creation. Mankind may be better off because of Colossus, but it’s no longer calling the shots. The final moments of the film are perfect, early-’70s bleak sci-fi: Forbin finally breaks down in rage and frustration as the now seemingly all-knowing, all-seeing Colossus reads out its benevolent plans for humankind’s future. That includes a promise that, in time, Forbin will come to regard the machine with love. That Forbin’s last words, as the computer – and we – watch him simultaneously from every angle, are “Never!” means nothing to the AI. See, Colossus has evolved past mere man, and it knows better now.</p><p>It’s got the whole world in its hands.</p><p><em>Talk to Executive Editor Scott Collura on Twitter at </em><a href="https://twitter.com/ScottCollura" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>@ScottCollura</strong></em></a><em>, or listen to his </em><a href="https://www.spreaker.com/show/transporter-room-3-the-star-trek-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Star Trek podcast, Transporter Room 3</strong></em></a><em>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          

            <p>One promising approach to treating Type 1 diabetes is implanting pancreatic islet cells that can produce insulin when needed, which can free patients from giving themselves frequent insulin injections. However, one major obstacle to this approach is that once the cells are implanted, they eventually run out of oxygen and stop producing insulin.</p>

<p>To overcome that hurdle, MIT engineers have designed a new implantable device that not only carries hundreds of thousands of insulin-producing islet cells, but also has its own on-board oxygen factory, which generates oxygen by splitting water vapor found in the body.</p>

<p>The researchers showed that when implanted into diabetic mice, this device could keep the mice’s blood glucose levels stable for at least a month. The researchers now hope to create a larger version of the device, about the size of a stick of chewing gum, that could eventually be tested in people with Type 1 diabetes.</p>

<p>“You can think of this as a living medical device that is made from human cells that secrete insulin, along with an electronic life support-system. We’re excited by the progress so far, and we really are optimistic that this technology could end up helping patients,” says Daniel Anderson, a professor in MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering, a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), and the senior author of the study.</p>

<p>While the researchers’ main focus is on diabetes treatment, they say that this kind of device could also be adapted to treat other diseases that require repeated delivery of therapeutic proteins.</p>

<p>MIT Research Scientist Siddharth Krishnan is the lead author of the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311707120" target="_blank">paper</a>, which appears today in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The research team also includes several other researchers from MIT, including Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute, as well as researchers from Boston Children’s Hospital.</p>

<p><strong>Replacing injections</strong></p>

<p>Most patients with Type 1 diabetes have to monitor their blood glucose levels carefully and inject themselves with insulin at least once a day. However, this process doesn’t replicate the body’s natural ability to control blood glucose levels.</p>

<p>“The vast majority of diabetics that are insulin-dependent are injecting themselves with insulin, and doing their very best, but they do not have healthy blood sugar levels,” Anderson says. “If you look at their blood sugar levels, even for people that are very dedicated to being careful, they just can’t match what a living pancreas can do.”</p>

<p>A better alternative would be to transplant cells that produce insulin whenever they detect surges in the patient’s blood glucose levels. Some diabetes patients have received transplanted islet cells from human cadavers, which can achieve long-term control of diabetes; however, these patients have to take immunosuppressive drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the implanted cells.</p>

<p>More recently, researchers have shown similar success with islet cells derived from stem cells, but patients who receive those cells also need to take immunosuppressive drugs.</p>

<p>Another possibility, which could prevent the need for immunosuppressive drugs, is to encapsulate the transplanted cells within a flexible device that protects the cells from the immune system. However, finding a reliable oxygen supply for these encapsulated cells has proven challenging.</p>

<p>Some experimental devices, including one that has been tested in clinical trials, feature an oxygen chamber that can supply the cells, but this chamber needs to be reloaded periodically. Other researchers have developed implants that include chemical reagents that can generate oxygen, but these also run out eventually.</p>

<p>The MIT team took a different approach that could potentially generate oxygen indefinitely, by splitting water. This is done using a proton-exchange membrane — a technology originally deployed to generate hydrogen in fuel cells — located within the device. This membrane can split water vapor (found abundantly in the body) into hydrogen, which diffuses harmlessly away, and oxygen, which goes into a storage chamber that feeds the islet cells through a thin, oxygen-permeable membrane.</p>

<p>A significant advantage of this approach is that it does not require any wires or batteries. Splitting this water vapor requires a small voltage (about 2 volts), which is generated using a phenomenon known as resonant inductive coupling. A tuned magnetic coil located outside the body transmits power to a small, flexible antenna within the device, allowing for wireless power transfer. It does require an external coil, which the researchers anticipate could be worn as a patch on the patient’s skin.</p>

<p><strong>Drugs on demand</strong></p>

<p>After building their device, which is about the size of a U.S. quarter, the researchers tested it in diabetic mice. One group of mice received the device with the oxygen-generating, water-splitting membrane, while the other received a device that contained islet cells without any supplemental oxygen. The devices were implanted just under the skin, in mice with fully functional immune systems.</p>

<p>The researchers found that mice implanted with the oxygen-generating device were able to maintain normal blood glucose levels, comparable to healthy animals. However, mice that received the nonoxygenated device became hyperglycemic (with elevated blood sugar) within about two weeks.</p>

<p>Typically when any kind of medical device is implanted in the body, attack by the immune system leads to a buildup of scar tissue called fibrosis, which can reduce the devices’ effectiveness. This kind of scar tissue did form around the implants used in this study, but the device’s success in controlling blood glucose levels suggests that insulin was still able to diffuse out of the device, and glucose into it.</p>

<p>This approach could also be used to deliver cells that produce other types of therapeutic proteins that need to be given over long periods of time. In this study, the researchers showed that the device could also keep alive cells that produce erythropoietin, a protein that stimulates red blood cell production.</p>

<p>“We’re optimistic that it will be possible to make living medical devices that can reside in the body and produce drugs as needed,” Anderson says. “There are a variety of diseases where patients need to take proteins exogenously, sometimes very frequently. If we can replace the need for infusions every other week with a single implant that can act for a long time, I think that could really help a lot of patients.”</p>

<p>The researchers now plan to adapt the device for testing in larger animals and eventually humans. For human use, they hope to develop an implant that would be about the size of a stick of chewing gum. They also plan to test whether the device can remain in the body for longer periods of time.</p>

<p>“The materials we’ve used are inherently stable and long-lived, so I think that kind of long-term operation is within the realm of possibility, and that’s what we’re working on,” Krishnan says.</p>

<p>“We are very excited about these findings, which we believe could provide a whole new way of someday treating diabetes and possibly other diseases,” Langer adds.</p>

<p>The research was funded by JDRF, the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at the National Institutes of Health.</p>

The rear roof panel (flat) would "oilcan" every time they went over a bump, making that characteristic noise - and it is almost impossible to fix.</p><p>In the late 1950's, car makers started doing "deep draw" stampings to make tail fins.&nbsp; They pushed the sheetmetal art to the limits.&nbsp; Of course, back then, "body lead" was used to fill in seams (such as where the roof met the "C" pillar) and a lot of cars had a lot of lead in them.&nbsp; Chrysler Imperials famously had no body seams - they were filled with lead.&nbsp; By the 1970s and 1980s, the "square" look came into vogue, and this created challenges for Engineers.&nbsp; Large flat sections of sheetmetal would tend to oilcan, so they put creases and folds into the body to prevent this.&nbsp; Even so....</p><p>I went to work at Carrier in the air handling lab, where we built and tested prototype air handlers.&nbsp; These were big sheetmetal boxes with a big fan in them (and a coil).&nbsp; To keep them from oil-canning, we would <a href="https://sheetmetal.me/tooling-terminology/cross-break/">cross-break</a> (or cross-buck) the sheetmetal.&nbsp; Later, we devised a method of embossing ribs in the metal, which allowed us to use thinner metal.&nbsp; You see this technique used on things like "Jerry" cans used to hold gasoline on the back of a jeep.&nbsp; Ribs strengthen the metal, much as cross-breaking does (only better).</p><p>So, anyone who has tortured sheetmetal, as they used to call it at GM, knows that making a vehicle with nothing but flat surfaces is bound to be trouble.&nbsp; The flat panels will "oilcan" unless you make them really thick, which is too heavy and expensive, or back them with ribs or embossing them.&nbsp; Moreover, it will be harder to maintain dimensional stability with flat panels, making door and hood seems look uneven.</p><p>Tesla announced its childishly named "Cybertruck" years ago, in a product announcement famous for Elon Musk breaking the "unbreakable" windows. It was fortunate they were breakable, as an unbreakable window could trap passengers inside, if the vehicle caught fire (<i>which of course Teslas never do</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;He touted the truck as having an "exoskeleton" when in fact, it was just a typical unibody - something pickup truck buyers would avoid (other than perhaps, the Honda "pickup" which even has a fake body seam in it to make it appear the bed is mounted to a frame, when in fact, the "truck" is based on the Odyssey minivan).</p><p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90945689/teslas-cybertruck-has-a-serious-problem-that-only-a-complete-redesign-can-fix">The truck has been delayed for years now</a>, and in the meantime, Rivian has started production and sold trucks (I have seen several on the road now) and Ford and GM are offering electric versions of their standard pickups.&nbsp; Why Tesla is late to market is a good question, but a recent Tweet on TWITTER from Musk hints as to why.&nbsp; He claims the truck looks like crap as the flat panels don't meet up well and minor imperfections in flat sheetmetal show up more easily.&nbsp; <i>Any Engineer coulda toldya that.</i></p><p>His solution?&nbsp; <i>To make the sheetmetal in tolerances higher than used in ball-bearings.</i>&nbsp; It is a ridiculous Tweet as any Engineer could tell you that the staggering cost of making body panels to instrumentation specs is a pointless waste of money.&nbsp; Just add some creases or curves, and the panels will look good and fit.&nbsp; Flat panels - even if you could make them to micron tolerances, would be a nightmare to repair, even for the tiniest of dents.</p><p>But maybe this is just an excuse to delay the production of the "Cybertruck" indefinitely - while shoring up the stock price.&nbsp; Know-nothings on the Internet buy Tesla stock (and AMC and Gamestop) and tell each other the price will keep going up.&nbsp; I saw one posting online claiming that AMC stock will go up to $1000 a share, when it is languishing at $12 right now.&nbsp; There is no secret sauce or "moat" to running movie theaters, which are a dying brick-and-mortar business anyway.&nbsp; But that didn't stop them from being patsies in a grand pump-and-dump.</p><p>Similarly, Tesla stock was hyped to the stratosphere and is finally coming back to Earth.&nbsp; The "World's Richest Man" was rich only on paper, and he blew most of that buying TWITTER.&nbsp; I saw a posting online from a fan-boy showing <i>the</i>&nbsp;"Cybertruck" leaving the Tesla factory, behind a Model X.&nbsp; "See?" he said, "It's in production already!"&nbsp; In fact, <i>it is not</i>.&nbsp; But you see how they spread these rumors to prop up the stock price.</p><p>Worldwide, we see this nonsense.&nbsp; Evergrande is trading again and lost 80% of its value overnight.&nbsp; Entire cities of empty buildings have been built in China, and no one actually lives in them - they are the tulip bulbs or crypto-currency of condos.&nbsp; And the longer this bubble goes on, the worst it will be when it bursts - and it is bursting now.&nbsp; Similar bubbles are happening in the USA and in particular, Canada, where housing prices have reached ridiculous proportions for no apparent reason (although Chinese buyers are one aspect of this, yet again).</p><p>Frankly, I am shocked that newbie Rivian is actually selling pickup trucks before Tesla.&nbsp; But I think Rivian may be in for a rough time if the economy declines.&nbsp; <a href="https://livingstingy.blogspot.com/2023/08/if-theres-no-recession.html">As I noted before</a>, I am getting flooded with e-mails from <i>every retailer I have ever done business with</i>&nbsp;begging me to buy more "stuff."</p><p>I see a slap of reality, 2008-style, coming around the bend.&nbsp; The longer people want to believe in fantasies, the worse it will be.&nbsp; Putin believes he can take over the world - and yet half his army has been destroyed, using surplus equipment various Western countries have sent to the Ukraine.&nbsp; MAGA-hats think that Donald Trump is some sort of financial genius who will "save America" by turning it into a totalitarian State ("FREE-DUM!" - ironic, isn't it?).</p><p>We are due for a wake-up call. The alarm keeps going off, but we keep hitting the "snooze" button and go back to dreaming - <i>for just a little bit longer.</i></p><p>UPDATE:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisaUbaKVQh7wz-xNrzFX1g1tMNp9HwzECzPNLWTKJLcF3YNSjUcTUBSZ2lEyRuWTEmSt8wl0CE6v-0gar9sVfj3SHIXmLmUPwUc3Bgv-rRZo6-oZqWjGRaG-WrvJ8b2WEHeE1bNe0aSJPAP2JoPKOaTMps4nIQiOQU-gNSoYSjFMl7ucOR99mbTjRLNqg/s619/duct%20tape.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="433" data-original-width="619" height="280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisaUbaKVQh7wz-xNrzFX1g1tMNp9HwzECzPNLWTKJLcF3YNSjUcTUBSZ2lEyRuWTEmSt8wl0CE6v-0gar9sVfj3SHIXmLmUPwUc3Bgv-rRZo6-oZqWjGRaG-WrvJ8b2WEHeE1bNe0aSJPAP2JoPKOaTMps4nIQiOQU-gNSoYSjFMl7ucOR99mbTjRLNqg/w400-h280/duct%20tape.png" width="400"></a></p><p>Note the duct tape covering the panel gaps. Note also the awkward transition to the windshield frame - like a DeLorean someone made in their back yard.&nbsp; Notice how the driver's door panel is oil-canning.&nbsp; What a mess.&nbsp; A few creases or body lines would fix a lot of this.&nbsp; The rest of it looks just as bad.</p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Last week, I had a fascinating conversation with a reader around frustration and unhappiness at work. Much of it was totally obvious to both of us, but it occurred to me that this probably <em>isn't</em> to everyone, which is why almost all of my colleagues (in very cushy, non-stressful jobs) nonetheless need therapy. And if it isn't obvious to everyone, it's worth writing about.</p>
<p>I now believe that this stems from a failure to recognize the gap, frequently vast, between what is being <em>said</em> by a person and what is being felt, and how this discrepancy applies to organizations too.</p>
<p>It was sparked by reference to a concept called the <em>honne-tatemae</em> divide, which are Japanese concepts related to the true feelings of an individual and the front they present in public. I don't actually know anything about the Japanese context beyond this one Wikipedia article, so this has been dropped entirely so that I seem worldly and to give us vocabulary less onerous than "what you really think" and "what you're forced to say".</p>
<h2 id="i-tatemae">I. Tatemae</h2>
<p>I have never met a single manager at any large company that has not said they want to be <em>data driven</em>. I have also never seen a single one of them take any steps that could actually move them in this direction.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the average annual salary for a Power BI developer places them in the 90th percentile of my country's annual income. For those of you unfamiliar with Power BI, you connect it to data sources and then it makes visualizations for managers to gawk at, and it is so simple to use that it is not inconceivable to me that you could <em>actually</em> train a monkey to make a bar chart with the correct application of positive reinforcement and peanuts.</p>
<p>There are a handful of people who do amazing things in Power BI, but the hard truth is that most people who work in it are <em>really</em> just dragging-and-dropping bar charts onto a page after connecting it to a spreadsheet, being paid absolutely exorbitantly, and then if they're smart, going home and despairing. This is because Power BI tracks usage metrics and almost all dashboards are completely unused.</p>
<p>My current organization has 8000 staff members, and I used to glance over the usage metrics of the dashboards my old team produced. I believe three dashboards were used, out of somewhere around 50 - 100. Of those being visited, it usually turned out they were being visited by members of our team checking to see if the data had refreshed for the day. I'd estimate the cost of maintaining our team was approximately $1,000,000, for an organization that supposedly can't afford to waste that money.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Management has no choice but to say that they want to be data driven. It's not like they can just come out and <em>say</em> that it's all fucked - so they say the only thing that is available. We are going through a "digital transformation", and that is why all of these efforts don't generate any revenue and drive staff to misery. It will be better once this current initiative successfully completes, even though we have never demonstrated the ability to successfully complete a similar initiative at any point in the past.</p>
<h2 id="ii-honne">II. Honne</h2>
<p>There are two pressures that drive the garbled stream of corporate of nonsense at organizations.</p>
<h2 id="i-sturgeons-law">I. Sturgeon's Law</h2>
<p>The first one is <em>very</em> simple, and I sometimes lose sight of it while I'm deep in the theory mines of incentives and other smarter takes. 90% of everything is crud, and that explains almost everything. Most managers have never had an independent thought on how to manage people effectively (hence the Agile parroting), most programmers don't know what an abstraction is, etc, etc. This is the <em>overwhelming</em> factor even though it isn't a satisfying answer, but it has done more for my own peace of mind than anything that follows.</p>
<p>I used to be pretty good on the fencing circuit - as in, olympic fencing, with the swords. It never occurred to me <em>for even a goddamn second</em> that we could win competitions without having good, smart people that understood the sport and trained hard. If we lose because Derek didn't turn up to practice for six months, I might be pissed off and upset, but I am not <em>spiritually confused</em> about why my efforts aren't rewarding me.</p>
<p>I have no idea what possesses us to turn up at work and think that we can accomplish anything with fucking Derek over there calling the shots while slamming their empty head onto a keyboard as rapidly as Jira will allow him to create cards we won't finish, but for some reason it's a thing that happens.</p>
<p>Derek will repeat whatever brain-dead thing is in vogue but they are <em>very stupid</em> and will repeat literally anything that sounds popular, plus will never question that they have never had an unambiguous success over their entire career. This means they will inevitably become promoted over time, because unlike the rest of us who have to put in <em>effort</em> and pay what a friend of mine terms <em>soul cost</em> to act like a sycophant, they believe it sincerely.</p>
<h2 id="ii-sturgeons-law-again">II. Sturgeon's Law Again</h2>
<p>Here's the pressure if you're in the 10% of people that aren't crud at their jobs - you're surrounded by people that <em>are</em> crud.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong - I <em>am</em> that terrible person at many things. There are fencing teams where I'd be absolute dead weight. My piano playing leaves much to be desired. Last week, I managed to stub the little toe on both feet, on the same day, on two separate occasions, and I have on at least one occasion absentmindedly dropped a teaspoon into the trash instead of a tea bag.</p>
<p>However I don't do any of that professionally. In professional settings, approximately <em>all</em> of my time goes into solving problems introduced by people that are just indescribably bad.</p>
<p>I work on a platform that cost my organization an eye-watering sum of money to produce, over the span of two years, and the engineers responsible for it elected to use spreadsheets to control the infrastructure, so we now have a spreadsheet with 400 separate worksheets that powers but one part of this whole shambling mess.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the kind of havoc such people could wreak upon infrastructure and code if left unchecked?</p>
<p>Is there <em>any</em> chance a team with people like that is going to produce good results? Obviously not. Do most teams at large organizations have at least one person like that? Sweet merciful Christ, in both my first, second, and perhaps even third-hand experience, whatever that means, it's possible that <em>half of all teams consist entirely of that person</em>.</p>
<p>Can my manager keep their job if they honestly say "There is no chance this team will ever hit its objectives"? <em>Fuck</em> no, if they did that they'd be <em>gone</em>, so the system is constantly selecting for people that are either too dumb to realize it's hopeless, too perversely incentivized to be honest, or too deep into despair to <em>admit to themselves</em> it is hopeless.</p>
<h2 id="iii-ignoring-is-bliss">III. Ignoring Is Bliss</h2>
<p>From the Tao of Programming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A novice asked the Master: "In the East, there is a great tree-structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated out of shape with vice presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying 'Go Hence!' or 'Go Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity exist?"</p>
<p>The Master replied: "You perceive this immense structure and are disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its endless gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I quote the above because it is very funny, and because the only thing that has brought me clarity is totally ignoring anything management says unless I have a very good reason to believe the person I am speaking to has intelligence, integrity, <em>and</em> has come to terms with the fact that large organizations are inherently dysfunctional, which happens rarely.</p>
<p>I have a friend that was denied a raise after working at a company diligently for five years - there was no budget, he was told. He was upset, and ended up spending a year traveling the world on sabbatical.</p>
<p>While he was away, a new position opened up in the same department, for the same job title - it was a permanent role, theoretically exactly the same job he was doing in an identical team with the same managers. They gave me that job, all the money he asked for, plus another hefty sum on top of it.</p>
<p>Management saying there was no budget <em>meant nothing</em> - it is purely a thing they are forced to say, and if the person saying it was not particularly insightful, they even believed it. The <em>only</em> thing an organization can do that means <em>anything</em> is actually solving your problem, and <em>any</em> words to the effect of "we'll address your concerns soon" or "we just need to do some planning around this", etc, should just be ignored wholesale.</p>
<p>These days, I ignore everything they've said about salary (I just state a number and don't budge, and they usually just give me what I want despite saying it was impossible), I ignore everything they say around work culture and the teams they want to build (I don't factor it into my decisions around whether it's a team I'd like to join because I know it isn't trustworthy), and frankly, sometimes I just ignore them because fuck 'em, why not?</p>
<p>Similarly, I let them talk as much as they want about work culture or whatever. These are the endless gyrations of the great tree structure, rustling in the wind. Actually <em>remove</em> the staff that no one works to work with or who terrorize their subordinates and I'll know you're serious about performance. Reward people for staying, and I'll know you're serious about valuing people. Anything short of that is less than worthless, because you've wasted valuable time I could have been listening to music.</p>
<p>It's much more peaceful to solve a few problems, not waste a single iota of my energy on creating systemic change unless we're going to try curing cancer, then log off to touch grass. Realizing that no mere <em>words</em> can demonstrate an appetite for true change was necessary for me to make that change in my life - hopefully it does the same for someone else.</p>

Activists on opposing sides crowd around the backdrop of a television segment outside the California State Capitol on a bill that would ban caste-based discrimination in California. | Eric He/POLITICO
</p>

</div>
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill Saturday that would have explicitly outlawed caste discrimination in California, dealing a blow to activists hoping to make the state the first in the nation to enact such a ban and a first-term lawmaker who shepherded <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/04/ban-caste-discrimination-california-bill-00113817" target="_blank" data-tracking="mpos=&amp;mid=&amp;lindex=&amp;lcol=">one of the more controversial bills</a> of the session through the Legislature.</p>
<p>The law would have inserted caste into the definition of ancestry, making it illegal to discriminate on the basis of caste under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Fair Employment and Housing Act and education discrimination law.</p>

<p>Hearings on <span>Senate Bill 403</span> — from state Sen. <span>Aisha Wahab</span> (D-Hayward) — were among the most attended of the session, with lines stretching down hallways, public testimony lasting for hours and demonstrations outside the Capitol. The proposal split California’s large South Asian community, drawing passionate lobbying for and against it. Assemblymember <span>Ash Kalra</span>, the first Indian American elected to the state Legislature, lamented the fissure during a hearing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SB-403-Veto-1.pdf" target="_blank" data-tracking="mpos=&amp;mid=&amp;lindex=&amp;lcol=">veto message</a>, Newsom said the bill is unnecessary because caste discrimination is already prohibited under existing civil rights protections that “shall be liberally construed.” </p>
<p>“In California, we believe everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, no matter who they are, where they come from, who they love, or where they live,” Newsom said.</p>

<p>After the bill passed, supporters launched a hunger strike to put pressure on Newsom to sign it, holding rallies outside the Capitol.</p>
<p>Opponents contended that the legislation will stigmatize Hindus and people from South Asia, where caste — a social hierarchy in which one’s group is inherited — is historically most closely associated. Representatives for the Hindu American Foundation had previously promised to challenge it in court. The veto is a victory for national Hindu groups such as the Hindu American Foundation and the Coalition of Hindus of North America, which fiercely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill.</p>
<p>A pair of Republican state senators, <span>Brian Jones</span> and <span>Shannon Grove</span>, wrote <a href="https://sr40.senate.ca.gov/sites/sr40.senate.ca.gov/files/Request%20for%20Veto%20-%20SB%20403%20%28WAHAB%29%5B4%5D.pdf" target="_blank" data-tracking="mpos=&amp;mid=&amp;lindex=&amp;lcol=">a letter</a> to Newsom on Tuesday asking him to veto the bill. The senators claimed that the bill would “not only target and racially profile South Asian Californians, but will put other California residents and businesses at risk and jeopardize our state’s innovative edge.”</p>
<p>The bill also received pushback from two of Wahab’s progressive colleagues in the Assembly, and was amended to make the word “caste” less prominent in the law.</p>
<p>Seattle was the first city to pass a caste discrimination ordinance earlier this year, and Fresno last month was the first city in California to do so.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A long-lost Amazon documentary described as “the holy grail of Brazilian silent cinema” has been rediscovered nearly a century after it went missing.</p><p><em>Amazonas, </em><em>Maior Rio do </em><em>Mundo </em>(Amazon: Longest River in the World)was stolen from the original director, Silvino Santos, shortly after it was made in 1918. Just over a decade later, it had completely disappeared. The film resurfaced earlier this year in a Czech archive and was identified by specialists in Italy and Brazil.</p><p>“It’s basically a miracle,” said Sávio Stoco, the Brazilian expert on Santos who confirmed the discovery. “We didn’t have the slightest hope that this work would one day be found.”</p><p>A Portuguese-born cinematographer who spent most of his life in the Amazon, Santos was one of the main non-fiction film-makers of early 20th century Brazilian cinema. He is best remembered for his 1922 documentary <em>No </em><em>Paiz das Amazonas</em> (In the Country of the Amazons), which experts read as an attempted remake of his lost production.</p><p>The 1918 film is considered a rare gem of Brazilian cinematography for its length, subject matter, and quality of composition. Featuring fascinating footage of the Amazon forest’s diverse landscapes and inhabitants – including some of the earliest known moving images of the Indigenous Witoto people – the feature-length film “mixes different dimensions of the documentary genre into a very enjoyable narrative for the viewer”, explains Stoco, a professor of visual arts at the federal university of Pará in Belém.</p><figure id="06f00dee-1395-4db3-9447-a2d986d6a0d8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A still from Amazonas, Maior Rio do Mundo (Amazon: Longest River in the World) by the director Silvino Santos." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="352.69041218637994" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The 1918 film is considered a gem of Brazilian cinematography for its length, subject matter, and quality of composition.</span> Photograph: Národní filmový archiv, Prague</figcaption></figure><p>Santos takes his audience on a remarkably detailed journey through the Amazon, alternating close-up shots of caimans, jaguars and tropical flora with footage of Indigenous rituals and longer sequences showcasing the region’s extractive industries: rubber, the Brazil nut, timber, fishing, even the egret feathers that were a staple of women’s fashion at the time.</p><p>The lost documentary gained mythical status in Brazil with the story of its disappearance, which was recorded by Santos in an unpublished memoir written shortly before his death in 1969.</p><p>Shot over three years in the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon, the film vanished before it could be screened in Brazil and bankrupted its Manaus-based production company.

<p dir="auto">This project covers two intertwined use cases:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Continuous and regular dumps of one or all <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" rel="nofollow">PostgreSQL</a> databases at a given
host in a format that permits recovery in case of disasters.  This is
<code>backup.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Continuous and regular copying of these dumps in a compressed form to a
(supposedly) remote directory in order to facilitate offsite backup and
recovery in case of disasters. This is <code>offsite.sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The project is tuned for usage within a Dockerised environment and each tool
described below performs only one backup or compression.  Typical scenarios will
periodically restart containers based on this image using a host-wide cron-like
daemon such as <a href="https://github.com/efrecon/dockron">dockron</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-example" dir="auto"><a href="#example">Example</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">An example <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" rel="nofollow">compose</a> file is provided as a plausible real-life scenario.  The
file <code>docker-compose.yml</code> starts up the following containers:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>db</code>, an instance of the PostgreSQL database.</li>
<li><code>pgbackup</code>, which runs <code>backup.sh</code> once and will perform a backup of all
databases when it starts.</li>
<li><code>davbackup</code>, which runs <code>offsite.sh</code> once and will copy the latest backup to
another volume in compressed form. This could be a WebDAV mounted volume,
even though it isn't since this is just an example.</li>
<li><code>pulse</code>, runs an instance of <code>efrecon/dockron</code> and will restart the two
previous containers from time to time so they can regularly perform their
operations.</li>

that it will be able to properly terminate sub-processes when stopping the

<p dir="auto">In a typical Docker environment, database initialisation takes time. This means
that depending on the database container will not be enough. The Docker image
for this project provides a <a href="https://gist.github.com/efrecon/86456960e2110b287632fd7f42c1cd31">script</a> aiming at waiting for the connection to the
postgres database to be responsive. How to perform this and chain it behind
<code>tini</code> is exemplified in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.</p>

</article><h2>A
religious offering?</h2><p>Archaeologists
have found five gold foil figures in the last couple of weeks.</p><p>Three of
them were found where the wall of the temple once
stood. Two of them were found in separate post holes.</p><p>Finding a gold
foil figure is spectacular and rare in itself. But the five gold foil figures that
were found at Hov this time offer something extra: They were found and
excavated where they were most likely originally placed. Knowing where something
was once placed helps archaeologists understand more.</p><p>“It’s extra
special that we can link the gold foil figures to the various parts of the
building's construction,” Stene says.</p><p>The many gold
foil figures found here earlier were discovered in and around another post hole
in the old temple, on the opposite side of the two that recently appeared.</p><p> It's possible that some of the gold foil figures they found here earlier were also placed in the wall, but there's uncertainty about exactly where they were once found. Now, with these three that we found under the actual structure of the wall, it's clear that they were intentionally placed there before the wall's construction," Stene says.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">One of the
theories about what the gold foil figures were used for is that they may have
served as a form of <span data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">admission ticket</span> to a temple like the one that once stood here at Hov. </p>
<p>But an admission ticket doesn’t lie under a wall.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Modern
excavation has provided more knowledge about this,” Stene says. “The gold foil
figures in the post hole were not visible to people. Those we found in the wall
would also not have been visible to others. So this doesn't appear to be an admission ticket, but rather an offering or a religious act to protect the building."</p><figure data-element-guid="58a219f5-cf93-409e-8b56-de3378926276">

<h2>A small,
but prominent pagan temple</h2><p>The temple at
Hov was discovered by pure chance in 1993. County conservator Harald Jacobsen drove
along the E6 and noticed the soil. He thought it looked like what
archaeologists call cultural layers, meaning soil where traces of humans are
found. A small investigation proved that he was right, and the finding of two gold
foil figures indicated that this was no ordinary place.</p>



<!-- placeholder(#1) -->


<p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">Smaller
excavations during the 2000s led to the discovery of 28 gold foil figures, and
what is referred to as a temple, a house for pagan religious practices.</p><p>One of the
reasons archaeologists believe this was a temple, besides the gold foil figures,
is the absence of other finds that would be natural if people lived there, like
cooking pots and whetstones.&nbsp;</p><p>A proper
excavation of the area had to wait until this year, in connection with the E6
Roterud-Storhove road project. Throughout the autumn and winter, C14 dating
will finally determine if it is true that the temple has stood here since
around the year 600 – and right up to the 11th century.</p><p>“Based on what we have interpreted as post holes, it's not unreasonable to think that a building has stood here that has looked the same for several hundred years. That's not a problem, as long as you maintain the building by
replacing the load-bearing posts as they rot,” Stene says. </p><p>With its
15–16 metres in length, the house is small. Residential homes of the time could
easily be 20-30 metres long.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Because it’s
relatively small, we believe the structure served a solely ritualistic function,” says
Stene. “It probably wasn't where they had their feasts. Those were likely held in a larger hall, but maybe they had drinking ceremonies here. Maybe it was just the select circle in society, the elite, who were allowed to enter."</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">The&nbsp;archaeologists also believe the building was fairly tall.&nbsp;</p><p>“It
probably stood out in the landscape. If you came to Mjøsa by boat, it was
probably clearly visible,” Stene says. </p><figure data-element-guid="de9f3460-1756-4414-a618-5c61db98a1ed">

</article><h2>Gold foil
figures in buildings</h2><p>Ingunn
Marit Røstad, archaeologist at the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, is an expert on the
Merovingian period in Norway and gold foil figures. She also believes there are
more gold foil figures out there.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Bornholm
is very special, even in Denmark. There aren't that many other find sites
there,” Røstad points out.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">There are
also other regional differences: In Denmark, there are more individual
figures, whereas in Norway and Sweden, it is mostly couples that are
depicted. </p><p>“But more of these small pieces of gold keep appearing. Either through excavation or with metal detectors. So, more
could pop up in various places in Norway as well,” she says.</p><p>Due to the continuous new finds, the number of gold foil figures must be regularly updated. The latest numbers Røstad has from 2019 indicate that a total of 3,243 gold foil figures
have been found in Scandinavia – 2,708 of them on Bornholm.</p><p>Røstad also
points out that what’s especially unique about the new gold foil figures from
Hov is that they were found in the ground, where they lay. Archaeologists call
it context – the place where something is found is part of the story.</p><p>“Of all the
thousands of gold foil figures we have, only a few have been found on-site and
excavated,” Røstad says. “So, it’s extremely valuable that we get good context
for the finds from Hov.”</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">What stands
out when gold foil figures are actually excavated – as opposed to just being randomly
found in a field – is that archaeologists find them in association with
buildings.</p><figure data-element-guid="584a4b0f-0a19-41ae-b357-e844b875ddc5">

<h2>Pictures
of the elite</h2><p>Røstad does
not place much stock in the theory that the gold foil figures were admission tickets to the temple.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">They do not
have holes suggesting that they were sewn onto clothing, and apart from a few
exceptions from Bornholm, they do not have&nbsp;fastenings suggesting
they are jewellery.</p><p>They are
dated to the Merovingian period due to the style of clothing and jewellery depicted
on the men and women. </p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“People assume
that they’re showing the elite’s clothing during this period,” Røstad says. “A
sort of idealised depiction of elite clothing, featuring the elaborate hairstyle
that the women have with a distinctive knot. You also see beads, special types of brooches, drinking cups, and drinking horns, which date them to the Merovingian
period.”</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">A common
interpretation of the gold foil figures is that they have some sort of ritual
significance. Many believe that the couple depicted is the god Frøy and the goddess Gerd. Perhaps the gold foil figures were part of a symbolic act
when people celebrated weddings?</p><figure data-element-guid="53d29dd6-915a-47cf-b8db-a61d421a19e3">

<h2>Of divine
lineage?</h2><p>Another
interpretation deals with the idea that the most powerful families of this time
claimed they could trace their lineage back to the gods, and that the gold foil
figures in some way signaled that they were of divine lineage.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“This was
used to legitimise ruling; you were a leading family because you were descended
from the gods,” Røstad says. “Even though they’re tiny, the gold foil figures could
have been very significant. Not as jewellery worn visibly to show status, but
perhaps they were part of some kind of ritual placement at the high seat
where the king or jarl sat.” </p><p>The first gold
foil figures were found in 1725. In a text from 1791, they were referred to as ‘gullgubber’
(golden old men), and the name just stuck. Even though the vast majority of them actually depict both a man and a woman.</p><p>———</p><p>Translated by Alette Bjordal Gjellesvik.</p><p><a href="https://forskning.no/arkeologi/gullskatt-funnet-utenfor-lillehammer-blir-ikke-stort-mer-spektakulaert-enn-dette/2252591">Read

			Have you ever wanted to test (from the command line) whether a port on another machine can be reached from yours? When some app of your can't seem to connect to a given port, you may want to test things from the command line. (The problem may be that the service using that port has stopped or is blocked by a firewall--it may be that you're mistaken in the port you are trying to use, or perhaps even the ip address, domain name, or machine name.)    </p><p>
There are in fact many tools which can help with this task, some of which will be familiar to those on *nix systems, but Windows users who've been around a while (or who learned from such folks) may try to rely on the good ol' telnet command (as in <i>telnet <machine> <port></port></machine></i>). Unfortunately, they often find out how <b>Microsoft has disabled that tool by default for over a decade</b> (since Windows Vista), and while it <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/enable-telnet-windows/">can be easily enabled</a>, they may be prevented or understandably reluctant to do that.    </p><p>
In this post, I want to show a couple of command-line alternatives which can do the job easily, <b>one best suited for powershell users (Test-NetConnection)</b>, and and two of which would suit those who prefer the command line (cmd) and which are now built-into Windows (the past few years): <b>ssh and curl</b>. No, this is not their primary job but they will suit for this task and it may surprise some to learn they're even built-in options. I'll conclude with still other options available to those on *nix environments (who of course can also use ssh and curl), especially nc (netcat). </p><p> Topics:  </p><ul>  <li><a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/ps">Option 1) Powershell's nifty Test-NetConnection</a></li><a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/ps">  </a><li><a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/ps"></a><a href="#win">Yes, Windows has included ssh and curl for a few years!</a></li>  <li><a href="#curl">Option 2) Using curl to test connectivity to a port</a>, including how the curl command responds if the port CANNOT or CAN be reached</li>  <li><a href="#ssh">Option 3) Using ssh to test connectivity to a port</a>, including how that command responds in those cases</li>  <li><a href="#other">Using other cli tools on Linux, Unix, MacOS</a></li>  <li><a href="#why">On understanding WHY the port being checked could not be reached</a></li>  </ul>    <h2 id="ps">Option 1) Powershell's nifty Test-NetConnection</h2>    <p>
<b>Update:</b> this first section has been added since my original post. Thanks to Mark Gregory for <a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/testing_port_reachability_with_other_than_telnet#c3D1D347A-C432-43A4-B9FC06F0CDF4EB1A">his kind comment suggesting it</a>.    </p><p>
If you're a powershell user (or are ok using it, even if you favor still using the traditional Windows CMD for the command line), there's a nice cmdlet that can do this task of testing a connection to a port, Test-NetConnection, as in:    </p><p>Test-NetConnection <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span> -port <span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Of course, <i>machine</i> can be an ip address, domain name, machine name, etc., and it need not be a machine other than yours: it can be your own.      </p><p>
So for instance, someone might test if their SQL Server was reachable on the machine "dbserver" at port 1433 using:    </p><p>Test-NetConnection dbserver -port 1433</p>    <p>
The UI of the tool will appear as it tries to connect, and regardless of its results, in the end it will report true or false, as in:  </p><p>Response includes TcpTestSucceeded: True</p>    <p>
For some readers, that's really all you need to hear and you can stop. For those interested to learn more (who may want to propose other alternatives), please do read on.    </p><h2>What about the long delay if the port is NOT open</h2>    <p>
You may notice that this Test-NetConnection cmdlet will hang if the port on the machine trying to be reached is not available. That hang-time is as much about your a TCP timeout set at the OS level for your machine (from which you're running the test.) I discuss this more later with regard to curl and ssh (which offer options to override that timeout).    </p><p>
Sadly, at this writing, there's no option to override that timeout for Test-NetConnection. (Others have noticed and raised the concern. See <a href="https://copdips.com/2019/09/fast-tcp-port-check-in-powershell.html">this post</a> for a couple of powershell approaches addressing this issue.)    </p><h2>Other ways do exist to test connectivity to such specific apps</h2>    <p>
<b>Update:</b> I previously had these few paragraphs in the next section, but I am moving them up to here because they're natural questions following the example I've offered, which I also use for the other variants below.    </p><p>
And yes, I'm well aware that there are other means by which one could test connectivity to something like SQL Server (or mysql or redis, etc.) from the commandline, using dedicated tools offered for each. The point of this post was to present approaches that works with ANY service whose port accessibility you're checking.    </p><p>
Finally, I'm also aware that there are other ways to find what ports are open on a given machine (port scanning tools) as well as whether and what ports are open on your machine, such as via good ol' netstat or UI tools like curports, to the more modern tool built into Windows (since Vista) called Resource Monitor. The focus here is again on a cli approach to test the accessibility of a port on any machine--versus finding if its one of many open ports, valuable though that info may be.    </p><p>
Anyway, moving on, for those who may still favor CMD (the command prompt) over powershell, you won't find it offering that nifty Test-NetConnection (though again you can call powershell commands from cmd). Instead, you may find some comfort in using curl or ssh, instead, which are covered in the remainder of this post.     </p><h2 id="win">Yes, Windows has included ssh and curl for a few years!</h2>    <p>
So as for ssh and curl, let me point out first some news which may have been missed by many (including those who try to help others or who write about IT matters). You don't NEED to "install putty" anymore: <b><u>Windows has included ssh (an openssh client) for a few years, since later versions of Windows 10 and Server 2019</u></b>.  And the same is true of curl (a command-line browser).    </p><p>
If you want to confirm this, just open a Windows command prompt and type ssh (it should be found within your Windows path, and so should run), which will return brief help for the command. Same with curl!    </p><p>
Now granted, I realize that using curl or ssh to test the availability of a port (especially on another server) is not the real purpose of those tools--any more than it was the purpose of telnet. But the point is that these generally do "work" well, so they're  tools to consider for one's arsenal. And again, I'll cover other tools that you may be able to obtain or find in some Linux distros (or MacOS or Unix) at the end of this post.    </p><p>
Considering also that you find either curl or ssh to suit you better for some situations, I will discuss them both. And I could have presented either one first. I offer curl first as some may be more comfortable with that, if they don't have much experience with ssh. Again the key point is that both these tools should be available to everyone reading this, unless they're on very old deployments of Windows.    </p><h2 id="curl">Option 2) Using curl to test connectivity to a port</h2>    <p>
So let's look first at using curl to test if a port can be reached (though really, I'd recommend option 1 above or option 3 below, for reasons which will become clear):    </p><p>curl <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>:<span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Note there's a colon between the machine and the port.  Again, <i>machine</i> could be an ip address, domain name, machine name, etc.     </p><p>
So for instance, someone might test if their SQL Server was reachable on the machine "dbserver" at port 1433 using:    </p><p>curl dbserver:1433</p>    <p>
So let's talk about what one may see depending on whether the connection via curl can or cannot be made. Of course, normally one uses curl to visit a given page on a given site, but again we're just "hacking" it to have it try to merely connect.     </p><h2>How the curl command responds if the port CANNOT be reached, and dealing with hang time</h2>    <p>
If somehow that machine (or ip address or domain name) cannot be reached, the request will hang (more on that in a moment) and then the curl command will respond with this error:    </p><p>curl: (<span>28</span>) Failed to connect to <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>: <span>&lt;port&gt;</span> after <span>&lt;duration&gt;</span>: ms: Couldn't connect to server</p>    <p>
The key is that this tells us that that the port could not be reached. (As for "why not", neither curl nor ssh can help with that. I discuss that at the end.)    </p><p>
As for this "hang time" waiting to connect, this is something telnet did also. The amount of time it will wait is technically defined by your OS, and is known generically as the TCP timeout time.  A difference with curl versus telnet is that you CAN control how long you're willing for the curl command to await using the command's optional <i>connect-timeout</i> flag, as in the following example to set a 1-second timeout:    </p><p>curl --connect-timeout 1 <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>:<span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Finally, if you find it does not stop trying to connect within the number of seconds indicated, do beware that the curl tool may be attempting different additional connections than you may realize. Add the -v arg to the command, to see more verbose output, including details of the connections it's attempting.    </p><p>curl -v --connect-timeout 1 <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>:<span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
So that's how the tool can tell us (or be tweaked regarding) the failure to connect. Let's move on to what it may show if it CAN connect.    </p><h2>How the curl command responds if the port CAN be reached</h2>    <p>
Remembering that curl is first and foremost a command-line http client, if the connection is successful AND there's a web server on the other end (with a default web page to satisfy this request), <b>the command will respond showing us the output of the page</b>, whatever it is. :-) Or if it does not exist, it will perhaps show the content returned in the form of some sort of 404 error page. (And yes, there are ways to pipe its output to a file or the bit bucket, but I leave you to check out the docs for that.)    </p><p>
If instead the port being tested could be reached but it is NOT for a web server (which may be more common for folks seeking to "test a port's accessibility"), then the curl command will respond (immediately) with an error:    </p><p>curl: (<span>52</span>) Empty reply from server</p>    <p>
And <b>given that our goal again is just to know if the port can be reached, there's value in getting that immediate error: the port CAN be reached.</b>    </p><p>
(Another beneficial difference of this over the old telnet approach is that with that, a successful connection would show a blank screen if the connection, awaiting commands. You'd have to know telnet keystrokes and commands to break out of that, or you might close the terminal window if testing the port was your only reason for opening it.)    </p><p>
But maybe you feel itchy about using curl for this task. Well, if you can be persuaded, there is again the alternative of using ssh...    </p><h2 id="ssh">Option 3) Using ssh to test connectivity to a port</h2>    <p>
As for using ssh to test if a port can be reached, you could do something like this:  </p><p>ssh -p <span>&lt;port&gt;</span> <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Again, <i>machine</i> could be an ip address, domain name, machine name, etc.  (And those two values of machine and port are indeed the reverse order of both the curl above and the traditional telnet.)      </p><h2>How the ssh command responds if the port CANNOT be reached, and dealing with hang time</h2>    <p>
If the port CANNOT be reached, then (like with curl and telnet) the command will hang for an extended period of time before failing with an error like:  </p><p>ssh: connect to host <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>  port <span>&lt;port&gt;</span>: Connection timed out</p>    <p>
So with my example above, I'd receive this if SQL Server was not listening or inaccessible:  </p><p>ssh: connect to host dbserver port 1433: Connection timed out</p>    <p>
And as in the case of curl, if you want to override that long TCP timeout time for your OS, you can do that with the command's optional ConnectTimeout flag. The following to set a 1-second timeout:    </p><p>ssh -o ConnectTimeout=1  -p <span>&lt;port&gt;</span> <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span></p>    <p>
(And as with curl, if you find it does not stop trying to connect within the number of seconds indicated, do beware that the ssh tool may be attempting different connections than you realize. add the -v arg to the command, to see more details of the connections it's attempting.)    </p><p>
Again, as for "why" it can't be reached, see the end of this port for ideas to consider.    </p><h2>How the ssh command responds if the port CAN be reached</h2>    <p>
If on the other hand the port CAN be reached, the ssh command <b>will respond immediately</b>, which is nice. And that's what makes this (like curl) indeed a helpful tool (.     </p><p>
That said, note that if the port you're checking is technically not an ssh port, the command will also report an "error":   </p><p>kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host</p>    <p>
In the case of using the command for this test of port connectivity, we can ignore that error. Again, <b>at least this confirms that the port could be reached, which was our primary goal.</b>    </p><h2 id="other">Using other cli tools on Linux, Unix, MacOS</h2>    <p>
Before wrapping up this post, I mentioned at the open how this this technique may appeal to Windows users more than those on *nix OS's, as they not only already have long had the two tools above, but they have still other tools they can use for this task of testing for whether a port can be reached, such as  netcat/nc, which could handle this just as simply:    </p><p>nc -zv <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span> <span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
And as for port-scanning (the broader process of determining what ports are open on a given machine), there is the classic (and powerful) nmap command, but it's beyond the scope of this post (as its related tool ncat, which is not the same as netcat above).    </p><h2 id="why">On understanding WHY the port being checked could not be reached</h2>    <p>
Finally, I realize some may wonder how to know WHY a port can't be reached, but neither of these tools can help with that: they merely respond one way if the port CAN be reached and another if it cannot.     </p><p>
As I noted at the opening, the reach a port may not be open is that the service you're trying to reach is not enabled. Or maybe there's a firewall blocking access to it (which blocking could be specific to your machine from you are attempting to make the connection). There may be a firewall in the OS of the machine you're talking to, or one that's been installed there as software, or there may be one on the network you're connecting to, etc.    </p><p>
Or you may simply have the wrong value for the port you are testing, or the ip address, domain name, machine name, etc.     </p><p>
Before we wrap up, note that sometimes you may find that a given machine can be identified any of many different ways--such that a port may be "open" to you if you try a way that's different from what you're trying (so try an ip address if you have a domain name, or vice-versa, or perhaps try a subdomain if you know of one, and so on).    </p><p>
Often, you will need to get on the server itself (which you can't reach) and attempt these or other tools THERE, to find out if the port is correct in the first place.    </p><h2>Conclusion</h2>    <p>
I hope I've helped you see how curl and ssh (and nc) can be handy tools to have in your arsenal, when you just want to quickly test port accessibility from the commandline. For those on Windows, you can stop trying to install telnet to do a quick port test: just use curl or ssh! :-) That was really the primary motivation of my post here.    </p><p>
And let me know how it goes.    </p><p>
Indeed, this is one of those topics where there may be dark corners, edge cases, and unexpected situations where results differ. I'm sure some people have more experience to share, whether other gotchas or tips, or still other tools that may be built-in to Windows or *nix. As for other tools one might obtain, those are less interesting as again the post here is about built-in tools, because often people are working in environments (especially on servers or containers) where they're not necessarily free to/wanting to install software.    </p><p>
