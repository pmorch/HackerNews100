            <span>Abstract:</span>Pig-butchering scams have emerged as a complex form of fraud that combines elements of romance, investment fraud, and advanced social engineering tactics to systematically exploit victims. In this paper, we present the first qualitative analysis of pig-butchering scams, informed by in-depth semi-structured interviews with $N=26$ victims. We capture nuanced, first-hand accounts from victims, providing insight into the lifecycle of pig-butchering scams and the complex emotional and financial manipulation involved. We systematically analyze each phase of the scam, revealing that perpetrators employ tactics such as staged trust-building, fraudulent financial platforms, fabricated investment returns, and repeated high-pressure tactics, all designed to exploit victims' trust and financial resources over extended periods. Our findings reveal an organized scam lifecycle characterized by emotional manipulation, staged financial exploitation, and persistent re-engagement efforts that amplify victim losses. We also find complex psychological and financial impacts on victims, including heightened vulnerability to secondary scams. Finally, we propose actionable intervention points for social media and financial platforms to curb the prevalence of these scams and highlight the need for non-stigmatizing terminology to encourage victims to report and seek assistance.

        <p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&amp;ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">3Blue1Brown video series</a> on transformer models, Grant Sanderson posed a fascinating question: How can a relatively modest embedding space of 12,288 dimensions (GPT-3) accommodate millions of distinct real-world concepts? </p><p>The answer lies at the intersection of high-dimensional geometry and a remarkable mathematical result known as the <a href="https://stanford.edu/class/cs114/readings/JL-Johnson.pdf?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma</a>. While exploring this question, I discovered something unexpected that led to an interesting collaboration with Grant and a deeper understanding of vector space geometry. </p><p>The key insight begins with a simple observation: while an N-dimensional space can only hold N perfectly orthogonal vectors, relaxing this constraint to allow for "quasi-orthogonal" relationships (vectors at angles of, say, 85-95 degrees) dramatically increases the space's capacity. This property is crucial for understanding how language models can efficiently encode semantic meaning in relatively compact embedding spaces.</p><p>In Grant's video, he demonstrated this principle with an experiment attempting to fit 10,000 unit vectors into a 100-dimensional space while maintaining near-orthogonal relationships. The visualization suggested success, showing angles clustered between 89-91 degrees. However, when I implemented the code myself, I noticed something interesting about the optimization process.</p><p>The original loss function was elegantly simple: </p><div><p>               loss = (dot_products.abs()).relu().sum()</p><p>While this loss function appears perfect for an unbounded ℝᴺ space, it encounters two subtle but critical issues when applied to vectors constrained to a high-dimensional unit sphere:</p></div><ol><li><strong>The Gradient Trap</strong>: The dot product between vectors is the cosine of the angle between them, and the gradient is the sine of this angle. This creates a perverse incentive structure: when vectors approach the desired 90-degree relationship, the gradient (sin(90°) = 1.0) strongly pushes toward improvement. However, when vectors drift far from the goal (near 0° or 180°), the gradient (sin(0°) ≈ 0) vanishes—effectively trapping these badly aligned vectors in their poor configuration.</li><li><strong>The 99% Solution</strong>: The optimizer discovered a statistically favorable but geometrically perverse solution. For each vector, it would be properly orthogonal to 9,900 out of 9,999 other vectors while being nearly parallel to just 99. This configuration, while clearly not the intended outcome, actually represented a global minimum for the loss function—mathematically similar to taking 100 orthogonal basis vectors and replicating each one roughly 100 times.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1169" height="624" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png 1169w"></figure><p>This stable configuration was particularly insidious because it satisfied 99% of the constraints while being fundamentally different from the desired constellation of evenly spaced, quasi-orthogonal vectors. To address this, I modified the loss function to use an exponential penalty that increases aggressively as dot products grow:</p><p>               loss = exp(20*dot_products.abs()**2).sum()         (<a href="https://github.com/NickYoder86/Johnson-Lindenstrauss?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">Full code here</a>)</p><p>This change produced the desired behavior, though with a revealing result: the maximum achievable pairwise angle was around 76.5 degrees, not 89 degrees. </p><p>This discovery led me down a fascinating path exploring the fundamental limits of vector packing in high-dimensional spaces, and how these limits relate to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma.</p><p>When I shared these findings with Grant, his response exemplified the collaborative spirit that makes the mathematics community so rewarding. He not only appreciated the technical correction but invited me to share these insights with the 3Blue1Brown audience. This article is that response, expanded to explore the broader implications of these geometric properties for machine learning and dimensionality reduction.</p><h2 id="the-johnson-lindenstrauss-lemma-a-geometric-guarantee">The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma: A Geometric Guarantee</h2><p>At its core, the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma makes a remarkable promise: you can project points from an arbitrarily high-dimensional space into a surprisingly low-dimensional space while preserving their relative distances with high probability. What makes this result particularly striking is that the required dimensionality of the low-dimensional space grows only logarithmically with the number of points you want to project.</p><p>Formally, the lemma states that for an error factor ε (between 0 and 1), and any set of N points in a high-dimensional space, there exists a projection into k dimensions where for any two points u and v in the original space, their projections f(u) and f(v) in the lower dimensional space satisfy:</p><p>(1 - ε)||u - v||² ≤ ||f(u) - f(v)||² ≤ (1 + ε)||u - v||²</p><p>The number of dimensions (k) required to guarantee these error bounds is given by:</p><p>k ≥ O(log(N)/ε²)</p><p>The "Big O" notation can be replaced with a concrete constant C:</p><p>k ≥ (C/ε²) * log(N)</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li>k is the target dimension</li><li>N is the number of points</li><li>ε is the maximum allowed distortion</li><li>C is a constant that determines the probability of success</li></ul><p>While most practitioners use values between 4 and 8 as a conservative choice for <a href="http://www.yaroslavvb.com/papers/achlioptas-database.pdf?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">random projections</a>, the optimal value of C remains an open question. As we'll see in the experimental section, engineered projections can achieve much lower values of C, with profound implications for embedding space capacity.</p><p>The fascinating history of this result speaks to the interconnected nature of mathematical discovery. Johnson and Lindenstrauss weren't actually trying to solve a dimensionality reduction problem – they stumbled upon this property while working on extending Lipschitz functions in Banach spaces. Their 1984 paper turned out to be far more influential in computer science than in their original domain.</p><h2 id="from-theory-to-practice-two-domains-of-application">From Theory to Practice: Two Domains of Application</h2><p>The JL lemma finds practical application in two distinct but equally important domains:</p><ol><li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction</strong>: Consider an e-commerce platform like Amazon, where each customer's preferences might be represented by a vector with millions of dimensions (one for each product). Direct computation with such vectors would be prohibitively expensive. The JL lemma tells us we can project this data into a much lower-dimensional space – perhaps just a thousand dimensions – while preserving the essential relationships between customers. This makes previously intractable computations feasible on a single GPU, enabling real-time customer relationship management and inventory planning.</li><li><strong>Embedding Space Capacity</strong>: This application is more subtle but equally powerful. Rather than actively projecting vectors, we're interested in understanding how many distinct concepts can naturally coexist in a fixed-dimensional space. This is where our experiments provide valuable insight into the practical limits of embedding space capacity.</li></ol><p>Let's consider what we mean by "concepts" in an embedding space. Language models don't deal with perfectly orthogonal relationships – real-world concepts exhibit varying degrees of similarity and difference. Consider these examples of words chosen at random:</p><ul><li>"Archery" shares some semantic space with "precision" and "sport"</li><li>"Fire" overlaps with both "heat" and "passion"</li><li>"Gelatinous" relates to physical properties and food textures</li><li>"Southern-ness" encompasses culture, geography, and dialect</li><li>"Basketball" connects to both athletics and geometry</li><li>"Green" spans color perception and environmental consciousness</li><li>"Altruistic" links moral philosophy with behavioral patterns</li></ul><p>The beauty of high-dimensional spaces is that they can accommodate these nuanced, partial relationships while maintaining useful geometric properties for computation and inference.</p><h2 id="empirical-investigation-of-embedding-capacity">Empirical Investigation of Embedding Capacity</h2><p>When we move from random projections to engineered solutions, the theoretical bounds for C of the JL lemma become surprisingly conservative. While a <a href="https://documents.uow.edu.au/~jennie/WEBPDF/175_1992.pdf?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">Hadamard matrix transformation</a> with random elements can reliably achieve a C value between 2.5 and 4 in a single pass, our GPU experiments suggest even more efficient arrangements are possible through optimization.</p><p>To explore these limits, I implemented a series of experiments projecting standard basis vectors into spaces of varying dimensionality. Using GPU acceleration, I tested combinations of N (number of vectors) up to 30,000 and k (embedding dimensions) up to 10,000, running each optimization for 50,000 iterations. The results reveal some fascinating patterns:</p><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1316" height="262" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png 1316w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption><span>Experimental values of C (GPU optimization)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Several key observations emerge from this data:</p><ol><li>The value of C initially rises with N, reaching a maximum around ~0.9 (notably always below 1.0)</li><li>After peaking, C begins a consistent downward trend</li><li>At high ratios of N to K, we observe C values trend below 0.2</li></ol><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1164" height="624" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png 1164w"><figcaption><span>C values for different dimensions K plotted against increasing N vectors</span></figcaption></figure><p>This behavior likely relates to an interesting property of high-dimensional geometry: as dimensionality increases, sphere packing becomes more efficient when the spheres are small relative to the unit sphere. This suggests that our observed upper bounds on C might still be conservative for very large numbers of concepts.</p><h2 id="practical-implications-for-language-models">Practical Implications for Language Models</h2><p>Let's consider three scenarios for the constant C:</p><ol><li>C = 4: A conservative choice for random projections with Hadamard matrices</li><li>C = 1: A likely upper bound for optimized or emergent embeddings</li><li>C = 0.2: A value suggested by our experiments for very large spaces</li></ol><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1037" height="249" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png 1037w"><figcaption><span>Number of possible vectors ranging from "Efficient random projection C=4" to "Optimized projection C=0.2"</span></figcaption></figure><p>The implications of these geometric properties are staggering. Let's consider a simple way to estimate how many quasi-orthogonal vectors can fit in a k-dimensional space. If we define F as the degrees of freedom from orthogonality (90° - desired angle), we can approximate the number of vectors as:</p><p>Vectors ≈ 10^(k * F² / 1500)</p><p>where:</p><ul><li>k is the embedding dimension</li><li>F is the degrees of "freedom" from orthogonality (e.g., F = 3 for 87° angles)</li></ul><p>Applying this to GPT-3's 12,288-dimensional embedding space reveals its extraordinary capacity:</p><ul><li>At 89° (F = 1): approximately 10^8 vectors</li><li>At 88° (F = 2): approximately 10^32 vectors</li><li>At 87° (F = 3): approximately 10^73 vectors</li><li>At 85° (F = 5): more than 10^200 vectors</li></ul><p>To put this in perspective, even the conservative case of 86° angles provides capacity far exceeding the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe (~10^80). This helps explain how language models can maintain rich, nuanced relationships between millions of concepts while working in relatively modest embedding dimensions.</p><h2 id="practical-applications-and-future-directions">Practical Applications and Future Directions</h2><p>The insights from this investigation have two major practical implications:</p><ol><li><strong>Efficient Dimensionality Reduction</strong>: The robustness of random projections, particularly when combined with Hadamard transformations (or <a href="https://www.ece.unb.ca/tervo/ece4253/bch.shtml?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">BCH coding</a>), provides a computationally efficient way to work with high-dimensional data. No complex optimization required – the mathematics of high-dimensional spaces does the heavy lifting for us.</li><li><strong>Embedding Space Design</strong>: Understanding the true capacity of high-dimensional spaces helps explain how transformer models can maintain rich, nuanced representations of language in relatively compact embeddings. Concepts like "Canadian," "morose," "Hitchcockian," "handsome," "whimsical," and "Muppet-like" can all find their place in the geometry while preserving their subtle relationships to each other.</li></ol><p>This research suggests that current embedding dimensions (1,000-20,000) provide more than adequate capacity for representing human knowledge and reasoning. The challenge lies not in the capacity of these spaces but in learning the optimal arrangement of concepts within them.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/NickYoder86/Johnson-Lindenstrauss?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">My code for Hadamard and optimized projections</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>What began as an investigation into a subtle optimization issue has led us to a deeper appreciation of high-dimensional geometry and its role in modern machine learning.

                                                                                                                                    <p>Cannabis use is increasing globally with an estimated 219 million users (4.3% of the global adult population) in 2021, but its long-term metabolic effects remain unknown. While some studies have suggested potential anti-inflammatory or weight management properties, others have raised concerns regarding glucose metabolism and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+resistance/" rel="tag">insulin resistance</a>, and the magnitude of the risk of developing diabetes hasn't been clear.</p>
<p>To strengthen the evidence base, Dr. Ibrahim Kamel from the Boston Medical Center, Massachusetts, U.S. and colleagues analyzed <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag">electronic health records</a> from 54 health care organizations (TriNetX Research Network, with centers from across U.S. and Europe) to identify 96,795 outpatients (aged between 18 and 50 years, 52.5% female) with cannabis-related diagnoses (ranging from occasional use to dependence, including cases of intoxication and withdrawal) between 2010 and 2018.</p>
<p>They were matched with 4,160,998 healthy individuals (with no record of substance use or major chronic conditions) based on age, sex, and underlying illnesses at the start of the study, and followed for five years.</p>
<p>After controlling HDL and LDL cholesterol, uncontrolled high blood pressure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cocaine use, alcohol use and several other lifestyle risk factors, the researchers found that new cases of diabetes were significantly higher in the cannabis group (1,937; 2.2%) compared to the healthy group (518; 0.6%), with statistical analysis showing cannabis users at nearly four times the risk of developing diabetes compared to non-users.</p>

                                                                                                        
    
                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>While the authors note that more research is needed to fully explain the association between cannabis and diabetes, it may come down to insulin resistance and unhealthy dietary behaviors. Nevertheless, the study's results have immediate implications for metabolic monitoring practices and public health messaging.</p>
<p>"As cannabis becomes more widely available and socially accepted and legalized in various jurisdictions, it is essential to understand its potential health risks," said lead author Dr. Kamel.</p>
<p>"These new sights from reliable real-world evidence highlight the importance of integrating diabetes risk awareness into substance use disorder treatment and counseling, as well as the need for health care professionals to routinely talk to patients about <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cannabis+use/" rel="tag">cannabis use</a> so that they can understand their overall diabetes risk and potential need for metabolic monitoring."</p>
<p>The authors note that more research is needed on the long-term endocrine effects of cannabis use and whether diabetes risks are limited to inhaled products or other forms of cannabis such as edibles.</p>
<p>Despite the important findings, this is a retrospective study and cannot prove that cannabis use causes <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag">diabetes</a>, and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced the results despite efforts to reduce confounding bias via propensity score matching. This study has limitations due to a lack of detailed cannabis consumption data and potential misclassification.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that the inherent limitations of real-world data often result from inconsistent patient reporting in electronic medical records.</p>
<p>They also note that there is a risk of bias because of imprecise measures of cannabis exposure and the reliance on participants to accurately report any cannabis use, even when they lived in places where the drug is illegal.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p><strong>A new study from South Dakota State University reveals how grapevine canes can be converted into plastic-like material that is stronger than traditional plastic and will decompose in the environment in a relatively short amount of time.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote><p>The need for biodegradable packaging material has never been higher.</p><p>Currently, most packaging is "single use" and is made with plastic materials, derived from nonrenewable sources like crude oil that take hundreds of years to decompose in the environment. On top of this, only 9% of plastic is recycled. This has resulted in the formation of floating piles of plastic garbage in the ocean, called the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch."</p><p>But maybe even more concerning is the discovery of micro- and nano-plastics in the environment. Research has found that plastic breaks down into tiny particles, which are being ingested or inhaled by both humans and animals, and are found literally everywhere, including in the human body — according to recent research studies. Worse, little is known about the long-term health effects of microplastics.</p><p><a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/srinivas-janaswamy">Srinivas Janaswamy</a> is an associate professor in South Dakota State University's <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/dairy-food-science">Department of Dairy and Food Science</a>. His research has focused on developing value-added products through biowaste and agricultural byproducts. One of the overarching goals of Janaswamy's research is to tackle the plastic waste crisis.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Perhaps the biggest contributor to plastic waste, at least in the United States, is plastic bags, the kind found at most retail stores. These bags, while sometimes recycled, are often only used once and can be found littered throughout the environment.</p><p>To address this problem, Janaswamy is working toward developing a plastic-like bag that will decompose in the environment.</p><p>"That is my dream," Janaswamy said.</p><p>The key ingredient to Janaswamy's work? Cellulose. This biopolymer is the most abundant organic substance on Earth and is found, primarily, in the cell walls of plants. Cellulose, thanks to strong hydrogen bonds and a chain of glucose molecules, gives plants structural strength and rigidity along with other biopolymers such as mannan, xylose, hemicellulose and lignin.</p><p>Humans have long used cellulose to create products. Cotton, the material used to make a majority of the world’s clothing, is primarily composed of cellulose. Wood is rich in cellulose as well.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>In previous research, Janaswamy has extracted cellulose from agricultural products like <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2023/06/can-avocado-peels-help-curb-plastic-waste-problem">avocado peels</a>, <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2025/02/extending-shelf-life-fruits">soyhulls</a>, alfalfa, <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2023/12/sdsu-researcher-turning-switchgrass-bioplastics">switchgrass</a>, <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2023/09/could-spent-coffee-grounds-provide-alternative-plastic-packaging">spent coffee grounds</a>, corncob and <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2024/02/save-peels-how-bananas-can-be-used-fight-plastic-waste-crisis">banana peels</a>. He uses the extracted cellulose to develop films — materials that look and feel similar to traditional plastic wrapping.</p><p>"By extracting cellulose from agricultural products, value-added products can be created," Janaswamy said.</p><p>Each of Janaswamy's films has different characteristics and properties. Some are more transparent than others. Some are stronger. But thanks to a unique collaboration with a fellow SDSU faculty member, Janaswamy may have created his best value-added product yet.</p><h2><strong>Grapevine canes</strong></h2><p>Janaswamy had just finished presenting “Ag Biomass – A Holy Grail to Clean up the Plastic Mess” at SDSU's Celebration of Faculty Excellence when he was approached by <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/anne-fennell">Anne Fennell</a>, a Distinguished Professor in the <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/agronomy-horticulture-plant-science">Department of Agronomy, Horticulture and Plant Science</a>.</p><p>After listening to Janaswamy's presentation, Fennell became interested in the research and had an idea. A leading researcher in the study of grapevines, she knew that grapevine canes — the woody plant material that grapes grow on — were rich in cellulose. She also knew that grapevine canes were abundant and had limited use after harvest.</p><p>"Every year we prune the majority of yearly biomass off the vine," Fennell said. "The pruned canes are either mowed over, composted and reapplied to the soil, or burned in some areas. &nbsp;Research in Australia showed that prunings could be removed from the field in alternate years without effecting soil health. &nbsp;My thought was why not use this for value added films. Several of the materials that Janaswamy previously used had a high-water content, in contrast the winter pruning yields a cellulose-dense material with low water content, making them an abundant ideal material to work with."</p><p>Fennell's idea led to a collaboration, and soon Janaswamy was extracting cellulose — which looks almost like cotton — from the canes of grapevines. The resulting films were eye-opening.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/fb/d5fb00211g">recent study</a> published in the academic journal Sustainable Food Technology, Janaswamy's grapevine cane films are transparent and strong and biodegrade within 17 days in the soil — leaving behind no harmful residue.</p><p>"High transmittance in packaging films enhances product visibility, making them more attractive to consumers and facilitating easy quality inspection without the need for unsealing," Janaswamy said. "These films demonstrate outstanding potential for food packaging applications."</p><figure role="group">

<p>The grapevine canes were harvested from SDSU's research vineyard. The research team, which includes doctoral candidates <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/sandeep-paudel">Sandeep Paudel</a> and <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/sumi-regmi">Sumi Regmi</a>, and Sajal Bhattarai, an SDSU graduate and a doctoral candidate at Purdue University, followed a published protocol in developing the films, which includes drying and grinding the canes and extracting the cellulosic residue. The residue was then solubilized and cast onto glass plates to create the films.</p><p>Testing revealed the grapevine cane-derived films were actually stronger than traditional plastic bags — in terms of tensile strength.</p><p>"Using underutilized grapevine prunings as a cellulose source for packaging films enhances waste management in the field and addresses the global issue of plastic pollution," Janaswamy said. "Developing eco-friendly films from grapevine cellulose represents a practical approach to sustainability, helping to conserve the environment and its resources and contributing to the circular bioeconomy."</p><p>The results of this work move Janaswamy one step closer to his dream of developing a bag made from a plastic-like material that will quickly decompose in the environment.</p><p>Funding for this research was provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the National Science Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Carla Rover once spent 30 minutes sobbing after having to restart a project she vibe coded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rover has been in the industry for 15 years, mainly working as a web developer. She’s now building a startup, alongside her son, that creates custom machine learning models for marketplaces.&nbsp;</p>







<p>She called vibe coding a beautiful, endless cocktail napkin on which one can perpetually sketch ideas. But dealing with AI-generated code that one hopes to use in production can be “worse than babysitting,” she said, as these AI models can mess up work in ways that are hard to predict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had turned to AI coding in a need for speed with her startup, as is the promise of AI tools.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“Because I needed to be quick and impressive, I took a shortcut and did not scan those files after the automated review,” she said. “When I did do it manually, I found so much wrong. When I used a third-party tool, I found more. And I learned my lesson.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She and her son wound up restarting their whole project — hence the tears. “I handed it off like the copilot was an employee,” she said. “It isn’t.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rover is like many experienced programmers turning to AI for coding help. But such programmers are also finding themselves acting like AI babysitters — rewriting and fact-checking the code the AI spits out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent report by content delivery platform company Fastly <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/senior-developers-ship-more-ai-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found that at least 95%</a> of the nearly 800 developers it surveyed said they spend extra time fixing AI-generated code, with the load of such verification falling most heavily on the shoulders of senior developers.</p>

<p>These experienced coders have discovered issues with AI-generated code ranging from hallucinating package names to deleting important information and security risks. Left unchecked, AI code can leave a product far more buggy than what humans would produce.</p>

<p>Working with AI-generated code has become such a problem that it’s given rise to a new corporate coding job known as “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7370912703231574016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vibe code cleanup specialist</a>.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>TechCrunch spoke to experienced coders about their time using AI-generated code about what they see as the future of vibe coding. Thoughts varied, but one thing remained certain: The technology still has a long way to go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Using a coding co-pilot is kind of like giving a coffee pot to a smart six-year-old and saying, ‘Please take this into the dining room and pour coffee for the family,’” Rover said.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Can they do it? Possibly. Could they fail? Definitely. And most likely, if they do fail, they aren’t going to tell you. “It doesn’t make the kid less clever,” she continued. “It just means you can’t delegate [a task] like that completely.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-you-re-absolutely-right-nbsp">“You’re absolutely right!”&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Feridoon Malekzadeh also compared vibe coding to a child.</p>

<p>He’s worked in the industry for more than 20 years, holding various roles in product development, software, and design. He’s building his own startup and heavily using vibe-coding platform Lovable, he said. For fun, he also vibe codes apps like one that generates Gen Alpha slang for Boomers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He likes that he’s able to work alone on projects, saving time and money, but agrees that vibe coding is not like hiring an intern or a junior coder. Instead, vibe coding is akin to “hiring your stubborn, insolent teenager to help you do something,” he told TechCrunch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“You have to ask them 15 times to do something,” he said. “In the end, they do some of what you asked, some stuff you didn’t ask for, and they break a bunch of things along the way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Malekzadeh estimates he spends around 50% of his time writing requirements, 10% to 20% of his time on vibe coding, and 30% to 40% of his time on vibe <em>fixing </em>— remedying the bugs and “unnecessary script” created by AI-written code.&nbsp;</p>







<p>He also doesn’t think vibe coding is the best at systems thinking — the process of seeing how a complex problem could impact an overall result. AI-generated code, he said, tries to solve more surface-level problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“If you’re creating a feature that should be broadly available in your product, a good engineer would create that once and make it available everywhere that it’s needed,” Malekzadeh said. “Vibe coding will create something five different times, five different ways, if it’s needed in five different places. It leads to a lot of confusion, not only for the user, but for the model.”</p>







<p>Meanwhile, Rover finds that AI “runs into a wall” when data conflicts with what it was hard-coded to do. “It can offer misleading advice, leave out key elements that are vital, or insert itself into a thought pathway you’re developing,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also found that rather than admit to making errors, it will manufacture results.</p>

<p>She shared another example with TechCrunch, where she questioned the results an AI model initially gave her. The model started to give a detailed explanation pretending it used the data she uploaded. Only when she called it out did the AI model confess. </p>

<p>“It freaked me out because it sounded like a toxic co-worker,” she said.</p>

<p>On top of this, there are the security concerns.</p>

<p>Austin Spires is the senior director of developer enablement at Fastly and has been coding since the early 2000s.&nbsp;</p>







<p>He’s found through his own experience — along with chatting with customers — that vibe code likes to build what is quick rather than what is “right.” This may introduce vulnerabilities to the code of the kind that very new programmers tend to make, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“What often happens is the engineer needs to review the code, correct the agent, and tell the agent that they made a mistake,” Spires told TechCrunch. “This pattern is why we’ve seen the trope of ‘you’re absolutely right’ appear over social media.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>He’s referring to how AI models, like Anthropic Claude, tend to respond “you’re absolutely right” when called out on their mistakes.</p>

<p>Mike Arrowsmith, the chief technology officer at the IT management software company NinjaOne, has been in software engineering and security for around 20 years. He said that vibe coding is creating a new generation of IT and security blind spots to which young startups in particular are susceptible.</p>

<p>“Vibe coding often bypasses the rigorous review processes that are foundational to traditional coding and crucial to catching vulnerabilities,” he told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>NinjaOne, he said, counters this by encouraging “safe vibe coding,” where approved AI tools have access controls, along with mandatory peer review and, of course, security scanning.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-the-new-normal">The new normal</h2>

<p>While nearly everyone we spoke to agrees that AI-generated code and vibe-coding platforms are useful in many situations — like mocking up ideas — they all agree that human review is essential before building a business on it.</p>

<p>“That cocktail napkin is not a business model,” Rover said. “You have to balance the ease with insight.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>But for all the lamenting on its errors, vibe coding has changed the present and the future of the job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rover said vibe coding helped her tremendously in crafting a better user interface. Malekzadeh simply said that, despite the time he spends fixing code, he still gets more done with AI coders than without them.</p>







<p>“‘Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress,” Malekzadeh said, quoting the French theorist Paul Virilio, who spoke about inventing the shipwreck along with the ship.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The pros far outweigh the cons.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The Fastly survey found that senior developers were twice as likely to put AI-generated code into production compared to junior developers, saying that the technology helped them work faster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vibe coding is also part of Spires’ coding routine. He uses AI coding agents on several platforms for both front-end and back-end personal projects. He called the technology a mixed experience but said it’s good in helping with prototyping, building out boilerplate, or scaffolding out a test; it removes menial tasks so that engineers can focus on building, shipping, and scaling products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems the extra hours spent combing through the vibe weeds will simply become a tolerated tax on using the innovation.</p>

<p>Elvis Kimara, a young engineer, is learning that now. He just graduated with a master’s in AI and is building an AI-powered marketplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many coders, he said vibe coding has made his job harder and has often found vibe coding a joyless experience.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“There’s no more dopamine from solving a problem by myself. The AI just figures it out,” he said. At one of his last jobs, he said senior developers didn’t look to help young coders as much&nbsp;— some not understanding new vibe-coding models, while others delegated mentorship tasks to said AI models.</p>

<p>But, he said, “the pros far outweigh the cons,” and he’s prepared to pay the innovation tax.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“We won’t just be writing code; we’ll be guiding AI systems, taking accountability when things break, and acting more like consultants to machines,” Kimara said of the new normal for which he’s preparing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Even as I grow into a senior role, I’ll keep using it,” he continued. “It’s been a real accelerator for me. I make sure I review every line of AI-generated code so I learn even faster from it.”</p>

      <p>Today we turned off our Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service, as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/05/ending-ocsp/">announced</a> in December of last year. We stopped including OCSP URLs in our certificates more than 90 days ago, so all Let’s Encrypt certificates that contained OCSP URLs have now expired. Going forward, we will publish revocation information exclusively via Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).</p>
<p>We ended support for OCSP primarily because it represents a considerable risk to privacy on the Internet. When someone visits a website using a browser or other software that checks for certificate revocation via OCSP, the Certificate Authority (CA) operating the OCSP responder immediately becomes aware of which website is being visited from that visitor’s particular IP address. Even when a CA intentionally does not retain this information, as is the case with Let’s Encrypt, it could accidentally be retained or CAs could be legally compelled to collect it. CRLs do not have this issue.</p>
<p>We are also taking this step because keeping our CA infrastructure as simple as possible is critical for the continuity of compliance, reliability, and efficiency at Let’s Encrypt. For every year that we have existed, operating OCSP services has taken up considerable resources that can soon be better spent on other aspects of our operations. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2022/09/07/new-life-for-crls/">Now that we support CRLs</a>, our OCSP service has become unnecessary.</p>
<p>At the height of our OCSP service’s traffic earlier this year, we handled approximately 340 billion OCSP requests per month. That’s more than 140,000 requests per second handled by our CDN, with 15,000 requests per second handled by our origin. We’d like to thank <a href="https://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a> for generously donating CDN services for OCSP to Let’s Encrypt for the past ten years.</p>

<p>I recently implemented a minimal proof of concept time-sharing operating system kernel on RISC-V. In this post, I’ll share the details of how this prototype works. The target audience is anyone looking to understand low-level system software, drivers, system calls, etc., and I hope this will be especially useful to students of system software and computer architecture.</p>
<p>This is a redo of an exercise I did for my undergraduate course in operating systems, and functionally it should resemble a typical operating systems project. However, this experiment focuses on modern tooling, as well as the modern architecture of RISC-V. RISC-V is an amazing technology that is easy to understand more quickly than other CPU architectures, while remaining a popular choice for many new systems, not just an educational architecture.</p>
<p>Finally, to do things differently here, I implemented this exercise in Zig, rather than traditional C. In addition to being an interesting experiment, I believe Zig makes this experiment much more easily reproducible on your machine, as it’s very easy to set up and does not require any installation (which could otherwise be slightly messy when cross-compiling to RISC-V).</p>

<p>The final code for this experiment is on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/popovicu/zig-time-sharing-kernel">here</a>. We’ll be referencing the code from it as we go.</p>
<p>GitHub should be the source of truth and may be slightly out of sync with the code below.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-reading">Recommended reading</h2>
<p>The basic fundamentals of computer engineering and specifically computer architecture are assumed. Specifically, knowledge of registers, how the CPU addresses memory, and interrupts is all necessary.</p>
<p>Before diving deep into this experiment, it’s recommended to also review the following background texts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/bare-metal-programming-risc-v">Bare metal programming on RISC-V</a></li>

<li><a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-interrupts-with-timer-example/">RISC-V interrupts with a timer example</a></li>
<li><em>Optional</em> - <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/making-a-micro-linux-distro">Making a micro Linux distro</a> - mainly for the brief philosophy on the kernel / user space split</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="unikernel">Unikernel</h2>
<p>We’ll be developing a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel">unikernel</a>. Simply put, this setup links the application code directly with the OS kernel it depends on. Essentially, everything is bundled into a single binary executable, and the user code is loaded into memory alongside the kernel.</p>
<p>This bypasses the need to separately load the user code at runtime, which is a complex field in itself (involving linkers, loaders, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="sbi-layer">SBI layer</h2>
<p>RISC-V supports a layered permissions model. The system boots into machine mode (M), which is completely bare-metal, and then supports a couple of other less privileged modes. Please check the background texts for more details; below is a quick summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>M-mode can do pretty much anything; it is fully bare-metal.</li>
<li>In the middle is S-mode, supervisor, which typically hosts the operating system kernel.</li>
<li>At the bottom is U-mode, user, where application code runs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lower privilege levels can send requests to higher privilege levels.</p>
<p>We’ll assume that at the bottom of our software stack is an SBI layer, specifically OpenSBI. Please study <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-sbi-and-full-boot-process">this text</a> for the necessary background, as we’ll use the SBI layer to manage console printing and control the timer hardware. While manual implementation is possible, I wanted to add more value to this text by demonstrating a more portable approach with OpenSBI.</p>
<h2 id="goal-for-the-kernel">Goal for the kernel</h2>
<p>We want to support a few key features for simplicity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Statically define threads ahead of execution; i.e., dynamic thread creation is not supported. Additionally, for simplicity, threads are implemented as never-ending functions.</li>
<li>Threads operate in user mode and are able to send system calls to the kernel operating in S-mode.</li>
<li>Time is sliced and allocated among different threads. The system timer will be set to tick every couple of milliseconds, at which point a thread may be switched out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, development is targeted for a single-core machine.</p>
<h2 id="virtualization-and-what-exactly-is-a-thread">Virtualization and what exactly is a thread</h2>
<p>Before implementing threads, we should decide what they really are. The concept of threads in a time-sharing environment enables multiple workloads to run on a single core (as noted above, we’re focusing on single-core machines), while the programming model for each thread remains largely the same as if it were the sole software on the machine. This is a loose definition, which we will refine.</p>
<p>To understand time-sharing, let’s briefly consider its contrast: cooperative scheduling/threading. In cooperative scheduling/threading, a thread voluntarily yields CPU time to another workload. Eventually, the expectation is that another thread will yield control back to the first.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>function thread():</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_1();</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_2();</span></span>
<span><span>  YIELD();</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_3();</span></span>
<span><span>  YIELD();</span></span>
<span><span>  ...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>To be clear, this isn’t an “outdated” technique, despite being older. In fact, it’s alive and well in many modern programming languages and their runtimes (often abstracted from programmers). One good example is Go, which uses Goroutines to run multiple workloads on top of one operating system thread. While programmers don’t necessarily add explicit yield operations, the compiler and runtime can inject them into the workload.</p>
<p>Now, it should be clearer what it means for the programming model to remain largely the same in a time-sharing context. The thread would naturally look like this:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>function thread():</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_1();</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_2();</span></span>
<span><span>  operation_3();</span></span>
<span><span>  ...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>There are simply no explicit yield operations; instead, the kernel utilizes timers and interrupts to seamlessly switch between threads on the same core. This is precisely what we’ll implement in this experiment.</p>
<p>When multiple workloads run on the same resource, and each retains the same programming model as if it were the only workload, we can say the resource is virtualized. In other words, if we’re running 5 threads on the same core, each thread “feels” like it has its own core, effectively running on 5 little cores instead of 1 big core. More formally, each thread retains its own view of the core’s architectural registers (in RISC-V, <code>x0-x31</code> and some CSRs, more on this below) and… some memory! Let’s look deeper into that.</p>
<h3 id="the-stack-and-memory-virtualization">The stack and memory virtualization</h3>
<p>To begin, a thread has its own stack for reasons we’ll analyze shortly. The rest of the memory is “shared” with other threads, but this requires further investigation.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that hardware virtualization exists on a spectrum, rather than as a few rigid options. Here are some of the options for virtualization:</p>
<ol>
<li>Threads: virtualizes architectural registers and stacks, but not much else; i.e., different threads can share data elsewhere in memory.</li>
<li>Process: more heavyweight than threads, memory is virtualized such that each process “feels” like it has a dedicated CPU core and its own memory untouchable by other processes; additionally, a process houses multiple threads.</li>
<li>Container: virtualizes even more - each container has its own filesystem and potentially its own set of network interfaces; containers share the same kernel and underlying hardware.</li>
<li>VM: virtualizes everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many more shades in between, and each of these options likely has different subtypes. The point here is that all these approaches enable running different workloads with varying isolations, or more intuitively, different <em>views</em> of the machine and their environment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you examine the Linux kernel source code, you won’t find a construct explicitly called a <em>container</em>. What we popularly call containers isn’t a mechanism baked into the kernel, but rather <strong>a set of kernel mechanisms</strong> used together to form a specific view of the environment for our workload. For example, the <code>chroot</code> mechanism restricts filesystem visibility, while <code>cgroups</code> impose limits on workloads; together, these form what we call a container.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe (though don’t quote me on this) that the boundaries between threads and processes in Linux are somewhat blurred. To the best of my knowledge, both are implemented on top of <em>tasks</em> in the kernel, but when creating a task, the API allows different restrictions to be specified.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is all to say that we’re always defining a workload with varying restrictions on what it can see and access. When and why to apply different restrictions is a topic for another day. Many questions arise when writing an application, ranging from the difficulty of an approach to its security.</p>
<h3 id="virtualizing-a-thread">Virtualizing a thread</h3>
<p>In this experiment, we’ll implement minimal virtualization with very basic, time-sharing threads. Therefore, the goals are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The programming model for a thread should remain mostly untouched. As long as a thread doesn’t interact with memory contents used by other threads, its programming model should remain consistent, powered by time-sharing.</li>
<li>A thread should have its own protected view of architectural registers, including some RISC-V CSRs.</li>
<li>A thread should be assigned its own stack.</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be obvious why a thread needs its own view of the registers. If other threads could freely touch a thread’s registers, the thread wouldn’t be able to do any meaningful work. All (I believe) RISC-V instructions work with at least one register, so protecting a thread’s register view is essential.</p>
<p>Furthermore, assigning a private stack to a thread is necessary, though slightly less obvious. The answer is that different stacks are needed to manage different execution contexts. Namely, when a function is invoked, by convention, the stack is used to allocate function-private variables. Additionally, registers like <code>ra</code> can be pushed to the stack to retain the correct return address from a function (in case another function is invoked within it). In short, there are various reasons, per RISC-V convention, why the stack is needed to maintain the execution context. The details of RISC-V calling conventions will not be described here.</p>
<h3 id="interrupt-context">Interrupt context</h3>
<p>It’s crucial to understand how interrupt code runs and what it should consist of, as this mechanism will be heavily exploited to achieve seamless time-sharing between threads. For a detailed, practical example, please check out <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-interrupts-with-timer-example/">this past text</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll briefly include the assembly for the timer interrupt routine from that text:</p>

<p>This assembly was obtained by writing a C function tagged as an S-level interrupt in RISC-V. With this tag, the GCC compiler knew how to generate the <em>prologue</em> and <em>epilogue</em> of the interrupt routine. The prologue preserves architectural registers on the stack, and the epilogue recovers them (in addition to specifically returning from S-mode). All of this was generated by correctly tagging the C function’s invoking convention.</p>
<p>This somewhat resembles function calling, and that’s essentially what it is. Interrupts can be thought of (in a very simplified sense) as functions invoked by some system effect. Consequently, utilized registers must be carefully preserved on the stack and then restored at the routine’s exit; otherwise, asynchronous interrupts like timer interrupts would randomly corrupt architectural register values, completely blocking any practical software from running!</p>
<h2 id="implementation-high-level">Implementation (high-level)</h2>
<p>We’ll explore the implementation by first describing the high-level idea and then digging into the code.</p>
<h3 id="leveraging-the-interrupt-stack-convention">Leveraging the interrupt stack convention</h3>
<p>Adding an interrupt is, in a way, already introducing a form of threading to your application code. In a system with a timer interrupt, the main application code runs, which can occasionally be interleaved with instances of timer interrupt invocations. The core jumps to this interrupt routine when the timer signals, and it carefully restores the architectural state before control flow returns to the “main thread”. There are two control flows running concurrently here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Main application code.</li>
<li>Repetitions of the interrupt routine.</li>
</ol>
<p>This interleaving of the timer interrupt can be leveraged to implement additional control flows, and the main idea is outlined below.</p>
<p>The core of the interrupt routine is sandwiched between the prologue and the epilogue. That’s where the interrupt is serviced before control returns to the main application thread by restoring registers from the stack.</p>
<p>However, <strong>why must we restore the registers from the same stack location</strong>? If our interrupt logic swaps the stack pointer to some other piece of memory, we’ll end up with a different set of architectural register values recovered, thus entering a whole different flow. In other words, we achieve a <strong>context switch</strong>, and this is precisely how it’s implemented in this experiment. We’ll see the code for it shortly.</p>
<h3 id="kerneluser-space-separation">Kernel/user space separation</h3>
<p>We can now delineate the kernel space and user space. With RISC-V, this naturally translates to kernel code running in supervisor (S) mode and user space code running in U-mode.</p>
<p>The machine boots into machine (M) mode, and since we want to leverage the SBI layer, we’ll allow OpenSBI to run there. Then, the kernel will perform some initial setup in S-mode before starting the U-mode execution of user space threads. Periodic timer interrupts will enable context switches, and the interrupt code will execute in S-mode. Finally, user threads will be able to make system calls to the kernel.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-code">Implementation (code)</h2>
<p>Please refer to the GitHub repository for the full code; we will only cover core excerpts below.</p>
<h3 id="assembly-startup">Assembly startup</h3>
<p>As usual, a short assembly snippet is needed to start our S-mode code and enter the “main program” in Zig. This is in <code>startup.S</code>.</p>

<p>The rest of the assembly startup primarily involves cleaning up the BSS section and setting up the stack pointer for the initial kernel code.</p>
<h3 id="main-kernel-file-and-io-drivers">Main kernel file and I/O drivers</h3>

<span><span>    }</span></span></code></pre>
<p><code>main</code> is marked as <code>export</code> to conform to the C ABI.</p>
<p>Here, we have a lightweight implementation of a couple of I/O drivers. As you can see, writing can occur in one of two ways: either we go through the SBI layer (<code>sbi.zig</code>) or, if that fails, we use direct MMIO (<code>uart_mmio.zig</code>). The SBI method should theoretically be more portable, as it delegates output management details to the M-level layer (essentially what we do with MMIO), freeing us from concerns about exact memory space addresses.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly look at <code>sbi.zig</code>:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// Struct containing the return status of OpenSBI</span></span>
<span><span>pub const SbiRet = struct {</span></span>
<span><span>    sbi_error: isize,</span></span>

<span><span>};</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>pub fn debug_print(message: []const u8) SbiRet {</span></span>
<span><span>    var err: isize = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    var val: isize = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    const msg_ptr = @intFromPtr(message.ptr);</span></span>
<span><span>    const msg_len = message.len;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    asm volatile (</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv a0, %[len]</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv a1, %[msg]</span></span>
<span><span>        \\li a2, 0</span></span>
<span><span>        \\li a6, 0x00</span></span>
<span><span>        \\li a7, 0x4442434E</span></span>
<span><span>        \\ecall</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv %[err], a0</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv %[val], a1</span></span>
<span><span>        : [err] "=r" (err),</span></span>
<span><span>          [val] "=r" (val),</span></span>
<span><span>        : [msg] "r" (msg_ptr),</span></span>
<span><span>          [len] "r" (msg_len),</span></span>
<span><span>        : .{ .x10 = true, .x11 = true, .x12 = true, .x16 = true, .x17 = true, .memory = true });</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    return SbiRet{</span></span>
<span><span>        .sbi_error = err,</span></span>
<span><span>        .value = val,</span></span>
<span><span>    };</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is very straightforward; we’re simply performing the system call exactly as described in the OpenSBI documentation. Note that when I first wrote this code, I wasn’t fully familiar with Zig’s error handling capabilities, hence the somewhat non-idiomatic error handling.</p>
<p>However, this can be considered a first driver in this kernel, as it directly manages output to the device.</p>
<p>Next is <code>uart_mmio.zig</code>:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// UART MMIO address (standard for QEMU virt machine)</span></span>
<span><span>pub const UART_BASE: usize = 0x10000000;</span></span>
<span><span>pub const UART_TX: *volatile u8 = @ptrFromInt(UART_BASE);</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>// Direct UART write function (fallback when SBI is not available)</span></span>
<span><span>pub fn uart_write_string(message: []const u8) void {</span></span>
<span><span>    for (message) |byte| {</span></span>
<span><span>        UART_TX.* = byte;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is straightforward and self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Returning to <code>kernel.zig</code> and the <code>main</code> function, we create 3 user threads, each printing a slightly different message (the thread ID is the varying bit). At this point, the kernel setup is almost complete.</p>
<p>The final steps involve setting up and running the timer interrupt. Once that is done, kernel code will only run when the timer interrupts the system or when user space code requests a system call.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>interrupts.setup_s_mode_interrupt(&amp;s_mode_interrupt_handler);</span></span>
<span><span>_ = timer.set_timer_in_near_future();</span></span>
<span><span>timer.enable_s_mode_timer_interrupt();</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We could request a context switch immediately, but for simplicity, we’ll wait until the timer activates and begins the actual work in the system.</p>
<h3 id="s-mode-handler-and-the-context-switch">S-mode handler and the context switch</h3>
<p>While the Zig compiler could generate the adequate prologue and epilogue for our S-mode handler, we will do it manually. The reason is that we also want to capture some CSRs in the context that otherwise wouldn’t have been captured by the generated routine.</p>
<p>That’s why we use the <code>naked</code> calling convention in Zig. This forces us to write the entire function in assembly, though a quick escape hatch to this limitation is to call a Zig function whenever Zig logic is needed.</p>
<p>I won’t copy paste the whole prologue and epilogue here because they are very similar to what was done in the previous C experiment with RISC-V interrupts. Instead, I’ll just focus on the bit that is different:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>...</span></span>

<span><span>        \\csrw sstatus, x5</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, a couple more registers were added to the prologue and epilogue in addition to the core architectural registers.</p>
<p>Next, within this prologue/epilogue sandwich, we invoke the <code>handle_kernel</code> Zig function. This routes to the correct logic based on whether the interrupt source is a synchronous system call from user space or an asynchronous timer interrupt. The reason is that we land in the same S-level interrupt routine regardless of the interrupt source, and then we inspect the <code>scause</code> CSR for details.</p>
<p>To successfully work with the <code>handle_kernel</code> function, we need to be aware of the assembly-level calling conventions. This function takes a single integer parameter and returns a single integer parameter. Since the function signature is small, it works as simply as this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sole function parameter is passed through the <code>a0</code> architectural register.</li>
<li>The same register also holds the function’s result upon return.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is pretty easy. Let’s quickly look at the signature of this function:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>export fn handle_kernel(current_stack: usize) usize {</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>It is slightly awkward but gets the job done. The input to this Zig logic is the stack top before invoking the Zig logic (which inevitably leads to some data added to the stack). The function’s output is where the stack top should be <em>after</em> the Zig logic is done. If it differs from the input, then we’re performing a context switch. If it’s the same, the same workload thread will continue running after the interrupt.</p>
<p>The rest of the logic is very simple. It inspects the interrupt source (system call from user space or timer interrupt) and performs accordingly.</p>
<p>In the case of a timer interrupt, a context switch is performed. The <code>schedule</code> function from <code>scheduling.zig</code> is invoked, and it potentially returns the other stack we should switch to:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const build_options = @import("build_options");</span></span>

<p>The code from the <code>thread</code> module is very simple, serving as boilerplate for a basic queue that manages structs representing threads. I won’t copy it here, as it’s mostly AI-generated. It is important to note, however, that the stacks are statically allocated in memory, and the maximum number of running threads is hardcoded.</p>
<p>The <code>thread</code> module also includes logic for setting up a new thread. This is where data is pushed onto the stack before the thread even runs. If you wonder why, it’s because when returning from the S-level trap handler, we need <em>something</em> on the stack to indicate where to go. The initial data does precisely that. We can seed the initial register values here as desired. In fact, in this experiment, we demonstrate passing a single integer parameter to the thread function by seeding the <code>a0</code> register value (per calling convention) on the stack, which the thread function can then use immediately.</p>
<h3 id="the-user-space-threads">The user space threads</h3>

<p>Additionally, as mentioned above, we pre-seeded the stack such that when <code>a0</code> is recovered from the stack upon the first interrupt return for a given thread, the function argument will be picked up. That’s how the <code>print</code> function accesses the <code>thread_arg</code> value and uses it in its logic.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the user/kernel boundary, we have <code>syscall.debug_print(content);</code>. This conceptually behaves more or less as <code>printf</code> from <code>stdio.h</code> in C. It performs prepares the arguments to the kernel and runs a system call with these arguments which should lead to some content getting printed on the output device. Here’s what the printing library looks like (from <code>syscall.zig</code>):</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// User-level debug_print function</span></span>
<span><span>pub fn debug_print(message: []const u8) void {</span></span>
<span><span>    const msg_ptr = @intFromPtr(message.ptr);</span></span>
<span><span>    const msg_len = message.len;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    // Let's say syscall number 64</span></span>
<span><span>    // a7 = syscall number</span></span>
<span><span>    // a0 = message pointer</span></span>
<span><span>    // a1 = message length</span></span>
<span><span>    asm volatile (</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv a0, %[msg]</span></span>
<span><span>        \\mv a1, %[len]</span></span>

<span><span>        \\ecall</span></span>

<span><span>        : [msg] "r" (msg_ptr),</span></span>
<span><span>          [len] "r" (msg_len),</span></span>
<span><span>        : .{ .x10 = true, .x11 = true, .x17 = true, .memory = true });</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    // Ignore return value for simplicity</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>System call 64 is served from the S-mode handler in <code>kernel.zig</code>. This is self-explanatory, and we won’t go into further details here.</p>
<h3 id="running-the-kernel">Running the kernel</h3>
<p>We will deploy the kernel on bare-metal, specifically on a virtual machine. In theory, this should also work on a real machine, provided an SBI layer is present when the kernel starts, and the linker script, I/O “drivers,” and other machine-specific constants are adapted.</p>
<p>To build, we simply run</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>zig</span><span> </span><span>build</span></span></code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many educational OS kernels exist, but this experiment combines RISC-V, OpenSBI, and Zig, offering a fresh perspective compared to traditional C implementations.</p>
<p>The resulting code runs on a QEMU virtual machine, which can be easily set up, even by building QEMU from source.</p>
<p>To keep the explanation concise, error reporting was kept minimal. Should you modify the code and require debugging, sufficient clues are provided, despite some areas where the code is simplified (e.g., anonymous results after SBI print invocations like <code>_ = ...</code>). Much of the code in this example was AI-generated by Claude to save time, and it should function as intended. While some parts of the code are simplified, such as stack space over-allocation, these do not detract from the experiment’s educational value.</p>
<p>Overall, this experiment serves as a starting point for studying operating systems, assuming a foundational understanding of computer engineering and computer architecture. It likely has plenty of flaws for a practical application, but for now, we’re just hacking here!</p>
<p>I hope this was a useful exploration.</p>

<p>Say you’re a senior member of your team at work. You’re 12 minutes late to the weekly staff Zoom. Once you’ve “joined audio,” the first thing you hear is your old friend’s voice. “There you are! So glad you could fit us in.” You laugh and explain the disastrous traffic, difficult drop-off at your kids’ school, or whatever it was that messed up your morning. The moment passes and the conversation moves on. You turn to the job at hand, focused and ready to go.</p>



<p>But what if you’re a junior staffer, still feeling your way. Same thing happens: You’re 12 minutes late to the weekly staff Zoom. Once you’ve “joined audio,” the first thing you hear is the boss’s voice. “There you are! So glad you could fit us in.” A few colleagues chuckle. You consider making excuses—about traffic, drop-off, whatever it was—but the moment passes, and the conversation moves on.</p>

<p>Your mind doesn’t, though. It’s still ruminating. <em>Was that snark in my boss’s voice? Were they talking about me before I logged on? Do I fit in here? Am I any good at this job? </em>You might not be fully aware of these questions. Your mind works quickly on multiple tracks at the same time. And those questions are nasty; they threaten your sense of belonging, your worth, and your value, at least at work. So you try to push them away, to suppress them. But they’re still there. And once they’ve been triggered, it might feel like the evidence keeps pouring in.</p>



<p>Someone makes an inside joke in the chat. You don’t get it. <em>I don’t belong here. </em>Someone rolls their eyes while you’re talking. <em>They don’t respect me.</em> The boss ignores you for the rest of the meeting. <em>No one sees me.</em> Again, these thoughts may not be fully conscious. But there’s no mistaking the fact that your motivation to get back to work has waned by the time you log off. What was it you were supposed to look into?</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Was that snark in my boss’s voice? Were they talking about me before I logged on? Do I fit in here? Am I any good at this job?</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Next thing you know, you’re idly messing around online when a text comes in from the person who rolled their eyes. “You okay? You seemed out of it at the meeting.” You ignore it. But your mind doesn’t. It’s busy composing possible replies. The full spectrum from passive-aggressive to career imperiling. Eventually you pick up your phone. What will you text back?</p>



<p>This is how self-defeating spirals start and how they gather speed. Let’s break down the moving parts:</p>



<ol start="1">
<li>A circumstance places a big question on the table—about identity, belonging, or adequacy: <em>You’re new at work. You want to succeed and belong, but you wonder . . . </em>That question looms, latent and inactive, but present.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2">
<li>A “bad” thing happens: <em>Your boss is a little snarky.</em></li>
</ol>



<ol start="3">
<li>That question gets triggered: <em>You read the room for answers, drawing negative inferences from ambiguous evidence. You’re distracted from the task at hand. Your pessimistic hypothesis becomes more entrenched.</em></li>
</ol>



<ol start="4">
<li>You act on that pessimistic hypothesis, making matters worse.</li>
</ol>



<p>Maybe you send that colleague a snarky text back. And what do you know: When you see them a few days later, they’re cold to you.</p>



<p>Now you aren’t talking. Maybe you flub that assignment your boss gave you, and they lose confidence in you. Fast-forward a year and you’re at a new job. Tensions are emerging with the new coworkers. Or are they? How will this story end? Do you have any control over it?</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>When a core question is unsettled, it functions like a lens through which you see the world.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yes, you do. We all do. Negative spirals or feedback loops like these aren’t inevitable. In fact, there are small things we can do both for ourselves and for others to nip them in the bud—and prevent catastrophic outcomes months and years into the future. Better yet, there are ways we can launch positive spirals—dramatically increasing our chances of future happiness, success, and flourishing. The very same processes can either propel us upward or pull us down.</p>



<p>To understand how all this is possible, let’s get more precise about sequences like 1–4 above. There are three key concepts at play: “core questions” (number 1), meaning making or “construal” (numbers 2 and 3), and “calcification” (number 4). Think of these as “the three Cs” of spirals—whether positive or negative.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="466" src="https://behavioralscientistorg.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Spiral-Graphic-1024x466.png" alt="" srcset="https://behavioralscientistorg.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Spiral-Graphic-1024x466.png 1024w, https://behavioralscientistorg.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Spiral-Graphic-300x136.png 300w, https://behavioralscientistorg.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Spiral-Graphic-768x349.png 768w, https://behavioralscientistorg.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Spiral-Graphic-1536x699.png 1536w, https://behavioralscientistorg.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Spiral-Graphic-2048x931.png 2048w, https://behavioralscientistorg.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Spiral-Graphic-1430x650.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><strong>Core questions. </strong>There are the fundamental questions all of us face, at one time or another. For example: <em>Who am I? Do I belong? Am I enough?</em> I think of these questions as “defining” because they help define you and your life: your sense of self, what relationships you’ll have, and whether you’ll be able to do and be the things you aspire to. There might be long stretches when you don’t think about a given question much because it’s settled for you then. But at critical junctures specific questions flare up, unsettle and preoccupy you. Then they begin to shape what you see and how you act.</p>



<p><strong>Construal. </strong>It’s natural to think that we have an unfiltered view of the world. That light hits your eyes and you just see what’s out there. But it’s more that we read the world, interpret it, drawing inferences based on what’s already in our heads. We pick up on themes that seem relevant or important to us, not noticing or screening out other details.</p>



<p>A friend once told me of an ingenious class demonstration that helped her begin to understand this process. A professor split the class in two and then spoke to the first half alone, telling them of his love for travel and a recent trip to Libya. Next, he spoke to the second half about shopping and how hard it was to find the right size shoe. Last, he brought the class together and said a single word. He asked the students to write it down. Students in the first group wrote, “Tripoli.” Those in the second wrote, “Triple E.”</p>



<p>Construal is like a kind of focus. As you look out at the social scene, what snaps to attention? If you’re anything like me, one of the most powerful guides is whatever could pose a risk to you, could threaten you. If you’re walk­ing through a forest where a tiger is said to prowl, you might hear that tiger in every rustle of leaves, see it in every sway of reeds. But in the social world, we don’t all face the same threats. That’s why when you’re new at work and nervous about your place you might hear snark in your boss’s voice, but not if it’s your old friend.</p>



<p>When a core question is unsettled for a person, it functions like a lens through which you see the world. We seek answers that can help us resolve that question. <em>Is it true?</em> we ask. <em>Are my doubts and fears well founded? </em>Then, if a “bad” thing happens, it can seem like proof of your negative hypothesis. We aren’t neutral observers on the lookout for evidence one way or the other. We’re in the grip of confirmation bias, attuned to evidence that corroborates our preconceived theory, even if it’s the tiniest thing.</p>



<p><strong>Calcification. </strong>Calcification happens when our negative thoughts and feelings get entrenched—often as a consequence of our own actions. You have a bad date and think, <em>Am I unlovable? Will I be alone forever? </em>Pretty soon your next date isn’t going well either. Rinse and repeat long enough, and you’re stuck in a romantic rut.</p>



<p>When you start to look, you can see spirals everywhere. You fail an important math test. You think you can’t succeed, and stop going to class. You feel sick from a treatment designed to help you overcome an illness. You think it means your illness is especially strong and resistant and so avoid treatment. You have a fight with your kids. You think you’re a “bad parent,” and then yell at them even more the next time. This is self-sabotage, and one step at a time it costs us our achievements, our health, our relationships, and our well-being.</p>



<p><strong>Spiraling up</strong></p>



<p>Yet if our struggles arise, in part, from the inferences we draw, we have an opportunity. In my work, my colleagues and I identify early moments where people could go one way or the other. By understanding the questions that come up at critical junctures, we can offer people better ways to think through challenges—ways that can help them spiral up, instead of down. </p>



<p>That’s what we call “wise” interventions: graceful ways to offer people good answers to the questions that define our lives. It sure can seem like magic that 21 minutes could <a href="https://www.gregorywalton.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/finkelslotterluchieswaltongross_psci.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve marriage</a> a year later; that a one-page letter could <a href="https://www.gregorywalton.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/waltonokonofuaetal_2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep kids out of jail</a>; that a string of postcards could <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.52.6.828" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut suicide rates by half</a> over two years; or that an hour-long <a href="https://www.gregorywalton.com/uploads/4/9/4/4/49448111/bradycohenjarviswalton2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reflection on belonging</a> in the first year of college could improve life satisfaction and career success a decade later. But this—this is ordinary magic.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Negative spirals or feedback loops aren’t inevitable. There are things we can do both for ourselves and for others to nip them in the bud</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In my first year of college, I was biking back through campus one lovely fall day when I saw a large group of fellow students gathered enthusiastically around a truck from the California burger chain In-N-Out. Maybe they craved a taste of home. But in Michigan, where I was from, there are no In-N-Outs. I’d never heard of it. Feeling excluded from the burger party, I biked off in a huff to eat my lunch in the dining hall alone. I remember thinking, I’m not standing in line for a burger!</p>



<p>What was my problem?</p>



<p>As an 18-year-old, I certainly didn’t want to think of myself as feeling that I did not belong in college. And I definitely didn’t want to think that an In-N-Out truck could trigger that feeling. How ridiculous that would be. Who thinks they don’t belong because of a burger truck?</p>



<p>It was ridiculous. After my brother experienced a particularly mysterious romantic disaster, it’s something we christened a “tifbit”—tiny fact, big theory. Of course not knowing about In-N-Out didn’t mean I didn’t belong in college. But that’s the point. For looking back now, I know the truth is I was homesick. I felt so far from home and all the people I knew and loved. So I wondered, <em>Will I make friends in California? Will I fit in?</em> Seeing all those classmates crowded together, eager to get lunch from a place I’d never even heard of, just triggered those anxieties.</p>



<p>With wisdom and kindness and a little distance, we can laugh at ourselves in situations like these. But we should pay attention. For beneath every tifbit is a real question, and it’s almost always a reasonable one. Big responses to small experiences can help us see what lies beneath the surface. For a tifbit is never just a tiny fact. It’s a clue to the bigger questions that define our lives.</p>



<p>With a little prompt, I could have known that almost everyone feels homesick at first in college, that we’re all in some sense far from home, even the kids from California, that everyone was trying to find new communities. Maybe then I would have joined the line at the In-N-Out truck. I could have asked someone to tell me what In-N-Out was. Why do they love it? What is “animal style”?</p>



<p>I’m sure they would have been glad to share. I know I would have had a better lunch. And maybe I would have made a friend, too.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-node="flmx62i75nea">
	<p><span>Washington, D.C.</span> — </p><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it will no longer defend rules that protect people from unsafe levels of PFAS “forever chemicals” in drinking water, seeking to reverse legal protections put into place last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://earthjustice.org/document/epa-motion-for-partial-vacatur-in-pfas-case">In its motion filed in federal court yesterday</a>, EPA asked the court to axe its determinations to regulate and enforceable standards for four PFAS chemicals – GenX, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFBS. Separately, EPA previously announced that it will seek to extend the compliance deadline for PFOA and PFOS standards by two years from 2029 to 2031. PFAS have contaminated the drinking water for approximately <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00713">200 million people nationwide</a>.</p>
<p>Environmental lawyers said EPA’s course of action is an attempt to evade limits that Congress imposed on the agency. The Safe Drinking Water Act has a strong anti-backsliding provision that prohibits the EPA from weakening any drinking water standard once it is set. In essence, EPA is asking the court to do what EPA itself is not allowed to do.</p>
<p>“Administrator Zeldin promised to protect the American people from PFAS-contaminated drinking water, but he’s doing the opposite,” said <strong>Katherine O’Brien, Earthjustice attorney</strong>. “Zeldin’s plan to delay and roll back the first national limits on these forever chemicals prioritizes chemical industry profits and utility companies’ bottom-line over the health of children and families across the country.”</p>
<p>“The EPA’s request to jettison rules intended to keep drinking water safe from toxic PFAS forever chemicals is an attempted end-run around the protections that Congress placed in the Safe Drinking Water Act. It is also alarming, given what we know about the health harms caused by exposure to these chemicals. No one wants to drink PFAS. We will continue to defend these common-sense, lawfully enacted standards in court,” said <strong>Jared Thompson, a senior attorney with NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council)</strong>.</p>
<p>Earthjustice is representing the following community groups: Buxmont Coalition for Safe Water, Clean Cape Fear, Clean Haw River, Concerned Citizens of WMEL Water Authority Grassroots, Environmental Justice Task Force, Fight for Zero, Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water, and Newburgh Clean Water Project. Working alongside NRDC,<a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/community-members-condemn-epas-lack-of-drinking-water-protections"> the organizations have intervened to defend the nation’s first-ever drinking water standards for PFAS</a> in ongoing litigation brought by chemical companies and water utility associations, who are asking the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., to overturn the standards.</p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong>:</h2>
<p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-to-know-about-pfas">PFAS</a>) are a class of thousands of synthetic chemicals that are widely used in an array of consumer, commercial, and industrial products due to their ability to withstand heat and repel water and stains. Also known as “forever chemicals,” PFAS are extremely persistent in the environment and can accumulate in humans or animals. PFAS exposure is linked to many negative health effects at extremely low levels of exposure, including but not limited to kidney and testicular cancer, liver and kidney damage, changes in hormone and lipid levels, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.</p>
<p>After decades of advocacy on the part of environmental and public health advocates, the EPA proposed in March 2023 to regulate six PFAS chemicals in drinking water. PFAS can be removed from drinking water with existing technologies. In April 2024, the agency concluded there is no safe level of PFOA or PFOS exposure, and the <a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2024/epa-finalizes-first-drinking-water-standards-for-toxic-pfas">final rule</a> covered six PFAS chemicals in total, and set individual limits for five PFAS chemicals and a limit on mixtures of four PFAS chemicals. The rule also requires water systems to monitor for the six regulated PFAS chemicals and publicly communicate their compliance with the new limits, while giving them the law’s maximum compliance time of five years to comply by April 2029. The rule was a long overdue step to address a public health crisis that threatens millions of people nationwide.</p>

    <p>I read to forget. Even when studying or working on papers for a PhD, I approach texts with the same mindset: I'm not a storage device that needs to save all bits of information. I am more of a system of Bayesian beliefs, constantly evolving and updating in small, incremental steps.</p>
<p>I remember co-workers highlighting large chunks of text, sometimes 40%. That doesn't make sense to me. We can only read a text once, given the number of compelling works and the limited time available to us.
So, I read to forget. When I start reading, I'm prepared to lose 98% of what's in front of me. From most texts, I only want two things: First, I want it to subtly alter my thinking, an incremental update that moves me towards a refined world model. Second, I want to pull out a few key pieces of information that I might use later in my writing. For instance, if I come across a well-written methodology section in a paper, I’ll save that.
Reading should stimulate my thinking and produce new ideas. I've found myself reading a paper, pausing midway, and immediately experimenting with some variation of the algorithm described, leading to new ideas or even a new paper.</p>
<p>If a non-fiction text doesn't spark new thoughts or actions, it may not even be worthwhile reading. Anything beyond that clutters my note-taking system. You can't possibly keep track of everything, nor can you work with hoarded pieces of information.</p>

But mechanisms on the effect of psychological disorder on cognitive function is inconclusive. Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a core symptom of a number of common psychological disorders and may be a modifiable process shared by many psychological risk factors that contribute to the development of cognitive impairment. RNT may increase the risk of cognitive impairment.

Another cross-sectional study found that increased level of RNT was associated with worse subjective cognition and increased memory complaints. Consistent with previous studies, our data demonstrates that higher level of RNT is related to worsecognitive function. In addition to this, this study found RNT was associated with cognitive domains except language skills. When participants were stratified by age and education level, a notable negative correlation was observed between RNT and cognitive function among older adults aged 60~69 years or junior high school and above. There are reasons why RNT does not correlate with cognitive function in older adults who are 80 to 90 years of age or have elementary school or below as follows. Increased brain aging in this age group may have altered the relationship between cognition and mood, or it may have weakened the association. The limited ability of older adults with low education level to perceive and express RNT resulted in a non-significant correlation between RNT and cognitive function.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms linking psychological disorder to cognitive function remain vague.

Firstly, in examining the association between RNT and cognitive function, the study eliminated as many bias-inducing factors as possible to ensure more reliable results through previous research and by conducting in-depth analyses that took into account a variety of possible potential confounders. Secondly, the study investigated the relationship between RNT and cognitive function through regression and subgroup analysis suggesting a negative association between RNT and cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults. In the future, the assessment of mental health can be incorporated into the health screening of older adults to comprehensively evaluate their health status. Health professionals and carers can enhance the assessment of RNT in older adults and identify problems promptly. By developing interventions to avoid further exacerbation of psychological problems in the elderly and increased risk of other diseases such as cognitive impairment.</p><p>However, there were limitations in the present study. First, a definitive causal relationship between RNT and cognitive function could not determine in this study since this study was a cross-sectional design. Secondly, since convenience sampling method was used in this study and all the participants in our study were selected only from Wuchan District and Hongshan District in Wuhan city, which suffered short time span, small sample size, and bad representativeness. In the future, multi-center and a longer time span cohort studies on the relationship between RNT and cognitive function should be carried out to further explore the mechanisms involved. Nonetheless, these findings have implications that are crucial to interventions that promote cognitive function in older adults.</p></div></div><div id="Sec14-section" data-title="Conclusion"><h2 id="Sec14">Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between RNT and cognitive function in Chinese older adults. After adjusting for a range of confounders, RNT is associated with cognitive function decline in older adults. The assessment of RNT levels in older adults can be enhanced, and psychological interventions and other measures can be taken to reduce RNT levels and further prevent cognitive decline.</p></div>

  In the contaminated area around Fukushima, Japan, scientists are studying the impact of radioactivity on the cognitive abilities of pollinating insects such as honeybees and giant hornets.       </p><div>
      
  <p><span><span>Bees and hornets are known to have a wide range of cognitive skills, including the ability to recognise colours and navigate in space. However, pollution by substances released into the environment by humans, such as pesticides, can impair their performance.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Olivier Armant, from the radionuclide ecology and ecotoxicology laboratory at the French ASNR nuclear safety and radiation protection authority, and Mathieu Lihoreau, an ethologist from the Research Centre on Animal Cognition at the Centre for Integrative Biology<a id="footnoteref1_022ysiz" title="CRCA-CBI (CNRS / Université de Toulouse III – Paul Sabatier - EPE)." href="#footnote1_022ysiz">1</a> wondered what effect ionising radiation might have on these pollinators. Armant works on the ecological impact of such radiation, carrying out long-term studies on the fauna and flora around Chernobyl (currently inaccessible, due to the war in Ukraine) and <span><a href="https://news.cnrs.fr/articles/learning-from-the-fukushima-decontamination">Fukushima, Japan,</a></span> while Lihoreau focuses on <span>bee intelligence</span> and the factors that may interfere with it.</span></span></p>
<h2><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Assessing cognitive performance</span></span></span></span></span></h2>
<p><span><span> <em>"A few years ago, a researcher in my lab came up with the idea of deploying various types of sensor to monitor, preferably automatically, the biological activity of certain species in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster," </em>Armant explains. "<em>We had three projects in mind: connected nest boxes, a system that measured the biotic parameters of water and – the one we chose – the method developed by Mathieu Lihoreau."&nbsp;</em><a id="footnoteref2_ky8e4dl" title="This work is the result of a joint call for projects between the CNRS, via its Mission for Transversal and Interdisciplinary Initiatives (MITI), and the former IRSN institute of radiation protection and nuclear safety, which has since merged with the ASN nuclear safety authority, forming the ASNR." href="#footnote2_ky8e4dl">2</a> For several years, the ethologist has been working on an automated system to assess the cognitive performance of these social insects. The device they use was designed in partnership with the Toulouse-based start-up BeeGuard, which manufactures connected beehives that enable real-time monitoring.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><em>"I study the learning and memory abilities of bees," </em>Lihoreau explains. <em>"Although this is primarily a fundamental research topic, it also has very concrete applications in ecotoxicology: if bees exhibit learning deficits in certain locations, it means there's a problem. For example, although many pesticides are used in doses that are low enough not to kill these insects, they end up as residues in the nectar they feed on and can have a neurotoxic effect. This results in cognitive disturbances that are difficult to observe, such as the inability to associate a reward with a specific colour or smell. Our system can measure these effects, which, although not lethal, are nonetheless serious, because they have a knock-on effect on the survival of colonies and, more generally, on pollination services."</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When disturbed in this way, bees begin to forage on flowers of different species, instead of focusing on just one. As a result, they no longer bring the right pollen to the right plants, which affects the entire ecosystem. The device developed by Lihoreau's team (made up of biologists, engineers, modellers and ecologists) had until now only been tested near Toulouse (southwestern France), rather than in the extreme conditions of an area like Fukushima, which the scientists were able to enter with the help of their Japanese colleagues.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"<em>We started collaborating with Japan just after the Fukushima disaster, in 2011,"</em><em> </em>Armant explains.<em> "We work in particular with Fukushima University's Institute of Environmental Radioactivity (IER), which help us to access the contaminated area. Our Japanese colleagues have extensive knowledge of the site and its forests, and they were able to direct us to the most interesting locations. This enabled us to carry out two field investigations in 2023 and 2024."</em></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The sites where the beehives were set up<a id="footnoteref3_wlqsdsc" title="As part of the BEERAD project to assess the effects of ionising radiation on bees, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR)." href="#footnote3_wlqsdsc">3</a> were selected on the basis of the soil contamination gradient for caesium-137. Local hornets, already present on the sites, were also included in the cognition study. Although it isn't clear whether these species are pollinators, they are worth studying, as they are descended from many generations of insects exposed to radiation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But just how do you carry out cognitive tests on an insect? <em>"The system is based on conventional experimental protocols developed in the laboratory over the past 50 years," </em>Lihoreau says. It uses a Y-shaped maze, in which the insect can choose between two branches illuminated by coloured LEDs, either blue or yellow. The insect needs to understand that it will be rewarded with sugar water, dispensed by a pump at the end of the branch, only if it chooses the right colour (blue or yellow, depending on the tests).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>A healthy bee needs 10 tests on average to find the correct path by following the right colours. <em>"This figure enables us to establish learning curves, which can then be compared to see if there is an impact on their ability to solve the problem," </em>Lihoreau adds.</span></span></p>
<h2><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Bees equipped with a QR Code</span></span></span></span></span></h2>
<p><span><span>The protocol used at Fukushima is automated. Each bee is equipped with a 2-mm-wide QR Code which is read by a camera, activating the opening of the maze. This customisation makes it possible to test the learning process of each insect, whose behaviour is filmed, analysed and sent in real time to a server. The whole operation is powered by solar panels.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Giant hornets, which are too big to enter the system, were tested manually in more traditional mazes. <em>"Our Japanese colleagues initially tried to dissuade us from handling them, because they are so dangerous," </em>Lihoreau recalls. <em>"However, the hornets are extremely useful for understanding the environmental impact of radioactive contamination, because these predators are at the top of the food chain and, unlike our honeybees, have always been present in the area, since well before the nuclear accident."</em></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Although the results of the study have yet to be published, scientists are already reporting a decline in insect cognition in the contaminated area of Fukushima Prefecture. <em>"We can see correlations," </em>Armant says. <em>"However, a causal link with radioactive contamination has not yet been established. But since the area is no longer inhabited, it is unlikely that the effect is due to factors such as pesticides."&nbsp;</em> </span><span>♦</span></span></span></p>
