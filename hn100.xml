<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><p>In the past three years Notion<!-- -->’<!-- -->s data has expanded 10x due to user and content growth, with a doubling rate of 6-12 months. Managing this rapid growth while meeting the ever-increasing data demands of critical product and analytics use cases, especially our recent Notion AI features, meant building and scaling Notion’s data lake. Here’s how we did it. </p><p>Everything you see in Notion—texts, images, headings, lists, database rows, pages, etc—despite differing front-end representations and behaviors, is modeled as a "block" entity in the back end and stored in the Postgres database with a consistent structure, schema, and associated metadata (learn more about <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/data-model-behind-notion">Notion's data model</a>).</p><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data Lake initial image" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=1920,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4rrziPDb4W1MWIJd9DU75F/ea42dabcf0bd96470958a47e4f80c1d2/Data_Lake_0.png 1x, https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4rrziPDb4W1MWIJd9DU75F/ea42dabcf0bd96470958a47e4f80c1d2/Data_Lake_0.png 2x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4rrziPDb4W1MWIJd9DU75F/ea42dabcf0bd96470958a47e4f80c1d2/Data_Lake_0.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Everything in Notion is a block, and these blocks are made up of data. Lots and lots of data. </p></figcaption></figure></div> <p>All this block data has been doubling every 6 to 12 months, driven by user activity and content creation. At the start of 2021 we had more than 20 billion block rows in Postgres, and this figure has since grown to more than two hundred billion blocks—a data volume of hundreds of terabytes, even when compressed.</p><div><p>To manage this data growth while enhancing the user experience, we’ve strategically expanded our database infrastructure from one Postgres instance to a more complex sharded architecture. We began in 2021 by <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/sharding-postgres-at-notion">horizontally sharding our Postgres database into 32 physical instances, each comprising 15 logical shards</a>, and continued in 2023 by <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/the-great-re-shard">increasing the number of physical instances to 96, with five logical shards per instance</a>. Thus we maintained a total of 480 logical shards while ensuring long-term scalable data management and retrieval capabilities.</p></div><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 1" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/64NhJVfqvEKp5e5n8efop3/338db6104a05a5bfc8a8eadc4fca73ec/Data_Lake_1.png 1x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/64NhJVfqvEKp5e5n8efop3/338db6104a05a5bfc8a8eadc4fca73ec/Data_Lake_1.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></figure></div> <p>By 2021 Postgres comprised the core of our production infrastructure, handling everything from online user traffic to various offline data analytics and machine learning needs. As the demands on both online and offline data increased, we realized it was essential to build a dedicated data infrastructure to handle offline data without interfering with online traffic.</p><div><p id="notion’s-data-warehouse-architecture-in-2021"><h2><span>Notion’s data warehouse architecture in 2021</span></h2></p></div><p>In 2021, we initiated this dedicated data infrastructure with a simple ELT (Extract, Load, and Transform) pipeline that used the third-party tool Fivetran to ingest data from the Postgres WAL (Write Ahead Log) to Snowflake and set up 480 hourly-run connectors for the 480 shards to write to the same number of raw Snowflake tables. We then merged these tables into a single large table for analytics, reporting, and machine learning use cases.</p><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 2" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=1920,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4eEtecJis4Q6Pb3PjC9yzf/3eeb2c4c820328192cde31262ec6ff99/Data_Lake_2.png 1x, https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4eEtecJis4Q6Pb3PjC9yzf/3eeb2c4c820328192cde31262ec6ff99/Data_Lake_2.png 2x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4eEtecJis4Q6Pb3PjC9yzf/3eeb2c4c820328192cde31262ec6ff99/Data_Lake_2.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></figure></div> <div><p><h3 id="scaling-challenges"><br>Scaling challenges</h3></p></div><p>As our Postgres data grew, we encountered several scaling challenges.</p><p><strong>Operability</strong></p><p>The overhead of monitoring and managing 480 Fivetran connectors, along with re-syncing them during Postgres re-sharding, upgrade, and maintenance periods, became extremely high, creating a significant on-call burden for team members.</p><p><strong>Speed, data freshness and cost</strong> </p><p>Ingesting data to Snowflake became slower and more costly, primarily due to Notion's unique update-heavy workload. Notion users update existing blocks (texts, headings, titles, bullet lists, database rows, etc) much more often than they add new ones. This causes block data to be predominantly update-heavy—90% of Notion upserts are updates. Most data warehouses, including Snowflake, are optimized for insert-heavy workloads, which makes it increasingly challenging for them to ingest block data.</p><p><strong>Use case support</strong></p><p>Data transformation logic became more complex and heavy, surpassing the capabilities of the standard SQL interface offered by off-the-shelf data warehouses. </p><div><ul><li><p>One important use case is constructing denormalized views of Notion’s block data for key products (e.g., AI and Search). Permission data, for example, ensures that only the right people can read or change a block (<a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/data-model-behind-notion">this blog</a> discusses Notion’s block permission model). But a block’s permission isn’t statically stored in the associated Postgres—it has to be constructed on the fly via expensive tree traversal computation.</p></li><li><p>In the following example, <code>block_1</code>, <code>block_2</code>, and <code>block_3 </code>inherit permissions from their immediate parents (<code>page_3 </code>and  <code>page_2</code>) and ancestors (<code>page_1 </code>and <code>workspace_a). </code>To build permission data for each of these blocks, we must traverse its ancestor tree all the way up to the root (<code>workspace_a</code>) in order to ensure completeness. With hundreds of billions of blocks whose ancestor depths ranged from a few to dozens, this kind of compute was very costly and would simply time out in Snowflake.</p></li></ul></div><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 3" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=1920,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/MydQ7FIKshSG7yHcqUBBh/730a7be57bebd5670132b0aa404cfbc2/Data_Lake_3.png 1x, https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/MydQ7FIKshSG7yHcqUBBh/730a7be57bebd5670132b0aa404cfbc2/Data_Lake_3.png 2x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/MydQ7FIKshSG7yHcqUBBh/730a7be57bebd5670132b0aa404cfbc2/Data_Lake_3.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Constructing permission data for each block requires traversing the entire ancestor tree.</p></figcaption></figure></div> <p>Because of these challenges, we started to explore building our data lake.</p><div><p id="building-and-scaling-notion’s-in-house-data-lake"><h2><span>Building and scaling Notion’s in-house data lake</span></h2></p></div><p>Here were our objectives for building an in-house data lake:</p><div><ul><li><p>Establish a data repository capable of storing both raw and processed data at scale.</p></li><li><p>Enable fast, scalable, operable, and cost-efficient data ingestion and computation for any workload—especially Notion's update-heavy block data.</p></li><li><p>Unlock AI, Search, and other product use cases that require denormalized data.</p></li></ul></div><p>However, while our data lake is a big step forward, it's important to clarify what it's not intended to do:</p><div><ul><li><p>Completely replace Snowflake. We’ll continue to benefit from Snowflake’s operational and ecosystem ease by using it for most other workloads, particularly those that are insert-heavy and don’t require large-scale denormalized tree traversal.</p></li><li><p>Completely replace Fivetran. We’ll continue taking advantage of Fivetran’s effectiveness with non-update heavy tables, small dataset ingestion, and diverse third-party data sources and destinations.</p></li><li><p>Support online use cases that require second-level or stricter latency. The Notion data lake will primarily focus on offline workloads that can tolerate minutes to hours of latency.</p></li></ul></div><div><p><h3 id="our-data-lake’s-high-level-design"><strong>Our data lake’s high-level design</strong></h3></p></div><p>Since 2022 we’ve used the in-house data lake architecture shown below. We ingest incrementally updated data from Postgres to Kafka using Debezium CDC connectors, then use <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/">Apache Hudi</a>, an open-source data processing and storage framework, to write these updates from Kafka to S3. With this raw data we can then do transformation, denormalization (e.g., tree traversal and permission data construction for each block), and enrichment, then store the processed data in S3 again or in downstream systems to serve analytics and reporting needs, as well as AI, Search, and other product requirements.</p><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 4" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/47gLr3QRSWQ9MpPbvE54Nf/2d232b1d4a0ea226f07852d6d824b490/Data_Lake_4.png 1x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/47gLr3QRSWQ9MpPbvE54Nf/2d232b1d4a0ea226f07852d6d824b490/Data_Lake_4.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Notion’s in-house data lake is built on Debezium CDC connector, Kafka, Hudi, Spark, and S3.</p></figcaption></figure></div> <p>Next we’ll describe and illustrate the design principles and decisions we arrived at after extensive research, discussion, and prototyping work.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-1-choosing-a-data-repository-and-lake"><strong>Design decision 1: Choosing a data repository and lake</strong></h3></p></div><p>Our first decision was to use S3 as a data repository and lake to store all raw and processed data, and position data warehouse and other product-facing data stores such as ElasticSearch, Vector Database, Key-Value store, etc as its downstream. We made this decision for two reasons:</p><div><ul><li><p>It aligned with Notion’s AWS tech stack, e.g., our Postgres database is based on AWS RDS and its export-to-S3 feature (described in later sections) allows us to easily bootstrap tables in S3.</p></li><li><p>S3 has proven its ability to store large amounts of data and support various data processing engines (like Spark) at low cost.</p></li></ul></div><p>By offloading heavy ingestion and compute workloads to S3 and only ingesting highly cleaned and business-critical data to Snowflake and product-facing data stores, we significantly improved data compute scalability and speed and reduced cost.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-2-choosing-our-processing-engine"><strong>Design decision 2: Choosing our processing engine</strong></h3></p></div><p>We chose Spark as our main data processing engine because as an open-source framework, it could be rapidly set up and evaluated to verify that it met our data transformation needs. Spark has four key benefits:</p><div><ul><li><p>Spark’s wide range of built-in functions and UDFs (User Defined Functions) beyond SQL enable complex data processing logics like tree traversal and block data denormalization, as described above.</p></li><li><p>It offers a user-friendly PySpark framework for most lighter use cases, and advanced Scala Spark for high-performance, heavy data processing.</p></li><li><p>It processes large-scale data (e.g., billions of blocks and hundreds of terabytes) in a distributed manner, and exposes extensive configurations, which allows us to fine-tune our control over partitioning, data skewness, and resource allocation. It also enables us to break down complex jobs into smaller tasks and optimize resourcing for each task, which helps us achieve reasonable runtime without over-provisioning or wasting resources.</p></li><li><p>Finally, Spark’s open-source nature offers cost-efficiency benefits.</p></li></ul></div><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-3-preference-for-incremental-ingestion-over-snapshot-dump">Design decision 3: Preference for incremental ingestion over snapshot dump</h3></p></div><p>After finalizing our data lake storage and processing engine, we explored solutions for ingesting Postgres data to S3. We wound up considering two approaches: incremental ingestion of changed data and periodic full snapshots of Postgres tables. In the end, based on performance and cost comparisons, we opted for a hybrid design:</p><div><ul><li><p><strong>During normal operations, incrementally ingest and continuously apply changed Postgres data to S3.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>In rare cases, take a full Postgres snapshot once to bootstrap tables in S3.</strong></p></li></ul></div><p>The incremental approach ensures fresher data at lower cost and with minimal delay (a few minutes to a couple hours, depending on table size). Taking a full snapshot and dumping to S3, by contrast, takes more than 10 hours and costs twice as much, so we do so infrequently, when bootstraping new tables in S3.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-4-streamlining-incremental-ingestion"><strong>Design decision 4: Streamlining incremental ingestion</strong></h3></p></div><div><ul><li><p><strong>Kafka CDC Connector for Postgres → to → Kafka</strong></p></li></ul></div><p>We chose the Kafka Debezium CDC (Change Data Capture) connector to publish incrementally changed Postgres data to Kafka, similar to Fivetran’s data ingestion method. We chose it together with Kafka for their scalability, ease of setup, and close integration with our existing infrastructure. </p><div><ul><li><p><strong>Hudi for Kafka → to → S3</strong></p></li></ul></div><div><p>To ingest the incremental data from Kafka to S3, we considered three excellent data lake and ingestion solutions: <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/">Apache Hudi</a>, <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/">Apache Iceberg</a>, and <a href="https://delta.io/">DataBricks Delta Lake</a>. In the end we chose Hudi for its excellent performance with our update-heavy workload and its open-source nature and native <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC+-+39+Deltastreamer+source+for+debezium+CDC+logs">integration with Debezium CDC messages</a>.</p></div><p>Iceberg and Delta Lake, on the other hand, weren’t optimized for our update-heavy workload when we considered them in 2022. Iceberg also lacked an out-of-box solution that understands Debezium messages; Delta Lake does have one, but it isn’t open source. We would have had to implement our own Debezium consumer if we’d gone with either of those solutions.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-5-ingest-raw-data-before-processing"><strong>Design decision 5: Ingest raw data before processing</strong></h3></p></div><p>Finally, we decided to ingest raw Postgres data to S3 without on-the-fly processing in order to establish a single source of truth and simplify debugging across the entire data pipeline. Once raw data is in S3, we then do transformation, denormalization, enrichment, and other types of data processing. We store intermediate data in S3 again and only ingest highly cleaned, structured, and business-critical data to downstream systems for analytics, reporting, and product needs.</p><div><p id="scaling-and-operating-our-data-lake"><h2><span>Scaling and operating our data lake</span></h2></p></div><p>We experimented with many detailed setups in order to tackle the scalability challenges associated with Notion’s ever-increasing data volume. Here's what we tried and how it went:</p><p><strong>1. CDC connector and Kafka setup</strong></p><p>We set up one Debezium CDC connector per Postgres host and deploy them in an AWS EKS cluster. Because of the maturity of Debezium and EKS management and Kafka's scalability, we’ve only had to upgrade the EKS and Kafka clusters a few times in the past two years. As of May 2024, it smoothly handles tens of MB/sec of Postgres row changes.</p><p>We also configure one Kafka topic per Postgres table and let all connectors consuming from 480 shards write to the same topic for that table. This setup significantly reduced the complexity of maintaining 480 topics for each table and simplified downstream Hudi ingestion to S3, significantly reducing operational overhead.</p><p><strong>2. Hudi setup</strong></p><p>We used <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/docs/0.10.0/hoodie_deltastreamer/">Apache Hudi Deltastreamer</a>, a Spark-based ingestion job, to consume Kafka messages and replicate the state of Postgres table in S3. After several rounds of performance tuning, we established a fast, scalable ingestion setup to ensure data freshness. This setup provides a delay of just a few minutes for most tables, and up to two hours for the largest one, the block table (see graphic below).</p><div><ul><li><p>We use the default COPY_ON_WRITE Hudi table type with UPSERT operation, which suits our update-heavy workload.</p></li><li><p>To manage data more effectively and minimize write amplification (i.e., the number of files updated per batched ingestion run), we fine-tuned three configurations: </p><div><ul><li><p>Partition/shard data using the same Postgres shard scheme, i.e., the  <code>hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field: db_schema_source_partition</code> config.

Spark data processing setup</strong>For the majority of our data processing jobs we utilize PySpark, whose relatively low learning curve makes it accessible to many team members. For more complex jobs such as tree traversal and denormalization, we leverage Spark’s superior performance in several key areas:</p><div><ul><li><p>We benefit from the performance efficiency of the Scala Spark.</p></li><li><p>We manage data more effectively by handling large and small shards separately (remember we kept the same 480 shards scheme in S3 to be consistent with Postgres); small shards have their entire data loaded into the Spark task container memory for fast processing, whereas large shards that exceed memory capacity are managed through disk reshuffling.</p></li><li><p>We utilize multi-threading and parallel processing to speed up processing of 480 shards, allowing us to optimize runtime and efficiency.</p></li></ul></div><p><strong>4. Bootstrap setup</strong></p><p>Here's how we bootstrap new tables:</p><div><ul><li><p>We first set up Debezium Connector to ingest Postgres changes to Kafka.</p></li><li><p>Starting from timestamp <code>t</code>, we kick off a AWS RDS-provided export-to-S3 job to save the latest snapshot of Postgres tables to S3. We then create a Spark job to read those data from S3 and write them to the Hudi table format.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we ensure that all changes made during the snapshotting process are captured by setting up Deltastreamer to read from Kafka messages from <code>t</code>. This step is crucial for maintaining data completeness and integrity.</p></li></ul></div><p>Thanks to the scalability of Spark and Hudi, these three steps usually complete within 24 hours, allowing us to perform re-bootstrap with manageable time to accommodate new table asks and Postgres upgrade and re-sharding operations.</p><div><p id="the-payoff-less-money-more-time-stronger-infrastructure-for-ai"><h2><span>The payoff: less money, more time, stronger infrastructure for AI</span></h2></p></div><p>We started developing our data lake infrastructure in the spring of 2022 and completed it by that fall. Due to the infra's inherently scalable nature, we were able to continually optimize and expand the Debezium EKS clusters, Kafka clusters, Deltastreamer, and Spark job to keep up with Notion's 6-to-12 month data doubling rate without significant overhauls. The payoff was significant:</p><div><ul><li><p>Moving several large, crucial Postgres datasets (some of them tens of TB large) to data lake gave us a net savings of over a million dollars for 2022 and proportionally higher savings in 2023 and 2024.</p></li><li><p>For these datasets, the end-to-end ingestion time from Postgres to S3 and Snowflake decreased from more than a day to a few minutes for small tables and up to a couple of hours for large ones. Re-syncs, when necessary, can be completed within 24 hours without overloading live databases.</p></li><li><p>Most importantly, the changeover unlocked massive data storage, compute, and freshness savings from a variety of analytics and product asks, enabling the successful rollout of Notion AI features in 2023 and 2024. Stay tuned for a detailed post on our Search and AI Embedding RAG Infra built on top of the data lake!</p></li></ul></div><p>We’d like to thank OneHouse and the Hudi open source community for their tremendous and timely support. Great open source support was crucial to our ability to spin up the data lake in just a few months.</p><p><i>As our needs grow and diversify, we continue to enhance our data lake by building automated and self-service frameworks to empower more engineers to manage and develop product use cases based on the data.</i></p><p><i>Interested in helping us build the next generation of Notion’s data management?

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://thasso.xyz/2024/07/13/setting-up-an-x86-cpu.html">https://thasso.xyz/2024/07/13/setting-up-an-x86-cpu.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40959742">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>People say there are things that are complex and there are things that are just complicated. Complexity is considered interesting, complicatedness is considered harmful. The process of setting up an x86_64 CPU is mostly complicated.</p><p>I’ll describe one way to go from a boot sector loaded by the BIOS with the CPU in 16-bit real mode to the CPU set up in 64-bit long mode. The setup is pretty bare-bones and there’s tons more to do.</p><p>To follow along, you need the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual</a>, an assembler (I used <a href="https://www.nasm.us/">nasm</a>), and <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>. If you don’t have an x86_64 CPU, you should still be able to run everything I describe by emulating an x86 CPU in QEMU. I assume you know x86 assembly and the syntax that nasm uses. I like the <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/">nasm tutorial by Ray Toal</a> for getting started.</p><p>I was surprised by how readable some of the Intel manual is. The initial chapters in volume 1 do a really good job at providing an overview of the system and explaining the terms used throughout the other volumes. But volume 3: System Programming Guide is most relevant to this discussion. There is an overview of all the operating modes in volume 3, section 2.2 Modes of Operation. The path we’re taking is highlighted in red.</p><p><img src="https://thasso.xyz/public/figures/x86-mode-transitions.png" alt="Overview of x86 mode transitions"></p><p>For everything up to 32-bit mode, take a look at <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf">“Writing a Simple Operating System – from Scratch”</a>. It’s unfinished but still very good.</p><h2 id="starting-point-bios"> Starting Point: BIOS <a href="#starting-point-bios"></a></h2><p>After a reset, the x86 CPU is in “real mode”. That mode has a default operand size of 16 bits. You get a 20-bit address space and thus the ability to address 1MB of memory by using segmentation. Real mode is pretty much a backward compatibility mode for the Intel 8086 chip from 1978.</p><p>After the BIOS the first code that runs is that in the boot sector. The BIOS searches the system for a disk where the first sector ends in the magic number <code>0xaa55</code> (i.e., the byte <code>0x55</code> followed by the byte <code>0xaa</code>). It loads that “boot sector” to memory at address <code>0x7c00</code>.</p><p>So the BIOS gives us 512 bytes to work with. We need to use these bytes in order to bootstrap the rest of the bootloader. <a href="https://github.com/jart/sectorlisp">One can fit a surprising amount of stuff in 512 bytes</a>, but it’s easiest to just load some more data from disk first. Fortunately, routines defined by the BIOS remain available to us as long as we’re in real mode.</p><h2 id="boot-sector-setup"> Boot Sector Setup <a href="#boot-sector-setup"></a></h2><p>Let’s set up a simple boot sector. It will just print a message to the screen using BIOS routines and then hang. This way, we know that the tooling works.</p><p>This is the assembly we need:</p><div><pre><code><span>;; src/boot_sector.s</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The linker script <code>linker.ld</code> is important because it makes sure that the code in our boot sector is relocated to the right address in the final image. Specifically, the bootloader loads the boot sector to address <code>0x7c00</code> in memory. So that’s the base address to relocate the boot sector to. In addition, the linker will add the magic number at the end of the boot sector. Other guides I’ve seen do both the offset and the magic number inside the boot sector assembly source file by using features of the assembler, but that’s somewhat hackish.</p><pre><code># linker.ld

Stage 1 is the code in the boot sector. It is everything that the BIOS loads for us. The sole purpose of stage 1 is to load stage 2 into memory. Stage 1 does this by using BIOS-provided routines to load stage 2 into memory.</p><p>In stage 2, we’ll switch from 16-bit real mode to 32-bit protected mode. In protected mode, we can’t use BIOS routines anymore. Without BIOS routines, loading sectors from a disk would become much more involved. So we’ll load a number of sectors from disk into memory and hope for the best. Of course, this is an unsafe technique, but it works for now.</p><p>This is how one can access the disk using BIOS.

In protected mode, segmentation is used by default to implement memory protection. Before switching to protected mode, you need to define a Global Descriptor Table (GDT) that contains segment descriptors for all the segments you want to define. Usually, paging is used in favor of segmentation. In fact, in 64-bit long mode, you need to use paging. But for the initial switch to protected mode, segmentation is required.</p><p>The Intel manual describes the “flat model” as a very simple segmentation model that can be implemented in the GDT. The “flat model” comprises a code segment and a data segment. Both of these segments are mapped to the entire linear address space (their base addresses and limits are identical). Using the simplest of all models is fine, since we just want to get to long mode and abandon segmentation in favor of paging.</p><p>The GDT is defined as a contiguous structure in memory. You fill a chunk of memory with the right data and give the CPU the address and the length of the memory chunk. The format of the GDT structure is described in the Intel manual.</p><p>From section “3.4.5 Segment Descriptors”:</p><p><img src="https://thasso.xyz/public/figures/segment-descriptor-layout.png" alt="Screenshot of segment descriptor layout"></p><p>The GDT is just an array of segment descriptors with a “null descriptor” at the start that’s used to catch invalid translations.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>
        We are trying to build the simplest git collaboration tool. The goal is to make
        self-hosting a git server as simple as running an SSH server -- all without
        sacrificing external collaborators time and energy.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <code>git format-patch</code> isn't the problem and pull requests aren't the solution.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        We are combining mailing list and pull request workflows. In order to build the
        simplest collaboration tool, we needed something as simple as generating patches
        but the ease-of-use of pull requests.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is not to create another code forge here. The goal is to create a very
        simple self-hosted git solution with the ability to collaborate with external
        contributors. All the code owner needs to setup a running git server:
      </p>

      <ul><li>A single golang binary</li></ul>

      <p>
        All an external contributor needs is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>An SSH keypair</li>
        <li>An SSH client</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>the problem</h2>

      <p>
        Email is great as a decentralized system to send and receive changes (patchsets)
        to a git repo. However, onboarding a new user to a mailing list, properly
        setting up their email client, and then finally submitting the code contribution
        is enough to make many developers give up. Further, because we are leveraging
        the email protocol for collaboration, we are limited by its feature-set. For
        example, it is not possible to make edits to emails, everyone has a different
        client, those clients have different limitations around plain text email and
        downloading patches from it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Github pull requests are easy to use, easy to edit, and easy to manage. The
        downside is it forces the user to be inside their website to perform reviews.
        For quick changes, this is great, but when you start reading code within a web
        browser, there are quite a few downsides. At a certain point, it makes more
        sense to review code inside your local development environment, IDE, etc. There
        are tools and plugins that allow users to review PRs inside their IDE, but it
        requires a herculean effort to make it usable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further, self-hosted solutions that mimic a pull request require a lot of
        infrastructure in order to manage it. A database, a web site connected to git,
        admin management, and services to manage it all. Another big point of friction:
        before an external user submits a code change, they first need to create an
        account and then login. This adds quite a bit of friction for a self-hosted
        solution, not only for an external contributor, but also for the code owner who
        has to provision the infra. Often times they also have to fork the repo within
        the code forge before submitting a PR. Then they never make a contribution ever
        again and keep a forked repo around forever. That seems silly.
      </p>

      <h2>introducing patch requests (PR)</h2>

      <p>
        Instead, we want to create a self-hosted git "server" that can handle sending
        and receiving patches without the cumbersome nature of setting up email or the
        limitations imposed by the email protocol. Further, we want the primary workflow
        to surround the local development environment. Github is bringing the IDE to the
        browser in order to support their workflow, we want to flip that idea on its
        head by making code reviews a first-class citizen inside your local development
        environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        We see this as a hybrid between the github workflow of a pull request and
        sending and receiving patches over email.
      </p>

      <p>
        The basic idea is to leverage an SSH app to handle most of the interaction
        between contributor and owner of a project. Everything can be done completely
        within the terminal, in a way that is ergonomic and fully featured.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notifications would happen with RSS and all state mutations would result in the
        generation of static web assets so it can all be hosted using a simple file web
        server.
      </p>

      <h3>format-patch workflow</h3>

      <p>
        The fundamental collaboration tool here is <code>format-patch</code>. Whether you a
        submitting code changes or you are reviewing code changes, it all happens in
        code. Both contributor and owner are simply creating new commits and generating
        patches on top of each other. This obviates the need to have a web viewer where
        the reviewing can "comment" on a line of code block. There's no need, apply the
        contributor's patches, write comments or code changes, generate a new patch,
        send the patch to the git server as a "review." This flow also works the exact
        same if two users are collaborating on a set of changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This also solves the problem of sending multiple patchsets for the same code
        change. There's a single, central Patch Request where all changes and
        collaboration happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        We could figure out a way to leverage <code>git notes</code> for reviews / comments, but
        honestly, that solution feels brutal and outside the comfort level of most git
        users. Just send reviews as code and write comments in the programming language
        you are using. It's the job of the contributor to "address" those comments and
        then remove them in subsequent patches. This is the forcing function to address
        all comments: the patch won't be merged if there are comment unaddressed in
        code; they cannot be ignored or else they will be upstreamed erroneously.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in one’s Google location data. It’s willingly shared with Google. <a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/224489.P.pdf">United States v. Chatrie</a>, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 16692 (4th Cir. July 9, 2024) (2-1):</p><div>
<p>Location History is turned off by default, so a user must take several affirmative steps before Google begins tracking and storing his Location History data. First, he must enable location sharing on his mobile device. Second, he must opt in to the Location History setting on his Google account, either through an internet browser, a Google application (such as Google Maps), or his device settings (for Android devices). Before he can activate the setting, however, Google always presents him language that explains the basics of the service. Third, he must enable the “Location Reporting” feature on his mobile device. And fourth, he must sign in to his Google account on that device. Only when a user follows these steps will Google begin tracking and storing his Location History data. Roughly one-third of active Google users have enabled Location History.</p>



<p>Even after a user opts in, he maintains some control over his location data. He can review, edit, or delete any information that Google has already obtained. So, for instance, he could decide he only wants to keep data for certain dates and to delete the rest. Or he could decide to delete everything. Google also allows him to pause (i.e., disable) the collection of future Location History data. Whatever his choice, Google will honor it. From start to finish, then, the user controls how much Google tracks and stores his Location History data.</p>



<p>Once a user enables Location History, Google constantly monitors his location through GPS, even when he isn’t using his phone. And if he has an Android phone, he can turn on another setting—”Google Location Accuracy”—that enables Google to determine his location using more inputs than just GPS, such as Wi-Fi access points and mobile networks. As a result, Location History can be more precise than other location-tracking mechanisms, including cell-site location information. But whether Google Location Accuracy is activated or not, Location History’s power should not be exaggerated. In the end, it is only an estimate of a device’s location. So when Google records a set of location coordinates, it includes a value (measured in meters) called a “confidence interval,” which represents Google’s confidence in the accuracy of the estimate. Google represents that for any given location point, there is a 68% chance that a user is somewhere within the confidence interval.</p>



<p>Google stores all Location History data in a repository called the “Sensorvault.” The Sensorvault assigns each device a unique identification number and maintains all Location History data associated with that device. Google then uses this data to build aggregate models to assist applications like Google Maps.</p>



<p>In 2016, Google began receiving “geofence warrants” from law enforcement seeking to access location information. A geofence warrant requires Google to produce Location History data for all users who were within a geographic area (called a geofence) during a particular time period. Since 2016, geofence requests have skyrocketed in number: Google claims it saw a 1,500% increase in requests from 2017 to 2018 and a 500% increase from 2018 to 2019. Concerned with the potential threat to user privacy, Google consulted internal counsel and law enforcement agencies in 2018 and developed its own three-step procedure for responding to geofence requests. Since then, Google has objected to any geofence request that disregards this procedure.</p>



<p>Google’s procedure works as follows: At Step One, law enforcement obtains a warrant [*8] that compels Google to disclose an anonymous list of users whose Location History shows they were within the geofence during a specified timeframe. But Google does not keep any lists like this on-hand. So it must first comb through its entire Location History repository to identify users who were present in the geofence. Google then gives law enforcement a list that includes for each user an anonymized device number, the latitude and longitude coordinates and timestamp of each location point, a confidence interval, and the source of the stored Location History (such as GPS or Wi-Fi). Before disclosing this information, Google reviews the request and objects if Google deems it overly broad.</p>



<p>At Step Two, law enforcement reviews the information it receives from Google. If it determines that it needs more, then law enforcement can ask Google to produce additional location coordinates. This time, the original geographical and temporal limits no longer apply; for any user identified at Step One, law enforcement can request information about his movements inside and outside the geofence over a broader period. Yet Google generally requires law enforcement to narrow its request for this more expansive location data to only a subset of the users pinpointed in Step One.</p>



<p>Finally, at Step Three, law enforcement determines which individuals are relevant to the investigation and then compels Google to provide their account-identifying information (usually their names and email addresses). Here, too, Google typically requires law enforcement to taper its request from the previous step, so law enforcement can’t merely request the identity of every user identified in Step Two.</p>

<h2>NVIDIA Warp Documentation<a href="#nvidia-warp-documentation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code. Warp takes
regular Python functions and JIT compiles them to efficient kernel code that can run on the CPU or GPU.</p>
<p>Warp is designed for spatial computing and comes with a rich set of primitives that make it easy to write
programs for physics simulation, perception, robotics, and geometry processing. In addition, Warp kernels
are differentiable and can be used as part of machine-learning pipelines with frameworks such as PyTorch and JAX.</p>
<p>Below are some examples of simulations implemented using Warp:</p>

<section id="quickstart">
<h2>Quickstart<a href="#quickstart" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to install Warp is from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/warp-lang">PyPI</a>:</p>

<p>The binaries hosted on PyPI are currently built with the CUDA 11.8 runtime.
Users requiring a newer CUDA runtime in Warp can build Warp from source or
install wheels hosted on GitHub as described in <a href="https://nvidia.github.io/warp/installation.html#github-installation"><span>Installing from GitHub Releases</span></a>.</p>

<h2>Additional Examples<a href="#additional-examples" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp/tree/main/warp/examples">warp/examples</a> directory in
the Github repository contains a number of scripts categorized under different subdirectories
that show how to implement different simulation methods using the Warp API. Most examples
will generate USD files containing time-sampled animations in the
same directory as the example.
Before running examples, users should ensure that the <code><span>usd-core</span></code>, <code><span>matplotlib</span></code>, and <code><span>pyglet</span></code> packages are installed using:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>usd</span><span>-</span><span>core</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>pyglet</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Examples can be run from the command-line as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>python</span> <span>-</span><span>m</span> <span>warp</span><span>.</span><span>examples</span><span>.&lt;</span><span>example_subdir</span><span>&gt;.&lt;</span><span>example</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Most examples can be run on either the CPU or a CUDA-capable device, but a handful require a CUDA-capable device. These are marked at the top of the example script.</p>
<p>USD files can be viewed or rendered inside NVIDIA
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse">Omniverse</a>,
Pixar’s UsdView, and Blender. Note that Preview in macOS is not
recommended as it has limited support for time-sampled animations.</p>
<p>Built-in unit tests can be run from the command-line as follows:</p>

<h2>Omniverse<a href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Omniverse extensions for Warp are available in the extension registry inside
Omniverse Kit or USD Composer.
The <code><span>omni.warp.core</span></code> extension installs Warp into the Omniverse Application’s
Python environment, which allows users to import the module in their scripts and nodes.
The <code><span>omni.warp</span></code> extension provides a collection of OmniGraph nodes and sample

<p>Versions take the format X.Y.Z, similar to <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/development-cycle/#devcycle">Python itself</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increments in X are reserved for major reworks of the project causing disruptive incompatibility (or reaching the 1.0 milestone).</p></li>
<li><p>Increments in Y are for regular releases with a new set of features.</p></li>
<li><p>Increments in Z are for bug fixes. In principle there are no new features. Can be omitted if 0 or not relevant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> but less strict around backward compatibility.
Like with Python, some breaking changes can be present between minor versions if well documented and gradually introduced.</p>

(AP) — <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></span> was the target of an apparent assassination attempt Saturday at a Pennsylvania rally and said afterward that he was shot in the ear. The barrage of gunfire set off panic among thousands of attendees and a dramatic scene in which a bloodied Trump was surrounded by Secret Service and then escorted to his SUV as he pumped his first in a show of defiance. </p><p>Trump’s campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing “fine” after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p><p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place,” he wrote on his social media site.</p><p>Rallygoers screamed in panic. Shouts of “Get down!” rang through the crowd. At least one attendee was dead and two spectators were critically injured, authorities said. The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter — who it said attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue, a farm show in Butler, Pennsylvania — and that Trump was safe.</p><p>The attack was the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It came in a deeply polarized political atmosphere, just four months from the presidential elections and days before Trump is to be officially named the Republican nominee at <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/republican-national-convention">his party’s convention</a></span> — which his campaign said would proceed as planned. </p>
    


<p>“There’s no place in America for this type of violence,” President Joe Biden, who is running against Trump as the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in remarks. “It’s sick. It’s sick.”</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            </div><p>Two officials spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. They said the shooter was not an attendee at the rally and was killed by U.S. Secret Service agents. </p><p>The officials said the shooter was engaged by members of the U.S. Secret Service counterassault team. The heavily armed tactical team travels everywhere with the president and major party nominees and is meant to confront any active threats while other agents focus on safeguarding and evacuating the person at the center of protection.</p><p>Law enforcement recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene, according to a third person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.</p><p>Many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.”</p><p>There was no immediate information on the shooter or their motivations.</p>
    

    

    

<h2>A rally disrupted by gunfire</h2><p>Trump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the apparent shots began just after 6:10 p.m. It took two minutes from the moment of the first shot for Trump to be placed in a waiting SUV.</p><p>As Trump was talking, a popping sound was heard, and the former president put his right hand up to his right ear, as people in the stands behind him appeared to be shocked.</p>



<p>As the first pop rang out, Trump said, “Oh,” and grabbed his ear as two more pops could be heard and he crouched down. More shots were heard then.</p><p>Someone could be heard saying near the microphone at Trump’s lectern, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents tackled the former president. They piled atop him to shield him with their bodies, as is their training protocol, as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat.</p><div data-align-center="">

                </div><p>The crowd cheered as he got back up and pumped his fist.</p><p>His motorcade left the venue moments later. Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle. </p><h2>Witnesses heard multiple gunshots and ducked for cover</h2><p>“Everybody went to their knees or their prone position, because we all knew, everyone becoming aware of the fact this was gunfire,” said Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, who was sitting to Trump’s right on stage. </p><p>As he saw Trump raise his fist, McCormick said, he looked over his shoulder and noticed someone had been hit while sitting in the bleachers behind the stage. </p><p>Eventually, first responders were able to carry the injured person out of a large crowd so he could get medical care, McCormick said. </p><p>Reporters covering the rally heard five or six shots ring out and many ducked for cover, hiding under tables. After the first two or three bangs, people in the crowd looked startled, but not panicked. An AP reporter at the scene reported the noise sounded like firecrackers at first or perhaps a car backfiring.</p><p>When it was clear the situation had been contained and that Trump would not be returning to speak, attendees started filing out of the venue. One man in an electric wheelchair got stuck on the field when his chair’s battery died. Others tried to help him move.</p><div data-override-title="true" data-hide-title="false" data-align-center="" data-carousel-enhancement="">

        </div><p>Police soon told the people remaining to leave the venue and Secret Service agents told reporters to get “out now. This is a live crime scene.”</p><p>Two firefighters from nearby Steubenville, Ohio, who were at the rally told the AP that they helped people who appeared injured and heard bullets hitting broadcast speakers.</p><p>“The bullets rattled around the grandstand, one hit the speaker tower and then chaos broke. We hit the ground and then the police converged into the grandstands, said Chris Takach.</p><p>“The first thing I heard is a couple of cracks,” Dave Sullivan said.</p><p>Sullivan said he saw one of the speakers get hit and bullets rattling and, “we hit the deck.”</p><p>He said once Secret Service and other authorities converged on Trump, he and Takach assisted two people who may have been shot in the grandstand and cleared a path to get them out of the way.</p><p>“Just a sad day for America,” Sullivan said.</p><p>“After we heard the shots got fired, then the hydraulic line was spraying all around, you could see the hydraulic fluid coming out of it. And then the speaker tower started to fall down,” Sullivan said. “Then we heard another shot that, you could hear, you knew something was, it was bullets. It wasn’t firecrackers.”</p><h2>Political violence again shakes America</h2><p>The perils of campaigning took on a new urgency after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in California in 1968, and again in 1972 when Arthur Bremer shot and seriously hurt George Wallace, who was running as an independent on a campaign platform that has sometimes been compared to Trump’s. That led to increased protection of candidates, even as the threats persisted, notably against Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008.</p><p>Presidents, particularly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, have even greater layers of security. Trump is a rarity as both a former president and a current candidate.</p><p>Biden was briefed on the incident, the White House said. He received an updated briefing from Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall.</p><p>He told reporters after 8 p.m. that he hadn’t been able to reach Trump yet but was briefed that the former president was “doing well.”</p><p>“I hope I get to speak to him tonight,” he said. </p><p>Mayorkas, whose department oversees the Secret Service, said officials were engaged with the Biden and Trump campaigns and “taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.”</p><p>Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., posted a photo on X of Trump, his fist raised and his face bloody in front of an American flag, with the words: “He’ll never stop fighting to Save America.”</p><p>North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the three men on Trump’s shortlist for vice president, all quickly sent out statements expressing concern for the former president, with Rubio sharing an image taken as Trump was escorted off stage with his fist in the air and a streak of blood on his face along with the words “God protected President Trump.”</p><p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said in a statement on X that he had been briefed on the situation and Pennsylvania state police were on hand at the rally site.</p><p>“Violence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable. It has no place in Pennsylvania or the United States,” he said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Colvin, Balsamo and Price reported from New York. Long reported from Washington.

<p>The incident unfolded as Trump was giving a speech at the rally in Pennsylvania. Suddenly, he appeared to fall to the ground clutching his ear.</p><p>He was quickly surrounded by armed security and stayed down for around a minute. Screams from the audience rang out as the scene unfolded.</p><p>Trump then rose to his feet, pumped his fist in the air, and shouted "fight", before being whisked off stage and into a vehicle.</p><p>He was quickly driven away from the scene. Video appeared to show blood coming from his ear as he left the stage.</p><p>The US Secret Service said Trump was now "safe" and that it had implemented protective measures around him.</p>     <div data-component-name="sdc-article-strapline">

immutable. All API access is secured with mutual TLS (mTLS)
authentication.</p></div><div><h3>Predictability</h3><p>Talos eliminates configuration drift, reduces unknown factors by
employing immutable infrastructure ideology, and delivers atomic
updates.</p></div><div><h3>Evolvability</h3><p>Talos simplifies your architecture, increases your agility, and always
delivers current stable Kubernetes and Linux versions.</p></div></div></div><div><h2>Features</h2><div><div><h3>Minimal</h3><p>Talos consists of only a handful of binaries and shared libraries:
just enough to run containerd and a small set of system services.</p><p>This aligns with NIST's recommendation in the Application Container
Security Guide.</p></div><div><h3>Hardened</h3><p>Hardened by design:</p><ul><li>Built with the Kernel Self Protection Project configuration
recommendations.</li><li>All access to the API is secured with Mutual TLS.</li><li>Settings and configuration described in the CIS guidelines are
applied by default.</li></ul></div><div><h3>Immutable</h3><p>Talos improves security further by mounting the root filesystem as
read-only and removing any host-level such as a shell and SSH.</p></div><div><h3>Ephemeral</h3><p>Talos runs in memory from a SquashFS, and persists nothing, leaving
the primary disk entirely to Kubernetes.</p></div><div><h3>Current</h3><p>Delivers the latest stable versions of Kubernetes and Linux.</p></div></div></div><div><p><img width="142" src="https://www.talos.dev/images/certified-kubernetes-color.png" alt="Certified Kubernetes"></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><a href="https://homedoctorbook.com/book/#aff=aboel3z" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Home Doctor - Practical Medicine for Every Household</a><span> - is a 304 page doctor written and approved guide on how to manage most health situations when help is not on the way.</span></em></p><p>In July of 2010 I was 22 and working at a Social Gaming startup in California. I'd just graduated and this was my first real job. I had a pay check and an apartment. I felt grown-up, for the first time.</p><p>I was one of two 'engineers' writing code for the company's flagship product, an RPG. I'd studied Philosophy in college, and that meant that, while I knew how to think through a problem, my knowledge of best practices, and sensible design patterns was minimal. I wielded my basic LAMP knowledge, with incredible enthusiasm.</p><p>The game designers (my overlords) often took inspiration from World of Warcraft, the blisteringly successful MMO produced by Blizzard. At that time, WoW's 'Raids' feature, was being met by audiences with unsurpassed excitement and engagement. It was something that we wanted to emulate in our game very badly.</p><p>I was landed with the task of implementing Raids for our game. My team-mate (Sam) was stuck with an enormous refactor, and I felt lucky to be working on something new and exciting.</p><p>One of the peculiarities of my development environment was that I ran all my code against the production database. Looking back, it's baffling that we did this, and it's laughable that I didn't know enough to question it.</p><p>I would inspect MySQL tables using a client, that had a GUI with a slick OSXy interface .. a far cry from phpmyadmin. Part of my naive testing process involved manually clearing the RAIDS table, to then recreate it programatically.</p><p>The monotony of this task lulled me into a stupor, and one lazy Tuesday afternoon found me drowsy, cursor hovering over the USERS table icon, to then bring up its menu and click 'clear'.</p><p>The implications of what I'd just done didn't immediately hit me. I first had a truly out-of-body experience, seeming to hover above the darkened room of hackers, each hunched over glowing terminals.</p><p>So what were the implications? The game had tens of thousands of paying customers. Users who'd paid to buy special items within the game to enhance their character stats. All of these character stats were stored in the USERS table, now void.</p><p>About a minute later, one of the content managers walked into the room. "I think there's a problem", she said. I spoke up, "Yeah. I know what's wrong".</p><p>I found myself on the phone to Rackspace, leaning on a desk for support, listening to their engineer patiently explain that backups for this MySQL instance had been cancelled over 2 months ago. Ah.</p><p>By late afternoon, a greasy layer of uneasiness had settled thickly on top of the building. People knew that something was wrong, but only a few knew what was wrong. I had been pulled into an emergency 'engineers + higher-ups' meeting in the conference room.</p><p>The CEO leaned across the table, got in my face, and said, "this, is a monumental fuck up. You're gonna cost us millions in revenue". His co-founder (remotely present via Skype) chimed in "you're lucky to still be here".</p><p>As a company we spent the next few days doing damage control. All work on games ceased. The technical crew tried to stitch together a likely semblance of the USERS table, based on data in other tables. The non-technical crew dealt with angry customers, and did data entry, for those claiming to remember their stats perfectly. I for one didn't go home for three days straight. I stank.</p><p>At no point was it publicly announced that I was responsible for all this. An email was sent out claiming that a 'junior engineer' was responsible. I was one of two people who could be considered 'junior'.</p><p>Within three days, it was clear that everyone knew it was me. People treated me differently. For a select few, there was a new empathy. For most, there was anger and distrust. For those, this company represented simply the best job they'd ever had. I put the company in jeopardy, and thus their happiness and livelihood.</p><p>I found myself weighed down with feelings of guilt and inadequacy. I apologized publicly at a 'whole company' meeting one day. There was applause.</p><p>A month or so later I wrote a letter of resignation to the CEO and my PM. I left town the next day, headed ultimately for New York City.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

        <h2>This is a motherfucking website.</h2>
        
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It fucking works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>

        - 13th July 2024
        </p><p>
        
TL;DR: I created a patch called EmperorLauncher, which modifies Emperor: Battle for Dune to run well on modern systems, with:
</p><ul>
    <li>High resolution support</li>
    <li>Working online multiplayer with direct ip connection</li>
    <li>Coop Campaign mode</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download the patch <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/releases/download/v1.0/EmperorLauncher.v1.0.zip">here</a>, and the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher">on github</a>.</p>

<p>Me and a friend playing Coop Campaign in 4K</p>
<p>The rest of this blog post is a fairly technical explanation of how and why I made this thing.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="table_of_contents">Table of Contents</h2>
<h3 id="what_is_emperor">What is Emperor: Battle for Dune?</h3>
<p>Emperor: Battle for Dune is a 2001 realtime strategy game made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_Studios">Westwood Studios</a>, arguably the inventors of the RTS genre. It is a sequel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_2000">Dune 2000</a>, itself a remake of sorts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II">Dune II</a>, considered by many to be the original RTS. The Dune RTSes hold a special place in my heart, with Dune 2000 being the first PC game I ever bought, and my introduction to the Dune universe. Emperor followed up on Dune 2000, bringing 3D graphics, vastly improved UX, and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOxuQBe_cL8&amp;list=PL4E8A872850C1B3AB&amp;index=29">absolutely bangin' soundtrack</a>. All that said, it isn't that well known these days. I suspect this is because it was outshone by Westwood's other RTS series, the juggernaut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/cnc_vs_dune.jpg" title="RA2 came out in 2000, a year before before Emperor. Google trends doesn't go back further than 2004."></p><p>Google trends, 2004-2010</p>
<h3 id="whats_wrong">What's wrong with it?</h3><p>
A lot. The years have not been kind to Emperor:
</p><ul>
    <li>The game can't run at higher resolutions afforded by modern screens</li>
    <li>Game simulation speed is uncapped in multiplayer, rendering it unplayably fast</li>
    <li>Westwood Online (WOL) doesn't work anymore, so you can't play multiplayer except through LAN</li>
    <li>You can't play the campaign in coop mode at all, because that was an online-only feature not supported over LAN</li>
    <li>The installer included on the disk is broken</li>
    <li>And finally, many visual effects are broken by the high framerates of modern PCs</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>Main menu in seizure mode</p>
<p>I love coop games, and I always wished more RTSes in particular had a coop mode. When I found out all these years later that Emperor had a coop mode that I'd never known about, and it was no longer playable - I knew in that moment, deep in my heart, that this was a cosmic injustice that must be put to rights. I also just had a hankerin' to do some reverse engineering, so...</p>
<h3 id="how_do_we_fix_it">How do we fix this mess?</h3>
<p>I started off with a modest initial goal. The "main" exe of the game is a misdirection: Emperor.exe is a thin wrapper that runs the real game executable, Game.exe. But if we run Game.exe directly, nothing happens. So my initial goal was to make a replacement for Emperor.exe, so I could control the launch of Game.exe. Later on, once I have this control, I can use it to inject a DLL containing my patches. More details on that later.</p>
<p>At this point I hopped into IDA to see what else Emperor.exe was doing other than calling CreateProcess.</p>
<details id="what_is_ida">
    <summary>What is IDA?</summary>
    <div>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Disassembler">IDA</a> is the industry standard reverse engineering tool. It is an incredibly powerful tool that operates on a database of knowledge about your executable. At its core it is a disassembler (IDA - Interactive DisAssembler), which turns machine code into slightly more readable textual assembly language.</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_runCommand_asm.jpg"></p><p>Part of a disassembled function from Emperor.exe</p>
            <p>It is also able to go one step further than that, and decompile the assembly into mostly-compilable C code. It will need some help from you, though. At the beginning, it will not know the types of anything. All the datastructures and typedefs are completely gone, everything is just an integer or int*, functions have been inlined, or optimised out entirely, and everything has names like sub_402E80 or a2.</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_runCommand.jpg"></p><p>The same code, decompiled into C</p>
            <p>As you browse through the code, you annotate things that you know. For example, in the function above I was able to look at the pointer that was being passed in, and see which offsets were being used. Since CreateProcessA is a known, documented Windows API function I was able to infer what was contained in some of those offsets. Using that knowledge, I was able to create a custom structure definition (ProcessRunData) with some fields filled in. Now I have a type for the parameter, so I can search for callers and annotate the type of the variable being passed to runCommand. And oh look, I'm using some of the fields in ProcessRunData with some other functions and variables, so now I know their type too. In this fashion, you could slowly flood-fill information through the whole binary until you had a full understanding of the whole program if you wanted to. That would of course be incredibly laborious for a game this size.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>This is probably a good time to mention that I am not a skilled reverse engineer. I'm definitely not a professional, and this is my first real foray into reverse engineering a binary like this. Cosmic justice aside, the main reason for this project was learning about reverse engineering for fun. So all that said, I spent the next couple of evenings reverse engineering a curious set of string manipulation functions that turned out to just be std::ostringstream.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_badnames.webp"></p><p>Behold, function names</p>
<p>Eventually I dug myself out of that rabbit-hole, and found out what Emperor.exe was doing that was so special. Before running Game.exe, it <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/EmperorLauncher.cpp#L40">creates a mutex, and an anonymous file mapping handle</a> - essentially just a chunk of allocated memory with a handle associated to it. It doesn't do much with the mutex, as far as I can tell just using it to make sure there is only one instance of the game running, but it does something odd with the file mapping. It launches Game.exe with bInheritHandles set to 1. This means the child process "inherits" our handles - it is able to use the same numeric value of the open file mapping handle, as though it had opened it itself. Emperor.exe then loads some data from the file Emperor.dat in the install directory, and does a bunch of manipulation to that data, presumably some sort of decryption. It then maps the mapping handle, and copies the decrypted data into the mapping.</p>
<p>So now we have some decrypted data in a mapping. The mapping handle is valid in both processes, so the child process can use the handle to retrieve the data that the launcher stored. But the child process doesn't know what the handle's value is. So the parent needs to send it somehow. Windows has an IPC message passing system where threads have <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/about-messages-and-message-queues">Message Queues</a>. This is used as the basis of window functionality - windows (HWNDs, actual window objects) use this queue to send and receive the messages that make them work.</p>
<p>The parent process tells the child the handle value by sending a message to the main thread of the child, using <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/EmperorLauncher.cpp#L124">0xBEEF</a> as the custom message ID, because why not. This works because CreateProcessA will actually tell the parent process the thread ID of the main thread of the newly created child process. I didn't really want to reverse engineer the decryption code, so I created a <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/tree/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/CommsDataDumper">dumping tool</a> that I could sub in in place of Game.exe, which reads the data sent to it and dumps it to disk.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/dumptruck.jpg"></p><p>Not that kind of dumping tool</p>
<p>Turns out the data was "UIDATA,3DDATA,MAPS", three strings that get passed to a bunch of asset loading code, making sure the game cannot work without them. From that point it was simple enough to write some code to perform the sequence myself, and I was able to start Game.exe successfully.</p>
<h3 id="patch_injection">Patch injection</h3>
<p>Now we get to the real meat and potatoes of this project - injecting our custom patches into Game.exe. We can force a process to load and run our code by using the ol' CreateRemoteThread &amp; LoadLibrary trick.</p>
<details id="createremote_loadlibrary">
    <summary>Excuse me, what trick is that?</summary>
    <div>
            <p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread">CreateRemoteThread</a> is a Windows API function that takes a "ThreadProc" function pointer, argument pointer, and process handle as arguments. The process handle is normally a handle representing the calling process, but not this time. When CreateRemoteThread is called, it creates a thread in the target process, which runs the passed function with the passed argument. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> is a Windows API function that takes a string path, and loads the DLL located at that path into the process. DLLs on windows can have a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dllmain">dllmain</a> function which will be called when the DLL is loaded.</p>
            <p>A function suitable to be passed to CreateRemoteThread must take a single pointer argument. LoadLibrary is a function that takes a single pointer argument. Do you see where this horror show is going?</p>
            <p>So the only remaining problem is that we need to get the path to our DLL into the memory space of our target process. Not a problem, we can use our friends <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex">VirtualAllocEx</a> (which takes a process handle parameter), and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory">WriteProcessMemory</a> to allocate a buffer in the target process' memory, and copy our DLL path into it. We then grab the address of LoadLibrary and pass it, along with our newly created DLL path buffer, to CreateRemoteThread. A new thread gets created in the target process, and loads our DLL. The dllmain function present in that DLL runs, and boom! We have code execution, from here we are free to do whatever nefarious things we like.</p>
            <p>Wait a minute, how do we know the address of CreateRemoteThread in the target process? Windows does have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">ASLR</a>, so DLLs are loaded at random addresses for security reasons. You would think this would make it impossible for us to know where CreateRemoteThread is located in another process. Well, bizarrely, we can just use the address of CreateRemoteThread in the current process. Windows does randomise DLL base addresses, but it will randomise on first load, then <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=93301">try to use the same address in every process after that</a>. Documentation on this is hard to find (if you do find something concrete, please let me know), and Raymond does only say the kernel will "try" to use the same address, but in practice there seems to be a special rule for some basic DLLs, like Kernel32.dll (which contains LoadLibrary), so they are always loaded at the same address on a given boot, to enable procedures like this one. Even if it isn't documented, this is a well known technique, which is used in <em>all sorts of things</em> out in the wild, including, I'm sure, some Microsoft products - so by now it's not something they could afford to break.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>So, if we start the process in a suspended state, then inject a dll, we get code execution in the target process before main is run. But what we really need is to modify existing functions in the Game.exe binary. How do we do that? In short, we use the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Detours">detours</a> library<a href="#foot-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<details id="what_is_detours">
    <summary>What is detours?</summary>
    <div>
            <p>Detours is the real black magic of this world. It is the arcane invocation that dispenses with arbitrary social constructs, and cuts straight to the fundamental truth of the machine. Types are an illusion. Data structures don't exist. There is only functions. And detours patches functions.</p>
            <p>Let's say we want to wrap a function from the standard library with some logging, in this example we'll use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-sendto">sendto</a>. We want to replace all calls to sendo with our modified function, which does some logging, and then calls the real sendto function. Something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/sendto_wrap.webp"></p><p>We can grab a pointer to the original sendto function pretty easily:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/sendto_load.webp"></p><p>Then comes the real magic. We can just edit the bytes of the original function, replacing the first instruction with the opcode for an unconditional jump to our patched function. It's a little bit more involved than just <code>memcpy(&amp;sendto, &amp;jumpCode, sizeof(jumpCode));</code> though. Memory pages containing functions are not writable for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX">security reasons</a>, so we need to set it writable with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect">VirtualProtect</a>, edit the function, then set it back. We then need to call <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache">FlushInstructionCache</a>, because otherwise we could end up with different instructions in cache vs memory which could cause a multitude of problems. And of course, we need to be sure that while we're doing all this, there isn't some other thread executing the code we're modifying. In our case we're executing our hooks before main runs, so we know there are no other threads to worry about.</p>
            <p>Ok, so now we've redirected the original function to our replacement, but there's one thing missing. If we want to wrap the original function, not just replace it, then we need a pointer we can call to run the original, unpatched code. But we've just stomped all over it by replacing random instructions with an unconditional jump. This is where the real genius of detours comes in. The library will take note of the instructions it ruined, copy them to a newly allocated chunk of memory somewhere, and set up a little wrapper function. That function contains the copied instructions, followed by a jump instruction that jumps back into the original code, just after the last broken instruction. As you can imagine, there is <em>a lot</em> of subtlety here, especially when dealing with an instruction set like x86, where not all opcodes are the same length. The end result is you can do something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/sendto_detour.webp"></p><p>sendto_orig now points at the magic generated chunk, so it behaves exactly like the original function, while the original sendto address is now set up to jump straight into our wrapper, leaving us free to call the original function from inside our wrapper.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>Now I can take the addresses of functions that I found and figured out in IDA, and wrap / replace them with detours. During my miscellaneous poking around in IDA, I noticed several calls that looked like some sort of debug logging function. When I looked at the function being called though, it was empty, just a return instruction. I hooked up a detour which forwarded the log message on to vprintf, but no luck, the process just crashes - a segfault inside vprintf.</p>
<p>The problem with this function is that it's not one function, it's many functions. My guess is that in the original source code, there were a bunch of debugging functions that were behind #ifdef DEBUG, and in release builds they were replaced with empty functions. This, combined with things like empty virtual functions to satisfy inheritance, means the final binaries end up with a lot of empty functions. They all compile to nothing but a single ret (return) instruction, and then the linker says "oh look, I have duplicated functions" and merges them into one location. Unfortunately, one of these empty functions is the debug logger.</p>
<p>My first attempt at solving this was to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/89df0a4378d62601681a389af5df703f1fb1ac29#diff-e404d91cbd33aed1d33216c0a473ac607f04d32ac4db75389a84131cb7a68396R23">use a heuristic</a> to detect if the parameters I've got look like a log string. The heuristic is pretty simple: if we interpret the first argument as a pointer to char, then we iterate a few bytes and check if those bytes are ASCII printable characters. If so - great, we have a log call, we can forward our parameters to vprintf. If not, then do nothing. There's also the obvious problem here that we can get all sorts of random values passed in here as a first parameter, and they're not all valid pointers at all, let alone pointers to null terminated strings. So, there's a pretty high chance we're going to segfault. But that's ok. Windows handles segfaults by throwing an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp?view=msvc-170">SEH exception</a>. We can catch and ignore the exception, then presume the call is not a logging call. Surprisingly, this actually worked pretty well.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/debug_log.webp" title="Digital Archaeology"></p><p>I wonder how long it's been since someone last read these log lines</p>
<p>That was cool, but not really enough. There were still false positives and false negatives, and false positives could still cause the game to crash. If I wanted to fix this for real, then I'd need to get in there and annotate every.&nbsp; single.&nbsp; call. I could give myself a bit of a head start though. I tightened up my heuristic to give no false positives (at the expense of some false negatives), and logged call sites by using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/intrinsics/addressofreturnaddress?view=msvc-170">AddressOfReturnAddress</a> intrinsic inside my detour.</p>
<p>What I really wanted was to separate the logging calls into a different function from the other empty function calls. Actually, two functions, because there were two variants of the logging function. IDA has a patching mode that allows you to make binary changes to the executable under analysis, without applying them to the real file on disk. It then uses those patches during disassembly and decompilation, so you get a virtualised view of how your patches will affect the binary. You can also dump the patches to a file, or apply them to the original binary.</p>
<p>The original empty function had a bunch of zeroed out padding bytes immediately following it, so I could patch in a few empty functions in that padding space by inserting ret instructions. Then I patch the actual logging calls to call one of the new empty functions, and later on I can detour that function to reenable logging. With an incomplete list of addresses from my heuristic dumper, I could use IDAs built in python scripting to patch known good call sites.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_patch_calls.png"></p><p>IDApython script to patch call sites with an offset</p>
<p>My heuristic worked pretty well for most of the call sites, but it was not all of them by a long shot. I wrote another python script to find unpatched call sites and apply some more heuristics, like looking for patterns of pushing a string constant before the call instruction. These got me another bunch of calls, but in the end I still had several hundred call sites that I just had to manually annotate. It took a few excruciatingly boring hours, but I got it done. I then exported the patch data, reformatted it as a C++ array, and <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchDebugLog.cpp">applied the patch at runtime</a>.</p>
<p>The reason I spent so long making sure the debug log was working so well, was that I had an intuition that it would end up being enormously helpful during the rest of the project. Actually, that's a lie, it was just a fun technical challenge and made me feel like a digital archaeologist. But hey - I had you fooled with that excuse right? Jokes aside, it really did help to have the original logs. For example, when I was working on getting multiplayer over WOL (Westwood Online) working, the client was hanging some time after receiving the game start command. By looking at the debug log, I could see a failed assert message: "MyId == INVALID_ID". I then searched IDA's strings view, jumped into the function where the assert was failing, and realised that it was the function which handles receipt of an SC_MESSAGE_YOUR_DETAILS message. A few lines above I saw that we had logged successfully receiving an SC_MESSAGE_YOUR_DETAILS message already. This tipped me off to look at my wireshark dumps, and I noticed that I was incorrectly sending a GAMEOPT command containing an SC_MESSAGE_YOUR_DETAILS message to all connected players instead of just the target. Without the debug log prompting me, I have no idea how long I would have taken to notice.</p>
<h3 id="patching_graphics">Patching graphics</h3>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/dx_overview.jpg"></p><p>Contemporary graphic design from the D3D7 era</p>
<p>Emperor was built with the then-current graphics API Direct3D 7. Broadly speaking, DirectX 8/9 is around when graphics APIs started to vaguely approximate the kind of feature set we expect today, moving away from a fixed-function pipeline and towards a modern shader-based world. DirectX 9 in particular, was still occasionally used up until quite recently, with some still-popular games still using it (for example CS:GO, which was only retired in 2023). I won't get into the weeds on graphics APIs here, but suffice it to say that Direct3D 7 support in modern windows is... patchy at best.</p>
<h4 id="window_management">High resolution windows</h4>
<p>One of the major issues is the resolution limit. From what I can tell, Direct3D7 on modern systems is implemented as some sort of wrapper layer that redirects to a more modern version of DirectX, like 9 or 11. Somewhere in that wrapper layer, the maximum texture size is being limited to 2048. Luckily, I was able to pull in some code from UCyborg's <a href="https://github.com/UCyborg/LegacyD3DResolutionHack/blob/master/d3dim.c">LegacyD3DResolutionHack</a> patch, which solved that problem for me<a href="#foot-2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>There was also another problem. The game cannot handle running at anything but a 4:3 ratio. Rendering works, but the UI is completely broken, like it's zoomed in way too far. Also the in-game mouse rendering has a broken offset, which varies depending on your distance from the centre of the screen<a href="#foot-3">[3]</a>.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/mouse_offset.mp4"></video>
<p>Mouse offset. The system cursor is where clicks really register.</p>
<p>So, we need some 4:3 letterboxing. This was actually surprisingly difficult. I tried just telling the game to render fullscreen at 2160x2880 (a 4:3 slice out of 4k), but it didn't like using arbitrary resolutions in fullscreen mode like that. The game does have a windowed mode though, accessible by passing -w in the command line args, and arbitrary resolutions are not a problem when windowed. But then we get an ugly floating window with a border, that doesn't cover up the taskbar. I tried <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/fc5538e8fa0c89208c112a4a6c0a4d1df37318f7#diff-e404d91cbd33aed1d33216c0a473ac607f04d32ac4db75389a84131cb7a68396R229">a bunch</a> of <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/abed24c94af91b28e8f42ce4c444a3c8c6ba34db#diff-e404d91cbd33aed1d33216c0a473ac607f04d32ac4db75389a84131cb7a68396R252">bad ideas</a>, but what worked in the end was a patch to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWindowManagement.cpp#L48">remove the border style, and reparent the game window</a> on top of a fullscreen black window. I also added <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWindowManagement.cpp#L155">mouse capture</a>, so edge scrolling isn't broken if you have multiple monitors, or want to play in windowed mode.</p>
<h4 id="patch_framerate_limit">Limiting framerate</h4>
<p>Next I <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/HookD3D7.cpp#L23">patched the IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene</a> method, to limit the FPS to 60.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/menu_calm.mp4"></video>
<p>Soooo much better</p>
<p>To limit the framerate to 60 FPS, we need to detect the current framerate, calculate the amount we need to delay, and then sleep the thread for that amount of time. To do that, we need to patch a function that is called once per frame, preferably at the very end of the frame. IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene fits the bill perfectly. But this was a little tricky, because IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene is not exported directly - it's a member function of a "lightweight COM" object created through a chain of COM method calls.</p>
<details id="what_is_lightweight_com">
    <summary>What is lightweight COM?</summary>
    <div>
            <p>COM is many things, but among other things it is a method of representing objects that allows us to have ABI stability. Lightweight COM (also known as nano COM) is a subset of COM concepts that focuses on that representation and ignores the rest.</p>
            <details id="what_is_abi_stability">
                <summary>What is ABI stability?</summary>
                <div>
                        <p>To understand ABI stability, let's take a step back and discuss API stability. API stability means that you provide a source-code level API that does not change, so consumers of that API can upgrade to new versions without having to change their code. ABI stability is taking this concept one step further for native code, and providing guarantees that consumers can upgrade your library <em>without recompiling</em>.</p>
                        <p>For example, if I add a new field to a struct that is part of my public interface, the API has not changed. Any code written against the old version can be successfully recompiled against the new version, and all is well. But an old <em>binary</em>, compiled against the old version will not work anymore. The compiler used information about the size of the struct, and the offsets of its members during compilation, and that information is now wrong. This binary interface is known as the ABI (Application Binary Interface). ABI stability is the practice of crafting updates to native code libraries without causing this kind of breakage.</p>
                    </div>
            </details>
            <p>Microsoft doesn't want to force everyone to recompile their DirectX apps every time they add a field to a class, so the COM object representation takes care of that. In essence, a COM object is a struct that contains, as its first member, a pointer to a table of functions (known as a vtable). Something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/com_lite.png"></p><p>When you're actually implementing a COM object in C++, Microsoft's MSVC compiler gives you a bit of help, but under the hood this is what you get. You could also implement a COM object in plain C, and in that case you would need to handle your layout manually. Under COM, you never access the members of a class directly, the consumer of your class only ever sees your vtable and a pointer to your class. This way, consumers never depend on the exact size or layout of the underlying struct, so you're free to change it.</p>
            <p>COM allows a single object to provide multiple interfaces, think of this like normal class inheritance, but with some extra possibilities. Each interface has its own base pointer, with its own vtable. You switch interface not by a simple cast, but by using a special QueryInterface function. There is also some reference counting going on, but that's not important to this discussion.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>To get a pointer to the IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene function, the application has to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Call DirectDrawCreateEx to get an IDirect3D7*</li>
    <li>Call IDirect3D7::CreateDevice to get an IDirect3DDevice7* </li>
    <li>Grab the function pointer from the vtable on the IDirect3DDevice7</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm confronted with a dilemma. I want to get the function pointer, but in order to do so I need to call a bunch of Direct3D functions that would create complicated objects, potentially interfering with the application. But maybe...</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/we_could_let_her_do_it.webp"></p><p>... maybe we could let the game create the objects</p>
<p>So in the end, what we do is the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Patch DirectDrawCreateEx on app start</li>
    <li>When DirectDrawCreateEx is called for the first time, before returning we use the IDirect3DDevice7 we just created to grab a pointer to IDirect3D7::CreateDevice, and patch that</li>
    <li>When IDirect3D7::CreateDevice is called for the first time, before returning we use the IDirect3DDevice7 we just created to grab a pointer to IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene and patch it to insert a frame rate limit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="patching_networking">Patching networking</h3>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/WOL.png"></p><p>It's got a 28.8 BPS modem</p>
<p>The next job is to get multiplayer working. What we want is a very basic version - no fancy lobbies, hosted servers or clan systems. Just forward ports and then copy/paste your friends IP to connect. Classic style, and most importantly requires no infrastructure so it won't break if I lose interest in maintaining it.</p>
<p>There's two roads we can go down here, patching LAN mode, or WOL (Westwood Online - the game's defunct online service). LAN mode is actually working, however it is not ideal for modern players. It depends on sending UDP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking)">broadcast</a> packets to announce servers, a commonly used trick in old LAN games. The idea is, when you host a game, you broadcast a special packet to all hosts on your LAN subnet, essentially announcing "I am running a game server". That lets the game show a list of lobbies in the LAN menu, so players can connect without having to open a cmd window and call out their IP address to eachother.</p>
<p>The downside is that, for obvious reasons, broadcast does not work online. And as the game has no way to specify an ip to connect to manually, there is no way to play with a friend online using this mode. I did initially work on allowing online play through LAN mode by <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/75618a09cc91cd2c9737e65b4b5b02e219f7105b">patching the LAN chat</a> to allow you to specify an IP to connect to, but once I realised there was a WOL-exclusive coop campaign mode I abandoned that approach.</p>
<p>There's two components to getting WOL working. We need to stand up a fake WOL master server so the game can figure out where to connect and what kind of game to start, and then we need to do some proxying of the game packets to make it work over a direct IP connection. Surprisingly enough, there is an master server running at <a href="https://xwis.net/">xwis.net</a>. From what I can tell, it's fan run, and at time of writing they have access to the original DNS entries used by the game (servserv.westwood.com). Emperor is not really working out of the box on xwis though, so despite them mentioning Emperor on their homepage, I think it's really only used for other Westwood games in the Command &amp; Conquer series. Still, it's enough to make and join a lobby so we'll start with the packet proxying and come back to the master server issue later. </p>
<h4 id="packets_must_flow">The packets must flow</h4>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/packets_must_flow.webp"></p><p>You're probably wondering "why the hell is he talking about proxying packets, I thought he wanted a direct connection". Well, I do. But there's a problem. Emperor uses a peer-to-peer networking model. Pairs (every pair? not sure) of players open direct connections to eachother. Critically, they open two connections for each pair one from A-&gt;B and one from B-&gt;A. This means every client in the game needs to have open ports so they can accept connections. Worse still, the game randomly chooses which ports to listen on. That's really not gonna fly, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Originally, the WOL master server was accompanied by a "mangler" server. "Mangler" here seems to refer to mangling packets for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking)">NAT punching</a>, a technique for allowing connections between two clients, both of whom are behind a NAT so direct connections are not normally available. This is unreliable at best, but more to the point, it needs an accessible server to coordinate the connection and the original is long gone. The game connection was just hanging at this stage, waiting forever for the mangler server to respond, so I <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWol.cpp#L75">patched out</a> the mangler call entirely.</p>
<p>Now we come to the real problem: the server will assign port ranges to each of the clients, send the ips and port ranges of each client to all the other clients, and they will attempt to open connections to one another. The meta communication about client list and port ranges takes place over IRC (yes, actual IRC, more on that later) hosted on the master server.</p>
<p>I solved this by completely co-opting all of winsock (winsock is the windows implementation of network sockets). I <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWol.cpp#L145">intercept</a> all the required functions, and tunnel all connections through a single client-&gt;server network connection. So when a client wants to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/WolProxyClient.cpp#L87">send a message</a> to the server, or even to another client, it is intercepted, wrapped in a header and pushed through the single network connection. There is a thread running on the server dedicated to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/WolProxyServer.cpp#L45">receiving messages</a>, and dispatching them to the appropriate destination. There are some subtleties around determining the appropriate destination based on port range, faking the correct sender ip, etc, but in the end it works quite well. The game still believes it's operating in a peer to peer fashion, but we get the benefit of being able to direct connect with only the server host needing to worry about their network config.</p>
<p>With all of that setup, I was able to start and join probably the first Coop Campaign game in over a decade.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/first_coop.jpg"></p><p>Atreides tutorial mission, immediately followed by a victory dance around my apartment</p>
<h4 id="irc_server">The part where I write an IRC server for some reason</h4>
<p>As mentioned before, the WOL master server is really just a glorified IRC server. There is some customisation though, so luckily the xwis server that's still running served as a great example to work from. There is even an <a href="https://github.com/pvpgn/pvpgn-server/blob/fcdf00fedfd79a041e1a7b2f20c8d15995b0a762/src/bnetd/handle_wol.cpp">open source WOL server implementation</a> for reference as well.</p>
<p>But wait a second, why write a server at all if there's one available online already? Well, because it won't be forever. My goal with this project is partly about just being able to play coop with my friend, yes, but it's also about cultural preservation. I want to craft a collection of bytes that ensures anyone who wants to play this game can do so, forever. If I rely on some server being up, I can't do that. As for why I didn't just use the pvpgn open source code - that project has very different goals to me. I want to provide the bare minimum needed to get a multiplayer game running, not run a competitive play community.</p>
<p>WOL is a weird mix of standard IRC stuff and custom bits. Game lobbies are special channels, they use standard IRC topics for game lobby info, but then use PAGE instead of PRIVMSG for sending messages in lobby chat, and synchronise game settings with GAMEINFO messages whose content isn't even ASCII. In the end, implementing a basic WOL server <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/WolIrcServer.cpp">wasn't too complicated</a>. It took some trial and error, and it definitely isn't robust if you wander off the happy path, but it works.</p>
<h3 id="packaging">Packaging</h3>

<h4 id="installer">Replacing the installer</h4>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the original installer for Emperor is broken. Westwood did release a workaround installer that you can use by copying the contents of the install CD to your hard drive and overwriting the setup exe, but honestly that's a mess. I'd prefer to provide a nice simple tool that can handle it for the user, and also deal with patching the game up to v1.09, the last official patch.</p>
<p>The basic install is pretty straightforward, just <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/Installer.cpp#L415">copying some files off the CD</a>, and extracting some others from a .cab file on the CD. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(file_format)">cab files</a> are just a basic archive format, like zip, and there is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fdi/">an interface</a> built into windows for extracting them.</p>
<p>The hard part was patching to v1.09. I was hoping I could just grab a copy of the patch file, EM109EN.EXE, right click -&gt; extract with 7zip and be presented with some shiny new up to date binaries, but alas no. The next thing I tried was checking for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_(Windows)">windows resources</a>. Windows resources are a standard method of embedding binary data into an executable file on windows, supported by the compiler and build system. Here, I actually got a hit. I didn't have any filenames, so I couldn't tell their types, but there were a few, mostly tiny files on the order of a few hundred bytes. One of the files was a few hundred kilobytes though. I opened it up in a hex editor and saw something I didn't expect.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/dosmode.png"></p><p>This program cannot be run in DOS mode</p>
<p>That's a windows executable file header!<a href="#foot-4">[4]</a> So we have an executable file embedded in the patch exe. I tried to start analysing the new binary, but none of my tools worked. "file", the unix magic number file identification tool couldn't tell what it was either. Clearly something wasn't right about this file. If I'd paid more attention and done some research on the windows PE format, I would have seen that that "MZ" bytes that should be at the very beginning of a PE file were offset by one word, and that was all that was wrong. But for now I decided to go back to the original patch binary and see if I could figure out what it was doing with the executable.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/rtpatch.png"></p><p>Loading &amp; running the DLL</p>
<p>I went searching for uses of LoadResource, a standard windows API that a program can use to get a pointer to a resource it has embedded, and I found this code. It is extracting the binary resource we found to a temporary file, then loading the temp file as a .DLL and running a function from inside it. We can also see here why we weren't able to load the executable before - the first four bytes of the resource are storing the size of the file, then the rest is the file itself. I'm not quite sure why they did this, as they could have just used the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-sizeofresource">SizeofResource</a> function instead.</p>
<p>I also noticed when running the patch program in a debugger, that all the actual file changes in the install directory were happening in the function pulled out of the embedded DLL. I had a look at the functions exported by the DLL to check out their names - the function that EM109EN.EXE calls is named "RTPatch32@12". RTPatch sounded like it might be some kind of patching tool, so I went searching and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231022172410/https://www.pocketsoft.com/rtpatch_binary_diff.html">sure enough</a>, it is.</p>
<p>I then went searching for any third party tools for working with RTpatch, and found the <a href="http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm#myrtp">myRTP</a> tool by Luigi Auriemma. Checking his source code, he straight up just loads and runs the DLL, with some arguments to tell it where to find the game. I tried the same, but noticed that it was just ignoring the directory I was passing in and fetching the Emperor install directory straight from the registry. I was able to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/Installer.cpp#L101">fake the registry</a> keys that it expected, pass in the same command string that EM109EN.EXE did, and that actually worked. This is kind of funny, as the embedded DLL is 168 KiB, while EM109EN.EXE is 5.5 MiB, meaning the actual patch data is about 3% of the file size. If they were willing to accept that kind of overhead, it makes me wonder if it was worth all the effort of using a binary diffing tool rather than just shipping the changed files whole.</p>
<h4 id="internet_components">Westwood Online Shared Internet Components</h4>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/Loading_ani.gif"></p><p>Loading the shared components was tricker than it seemed</p>
<p>I knew we would get back to COM eventually. When you use the original installer, there are two components - Emperor, and something called the "Westwood Online Shared Internet Components". Without this optional component installed, WOL doesn't work. Of course, I want to package this into my installer so the user doesn't need to worry about getting it set up.</p>
<p>The problem is that this component seems to live up to its name - it really is shared. I suppose the same installation of the shared internet components could be used by multiple Westwood games with WOL support. It's not installed in the Emperor directory, but in its own folder somewhere, and at first I didn't know how Emperor was finding it. I thought it might be through something saved in the registry? Well, it turns out that I was correct, but not in the way I expected.</p>
<p>The main thing installed is WOLAPI.DLL, and it is a COM class library. Emperor loads code from the library by using CoCreateClass to instantiate the various COM objects contained in WOLAPI.DLL, which were registered at install time.</p>
<details id="what_is_com_registration">
    <summary>Ok for real this time, WTF is COM?</summary>
    <div>
            <p>If you didn't read the previous section "<a href="#what_is_lightweight_com">What is lightweight COM?</a>", I suggest you go back and read it now.</p>
            <p>Again, I'm not going to give you a full explanation of all the subtleties of COM, mostly because I'm certain I'm not qualified to do so. But I can explain the process of registering a COM class library DLL.</p>
            <p>Let's say we have a chunk of functionality implemented as COM objects, and we want to make that code available as a library to be used by other processes. How do they find our DLL? How do they identify the objects they want to create? COM registration is a method for solving this problem.</p>
            <p>In COM, in addition to its human readable name, each class is identified by a unique identifier known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">GUID</a> (or more specifically, a class ID or CLSID). There is a standard COM function, CoCreateInstance, which is used to create instances of classes. You identify the class you want to create by passing in the CLSID of the class, and it gives you back a pointer to a new instance of that class. But where does it store the list of available classes?</p>
            <p>In the windows registry, under the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\<wbr>SOFTWARE\<wbr>Classes\<wbr>CLSID. So COM registration is essentially taking a DLL full of COM classes, and saving the CLSIDs of those classes, along with a path to the DLL implementing them into the windows registry at a system wide level.</p>
            <p>I've glossed over a lot of complexity here - for example COM has "out of process" servers, where the class is provided by an implementation that lives in a separate process, with automatic marshalling across process boundaries. But the part that matters here is just about telling CoCreateInstance where to find the WOL interfaces.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>Ok, so can we just copy WOLAPI.DLL into the install folder and do normal COM registration? Well, we could but it's not ideal. COM registration writes to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key, which requires admin access. Also, if at all possible I would like to keep things scoped to just affect our game process. Registering COM objects system wide seems unnecessarily messy.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it's not possible to register a class library for just one process<a href="#foot-5">[5]</a>, but it is possible to register a class for just one user by <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWol.cpp#L102">redirecting the registry</a>, and then using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-oaenableperusertlibregistration">OaEnablePerUserTLibRegistration</a> function, so that's what I did.</p>
<h4 id="launcher_ui">Launcher UI</h4>
<p>The last thing left to do was to make a basic launcher UI where players could type an ip to connect to, and tweak some basic settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/launcher.png"></p><p>UI design is my passion</p>
<p>In keeping with the very microsofty and quite retro theme of all the tech presented so far, I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/EmperorLauncher.cpp#L408">plain old win32</a>. It was my first time making a UI with raw win32 controls, and I gotta say - it's kinda rough. I can see why people generally don't use it anymore. But for something so simple and static like this, it was fine.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So with that, my goals were pretty much achieved. This blog post is getting long so I won't got into details about the last few bits of polish. If you made it this far, thanks for listening to my ramblings, and if you try playing it, I hope you enjoy the game.</p>

<p>•••</p>

<p id="foot-1">1: Detours actually takes care of the CreateRemoteThread &amp; LoadLibrary trick for us also.</p>
<p id="foot-2">2: It's actually a bit of a crazy hack, and probably not very resilient to change. What they're doing is searching for the bytes of a comparison to 2048, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/SetRenderTarget.webp"></p><p>Example from DIRECT3DDEVICEI::SetRenderTarget</p>
<p>They just search the whole binary for the pattern B8 00 08 00 00 39, and replace the 00 08 00 00 part (little endian / 2048 in decimal) with FF FF FF FF which makes the check an unconditional pass. B8 at the start is the mov opcode, and the 39 at the end is the start of the cmp opcode that follows. I had a scan through d3dim700.dll on my system, and it seemed like there weren't any false positives. Still though, this is not a super nice solution, and could be broken if Microsoft does ever decide to ship an update to Direct3D 7 for some reason. I would actually like to use a complete reimplementation of the D3D7 API on top of a more modern D3D, like <a href="https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper">dxwrapper</a>, but I tried a few, and none of them really worked well with Emperor.</p>
<p id="foot-3">3: Actually, it seems like the offset is always there, and always a little broken, even at 4:3. It's just small enough that it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p id="foot-4">4: Every windows executable actually starts with a DOS executable. Normally, this is just a small program that prints the message "This program cannot be run in DOS mode". This was a backwards compatability thing in the early days of windows. If a user tried to run a windows EXE from DOS, they would get a nice error explaining to them that they needed to use windows to run this file. Source <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2002/february/inside-windows-win32-portable-executable-file-format-in-detail#the-ms-dos-header">here</a>.</p>
<p id="foot-5">5: I did try using the DllGetClassObject function directly from the DLL, but it didn't work.</p>

<p>I’m an AWS Serverless Hero, principal engineer at an AWS centric logistics company, and I build and maintain <a href="https://aws-news.com/" rel="nofollow">https://aws-news.com</a>. It’s fair to say that I am very interested in everything AWS does. But I fear AWS is no longer interested in what I do.</p>



<p>This post is about AWS’ obsession with Generative AI (GenAI) and how it pushes away everything that makes AWS, well, AWS. Of course it started with OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT, on November 30, 2022. Coincidentally, this date fell exactly in the middle of Re:Invent – Amazon’s yearly developer conference in Vegas. I was there and it was great. Werner Vogels had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfvL_423a-I">keynote</a> about event driven architectures and there were many sessions in areas like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/top-analytics-announcements-of-aws-reinvent-2022/">analytics</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-relational-database-reinvent-2022-recap/">relational databases</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/reinvent-2022-devops-and-developer-productivity-playlist/">devops</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/three-key-security-themes-from-aws-reinvent-2022/">security</a>, and very importantly, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/architecting-for-sustainability-at-aws-reinvent-2022/">sustainability</a>.</p>



<p>Fast forward one year, and the world couldn’t look more different. GenAI dominated Re:Invent 2023. Every topic was either about the infrastructure for GenAI, the integrations with GenAI, the data for GenAI, and how GenAI would make everything better, from customer interactions to content creation, from refactoring to operations. It was weird, but I dismissed it as peak hype cycle. And to be honest I too was pretty excited about all the opportunities GenAI would bring.</p>



<p>Then 2024 came around, and somehow AWS’ focus on GenAI took on hysterical proportions. It started with the global AWS summits, where at least 80% of the talks was about GenAI. Then there was AWS re:Inforce – the annual security conference – which was themed “Security in the era of generative AI”.</p>

<p>After re:Inforce came the flagship NYC summit. Corey Quinn wrote a great piece about the conference titled <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/amazon-genai-services/">Amazon GenAI Services</a>. A quote from his post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>However, the badge lanyards were GenAI branded, the keynote opening slide simply said “Generative AI,” and every single offering discussed during the ~98 minute keynote was centered around Generative AI. Nearly every expo hall booth was dripping with GenAI; Elastic even went so far as to rebrand itself as “The Search AI company.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I wasn’t at the NYC summit so I can’t speak for the in-person experience. But I did monitor the releases they announced during the event. I summarized my thoughts in this <a href="https://x.com/donkersgood/status/1811153913632149660">tweet</a>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="908" data-permalink="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/2024/07/13/dear-aws-please-let-me-be-a-cloud-engineer-again/image-17/" data-orig-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png" data-orig-size="1224,420" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=1024" tabindex="0" role="button" width="1024" height="351" src="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>And this is the crux: AWS is now focused so strongly on GenAI that they seem not to care about anything else anymore – including everything that made developers love them and made them the leading cloud provider on almost every metric.</p>



<h2>You need a business to benefit from GenAI</h2>



<p>Now don’t get me wrong. I like GenAI. I use it extensively at work and for the AWS News Feed. I use ChatGPT to shape new ideas, Copilot to speed up development, and Claude to generate summaries. The point is that all these features add to an existing business. This business has customers, data, business rules, revenue, products, marketing, and all the other things that make a business tick. And most businesses had these things before 2022. GenAI allows us to add new features, and often faster than before. <em>But GenAI has no value without an existing product to apply it to</em>.</p>



<p>And this is where my work, my interests, and my passions come in. I like building products. I like designing scalable infrastructure. I like developing maintainable applications. And I love AWS for the tools they provide me to do this.</p>



<h2>The implicit message</h2>



<p>But AWS and I are growing apart. I feel the things I value are no longer the things they value. By only talking about GenAI, they implicitly tell me databases are not important. Scalable infrastructure is not important. Maintainable applications are not important. Only GenAI is.</p>



<p>The same goes for feature releases. If the vast bulk of all new feature releases are geared towards GenAI, it implicitly means AWS is rerouting investments from classic infrastructure to shiny GenAI. It means that the products I love get smaller budgets. It means that the products I use will not get the next feature I want, or only at a slower pace.</p>



<p>In summary, AWS’ implicit messaging tells developers they should no longer focus on core infrastructure, and spend their time on GenAI instead. I believe this is wrong. Because GenAI can only exist if there is a business to serve. Many, if not almost all of us developers got into AWS because we want to build and support these businesses. We’re not here to be gaslighted into the “GenAI will solve every problem” future. We know it won’t.</p>



<h2>A better way</h2>



<p>I’m not saying there is no value in GenAI. I’m not even saying AWS shouldn’t be building GenAI products. What I’m saying is that AWS is not a <em>GenAI only</em> company and shouldn’t pretend to be. $22.8 billion of <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx">AWS operating income</a> in 2022 and $24.6 billion in 2023 is a hell of a user base to ignore. It is also a financial foundation that should allow them to focus on more than one thing.</p>



<p>I would love to see AWS un-ignore its roots. Show us you still value the businesses and products you supported in the past. Help developers build better applications by listening to them and solving their pain points. Educate them on the fundamentals of infrastructure: performance, reliability, cost efficiency, security, operational excellence, and sustainability.</p>



<p>Your first <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles">leadership principle</a> is customer obsession: “Leaders start with the customer and work backwards”. </p>



<p>I’m your customer, and I’m begging you: please let me be a cloud engineer again.</p>
