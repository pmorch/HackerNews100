            <span>Abstract:</span>We present DeepSeek-V3, a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 671B total parameters with 37B activated for each token. To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models. Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training. In addition, its training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks. The model checkpoints are available at <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p dir="ltr">Apple has introduced DJ with Apple Music, which enables&nbsp;<a href="https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/apple-music-launches-replay-2024-and-reveals-year-end-charts/090980"><span>Apple Music</span></a><span> subscribers to build and mix sets directly from the streaming services catalogue.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The feature is integrated with DJ software and hardware platforms AlphaTheta, Serato and InMusic’s Engine DJ, Denon DJ, Numark, and Rane DJ. It builds on an integration with Algoriddim's Djay Pro software.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DJs at all levels will have access to Apple Music’s catalogue of more than 100 million songs to create and rehearse their sets on any of these DJ software and hardware platforms&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Apple Music is committed to supporting DJs,” said<a href="https://www.musicweek.com/live/read/apple-music-and-the-warehouse-project-to-release-spatial-audio-dj-sets/090349"> Stephen Campbell, global head of dance, electronic &amp; DJ mixes at Apple Music</a>. “With this latest integration, we’re taking that commitment even further – seamlessly connecting Apple Music with the industry’s leading DJ software and hardware. This innovation brings the full power of Apple Music into the creative workflow, making it easier than ever for DJs to access, play, and discover music in real time.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Users can also access a new dedicated DJ with Apple Music category page, spotlighting a series of DJ-friendly editorial playlists, along with new curator pages for each DJ software and hardware platform that will showcase any mixes or sample playlists that can be used to practice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"The integration of Djay with Apple Music across mobile, desktop, and spatial devices opens up a world of creative possibilities for both beginners and seasoned pros,” said Karim Morsy, CEO at Algoriddim. “With instant access to Apple Music’s catalogue of over 100 million songs, <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/apple-music-monetises-dj-mixes-for-creators-and-rights-holders/084104">DJs can mix anytime</a>, anywhere – transforming the way they discover and play their favorite music. Whether using Automix for a seamless, hands-free experience or crafting their own unique sets with djay’s powerful mixing tools, this integration marks a major milestone in making DJing more accessible than ever.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“We are thrilled to bring this integration with Apple Music to DJs around the world and in their creative process," said Yoshinori Kataoka, president and CEO of AlphaTheta. "This marks a significant step forward in making DJing more accessible, and we couldn’t be more excited about the possibilities it opens up.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">"At inMusic, our goal has always been to empower DJs with innovative tools that enhance creativity and performance,” said Morgan Donoghue, VP marketing, DJ brands at InMusic. “Integrating Apple Music into our Engine DJ platforms marks a major step forward, giving DJs instant access to a vast library of over 100 million tracks and expertly curated playlists to build and refine their sets with ease. This collaboration ensures DJs at every level can seamlessly discover, play, and integrate new music into their creative workflow."</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Teaming up with Apple Music is a milestone moment for Serato’s artist community,” said Young Ly, CEO at Serato. “We are excited to see established and new DJs alike combine their passion and creativity with access to one of the largest streaming catalogues in the world.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">DJ with Apple Music builds upon <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/apple-music-expands-live-global-radio-offering-with-three-stations/091020">Apple Music’s DJ Mixes</a>, a programme that launched on the platform in September 2021 with a collection of thousands of sets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In December, Apple Music also launched Apple Music Club, a live global radio station with curated DJ mixes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Today’s launch aims to expand on that relationship by encouraging DJs to use this integrated experience as a creative tool, allowing them to access and find inspiration in their libraries more easily,” concluded the statement.</p>

<h2>Winter of <strong><mark>Quality</mark></strong></h2>



<p>In just a few months, developers fixed<strong> <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.4/bugfixes/" data-type="link" data-id="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.4/bugfixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><mark>over 700</mark></a> </strong>reported issues, revisited old bug reports, and addressed unreported problems.</p>



<p>Alongside bug fixes, Winter of Quality also included tackling technical debt and improving documentation.</p>

<h2><strong>ACTION</strong> PACKED</h2>



<p>Blender 4.4 introduces <strong>Action Slots</strong>, revolutionizing animation workflows by letting multiple data-blocks share a single Action.</p>
</div>



<div>
<div>
<h2>WHAT ARE<br><mark>ACTION</mark><strong><mark> SLOTS</mark></strong>?</h2>



<p>Before Action Slots, each data-block specific animation—like an object’s position, a camera’s depth of field, or a material’s shader properties—needed its own separate Action. This made it difficult to animate multiple elements together or share animations between objects or even projects.</p>
</div>



<div>
<div>
<p>For example, if you wanted to animate a camera moving while also changing its depth of field, you’d need two separate Actions, which couldn’t be easily linked or reused.</p>



<p>Now you can mix all sorts of animations such as an object’s position, its material properties, even compositing effects—all within a single Action.</p>

<h2><strong>Pole</strong> Position</h2>



<p>A new option in the <strong>Select by Trait</strong> operator lets you select by pole count.</p>



<p>Easily find all 3-pole or 5-pole points in your mesh.</p>



<p>Given their impact on topology, the default selects all poles that do not have 4 edges, allowing for easy inspection.</p>

<h2>Influencer</h2>



<p>Joining triangles to quads now prioritizes quad-dominant topology, creating a more structured “grid” layout. This helps maintain cleaner geometry and improves mesh flow, especially in models where uniform quads are preferred.</p>



<p>This behavior can be adjusted using a <strong>topology influence factor</strong>, to better control how triangles are merged.</p>

<h2>Vertex &amp; Edge <strong>Dissolve</strong></h2>



<p>Dissolving edges may remove additional, unselected edges to ensure the mesh remains valid. Previously, this also dissolved vertices connected to those unselected edges.</p>

<h5>COMPOSITOR</h5>



<h2><strong>Speed</strong><br>for Everyone</h2>



<p>The CPU compositor was rewritten to pave the way for future development.</p>



<p>The rewrite provides significant improvements in performance in certain configurations of some nodes, caching of static resources like images, and less memory usage on node setups with many nodes that operate on pixels.</p>



<p>Filter nodes are particularly faster now:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.4/compositing/types/utilities/levels.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.4/compositing/types/utilities/levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levels</a></strong> node is up to <strong>10x</strong> faster.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.4/compositing/types/filter/glare.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.4/compositing/types/filter/glare.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glare</a></strong> filter is not only more advanced but also <strong>6x</strong> more performant.</li>



<li><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.4/compositing/types/filter/pixelate.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.4/compositing/types/filter/pixelate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Pixelate</strong></a> node is <strong>9x</strong> faster.</li>
</ul>



<p>Adjusting compositor node trees can be significantly faster and more interactive. That’s because the compositor now <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e53ac805af" data-type="link" data-id="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e53ac805af">avoids computing outputs</a> that aren’t viewed by the user through the backdrop or image editor.</p>



<p>The overall compositing experience should now feel more responsive, whether you’re using the CPU or GPU.</p>

<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations">the iPhone X was announced alongside the iPhones 8 and 8 Plus</a> in mid-September. The iPhones 8 shipped that month, and I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/the_iphones_8">a review of the iPhones 8</a> on September 19. The iPhone X, though, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/the-future-is-here-iphone-x/">wasn’t available to order until October 27</a>, and didn’t start shipping to customers until November 3. It was an unusual iPhone release cycle that year, to say the least. Initial reviews of the much-anticipated iPhone X appeared on October 31, but I’d only had the phone for 24 hours when the embargo dropped, so I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/10/iphone_x_review_roundup">some initial impressions then</a>, but wound up not publishing my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x">full review of the iPhone X</a> until December 26.</p>

<p>A few days later I wrote a follow-up regarding a specific new interaction design, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">Pressing the Side Button to Confirm Payments on iPhone X</a>”, which I began thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Occasionally I notice a burst of traffic to Daring Fireball from
Hacker News. It’s always short-lived, because for reasons I’ve
never seen explained, Daring Fireball articles always get
blacklisted from Hacker News once they hit their front page. It’s
apparent that a lot of HN readers do not like my work on the basis
that they see me as a shameless Apple shill, but it’s a shame the
articles get deleted because I like reading the comments. I feel
like it keeps me on my toes to read the comments from people who
don’t like Daring Fireball.</p>

<p>Even after being blacklisted from the Hacker News homepage,
though, the comment threads still exist. I went through <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">the
Hacker News comments on my iPhone X review</a> today, and a few
comments about how Apple Pay works on the iPhone X caught my
attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I didn’t mention then was that DF’s buried status at HN was, at the time, a relatively new phenomenon. Hacker News <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/">started in early 2007</a> and for a yearslong stretch, Daring Fireball articles seemed more or less appropriately popular there. Articles that I would think would resonate with the HN readership would hit, and get what always seemed to me an appropriate number of comments. At some point in the mid-2010s though, it seemed like DF articles would get downvoted or flagged after hitting the HN front page. I’d been noticing this for some time when I wrote the above in December 2017.</p>

<p>But even in 2017, DF articles would get active comment threads on HN occasionally. The Hacker News thread I referenced above, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">regarding my iPhone X review</a>, garnered 107 comments. In the years after that, DF articles went from being mysteriously disappeared <em>after</em> hitting the HN front page (and gaining some comment traction) to pretty much <em>never</em> hitting the HN front page (and thus never gaining any comment traction). I found this curious, and I couldn’t figure out <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">why or how</a> this was happening — or who was doing it — but I didn’t mention it much.</p>

<p>Two years ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/making_our_hearts_sing#fn1-2023-02-01">I did mention it again in a footnote</a>, in a piece about the inexplicably poor state of Android apps from a design perspective:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It sounds a bit conspiratorial, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">for several years
now</a> it’s seemed clear to me that Hacker News has
Daring Fireball in some sort of graylist. It’s not blacklisted,
obviously, given the aforementioned <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34605535">two</a>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34611552">threads</a> about yesterday’s piece, but nothing I
write here ever gains any significant traction there. Ever. And
the reason there are two threads for yesterday’s piece is that the
first one disappeared from the home page soon after it was posted.
I think? In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">this list of recent Hacker News threads for articles
from DF</a>, going back four months, only three have
more than 10 comments — and two of those are the threads from
yesterday. I don’t know who I pissed off there or why, but I’ve
never seen an explanation for this. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">HN commenter
Michiel de Mare has quantified the apparent
suppression</a>, based on the ranking of this very
article. Exactly what I’ve noticed for years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see this yourself right now, with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">the current list of recent DF articles submitted to Hacker News</a>. Most of them have 0, 1, or 2 comments. Some got up to 3. “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a>” is the most read, most commented upon things I’ve written in a while. On Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43348891">it got just 28 comments</a> before being shitlisted, which, I have to say, is just weird. That’s one piece I’d have thought would resonate with the HN audience, and make for good grist for discussion. Then, after the original thread was shitlisted, someone re-submitted it (perhaps confused that it wasn’t on the HN front page). That re-submission <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43355009">got 1 comment</a> before it too fell to the mysterious shitlist reaper.</p>

<p>The one recent exception is “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/why_cant_we_screenshot_frames_from_drm-protected_video">Why Can’t We Screenshot Frames From DRM-Protected Video on Apple Devices?</a>”, which somehow <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43223985">escaped the shitlist and garnered 208 comments</a>. These occasional exceptions to DF’s general shitlisting at HN have always made the whole thing more mysterious to me. There’s clearly no programmatic blacklisting that keeps Daring Fireball articles from being submitted, or from gaining a few comments. But once any traction occurs, <em>something</em> happens and poof, they’re gone from the Hacker News front page. It certainly doesn’t make any sense to me why my off-hand post griping about our inability to screenshot DRM video frames would be an order of magnitude more popular than “Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino” was.</p>

<p>Today, though, I saw <a href="https://jasette.facil.services/@jerome/114229390677476922">a helpful mention on Mastodon</a> that pointed me to an interesting project. An author named Michael Lynch has written a tool to quantify “<a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">the highest-ranking personal blogs of Hacker News</a>” since HN’s inception in 2007. According to Lynch’s all-time listing, Daring Fireball ranks #5, which I have to say surprised me, given its years of inexplicable (or at the very least, unexplained) shitlisting status. But Lynch’s tool lets you select date ranges. If you look at <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2021-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 through 2021</a>, Daring Fireball ranked #3, behind only <a href="https://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham’s renowned eponymous blog</a> and Brian Krebs’s excellent (and also eponymous) <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</a>. From <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2013-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 though 2013</a>, DF ranked #2, behind only Graham (who created Hacker News). But if you look at the last four years, from <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2021-10-09&amp;end=2025-03-26&amp;limit=100">2021 through 2025</a>, Daring Fireball ranks #72.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ve lost my fastball, and I just don’t write so good no more. Or maybe it’s not me, but the Hacker News audience that has changed in recent years.<sup id="fnr1-2025-03-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-26">1</a></sup> But it seems to me <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">there’s something fishy going on</a>. What bothers me isn’t so much that Daring Fireball is shitlisted at Hacker News — even though I really did enjoy reading the commentary on my posts back when they regularly surfaced there, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jgruber">still do</a> when one slips through the cracks. What bothers me is that it’s unexplained. Which, ultimately, seems not so much censorial as just cowardly.</p>

<p dir="auto">Aren't you <em>müde</em> from writing Rust programs in English? Do you like saying
"scheiße" a lot? Would you like to try something different, in an exotic and
funny-sounding language? Would you want to bring some German touch to your

<p dir="auto"><strong>rost</strong> (German for <em>Rust</em>) is here to save your day, as it allows you to
write Rust programs in German, using German keywords, German function names,
German idioms.</p>
<p dir="auto">You don't feel at ease using only German words? Don't worry!
German Rust is fully compatible with English-Rust, so you can mix both at your
convenience.</p>

<h2>‘This isn’t public safety, it’s intimidation’</h2><p>Neighbors said they were rattled by the arrest, which happened at 5:30 p.m. on a residential block.</p><p>“It looked like a kidnapping,” said Michael Mathis, a 32-year-old software engineer whose surveillance camera captured the arrest. “They approach her and start grabbing her with their faces covered. They’re covering their faces. They’re in unmarked vehicles.”</p><p>Tufts University President Sunil Kumar said in a statement that the school learned that authorities detained an international graduate student and the student’s visa had been terminated.</p><p>“The university had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event,” Kumar said. </p>

Ayanna Pressley called the arrest “a horrifying violation of Rumeysa’s constitutional rights to due process and free speech.”</p><p>“She must be immediately released,” Pressley said in a statement. “We won’t stand by while the Trump Administration continues to abduct students with legal status and attack our fundamental freedoms.”</p><p>Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell called the video “disturbing.”</p><p>“Based on what we now know, it is alarming that the federal administration chose to ambush and detain her, apparently targeting a law-abiding individual because of her political views,” she said. “This isn’t public safety, it’s intimidation that will, and should, be closely scrutinized in court.”</p>
    
<h2>Court says not to remove Ozturk from the state, but she is listed as being held in Louisiana</h2><p>U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued an order giving the government until Friday to answer why Ozturk was being detained. Talwani also ordered that Ozturk not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without 48 hours advance notice. </p><p>But as of Wednesday evening, the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s online detainee locator system listed her as being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana.</p><p>A senior DHS spokesperson confirmed Ozturk’s detention and the termination of her visa.</p><p>“DHS and (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. A visa is a privilege, not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is common sense security,” the spokesperson told the AP.</p><h2>Ozturk cowrote article criticizing university response to Palestinian issues</h2><p>Ozturk was one of four students last March who wrote an op-ed in The Tufts Daily criticizing the university’s response to its community union Senate passing resolutions that demanded Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.</p><p>Friends said Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel. But after the piece was published, her name, photo and work history were featured by Canary Mission, a website that says it documents people who “promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses.” The op-ed was the only cited example of “anti-Israel activism” by Ozturk. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>I’ve been thinking a lot about autonomous vehicles as I prepare for next Wednesday’s </span><a href="https://www.rideai.org/" rel="">Ride AI Summit</a><span> in Los Angeles.</span></em></p><p><em>I’ll be moderating two panels. One features three companies—Waabi, Bot.auto, and Torc—that are working to automate long-haul trucking. The other features Nuro and Wayve, two of the leading companies developing next-generation driver asssistance systems for customer-owned cars.</em></p><p><em><span>We still have some tickets available, so if you are involved—or interested—in the AV industry, you’ll want to </span><a href="https://www.rideai.org/events/ride-ai" rel="">join us in Los Angeles</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>The first ever fatal crash involving a fully driverless vehicle occurred in San Francisco on January 19. The driverless vehicle belonged to Waymo, but the crash was not Waymo’s fault.</p><p><span>Here’s what happened: a Waymo with no driver or passengers stopped for a red light. Another car stopped behind the Waymo. Then, according to Waymo, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCQqu_ZBzic" rel="">a human-driven SUV rear-ended the other vehicles</a><span> at high speed, causing a six-car pileup that killed one person and injured five others. Someone’s dog also died in the crash.</span></p><p>Another major Waymo crash occurred in October in San Francisco. Once again, a driverless Waymo was stopped for a red light. According to Waymo, a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction crossed the double yellow line and crashed into an SUV that was stopped to the Waymo’s left. The force of the impact shoved the SUV into the Waymo. One person was seriously injured.</p><p>These two incidents produced worse injuries than any other Waymo crash in the last nine months. But in other respects they were typical Waymo crashes. Most Waymo crashes involve a Waymo vehicle scrupulously following the rules while a human driver flouts them: speeding, running red lights, careening out of their lanes, and so forth.</p><p>Waymo’s service will only grow in the coming months and years. So Waymo will inevitably be involved in more crashes—including some crashes that cause serious injuries and even death.</p><p>But as this happens, it’s crucial to keep the denominator in mind. Since 2020, Waymo has reported roughly 60 crashes serious enough to trigger an airbag or cause an injury. But those crashes occurred over more than 50 million miles of driverless operations. If you randomly selected 50 million miles of human driving—that’s roughly 70 lifetimes behind the wheel—you would likely see far more serious crashes than Waymo has experienced to date.</p><p>Federal regulations require Waymo to report all significant crashes, whether or not the Waymo vehicle was at fault—indeed, whether or not the Waymo is even moving at the time of the crash. I’ve spent the last few days poring over Waymo’s crash reports from the last nine months. Let’s dig in.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6089362,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.understandingai.org/i/159863907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A Waymo car in Los Angeles. (Photo by P_Wei via Getty)</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Last September, I </span><a href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/human-drivers-are-to-blame-for-most" rel="">analyzed</a><span> Waymo crashes through June 2024. So this section will focus on crashes between July 2024 and February 2025. During that period, Waymo reported 38 crashes that were serious enough to either cause an (alleged) injury or an airbag deployment.</span></p><p>In my view only one of these crashes was clearly Waymo’s fault. Waymo may have been responsible for three other crashes—there wasn’t enough information to say for certain. The remaining 34 crashes seemed to be mostly or entirely the fault of others:</p><ul><li><p><span>The two serious crashes I mentioned at the start of this article are among </span><strong>16 crashes</strong><span> where another vehicle crashed into a stationary Waymo (or caused a multi-car pileup involving a stationary Waymo). This included ten rear-end crashes, three side-swipe crashes, and three crashes where a vehicle coming from the opposite direction crossed the center line.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Another </span><strong>eight crashes</strong><span> involved another car (or in one case a bicycle) rear-ending a moving Waymo.</span></p></li><li><p><span>A further </span><strong>five crashes</strong><span> involved another vehicle veering into a Waymo’s right of way. This included a car running a red light, a scooter running a red light, and a car running a stop sign.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Three crashes</strong><span> occurred while Waymo was dropping a passenger off. The passenger opened the door and hit a passing car or bicycle. Waymo has a </span><a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/05/keeping-riders-and-other-road-users/" rel="">“Safe Exit” program</a><span> to alert passengers and prevent this kind of crash, but it’s not foolproof.</span></p></li></ul><p>There were two incidents where it seems like no crash happened at all:</p><ul><li><p>In one incident, Waymo says that its vehicle “slowed and moved slightly to the left within its lane, preparing to change lanes due to a stopped truck ahead.” This apparently spooked an SUV driver in the next lane, who jerked the wheel to the left and ran into the opposite curb. Waymo says its vehicle never left its lane or made contact with the SUV.</p></li><li><p>In another incident, a pedestrian walked in front of a stopped Waymo. The Waymo began moving after the pedestrian had passed, but then the pedestrian “turned around and approached the Waymo AV.” According to Waymo, the pedestrian “may have made contact with the driver side of the Waymo AV” and “later claimed to have a minor injury.” Waymo’s report stops just short of calling this pedestrian a liar.</p></li></ul><p>So that’s a total of 34 crashes. I don’t want to make categorical statements about these crashes because in most cases I only have Waymo’s side of the story. But it doesn’t seem like Waymo was at fault in any of them.</p><p>There was one crash where Waymo clearly seemed to be at fault: in December, a Waymo in Los Angeles ran into a plastic crate, pushing it into the path of a scooter in the next lane. The scooterist hit the crate and fell down. Waymo doesn’t know whether the person riding the scooter was injured.</p><p>I had trouble judging the final three crashes, all of which involved another vehicle making an unprotected left turn across a Waymo’s lane of travel. In two of these cases, Waymo says its vehicle slammed on the brakes but couldn’t stop in time to avoid a crash. In the third case, the other vehicle hit the Waymo from the side. Waymo’s summaries make it sound like the other car was at fault in all three cases, but I don’t feel like I have enough information to make a definite judgment.</p><p>Even if we assume all three of these crashes were Waymo’s fault, that would still mean that a large majority of the 38 serious crashes were not Waymo’s fault. And as we’ll see, Waymo vehicles are involved in many fewer serious crashes than human-driven vehicles.</p><p><span>Another way to evaluate the safety of Waymo vehicles is by comparing their per-mile crash rate to human drivers. Waymo has been regularly publishing data about this over the last couple of years. Its most recent release came last week, when Waymo updated its </span><a href="https://waymo.com/safety/" rel="">safety data hub</a><span> to cover crashes through the end of 2024.</span></p><p>Waymo knows exactly how many times its vehicles have crashed. What’s tricky is figuring out the appropriate human baseline, since human drivers don’t necessarily report every crash. Waymo has tried to address this by estimating human crash rates in its two biggest markets—Phoenix and San Francisco. Waymo’s analysis focused on the 44 million miles Waymo had driven in these cities through December, ignoring its smaller operations in Los Angeles and Austin.</p><p><span>Using human crash data, Waymo estimated that human drivers on the same roads would get into 78 crashes serious enough to trigger an airbag. By comparison, Waymo’s driverless vehicles only got into 13 airbag crashes. That represents an </span><strong>83 percent reduction</strong><span> in airbag crashes relative to typical human drivers.</span></p><p><span>This is slightly worse than last September, when Waymo estimated an </span><strong>84 percent reduction</strong><span> in airbag crashes over Waymo’s first 21 million miles.</span></p><p><span>Over the same 44 million miles, Waymo estimates that human drivers would get into 190 crashes serious enough to cause an injury. Instead, Waymo only got in 36 injury-causing crashes across San Francisco or Phoenix. That’s an </span><strong>81 percent reduction</strong><span> in injury-causing crashes.</span></p><p><span>This is a significant improvement over last September, when Waymo estimated its cars had </span><strong>73 percent fewer</strong><span> injury-causing crashes over its first 21 million driverless miles.</span></p><p>The above analysis counts all crashes, whether or not Waymo’s technology was at fault. Things look even better for Waymo if we focus on crashes where Waymo was determined to be responsible for a crash.</p><p><span>To assess this, Waymo </span><a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2024/12/new-swiss-re-study-waymo" rel="">co-authored a study</a><span> in December with the insurance giant Swiss Re. It focused on crashes that led to successful insurance claims against Waymo. This data seems particularly credible because third parties, not Waymo, decide when a crash is serious enough to file an insurance claim. And claims adjusters, not Waymo, decide whether to hold Waymo responsible for a crash.</span></p><p>But one downside is that it takes a few months for insurance claims to be filed. So the December report focused on crashes that occurred through July 2024.</p><p>Waymo had completed 25 million driverless miles by July 2024. And by the end of November 2024, Waymo had faced only two potentially successful claims for bodily injury. Both claims are still pending, which means they could still be resolved in Waymo’s favor.</p><p><span>One of them was this crash that I described at the beginning of my </span><a href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/human-drivers-are-to-blame-for-most" rel="">September article</a><span> about Waymo’s safety record:</span></p><blockquote><p>On a Friday evening last November, police chased a silver sedan across the San Francisco Bay Bridge. The fleeing vehicle entered San Francisco and went careening through the city’s crowded streets. At the intersection of 11th and Folsom streets, it sideswiped the fronts of two other vehicles, veered onto a sidewalk, and hit two pedestrians.</p><p>According to a local news story, both pedestrians were taken to the hospital with one suffering major injuries. The driver of the silver sedan was injured, as was a passenger in one of the other vehicles. No one was injured in the third car, a driverless Waymo robotaxi.</p></blockquote><p>It seems unlikely that an insurance adjuster will ultimately hold Waymo responsible for these injuries.</p><p>The other pending injury claim doesn’t seem like a slam dunk either. In that case, another vehicle steered into a bike lane before crashing into a Waymo as it was making a left turn.</p><p>But let’s assume that both crashes are judged to be Waymo’s fault. That would still be a strong overall safety record.</p><p>Based on insurance industry records, Waymo and Swiss Re estimate that human drivers in San Francisco and Phoenix would generate about 26 successful bodily injury claims over 25 million miles of driving. So even if both of the pending claims against Waymo succeed, two injuries represent a more than 90 percent reduction in successful injury claims relative to typical human drivers.</p><p>The reduction in property damage claims is almost as dramatic. Waymo’s vehicles generated nine successful or pending property damage claims over its first 25 million miles. Waymo and Swiss Re estimate that human drivers in the same geographic areas would have generated 78 property damage claims. So Waymo generated 88 percent fewer property damage claims than typical human drivers.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://edera.dev/stories/styrolite">https://edera.dev/stories/styrolite</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43486997">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Why build a new low-level container runtime?</h2><p>The idea of separating the low-level container runtime concerns into its own tool or microservice is not new. Outside of the Kubernetes CRI, which presents container lifecycle management as a pluggable microservice, there are simpler tools which provide a low-level container runtime as well, such as the unshare utility in util-linux, as well as another tool called Bubblewrap.</p><p>But these tools are either too high-level (like the Kubernetes CRI), or they are designed to be used via shell scripting: Bubblewrap has a high amount of configurability, but is only accessible via a very complicated CLI that is easy to get wrong, while util-linux’s unshare has basic functionality, but also locked behind a CLI. While CLIs allow for rapid iteration, we needed something different for Edera Protect: a rich programmatic interface for spawning and managing containers with precision. Styrolite provides the best of both worlds—a clean API directly usable from Rust, while preserving the rapid iteration capabilities of a CLI.</p><h2>How Styrolite Works: Linux Containers Under the Hood</h2><p>Importantly, we designed Styrolite with full awareness that Linux namespaces were never intended as hard security boundaries—a fact that explains why container escape vulnerabilities continue to emerge. Our approach acknowledges these limitations while providing a more robust foundation.</p><p>Containers in Linux – as opposed to <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/jails/">other</a> <a href="https://illumos.org/man/7/zones">containerization</a> <a href="https://openvz.org/">efforts</a> <a href="http://linux-vserver.org/Welcome_to_Linux-VServer.org">elsewhere</a> – are built on <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html">Linux namespaces</a>. A namespace in Linux allows for an alternative view of a given type of resource, for example: the mount namespace allows for an alternative view of the mount table, and thus an alternative view of the root filesystem, while the PID namespace allows for an alternative view of the system process set. Container runtimes compose these namespaces to provide containerized environments, allowing for great flexibility at the cost of higher complexity.</p><p>At the root of all container runtimes is the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">Linux unshare(2) syscall</a>.&nbsp; This allows for a currently running process to dissociate from one or more of its current namespaces into a forked version of the namespace that can be modified.&nbsp; In general, container runtimes unshare most namespaces by default because it is necessary to do:</p><ul role="list"><li>Mount namespaces are unshared from the host so that we can pivot into a modifiable copy of a container image as the container’s root filesystem.</li><li>PID namespaces are unshared from the host so that the containerized workload cannot view processes outside of the container.</li><li>IPC namespaces are unshared from the host so that the containerized workload cannot view or manipulate System V IPC resources unrelated to the containerized workload.</li><li>User namespaces are unshared from the host so that UIDs and GIDs inside the container are remapped to safer UIDs and GIDs in the host namespace.&nbsp; In other words, root inside a container when running in a user namespace is usually running as an unprivileged UID outside the container environment.</li><li>Time namespaces may be unshared from the host to modify the visible system uptime.</li><li>UTS namespaces may be unshared from the host to change the visible system hostname.</li><li>Network namespaces may be unshared from the host to force the containerized workload to use an alternate networking path.</li></ul><p>On the Edera Protect platform, all of these namespaces are unshared at different levels in the stack.&nbsp; Styrolite when used inside the Edera Protect platform is primarily responsible for dealing with the Mount, PID, IPC, User, Time and UTS namespaces, while networking is handled elsewhere in the platform.</p><h2>Simple, Programmatic Interface</h2><p>Here's a glimpse of how Styrolite simplifies container creation compared to traditional approaches:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>// Create a basic container with Styrolite</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> mut request = CreateRequestBuilder::</span><span>new</span><span>()
</span><span>    .with_rootfs(</span><span>"/path/to/container/rootfs"</span><span>)
</span>    .set_executable(“/bin/sh”)
    .set_arguments(vec![“-i”])
    .set_working_directory(“/”)
    .push_namespace(Namespace::User)
    .push_namespace(Namespace::Mount)
    .push_namespace(Namespace::Pid)
    .to_request();

<span></span><span>// Launch a process in the container</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> runner = Runner::</span><span>new</span><span>(“styrolite”);
</span>runner.run(request)?;</code></pre><p>This clean interface makes container creation and management more maintainable and less error-prone than complex CLI commands or shell scripts.</p><h2>Real-World Applications</h2><p>Styrolite powers several important use cases:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Secure microservices:</strong> Within Edera Protect, Styrolite enables fine-grained container isolation for security-critical workloads</li><li><strong>Application sandboxing</strong>: Our companion tool, styrojail, helps Linux users limit resource consumption and improve security for applications like web browsers that process untrusted input</li><li><strong>Custom CI/CD environments: </strong>Developers can use Styrolite to create isolated build environments with precise resource controls</li></ul><h2>Performance and Security</h2><p>Styrolite is designed with minimal overhead, providing container initialization times comparable to or faster than traditional CLI approaches while offering stronger programmatic guarantees about container state.</p><p>Our security-first design acknowledges the inherent limitations of Linux namespaces while providing a more robust foundation through careful defaults and explicit security controls.</p><h2>Join the Community</h2><p>When we decided to build a low-level containerization tool for our own use in Edera Protect, we immediately knew it would have other benefits to the greater OSS community. We welcome contributions from the community:</p><ul role="list"><li>Star and fork the project on <a href="https://github.com/edera-dev/styrolite">GitHub</a></li><li>Try out Styrojail for application sandboxing</li><li>Report issues or suggest improvements</li><li>Contribute code or documentation</li></ul><p>We're committed to Styrolite's continued development and look forward to seeing how the community builds with it!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><img alt="Oracle" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2025/03/21/Oracle.jpg" width="1600"></p>

<p data-end="189" data-start="70">Despite Oracle&nbsp;denying a breach of its Oracle Cloud federated SSO login servers and the theft of account data for 6 million people, BleepingComputer has confirmed with multiple companies that associated data samples shared by the threat actor are valid.</p>

<p>Last week, a person named ‘rose87168’ claimed to have&nbsp;<a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-denies-data-breach-after-hacker-claims-theft-of-6-million-data-records/" delay="150" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-denies-data-breach-after-hacker-claims-theft-of-6-million-data-records/" navigationtraceid="TCJS5FY9E-to-Channel:UF436JBS4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">breached Oracle Cloud servers</a>&nbsp;and began selling the alleged authentication data and encrypted passwords of 6 million users.&nbsp;The threat actor also said that stolen SSO and LDAP passwords could be decrypted using the info in the stolen files and offered to share some of the data with anyone who could help recover them.</p>

<p>The threat actor released multiple text files consisting of a database, LDAP data, and a list of 140,621 domains of companies that were allegedly impacted by the breach. It should be noted that some of the company domains look like tests, and there are multiple domains per company.</p>

<figure><img alt="Threat actor selling allegedly stolen Oracle Cloud data" height="500" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1109292/2025/Oracle%20Cloud%20data%20leak.jpg" width="1236"><figcaption><strong>Threat actor selling allegedly stolen Oracle Cloud data</strong><br><em>Source: BleepingComputer</em></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the data, rose87168 shared an&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250301161517/http:/login.us2.oraclecloud.com/oamfed/x.txt?x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Archive.org URL</a> with BleepingComputer for a text file hosted on the "login.us2.oraclecloud.com" server that contained their email address. This file indicates that the threat actor could create files on Oracle's server, indicating an actual breach.</p>

<p>However, Oracle has denied that it suffered a breach of Oracle Cloud and has refused to respond to any further questions about the incident.</p>

<p>"There has been no breach of Oracle Cloud. The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data," the company told BleepingComputer last Friday.</p>

<p>This denial, however, contradicts findings from BleepingComputer, which received additional samples of the leaked data from the threat actor and contacted the associated companies.</p>

<p>Representatives from these companies, all who agreed to confirm the data under the promise of anonymity, confirmed the authenticity of the information. The companies stated that the associated LDAP display names, email addresses, given names, and other identifying information were all correct and belonged to them.</p>

<p>The threat actor also shared emails with BleepingComputer, claiming to be part of an exchange between them and Oracle.</p>

<p>One email shows the threat actor contacting Oracle's security email (secalert_us@oracle.com) to report that they hacked the servers.</p>

<p>"I've dug into your cloud dashboard infrastructure and found a massive vulnerability that has handed me full access to info on 6 million users," reads the email seen by BleepingComputer.</p>

<p>Another email thread shared with BleepingComputer shows an exchange between the threat actor and someone using a ProtonMail email address who claims to be from Oracle. BleepingComputer has redacted the email address of this other person as we could not verify their identity or the veracity of the email thread.</p>

<p>In this email exchange, the threat actor says someone from Oracle using a @proton.me email address told them that "We received your emails. Let’s use this email for all communications from now on. Let me know when you get this."</p>

<p data-end="716" data-start="551">Cybersecurity firm Cloudsek has also <a href="https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/the-biggest-supply-chain-hack-of-2025-6m-records-for-sale-exfiltrated-from-oracle-cloud-affecting-over-140k-tenants" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">found</a> an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250217171149/https://login.us2.oraclecloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Archive.org URL</a> showing that the "login.us2.oraclecloud.com" server was running Oracle Fusion Middleware 11g as of February 17, 2025. Oracle&nbsp;has since taken this server offline after news of the alleged breach was reported.</p>

<p>This version of the software was impacted by a vulnerability&nbsp;tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-35587" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2021-35587</a> that allowed unauthenticated attackers to compromise Oracle Access Manager. The threat actor claimed that this vulnerability was used in the alleged breach of Oracle's servers.</p>

<p>BleepingComputer has emailed Oracle numerous times about this information but has not received any response.</p>

This is a long overdue post on <a href="https://labs.iximiuz.com/">iximiuz Labs</a>' internal kitchen.
It'll cover why I decided to build my own learning-by-doing platform for DevOps, SRE, and Platform engineers, how I designed it, what technology stack chose, and how various components of the platform were implemented.
It'll also touch on some of the trade-offs that I had to make along the way and highlight the most interesting parts of the platform's architecture.
In the end, I'll, of course, share my thoughts on what's next on the roadmap.
Sounds interesting? Then brace for a long read!</p>

<div><p>Level up your server-side game — join 9,000 engineers getting insightful learning materials straight to their inbox.</p></div>
 <h2 id="why-my-own-online-playgrounds">Why my own online playgrounds?</h2>
<p>Before I decided to go all-in with iximiuz Labs, I'd already been <del>blogging</del> producing technical educational content for a few years.
My primary means of expression were plain writing and (quite a lot of) drawing.
However, there was one more, often overlooked but important, part - <strong>providing reproducible instructions on how to repeat the experiments from my articles to help students gain their own hands-on experience</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of just reading about a technology, I wanted the student to try it out, play with it, and see how it works first-hand.
This, in particular, required me to spend a non-trivial amount of time per article to come up with a set of steps to set up a lab environment...
But the harsh reality is that regardless of how big my effort was,
there would always be people lacking the right hardware, software, and/or skills to actually run these instructions.
So, I always felt that it could be done more efficiently.</p>
<p>A pretty common solution for this problem is to provide a web terminal connected to a pre-configured environment right on the article's page.
It definitely eliminates a great deal of the obstacles for the students.
They no longer need to install anything on their machines,
and it becomes possible to follow the instructions in the article without leaving the browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/katacoda-like-ux-min.png" alt="Blog post with an integrated web terminal on the side."></p><p>However, <strong>my personal experience with platforms providing such UX was not very positive</strong>.
I've tried a few of them, with Katacoda being the most notable one, but I was not impressed.
In the examples I've come across, the main focus would usually be on the playground capabilities and not on the educational content.
Students would often be provided with <del>humdrum</del> text materials on the left, from where they would have to copy-paste commands into the terminal on the right making it not very different from a regular blog post accompanied by a cloud VM.</p>
<p>I wanted to do better! 🤪</p>
<p>If I were to enhance my articles with playgrounds (not an easy undertaking for me at all), I wanted them to be a true integral part of the learning experience, not just a sidekick on my blog.</p>
<p>For me, <strong>the ultimate goal of tech education is to prepare the student to solve problems in real production environments</strong>
where there is often no instructor to guide them through the process.
Thus, efficient playgrounds should be designed in a way that would allow the student to learn by doing on their own, not by simply following instructions.
However, if the gap between the student's current skills and the skills required to solve the problem is too big,
the student would likely get stuck and give up.
It meant that I had to come up with a hybrid approach allowing the student to learn the theory in a structured (by the content author) way and then giving them a chance to apply what they've just learned on practice in a less-guided production-like environment.</p>
<p>On my ideal learning-by-doing platform, <strong>students would be walked through the theoretical part of the content first</strong>,
where they can learn the concepts and get familiar with the tools and techniques required to solve the problem.
And then, <strong>they would be presented with a set of exercises to try out and better internalize their newly acquired skills</strong>.</p>
<p>You can think of the first, theoretical, part as my traditional deep-dive blog post, where the main focus is on the text and visuals, and the terminal on the side is just an addition (so, not very different from a proverbial KataCoda).
The second, practical, part though, is meant to be something that I haven't seen in the wild much -
think of <strong>LeetCode- or even CodinGame-styled exercises (with interactive solution checking, gamification elements, and whatnot) but for Docker, Kubernetes, and other typical tools and technologies used by DevOps, SRE, or Platform engineers</strong>.</p>


<p>Interesting that as a student, I would probably be more looking forward to the new capabilities the playgrounds give me during the practical phase of learning.
However, as a teacher, I'm excited about the new possibilities that the playgrounds unlock for both, practical and theoretical, parts of education.</p>
<p>For the content authors, the playgrounds in the theoretical part become a new means of expression - for instance,
<strong>the instructor can use the playground to animate the processes and concepts from the lesson</strong>.
Just look at this PoC of a visualizer that I've come up with to explain how Kubernetes works - it utilizes the playground to run a Kubernetes cluster and render its state changes on a web canvas as the student interacts with it, all in real-time:</p>


<p>All this combined, it sounded like it was worth giving a shot -
if I were to try, I wouldn't be building yet another KataCoda but rather a new type of educational platform that I haven't seen before and which I would enjoy using myself as a student and as a teacher.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-design-goals">High-level design goals</h2>
<p>The rant above was inexcusably long, but I hope it gives you a better idea of what I'm trying to achieve with the platform as well as justifies some of the design decisions that I'm going to describe below.</p>
<p>As usual with system design, there's (way) more than one way to skin a cat.
My main goal was to ship something that would be good enough to start with, given the very limited resources I had to dedicate to the project.
My guiding principles were (and still are):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://matt-rickard.com/galls-law">Keep it simple</a> - no <del>Kubernetes</del> fancy tech, no large-scale cloud providers, no complex architecture.</li>
<li>Keep it reliable - no single point of failure and minimal probability of data loss.</li>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/05/25/new-playground--memory-spy/">Keep it secure</a> - limited attack surface and low incentives for the attackers.</li>
<li>Keep it cheap - the main cost factor (besides my time investment) should be the servers with playground VMs and not the management infrastructure.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modXC5IWTJI">Keep it realistic</a> - the first version of the platform should scale to 100-200 active playgrounds without any major redesign, and it's fine to rewrite it from scratch if it ever needs to scale beyond that.</li>
<li><a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/how-to-start-programming-in-go-for-devops/">Keep it productive</a> - use only programming languages and infra components that I'm already fluent in to avoid fighting multiple battles at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a high-level design of the platform that I came up with given the above constraints:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/iximiuz-Labs-high-level-arch-min.png" alt="iximiuz Labs v1 architecture"></p><p>The high-level idea is that there is a (static) web application, a central component called <em>Foreman</em>, concerned with everything but the playgrounds, and a fleet of horizontally scalable bare-metal servers (workers) behind it, each running a number of microVMs.</p>
<h2 id="foreman-component">Foreman component</h2>
<p>The kitchen-sink Foreman component includes a frontend application, a backend service for it, and a number of background jobs for various bookkeeping tasks.
It's by no means the most elegant approach, but it's not uncommon to structure things this way either, and since there is just a single developer (me) working on the platform, there is absolutely no need to split it into microservices just yet.</p>
<p>The main responsibilities of Foreman are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serve the (static) frontend JavaScript application, including the server-side rendering (SSR) of some pages for better SEO.</li>
<li>Implement authentication and authorization flows for end users (OAuth via GitHub at the moment).</li>
<li>Provide a simple REST API for the frontend app to start and stop courses, lessons, and freeform playgrounds.</li>
<li>Manage the fleet of workers and microVMs (pick the right worker server to start a new microVM on, monitor the health of the worker servers, update the status of the microVMs in the database, etc.).</li>
<li>Handle basic content management tasks (create, update, delete courses, lessons, playgrounds, etc).</li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: Video: Editing a markdown lesson with automatic preview -->

<p>All Foreman's subsystems are stateless, and their operations are mostly idempotent.
Even when I deploy multiple instances of Foreman, they can all work with the same database without (m)any conflicts.</p>
<p>From the security perspective, Foreman is likely the most sensitive component of the platform.
Gaining access to it would allow the attacker to mess with the content and the users' data, and also start any number of playgrounds.
However, it's not as bad as it sounds.</p>
<p>Messing with the content is not nice, but the mitigation is simple - I can always wipe it out and restore it from the source (all content lives in a Git repo).
The user data is somewhat more concerning, but the only thing the platform collects at the moment is the user's GitHub profile ID (for authentication purposes), which is public information anyway,
and the rest of the data, like the status of microVMs or users' course progress, is not so valuable outside of the platform's context.
Starting an arbitrary number of playgrounds is not a big deal either - the platform is designed to run only allowed microVM images, and Foreman doesn't have control over what's allowed and what's not.
So the attacker would be able to start a bunch of microVMs, but so is any other (premium) user of the platform.</p>
<h2 id="fleet-of-workers">Fleet of workers</h2>
<p>This is where I had to be the most creative.
Unlike Foreman, which is a pretty typical piece of software, the workers are much more exotic
and required quite a bit of experimentation and prototyping to get right.</p>
<p>Each worker server is a bare-metal machine (because it needs to run Firecracker, and nested virtualization isn't fun) with a bunch of daemons controlling various aspects of the worker's and microVM's lifecycle.</p>
<p>The worker servers are meant to be horizontally scalable and independent from each other.
They are also, in a way, stateless - the only state they maintain is the state of the microVMs they are running at the moment.
While it may cause some temporary inconvenience for the users, if something goes wrong with the worker server (including the server being compromised), it can be simply wiped out and replaced with a new one without a ripple effect on the rest of the platform.</p>
<h3 id="bender-daemon">Bender daemon</h3>
<p>The key component on a worker server is a daemon called <em>Bender</em>. It's responsible for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulling the template microVM rootfs and kernel images.</li>
<li>Preparing student-customized Firecracker drive images.</li>
<li>Configuring system resources (networking, temporary users, etc.) for microVMs.</li>
<li>Launching microVMs (including maintaining a warm pool of configured but not yet started playgrounds).</li>
<li>Monitoring microVMs' health and terminating failed or expired ones.</li>
<li>Exposing a simple REST API for Foreman to start and stop microVMs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, Bender to microVMs is what Docker or containerd is to containers - it's a single-host <del>container</del> microVM management daemon with a REST API.</p>
<p>Due to its nature, Bender is a highly privileged component (it runs as <em>root</em> directly on the host 🙈),
so my goal is to keep it as simple and focused as possible to minimize the attack surface.
Bender is also not exposed to end users directly (ideally, I'd not even expose it to the Internet, but currently, there is no LAN between Foreman and the workers due to my choice of the hosting providers).</p>
<p>Luckily, Bender is the only component that needs to run as <em>root</em> on the worker server.</p>
<h3 id="firecracker-microvms">Firecracker microVMs</h3>
<p>Every playground on iximiuz Labs consists of one or more microVMs.
The goal is to give the student shell access to an ephemeral Linux machine or a group of machines connected into a virtual network.</p>
<p>The multi-node nature of the playgrounds, plus various security and performance considerations, made me write quite a bit of custom code on top of Firecracker:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/multi-node-playground-min.png" alt="Multi-node playground architecture."></p><p>The design of the playgrounds is highly influenced by <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite">Weave Ignite</a> and Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Weave Ignite taught me to run Firecracker microVMs in Docker containers - it helps a lot with network management and also simplifies the cleanup logic.
To configure networking for a microVM, one needs to create a tun/tap device on the host, attach it to the microVM,
and add a bunch of iptables rules to route the traffic to/from the microVM.
Alex Ellis has a great <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/firecracker-init-lab">GitHub project</a> demonstrating how to do that.
It's not too complicated, but when it needs to be done for tens of microVMs on a single host, and combined with the egress and side- traffic filtering, it becomes a bit of a pain
to manage.
However, most of the networking trickery, including the creation of tun/tap devices, can be done in an isolated network namespace of a Docker container.
And when the VM is terminated, the container is terminated as well, so the cleanup is automatic (well, Docker will do it for you).</p>
<p>And Kubernetes inspired me to take the idea of running Firecracker microVMs in containers even further.
In Kubernetes, <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/">Pods are essentially groups of semi-fused containers that share some of their namespaces</a>, most notably the network namespace.
But it sounds pretty much what I needed for my multi-node playgrounds - a group of microVMs that can communicate with each other over a virtual network
can be represented as a group of containers that share the same network namespace.
And every such group gets its own Docker network (with a bunch of extra firewall rules) to isolate it from the other groups.</p>
<p>From the security standpoint, Firecracker microVMs are the most exposed part of the platform - I give Internet strangers direct shell access to them!
But they are also the most limited and isolated part of the system - each microVM gets an ephemeral non-privileged user assigned, then <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/83bde9c7dd791b96ec12406b5a012330d9e0833f/docs/jailer.md">jailed</a> and containerized on top of that.
Even breaking out of the VM would still require the attacker to gain root access to the host.
Nothing is impossible, but I personally don't know how to do that, and I'm doing my best to keep the system up-to-date with the latest security patches.</p>
<p>MicroVMs are resource- and rate-limited, and they are automatically terminated after a certain period of time.
The egress traffic from the <strong>free-tier microVMs</strong> is not just rate-limited but also restricted to DNS and HTTP(S) and only to an allow-listed set of hosts (this part was a bit tricky to implement, but thanks to my extensive experience with Envoy and Istio, I got it seemingly right after a few iterations).</p>
<h3 id="conductor-daemon">Conductor daemon</h3>
<p>As it was supposed to be clear from its name, the <em>Conductor</em> daemon is concerned with passing the commands from the student to the microVMs and back.
At the moment, it includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Terminal</em> session(s) - a bidirectional stream of bytes between the student's browser and the microVM's shell.</li>
<li><em>Tasks</em> - a set of commands to be executed on the microVM in accordance with the lesson's instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a browser tab is about to make a new Conductor connection,
it <em>claims</em> a connection slot sending an authenticated request to Foreman.
Foreman then issues a unique short-lived token for the connection and registers it in the corresponding Conductor instance before returning the token to the browser.
Once the browser receives the token, it can establish a WebSocket connection directly to the Conductor instance on the worker server with the target microVM.</p>
<p>The web terminal in the browser is implemented using <a href="https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js">Xterm.js</a>, and Conductor uses a similar to <a href="https://github.com/yudai/gotty">yudai/gotty</a> approach to proxy a TTY-controlled shell session to the browser.
The shell session itself is a good old SSH connection over a Unix socket which is mounted into the microVM's container and then proxied by the <em>Firestarter</em> shim component to the microVM's tap interface.</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/conductor-daemon-role-min.png" alt="conductor daemon role in the system."></p><p>The <em>tasks</em> are also passed to the playground via a WebSocket connection to Conductor.
I'll touch on the tasks in more detail in the next section, but for now, it's enough to know that they are just a set of commands authored by the lesson's author
and executed on the microVM in a predefined order.
When a task changes its state (e.g., from <em>pending</em> to <em>running</em> or from <em>running</em> to <em>finished</em>), Conductor notifies the browser page about it via a WebSocket message.
This is how the student's progress is tracked and visualized in the browser.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-solution-checking-subsystem">Automatic solution-checking subsystem</h3>
<p>The automatic solution checking is one of the most interesting parts of iximiuz Labs.
Even more, it's likely the key differentiator at the moment.
The subsystem deserves a separate blog post, which I should definitely write one day, but for now, I'll just give you a high-level overview
and highlight the most interesting technical challenges I had to overcome.</p>
<p>The automatic solution-checking subsystem is based on the concept of <em>tasks</em>.
Tasks are low-level building blocks behind the content's interactive elements and the exercises in the practice sections.
The content author can define a set of commands, in a similar way GitHub Actions pipelines are written,
that will be sent to the playground microVMs upon starting the lesson (or the exercise).</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/tasks.jpeg" alt="Example of a task definition."></p><p>On the microVM side, the commands are organized in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then periodically executed by a special daemon called <em>Examiner</em>.
If the task's command terminates with a non-zero exit code or times out, it's (almost) immediately retried.
And when a command finally finishes successfully, the browser page gets notified about it via a WebSocket message passed through Conductor.</p>
<p>The original idea was to (re-)use the SSH sessions (from the web terminal implementation) to pass the commands from Conductor to Examiner daemons:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/verification-engine.jpeg" alt="Automatic solution-checking subsystem."></p><p>However, the implementation turned out to be too complex and unreliable, especially when it came to timely reporting the task's state changes to the browser.
Surprisingly, the help came from the most unexpected place - gRPC!
gRPC is a perfect fit for the local communication between a daemon and its CLI client -
different projects, including containerd, use it for that purpose.
The <em>Examiner</em> daemon had already been using gRPC for the communication with its CLI client, <em>examinerctl</em>, meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conductor could use the same gRPC client directly to pass the commands to the Examiner daemon instead of executing them via <em>examinerctl</em> over SSH.</li>
<li>gRPC streams could be used to notify Conductor, and transitively the browser, about the task's state changes in a timely and reliable manner.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/examiner-examinerctl-grpc-min.png" alt="Using gRPC for local communication between a daemon and a CLI client."></p><h2 id="choosing-the-technology-stack">Choosing the technology stack</h2>
<p>It's not hard to notice that the above components are very diverse in their nature.
Thus, picking a single programming language or a framework for the whole platform was not an option.
However, since <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/minimal-viable-frameworks">the toolchain sprawl is a real problem</a>,
I tried to minimize the number of technologies involved as much as possible.</p>
<p><img width="45%" src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/iximiuz-labs-tech-stack.png" alt="iximiuz Labs tech stack: 34% Go, 27% Vue, 25% JavaScript, 10% misc shell scripts and Dockerfiles"></p><p>The need for developing a frontend app made the choice of JavaScript (or TypeScript) a no-brainer.
Hypothetically, I could have used Node.js for system daemons as well, but most of the projects in the Cloud Native space are written in Go,
and I didn't want to fight the ecosystem.
So, Go it was. But that's where I stopped.
Despite my warm feelings towards Python and Rust, I didn't want to introduce yet another language into the mix.
The tandem of Go and JavaScript is not my favorite, but it covers all the bases, and historically I've been pretty productive with it.</p>
<h3 id="frontend-app-and-api-layer">Frontend app and API layer</h3>
<p>Initially, I thought I'd use Vue.js for the frontend app (the only web framework I'm more or less fluent in)
and put an API server behind it written in Go.
However, I soon realized that I'd need to implement the server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO purposes -
after all, that's one of the main traffic sources for my blog at the moment.
So it made me try Nuxt 3, and rather unexpectedly, I liked it!
Nuxt 3 was just released out of beta,
still a bit rough around the edges, and with very limited documentation,
but nevertheless, I managed to bootstrap a simple app with SSR and a REST API in a matter of hours.
Six months later, I'm still using Nuxt 3, and I'm even happier with my choice now.</p>
<p>To avoid dealing a lot with the basic UI components, I bought the <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI kit</a> and befriended it with <a href="https://daisyui.com/">daisyUI</a> -
the Frankenstein's monster I'm not proud of, but it worked!
Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how much a hardcore backend engineer can achieve with the modern frontend stack these days:</p>
<blockquote data-lang="en" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I've been solo-building a pet project for a few months, and I'm pleasantly surprised by how much a hardcore backend engineer can achieve with the modern frontend stack! 💪</p><p>A thread on tools and tricks that helped me to develop a Web UI for iximiuz Labs 🧵 <a href="https://t.co/nrpVLUVe1T">pic.twitter.com/nrpVLUVe1T</a></p></div>— Ivan Velichko (@iximiuz) <a href="https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1640380028952227843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2023</a></blockquote> 

<p>The built-in API layer in Nuxt 3 turned out to be so handy, that I decided not to implement a separate API server in Go, at least for now.
But if there is no separate API server, why not to try putting the background jobs into the Nuxt app as well?
That's how the main business logic of the platform ended up being implemented in JavaScript 🙈</p>
<h3 id="backend-worker-servers-and-infra-glue">Backend worker servers and infra glue</h3>
<p>Two main daemons that live on the worker servers are written in Go.
One of them is launched as a systemd service, and the other one runs in a Docker container.
Both daemons expose HTTP APIs (via <a href="https://github.com/go-chi/chi">chi</a>),
and one of the daemons also has a built-in WebSocket server (via the archived <a href="https://github.com/gorilla/websocket">gorilla/websocket</a> package).</p>
<p>Docker is heavily (ab)used all over the platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>For development purposes - various dev tools are containerized.</li>
<li>As a means to package and deploy the daemons, microVM rootfs and kernel images, etc.</li>
<li>As a runtime for one of the daemons and surrounding infrastructure (Redis, Nginx, Envoy, etc.).</li>
<li>As a runtime for playgrounds - Firecracker microVMs are launched inside Docker containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting that playgrounds at the moment are also described in Dockerfiles, then built as Docker images, and stored in a private Docker registry.
When the playground management daemon needs to start a new playground, it pulls the image from the registry, extracts it into a directory, and creates a Firecracker drive image from its contents.</p>
<p>Other notable technologies used on worker servers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nginx - as a reverse-proxy in front of the backend daemons.</li>
<li>Envoy - as a transparent TCP egress proxy for the microVMs.</li>
<li>Redis - as a storage for daemons' state and as a message broker between them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hosting-and-data-storage-providers">Hosting and data storage providers</h3>
<p>I've considered quite a few options for hosting the platform, and it wasn't an easy choice. The goals were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the costs as low as possible.</li>
<li>Avoid managing some pieces (e.g., frontend ingress, databases, etc.).</li>
<li>...but retain the ability to manage the others (e.g., the frontend app itself, the worker servers, etc).</li>
<li>Choose a geographically scalable solution (students' proximity to the VMs is important).</li>
</ul>
<p>For the frontend app, I honestly tried to stay open-minded and considered all the fancy serverless-ish and edge-y solutions - Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, to name a few.</p>
<p>However, I ended up using <del>good old cloud VMs</del> more traditional <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">fly.io Machines</a>.
The amount of control over the frontend app Fly Machines give me is close to ideal - I can package in a container whatever (and however) I want and deploy it to a bunch of cheap VMs in a bunch of regions in a matter of seconds.
The ingress (including TLS termination and load balancing) and the automatic restarts on failure will be managed by fly.io.
The only thing that is not covered by fly.io yet is (more or less advanced) observability, but I'm hoping it'll be addressed soon.</p>
<p>For the storage layer, I tried to be open-minded again (considered Supabase, Fauna, Xata, Upstash...),
but in the end, I decided to go with the most boring option - MongoDB Atlas (with point-in-time backups).
I almost chose Fly's (semi-managed) Postgres offering, but at the time, the failback (after a failover) was not working as expected, and I didn't want to deal with it.
I should probably give it another try, though, because MongoDB is great for production but not so great for analytics and reporting (at least in my experience).</p>
<p>The choice for the worker servers was much easier - <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/sb">Hetzner Auction</a> is the cheapest bare-metal hosting I've ever known (I currently pay ~$40/mo for a server with 128GB RAM and 6 cores), on which I can fit tens of concurrent playgrounds. And if I ever need to expand to other regions, I'll likely try finding a similar hosting provider in the Americas and/or Asia.</p>
<p>The total monthly infra bill is currently around $100, where 80-90% of it is the cost of the worker servers.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next-on-the-roadmap">What's next on the roadmap?</h2>
<p>Content, of course!
I've already finished the first module (with two solid lessons) of my <a href="https://labs.iximiuz.com/courses/containerd-cli">course on containerd</a>,
but after blogging about containers for almost five years, I've accumulated soooo many content ideas... Now I finally have a platform to implement them on!</p>
<p>On the feature side, things that I'm planning to add next are:</p>
<ul>
<li>IDE integration (<a href="https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia">Eclipse Theia</a> or the like) - apparently, not everyone is a Vim fan 🤷‍♂️</li>
<li>Multi-node playgrounds - the engine is already there, but the UI needs to catch up 👷‍♂️</li>
<li>Kubernetes visualizer from the video at the beginning of the article ❤️‍🔥</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the dream goals is to open-source Bender and the Firecracker rootfs generation tooling.
However, before I can find a sustainable way to fund the work on the platform, I'm not sure if I can afford to spend time on it.</p>
<p>Of course, the users should have control over the roadmap too, not just me.
And speaking of the users, I'm staying open-minded - initially, I built the platform for myself (as an author) and for the readers of my blog (as students),
but I can see it being used by other educators and/or the students themselves to create and share their own labs.
Companies can use it to train their employees or conduct automated job interviews - something similar to HackerRank but for DevOps topics.
And universities can potentially use it to teach CS students.
The possibilities are endless (tm) 🚀</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>This week, the genetic testing company </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/24/nx-s1-5338622/23andme-bankruptcy-genetic-data-privacy"><span>23andMe filed for bankruptcy</span></a><span>, which means the genetic data the company collected on millions of users is now up for sale. If you do not want your data included in any potential sale, it’s a good time to ask the company to delete it. <br></span></p>
<p><span>When the company first announced it was considering a sale, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/sale-23andmes-data-would-be-bad-privacy-heres-what-customers-can-do"><span>we highlighted many of the potential issues</span></a><span>, including selling that data to companies with poor security practices or direct links to law enforcement. With this bankruptcy, the concerns we expressed last year remain the same. It is unclear what will happen with your genetic data if 23andMe finds a buyer, and that uncertainty is a clear indication that you should consider deleting your data. </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-urgently-issues-consumer-alert-23andme-customers"><span>California attorney general Rob Bonta agrees</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><span>First: Download Your Data</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/03/26/picture1.png" width="936" height="568" alt="screenshot of 23andme data delete page" title="screenshot of 23andme data delete page"></span></p>
<p><span>Before you delete your account, you may want to download the data for your own uses. If you do so, be sure to store it securely. To download you data:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Log into your 23andMe account and click your username, then click "Settings."&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Scroll down to the bottom where it says "23andMe Data" and click "View."</span></li>
<li><span>Here, you'll find the option to download various parts of your 23andMe data. The most important ones to consider are:</span></li>
<ol>
<li><span>The "Reports Summary" includes details like the "Wellness Reports," "Ancestry Reports," and "Traits Reports."</span></li>
<li><span>The "Ancestry Composition Raw Data" the company's interpretation of your raw genetic data.</span></li>
<li><span>If you were using the DNA Relatives feature, the "Family Tree Data" includes all the information about your relatives. Based on the descriptions of the data we've seen, this sounds like the data the bad actors collected.</span></li>
<li><span>You can also download the "Raw data," which is the uninterpreted version of your DNA.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><span>There are other types of data you can download on this page, though much of it will not be of use to you without special software. But there's no harm in downloading it all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How to Delete Your Data</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/03/26/picture2.png" width="936" height="604" alt="screenshot of 23andme data delete page" title="screenshot of 23andme data delete page"></span></p>
<p><span>Finally, you can delete your data and revoke consent for research. While it doesn’t make this clear on the deletion page, this </span><a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212170688-Requesting-23andMe-Account-Closure"><span>also authorizes the company</span></a><span> to destroy your DNA sample, if you hadn't already asked them to do so. You can also make this request more explicit if you want in the </span><a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/202907570-Preferences-Notifications-Consent-Report-Configuration"><span>Account preferences section</span></a><span> page.</span></p>
<p><span>If you're still on the page to download your data from the steps above, you can skip to step three. Otherwise:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click your username, then click "Settings."&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Scroll down to the bottom where it says "23andMe Data" and click "View."</span></li>
<li><span>Scroll down to the bottom of this page, and click "Permanently Delete Data."</span></li>
<li><span>You should get a message stating that 23andMe received the request but you need to confirm by clicking a link sent to your email.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Head to your email account associated with your 23andMe account to find the email titled "23andMe Delete Account Request." Click the "Permanently Delete All Records" button at the bottom of the email, and you will be taken to a page that will say "Your data is being deleted" (You may need to log in again, if you logged out).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>23andMe should give every user a real choice to say “no” to a data transfer in this bankruptcy and ensure that any buyer makes real privacy commitments. Other consumer genetic genealogy companies should proactively take these steps as well. Our DNA contains our entire genetic makeup. It can reveal where our ancestors came from, who we are related to, our physical characteristics, and whether we are likely to get genetically determined diseases. Even if you don’t add your own DNA to a private database, a relative could make that choice for you by adding their own. <br></span></p>
<p><span>This incident is an example of why this matters, and how certain features that may seem useful in the moment can be weaponized in novel ways. A bankruptcy should not result in our data getting shuffled off to the highest bidder without our input or a guarantee of&nbsp; real protections.</span></p>

          <p>Google is planning a major change to the way it develops new versions of the Android operating system. Since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/10/google-liberates-android-source-code-so-start-developing/">the beginning</a>, large swaths of the software have been developed in public-facing channels, but that will no longer be the case. This does not mean Android is shedding its open source roots, but the process won't be as transparent.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">has confirmed</a> to Android Authority that all Android development work going forward will take place in Google's internal branch. This is a shift from the way Google has worked on Android in the past, which featured frequent updates to the public AOSP branch. Anyone can access AOSP, but the internal branches are only available to Google and companies with a Google Mobile Services (GMS) license, like Samsung, Motorola, and others.</p>
<p>According to the company, it is making this change to simplify things, building on a recent change to trunk-based development. As Google works on both public and private branches of Android, the two fall out of sync with respect to features and API support. This forces Google to tediously merge the branches for every release. By focusing on the internal branch, Google claims it can streamline releases and make life easier for everyone.</p>
<p>When new versions of Android are done, Google says it will continue to publish the source code in AOSP as always. Supposedly, this will allow developers to focus on supporting their apps without keeping track of pending changes to the platform in AOSP. Licensed OEMs, meanwhile, can just focus on the lively internal branch as they work on devices that can take a year or more to launch.</p>

<p dir="auto">A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using <a href="https://playwright.dev/" rel="nofollow">Playwright</a>. This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/airline-demand-canada-united-states-collapses/">https://onemileatatime.com/news/airline-demand-canada-united-states-collapses/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485649">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Recently, I wrote about how <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/insights/united-states-tourism-decline-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’re seeing a general softening of demand</a> for travel to the United States, for a variety of reasons. There’s no denying that the most contentious situation is between Canada and the United States, and we now have some data that shows just how extreme the change in demand is.</p>



<div id="ez-toc-container">

<nav><ul><li><a href="#transborder_flight_bookings_are_down_by_70" title="Transborder flight bookings are down by 70%+">Transborder flight bookings are down by 70%+</a></li><li><a href="#when_will_airlines_slash_more_transborder_capacity" title="When will airlines slash more transborder capacity?">When will airlines slash more transborder capacity?</a></li><li><a href="#bottom_line" title="Bottom line">Bottom line</a></li></ul></nav></div>
<h2 id="h-transborder-flight-bookings-are-down-by-70"><span id="transborder_flight_bookings_are_down_by_70"></span>Transborder flight bookings are down by 70%+<span></span></h2>



<p>We’ve known that travel demand between Canada and the United States has been decreasing, both by air and by roads. We’ve seen some airlines scale back their flight schedules between the two countries, and we’ve also seen a substantial decline in road border crossings. However, it looks like what we’ve seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>



<p>Aviation analytics company <a href="https://www.oag.com/blog/canada-us-airline-capacity-aviation-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OAG has published some data</a> on the decline in flight bookings between the countries, and it’s worse than most people probably imagined. Specifically, the company compared summer season bookings in March 2024 vs. March 2025. In other words, at this point in both years, how many people have booked transborder flights in April through September?</p>



<p>Well, I hope you’re sitting down. For that six month period, the number of tickets booked is down anywhere from 71.4% to 75.7%. Just as an example, April is less than a week away, and here’s how bookings between the two countries are looking:</p>



<ul>
<li>In March 2024, 1,218,570 tickets had been booked for April 2024</li>



<li>In March 2025, 295,982 tickets have been booked for April 2025</li>



<li>That represents a 75.7% reduction in tickets booked</li>
</ul>



<p>I knew it was bad, but I didn’t expect it would be that bad, as that level of demand shift is something you almost never see.</p><!-- /1019006/OMAAT_InContent -->





<p>Everyone can draw their own conclusions as to what’s causing this. It’s also anyone’s guess if we’re at rock bottom in terms of consumer sentiment, and if we’ll see more close-in bookings than in past years. But either way, April is right around the corner, and those drops are massive.</p>

<h2 id="h-when-will-airlines-slash-more-transborder-capacity"><span id="when_will_airlines_slash_more_transborder_capacity"></span>When will airlines slash more transborder capacity?<span></span></h2>



<p>We’ve seen airlines cancel a bit of capacity between the United States and Canada, but nothing that nearly reflects the decline in future bookings that we’re seeing. According to OAG, so far airlines have slashed anywhere from 1.6% to 3.5% of their schedules between the two countries for April through September.</p>



<p>However, based on current data, that doesn’t even begin to cover the adjustments that will need to be made, unless something drastic happens soon. Obviously one would assume that Air Canada would be most impacted by these changes, given that the airline has the largest transborder network. Perhaps we’ll see Air Canada shift more capacity domestically, or to countries other than the United States, to account for where consumers want to travel to.</p>



<p>This can’t be an easy situation for those in airline route planning, since it’s hard to know for how long demand will remain so depressed. It’s not easy to just totally rework your route network, especially when it’s anyone’s guess how this evolves.</p>

<h2 id="h-bottom-line"><span id="bottom_line"></span>Bottom line<span></span></h2>



<p>We’ve known that there has been a decline in travel between Canada and the United States. However, the situation for future flight bookings looks much worse, with an over 70% reduction in flight bookings for the summer season. So far airlines have slashed at most 3.5% of their schedules, so presumably some significant changes will still have to be made.</p>



<p><strong>What do you make of these statistics on future transborder flight bookings? Are you surprised by the size of the decline?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">Model context protocol</a> (aka MCP) is a way to provide tools and context to the LLM. From the MCP docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Agents SDK has support for MCP. This enables you to use a wide range of MCP servers to provide tools to your Agents.</p>
<h2 id="mcp-servers">MCP servers</h2>
<p>Currently, the MCP spec defines two kinds of servers, based on the transport mechanism they use:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>stdio</strong> servers run as a subprocess of your application. You can think of them as running "locally".</li>
<li><strong>HTTP over SSE</strong> servers run remotely. You connect to them via a URL.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use the <a title="MCPServerStdio" href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/mcp/server/#agents.mcp.server.MCPServerStdio"><code>MCPServerStdio</code></a> and <a title="MCPServerSse" href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/mcp/server/#agents.mcp.server.MCPServerSse"><code>MCPServerSse</code></a> classes to connect to these servers.</p>
<p>For example, this is how you'd use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem">official MCP filesystem server</a>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-0-1"><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a><span>async</span> <span>with</span> <span>MCPServerStdio</span><span>(</span>

</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="using-mcp-servers">Using MCP servers</h2>
<p>MCP servers can be added to Agents. The Agents SDK will call <code>list_tools()</code> on the MCP servers each time the Agent is run. This makes the LLM aware of the MCP server's tools. When the LLM calls a tool from an MCP server, the SDK calls <code>call_tool()</code> on that server.</p>

<h2 id="caching">Caching</h2>
<p>Every time an Agent runs, it calls <code>list_tools()</code> on the MCP server. This can be a latency hit, especially if the server is a remote server. To automatically cache the list of tools, you can pass <code>cache_tools_list=True</code> to both <a title="MCPServerStdio" href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/mcp/server/#agents.mcp.server.MCPServerStdio"><code>MCPServerStdio</code></a> and <a title="MCPServerSse" href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/mcp/server/#agents.mcp.server.MCPServerSse"><code>MCPServerSse</code></a>. You should only do this if you're certain the tool list will not change.</p>
<p>If you want to invalidate the cache, you can call <code>invalidate_tools_cache()</code> on the servers.</p>

<p>For years now, Android has been developed in a way that allowed the public to look in on Google’s work, but that’s now changing as Google has just confirmed that it will start to develop the operating system entirely in its internal branch.</p>



<p>The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) has left most of Google’s work in developing Android as an operating system visible to the public eye. But, starting next week, Google is moving that work behind closed doors.</p>



<p>Google confirmed to <em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">Android Authority</a></em> that “all Android development will occur within Google’s internal branches,” the publication says. This is a shift from how Android has been developed for a very long time, but also aligns with more recent moves Google has been making. For a while now, Google has been developing most parts of Android behind closed doors in its “internal branches,” with the “AOSP branch” only having certain other aspects of Android’s framework (including Bluetooth, kernel, and some other core components). As such, it’s been quite a while since the current state of AOSP is at the same level as Google’s internal builds, leaving developers and others to wait on Google to make a public release to get <em>all </em>of the new changes.</p>



<p>With this change to move everything to its internal, private development branch, Google isn’t changing the speed at which these new builds arrive. Rather, this will potentially streamline the process and prevent conflicts when merging the branches.</p>	
	



<p>This does not mean that Google is making Android a closed-source platform, but rather that the open-source aspect will only be released when a new branch is released to AOSP with those changes, including when new full versions or maintenance releases are finished.</p>



<p>In the end, users of Android almost certainly won’t see any changes from this new structure. App developers will also likely be unaffected. The biggest impact may be on the tidbits caught from AOSP that make their way into the public eye, such as the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/21/google-pixel-10-aosp-android-boot-time-improvement/">recent appearance of “Pixel 10” in an AOSP commit.</a> That may be for the best, as those small tidbits can often be misconstrued or overhyped, leading to confusion later on.</p>



<p>A formal announcement of this change is apparently coming “later this week,” with the change itself happening next week. We’ll update this post when Google makes further details available.</p>

And, while there has been <a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/the-changing-face-of-open-source-security" rel="noopener">some decline in malware numbers between 2023 and 2024</a>, this year's numbers don’t seem to continue that downward trend. Still, while RL has detected some interesting npm malware so far this year, none of it warranted a detailed writeup.</p><p>Then March rolled around, and two very interesting packages were published on npm: <a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/ethers-provider2" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ethers-provider2</span></a> and <a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/ethers-providerz" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ethers-providerz</span></a>. These were simple downloaders whose malicious payload was cleverly hidden, with a second stage that “patches” the legitimate npm package <a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/ethers" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ethers</span></a>, installed locally, with a new file containing the malicious payload. That patched file ultimately serves a reverse shell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This approach reveals a high level of sophistication on the threat actor’s part that deserves some further analysis and exploration.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h2><em>ethers-provider2</em> delivers the malware</h2>
<div><p>The package <em>ethers-provider2 </em>was still available on npm at the time of publication. The package mirrors another, legitimate and widely-used npm package, <em>ssh2</em>, which has more than 350 million downloads and more than 1,600 dependent applications. The <em>ethers-provider2</em> package contains the <em>ssh2</em> source code, adding some malicious elements to it. So the whole package functions exactly how the <em>ssh2</em> package would — with something extra.</p><p>The package was easily detected by RL's Spectra platform, with telltale signs it contained malicious code. First, the file <em>install.js </em>had been modified to include a malicious payload downloading second stage malware from the domain <em>hxxp[:]//5[.]199[.]166[.]1[:]31337/install</em>. Upon installation, the install script install.js is executed and a second stage is downloaded to a temporary file and then executed. Immediately after that, the temporary file is deleted, removing any indication that anything happened, which was another sign the package is malicious, since this usually doesn’t happen in legitimate packages.&nbsp;</p><p>As we looked at the second stage malware, things got really interesting. The malware goes into an infinite loop that checks if the legitimate npm package <em>ethers</em> is installed locally. If it is installed, or once it is installed, the second-stage malware springs into action: replacing one of its files, <em>provider-jsonrpc.js</em>, with a file that looks- and functions the same, but includes additional, malicious code that downloads the third-stage malware from <em>hxxp[:]//5[.]199[.]166[.]1[:]31337/config</em> and executes it.</p></div>

<p>Figure 1: ethers-provider2’s second stage</p>
<div><p>The second-stage malware also creates a file, <em>loader.js</em>, which writes code with the same functionality as the malicious code used to “patch” the ethers’ file, and then runs it.</p><p>The third stage serves a reverse shell connecting to the threat actor’s server, which is accessed using an ssh client from <em>ethers-provider2</em>. This client functions in the same way as a client from a legitimate <em>ssh2 </em>package would, but it is modified to receive additional messages. That means that the connection opened with this client turns into a reverse shell once it receives a custom message from the server. This is true even if the <em>ethers-provider2</em> package is removed from a compromised system: the client will still be used under certain circumstances, providing a degree of persistence for the attackers.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>Figure 2: Reverse shell opened towards threat actors’ server</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<div><p>While not as common as infostealers on the npm platform, downloaders are far from uncommon and are frequently encountered. However, this downloader is notable because of the exceptional strategies employed by the attackers to hide the malicious payload it delivered. These evasive techniques were more thorough and effective than we have observed in npm-based downloaders before.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, once the malicious payload, <em>ethers-provider2</em>, was delivered, its removal wouldn’t necessarily remove its malicious functionality. Instead, it would remain hidden in another location. And if the package <em>ethers-provider2</em> was present when the ethers package was removed and installed again, it would patch it again in the same way described previously.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also important to mention once again that the malicious code was only put inside the locally installed npm package <a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/ethers" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>ethers</em></a>, and that the official npm package ethers was not compromised in any way.&nbsp;</p></div>
<h2>I am (not) throwin’ away my shot</h2>
<div><p>The other package belonging to the same campaign, <em>ethers-providerz </em>had only three versions, and the last two were very similar to <em>ethers-provider2</em>; whereas the first one <em>1.16.0</em> looked more like a test version, with some parts that didn't work as the threat actor probably intended.</p><p>The malicious payload was located in the install script <em>install.js</em>. It tries to “patch” several files of a legitimate locally installed npm package <em>@ethersproject/providers</em> in the same way <em>ethers’ </em>file <em>provider-jsonrpc.js </em>was patched.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>Which npm package was targeted for patching is speculative at this point, because the path to each file was written incorrectly, with the threat actor defining the scope, but not providing the name of the intended package.</p>
<a href="https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png"><img src="https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=1400&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png" alt="ReversingLabs" width="1400" srcset="https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=700&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 700w, https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=1400&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 1400w, https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=2100&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 2100w, https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=2800&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 2800w, https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=3500&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 3500w, https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=4200&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 4200w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a>
<p>Figure 3: Malicious payload inside install.js script</p>
<div><p>The RL research team also observed the malicious payload creating a malicious file, <em>loader.js</em>, in the folder <em>node_modules</em>, and executing it. The <em>node_modules</em> folder is where npm packages are stored by default once they are installed. The file <em>loader.js</em> downloads the second stage from <em>hxxp[:]//5[.]199[.]166[.]1[:]31337/config</em>.</p><p>What's interesting about this is that there is a legitimate npm package called <a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/loader.js" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>loader.js</em></a> with more than 24 million downloads and 5,200 dependent applications.This suggests that, as with <span>ssh2</span>, &nbsp;the threat actor was looking to “patch” a common, legitimate, and locally-installed npm package with a nearly identical version containing malicious code.</p></div>
<h2>RL YARA rule helps detect <em>ethers</em></h2>
<div><p>Detection of the malicious packages <em>ethers-provider2</em> and <em>ethers-providerz</em> was the easy part. They had very low download counts and contained non-obfuscated malicious code downloading the second stage inside the install script. RL’s Spectra platform finds obfuscated or non-obfuscated — and clearly malicious code — lurking in install scripts by identifying behaviors and characteristics when scanning both open- source and commercial, closed-source binaries. &nbsp;</p><p>Despite the low download numbers, these packages are powerful and malicious. If their mission is successful, they will corrupt the locally installed package ethers and maintain persistence on compromised systems even if that package is removed.</p><p>As of the time of publication, the package <em>ethers-providerz</em> was removed from npm, probably by the package's author because it has no security holding package. Package <em>ethers-provider2</em> is still on npm, but has been reported to the npm maintainers. </p><p>To address the risks posed by these packages, RL developed a simple YARA rule to help in detecting whether locally installed package <em>ethers</em> was “patched” or not.</p></div>

<h2>Even more packages?</h2>
<p>After this research was done, new packages were found that appear to be connected to this campaign: <em>reproduction-hardhat</em> and <em>@theoretical123/providers</em>. The former was a simple reverse shell that would connect to the IP address <em>5[.]199[.]166[.]1</em>, and the latter was a package downloading a second stage from <em>hxxp[:]//5[.]199[.]166[.]1[:]31337/config</em> and impersonating a legitimate npm package <em>@ethersproject/providers</em>. Both have been removed from npm.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div><p>As RL noted in its <a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/sscs-report" rel="noopener">2025 Software Supply Chain Security Report</a>, the scope of software supply chain risks is growing for both software producers and end-user organizations. While there was a drop in instances of malware discovered on open-source repositories like npm and PyPI in 2024, threat actors have not lost interest in promoting malicious packages to open-source developers.&nbsp;</p><p>This latest campaign is evidence that the risk of downloading malware and compromising development environments and networks remains high, while novel ways of serving malicious payloads are emerging.</p><p>The RL research team has already seen malicious packages serving malicious payloads that was in plain sight, obfuscated or cleverly hidden. Sometimes these packages are malicious by design. Other times, popular legitimate npm packages were hijacked and injected with malicious code. In these cases, there is usually a combination of approaches: the designed-malicious npm package injects a malicious payload into a legitimate and locally installed npm package, making it serve as a reverse shell. This approach makes it easier for the threat actor by reducing hurdles to hijacking a malicious open-source package.&nbsp;</p><p>What is even more ominous with this current threat: Even if the malicious package <span>ethers-provider2</span> is removed, the threat actors made sure their malicious functionality would persist. This highlights the importance of being alert to supply chain threats and attacks, since there are many malicious packages lurking on npm, serving malware in novel and not-so-novel ways.</p></div>
<h2>Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)</h2>
<div><p>Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) refer to forensic artifacts or evidence related to a security breach or unauthorized activity on a computer network or system. IOCs play a crucial role in cybersecurity investigations and cyber incident response efforts, helping analysts and cybersecurity professionals identify and detect potential security incidents.</p><p>The following IOCs were collected as part of RL's investigation of this malicious software supply chain campaign.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true" aria-labelledby="file-name-id-wide file-name-id-mobile"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">A love letter to the CSV format</h2><a id="user-content-a-love-letter-to-the-csv-format" aria-label="Permalink: A love letter to the CSV format" href="#a-love-letter-to-the-csv-format"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Or why people pretending CSV is dead are wrong</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Every month or so, a new blog article declaring the near demise of CSV in favor of some "obviously superior" format (<a href="https://parquet.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">parquet</a>, newline-delimited JSON, <a href="https://msgpack.org/" rel="nofollow">MessagePack</a> records etc.) find its ways to the reader's eyes. Sadly those articles often offer a very narrow and biased comparison and often fail to understand what makes CSV a seemingly unkillable staple of data serialization.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is therefore my intention, through this article, to write a love letter to this data format, often criticized for the wrong reasons, even more so when it is somehow deemed "cool" to hate on it. My point is not, far from it, to say that CSV is a silver bullet but rather to shine a light on some of the format's sometimes overlooked strengths.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">1. CSV is dead simple</h2><a id="user-content-1-csv-is-dead-simple" aria-label="Permalink: 1. CSV is dead simple" href="#1-csv-is-dead-simple"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The specification of CSV holds in its title: "comma separated values". Okay, it's a lie, but still, the specification holds in a tweet and can be explained to anybody in seconds: commas separate values, new lines separate rows. Now quote values containing commas and line breaks, double your quotes, and that's it. This is so simple you might even invent it yourself without knowing it already exists while learning how to program.</p>
<p dir="auto">Of course it does not mean you should not use a dedicated CSV parser/writer because you <em>will</em> mess something up.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2. CSV is a collective idea</h2><a id="user-content-2-csv-is-a-collective-idea" aria-label="Permalink: 2. CSV is a collective idea" href="#2-csv-is-a-collective-idea"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">No one owns CSV. It has no real specification (yes, I know about the controversial ex-post <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180" rel="nofollow">RFC 4180</a>), just a set of rules everyone kinda agrees to respect implicitly. It is, and will forever remain, an open and free collective idea.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">3. CSV is text</h2><a id="user-content-3-csv-is-text" aria-label="Permalink: 3. CSV is text" href="#3-csv-is-text"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Like JSON, YAML or XML, CSV is just plain text, that you are free to encode however you like. CSV is not a binary format, can be opened with any text editor and does not require any specialized program to be read. This means, by extension, that it can both be read and edited by humans directly, somehow.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">4. CSV is streamable</h2><a id="user-content-4-csv-is-streamable" aria-label="Permalink: 4. CSV is streamable" href="#4-csv-is-streamable"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">CSV can be read row by row very easily without requiring more memory than what is needed to fit a single row. This also means that a trivial program that anyone can write is able to read gigabytes of CSV data with only some kilobytes of RAM.</p>
<p dir="auto">By comparison, column-oriented data formats such as parquet are not able to stream files row by row without requiring you to jump here and there in the file or to buffer the memory cleverly so you don't tank read performance.</p>
<p dir="auto">But of course, CSV is terrible if you are only interested in specific columns because you will indeed need to read all of a row only to access the part you are interested in.</p>
<p dir="auto">Column-oriented data format are of course a very good fit for the dataframes mindset of R, pandas and such. But critics of CSV coming from this set of practices tend to only care about use-cases where everything is expected to fit into memory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">5. CSV can be appended to</h2><a id="user-content-5-csv-can-be-appended-to" aria-label="Permalink: 5. CSV can be appended to" href="#5-csv-can-be-appended-to"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It is trivial to add new rows at the end of a CSV file and it is very efficient to do so. Just open the file in append mode (<code>a+</code>) and get going.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once again, column-oriented data formats cannot do this, or at least not in a straightforward manner. They can actually be regarded as on-disk dataframes, and like with dataframes, adding a column is very efficient while adding a new row really isn't.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">6. CSV is dynamically typed</h2><a id="user-content-6-csv-is-dynamically-typed" aria-label="Permalink: 6. CSV is dynamically typed" href="#6-csv-is-dynamically-typed"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Please don't flee. Let me explain why this is sometimes a good thing. Sometimes when dealing with data, you might like to have some flexibility, especially across programming languages, when parsing serialized data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Consider JavaScript, for instance, that is unable to represent 64 bits integers. Or what languages, frameworks and libraries consider as null values (don't get me started on pandas and null values). CSV lets you parse values as you see fit and is in fact dynamically typed. But this is as much of a strength as it can become a potential footgun if you are not careful.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note also, but this might be hard to do with higher-level languages such as python and JavaScript, that you are not required to decode the text at all to process CSV cell values and that you can work directly on the binary representation of the text for performance reasons.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">7. CSV is succinct</h2><a id="user-content-7-csv-is-succinct" aria-label="Permalink: 7. CSV is succinct" href="#7-csv-is-succinct"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Having the headers written only once at the beginning of the file means the amount of formal repetition of the format is naturally very low. Consider a list of objects in JSON or the equivalent in XML and you will quickly see the cost of repeating keys everywhere. That does not mean JSON and XML will not compress very well, but few formats exhibit this level of natural conciseness.</p>
<p dir="auto">What's more, strings are often already optimally represented and the overhead of the format itself (some commas and quotes here and there) is kept to a minimum. Of course, statically-typed numbers could be represented more concisely, but you will not save up an order of magnitude there neither.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">8. Reverse CSV is still valid CSV</h2><a id="user-content-8-reverse-csv-is-still-valid-csv" aria-label="Permalink: 8. Reverse CSV is still valid CSV" href="#8-reverse-csv-is-still-valid-csv"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This one is not often realized by everyone but a reversed (byte by byte) CSV file, is still valid CSV. This is only made possible because of the genius idea to escape quotes by doubling them, which means escaping is a palindrom. It would not work if CSV used a backslash-based escaping scheme, as is most common when representing string literals.</p>
<p dir="auto">But why should you care? Well, this means you can read very efficiently and very easily the last rows of a CSV file. Just feed the bytes of your file in reverse order to a CSV parser, then reverse the yielded rows and their cells' bytes and you are done (maybe read the header row before though).</p>
<p dir="auto">This means you can very well use a CSV output as a way to efficiently resume an aborted process. You can indeed read and parse the last rows of a CSV file in constant time since you don't need to read the whole file but only to position yourself at the end of the file to buffer the bytes in reverse and feed them to the parser.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">9. Excel hates CSV</h2><a id="user-content-9-excel-hates-csv" aria-label="Permalink: 9. Excel hates CSV" href="#9-excel-hates-csv"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It clearly means CSV must be doing something right.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-slug="/blog/coretypes">
    
    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>The Go 1.18 release introduced generics and with that a number of new features, including type parameters, type constraints, and new concepts such as type sets.
It also introduced the notion of a <em>core type</em>.
While the former provide concrete new functionality, a core type is an abstract construct that was introduced
for expediency and to simplify dealing with generic operands (operands whose types are type parameters).
In the Go compiler, code that in the past relied on the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec/#Underlying_types">underlying type</a> of an operand,
now instead had to call a function computing the operand’s core type.
In the language spec, in many places we just needed to replace “underlying type” with “core type”.
What’s not to like?</p>
<p>Quite a few things, as it turns out!
To understand how we got here, it’s useful to briefly revisit how type parameters and type constraints work.</p>
<h2 id="type-parameters-and-type-constraints">Type parameters and type constraints</h2>
<p>A type parameter is a placeholder for a future type argument;
it acts like a <em>type variable</em> whose value is known at compile time,
similar to how a named constant stands for a number, string, or bool whose value is known at compile time.
Like ordinary variables, type parameters have a type.
That type is described by their <em>type constraint</em> which determines
what operations are permitted on operands whose type is the respective type parameter.</p>
<p>Any concrete type that instantiates a type parameter must satisfy the type parameter’s constraint.
This ensures that an operand whose type is a type parameter possesses all of the respective type constraint’s properties,
no matter what concrete type is used to instantiate the type parameter.</p>
<p>In Go, type constraints are described through a mixture of method and type requirements which together
define a <em>type set</em>: this is the set of all the types that satisfy all the requirements. Go uses a
generalized form of interfaces for this purpose. An interface enumerates a set of methods and types,
and the type set described by such an interface consists of all the types that implement those methods
and that are included in the enumerated types.</p>
<p>For instance, the type set described by the interface</p>
<pre><code>type Constraint interface {
    ~[]byte | ~string
    Hash() uint64
}
</code></pre>
<p>consists of all the types whose representation is <code>[]byte</code> or <code>string</code> and whose method set includes the <code>Hash</code> method.</p>
<p>With this we can now write down the rules that govern operations on generic operands.
For instance, the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec#Index_expressions">rules for index expressions</a> state that (among other things)
for an operand <code>a</code> of type parameter type <code>P</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The index expression <code>a[x]</code> must be valid for values of all types in <code>P</code>’s type set.
The element types of all types in <code>P</code>’s type set must be identical.
(In this context, the element type of a string type is <code>byte</code>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These rules make it possible to index the generic variable <code>s</code> below (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/M1LYKm3x3IB">playground</a>):</p>
<pre><code>func at[bytestring Constraint](s bytestring, i int) byte {
    return s[i]
}
</code></pre>
<p>The indexing operation <code>s[i]</code> is permitted because the type of <code>s</code> is <code>bytestring</code>, and the type constraint (type set) of
<code>bytestring</code> contains <code>[]byte</code> and <code>string</code> types for which indexing with <code>i</code> is valid.</p>
<h2 id="core-types">Core types</h2>
<p>This type set-based approach is very flexible and in line with the intentions of the
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">original generics proposal</a>:
an operation involving operands of generic type should be valid if it is valid for any type permitted by the respective
type constraint.
To simplify matters with respect to the implementation, knowing that we would be able to relax rules later,
this approach was <em>not</em> chosen universally.
Instead, for instance, for <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec#Send_statements">Send statements</a>, the spec states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The channel expression’s <em>core type</em> must be a channel, the channel direction must permit send operations,
and the type of the value to be sent must be assignable to the channel’s element type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These rules are based on the notion of a core type which is defined roughly as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a type is not a type parameter, its core type is just its <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec#Underlying_types">underlying type</a>.</li>
<li>If the type is a type parameter, the core type is the single underlying type of all the types in the type parameter’s type set.
If the type set has <em>different</em> underlying types, the core type doesn’t exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, <code>interface{ ~[]int }</code> has a core type (<code>[]int</code>), but the <code>Constraint</code> interface above does not have a core type.
To make things more complicated, when it comes to channel operations and certain built-in calls (<code>append</code>, <code>copy</code>) the above definition
of core types is too restrictive.
The actual rules have adjustments that allow for differing channel directions and type sets containing both <code>[]byte</code> and <code>string</code> types.</p>
<p>There are various problems with this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because the definition of core type must lead to sound type rules for different language features,
it is overly restrictive for specific operations.
For instance, the Go 1.24 rules for <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec#Slice_expressions">slice expressions</a> do rely on core types,
and as a consequence slicing an operand of type <code>S</code> constrained by <code>Constraint</code> is not permitted, even though
it could be valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When trying to understand a specific language feature, one may have to learn the intricacies of
core types even when considering non-generic code.
Again, for slice expressions, the language spec talks about the core type of the sliced operand,
rather then just stating that the operand must be an array, slice, or string.
The latter is more direct, simpler, and clearer, and doesn’t require knowing another concept that may be
irrelevant in the concrete case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the notion of core types exists, the rules for index expressions, and <code>len</code> and <code>cap</code> (and others),
which all eschew core types, appear as exceptions in the language rather than the norm.
In turn, core types cause proposals such as <a href="https://go.dev/issue/48522">issue #48522</a> which would permit a selector
<code>x.f</code> to access a field <code>f</code> shared by all elements of <code>x</code>’s type set, to appear to add more exceptions to the
language.
Without core types, that feature becomes a natural and useful consequence of the ordinary rules for non-generic
field access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="go-125">Go 1.25</h2>
<p>For the upcoming Go 1.25 release (August 2025) we decided to remove the notion of core types from the
language spec in favor of explicit (and equivalent!) prose where needed.
This has multiple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Go spec presents fewer concepts, making it easier to learn the language.</li>
<li>The behavior of non-generic code can be understood without reference to generics concepts.</li>
<li>The individualized approach (specific rules for specific operations) opens the door for more flexible rules.
We already mentioned <a href="https://go.dev/issue/48522">issue #48522</a>, but there are also ideas for more powerful
slice operations, and <a href="https://go.dev/issue/69153">improved type inference</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The respective <a href="https://go.dev/issue/70128">proposal issue #70128</a> was recently approved and the relevant changes
are already implemented.
Concretely this means that a lot of prose in the language spec was reverted to its original,
pre-generics form, and new paragraphs were added where needed to explain the rules as they
pertain to generic operands. Importantly, no behavior was changed.
The entire section on core types was removed.
The compiler’s error messages were updated to not mention “core type” anymore, and in many
cases error messages are now more specific by pointing out exactly which type in a type set
is causing a problem.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of the changes made. For the built-in function <code>close</code>,
starting with Go 1.18 the spec began as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For an argument <code>ch</code> with core type that is a channel,
the built-in function <code>close</code> records that no more values will be sent on the channel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A reader who simply wanted to know how <code>close</code> works, had to first learn about core types.
Starting with Go 1.25, this section will again begin the same way it began before Go 1.18:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a channel <code>ch</code>, the built-in function <code>close(ch)</code>
records that no more values will be sent on the channel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is shorter and easier to understand.
Only when the reader is dealing with a generic operand will they have to contemplate
the newly added paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the type of the argument to <code>close</code> is a type parameter
all types in its type set must be channels with the same element type.
It is an error if any of those channels is a receive-only channel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We made similar changes to each place that mentioned core types.
In summary, although this spec update does not affect any current Go program, it opens the
door to future language improvements while making the language as it is today easier to
learn and its spec simpler.</p>

This integration enables efficient execution of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/">AI workloads</a>, such as convolutional neural networks and large language models, directly on supported AMD hardware.</p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/finally-a-linux-laptop-with-a-brilliant-display-and-performance-that-rivals-my-macbook/">Finally, a Linux laptop with a brilliant display and performance that rivals my MacBook</a></strong></p><p>While <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/rust-in-linux-now-progress-pitfalls-and-why-devs-and-maintainers-need-each-other/">Rust has faced some difficulties in recent months in Linux</a>, more Rust programming language abstractions have been integrated into the kernel, laying the groundwork for future drivers written in Rust. As Greg Kroah-Hartman, the stable Linux kernel maintainer, recently pointed out, with "rust misc driver bindings and other rust changes to make misc drivers actually possible. I think <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.13-char-misc-More-Rust" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this is the tipping point</a>, expect to see way more rust drivers going forward now that these bindings are present."&nbsp;</p><p>Besides drivers, Miguel Ojeda, <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rust for Linux</a>'s lead developer, said recently that the introduction of the macro for smart pointers with Rust 1.84: derive(CoercePointee) is an "<a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Smart-pointer-and-more-Rust-code-for-the-Linux-kernel-6-14-10250840.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">important milestone on the way to building a kernel that only uses stable Rust</a>&nbsp;functions." This approach will also make integrating C and Rust code easier. We're getting much closer to Rust being grafted into Linux's tree.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Linux 6.14 supports Qualcomm's latest <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8-elite-mobile-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile processor</a>, enhancing performance and stability for devices powered by this chipset.

These primarily read-balancing methods offer flexibility for different RAID hardware configurations and workloads. Additionally, support for uncached buffered I/O optimizes memory usage on systems with fast storage devices.</p><p>In short, the Linux kernel 6.14 represents a major step forward in Linux's evolution, offering a robust set of features that cater to diverse user needs, from gaming enthusiasts to AI researchers and developers. Despite the minor delay in its release, the kernel's enhancements solidify Linux's position as a versatile and forward-thinking platform.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-the-best-tiling-window-manager-for-a-linux-beginner/">What's the best tiling window manager for a Linux beginner?</a></strong></p><p>If you want to start tinkering with the kernel today, you can:&nbsp;<a href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tag/?h=v6.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Linux 6.14 is now available for download</a>.

<p>Last fall the Azure Core Upstream team&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/hyperlight-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced Hyperlight</a>: an open-source Rust library you can use to execute small, embedded functions using hypervisor-based protection. Then, we showed how to run <a href="https://aka.ms/hl-kubecon-demo-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust functions really, really fast</a>, followed by using <a href="https://aka.ms/hyperlight-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C to run Javascript</a>. In February 2025, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) voted to onboard Hyperlight into their Sandbox program.</p>



<p>We’re announcing the release of Hyperlight Wasm: a Hyperlight virtual machine (VM) “micro-guest” that can run wasm component workloads written in many programming languages. If you’d like to dive straight in, you can visit the <a href="https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight-wasm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyperlight-wasm repo</a> on GitHub. In the remainder of this post we’ll cover the basics of how Hyperlight Wasm works and then walk through how to build a Rust example step-by-step.</p>







<h2 id="performance-and-compatibility">Performance and compatibility</h2>



<p>Traditional virtual machines do a lot of work to be able to run programs. Not only do they have to load an entire operating system, they also boot up the virtual devices that the operating system depends on. Hyperlight is fast because it doesn’t do that work; all it exposes to its VM guests is a linear slice of memory and a CPU. No virtual devices. No operating system.</p>



<p>But this speed comes at the cost of&nbsp;<em>compatibility</em>. Chances are that your current production application expects a Linux operating system running on the x86-64 architecture (hardware), not a bare linear slice of memory. And compatibility is not just limited to operating systems; it can be discussed at three distinct levels:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Operating system</strong>: Linux, macOS, and Windows provide a portable abstraction across different hardware.</li>



<li><strong>System interface layer</strong>: System&nbsp;interface standards such as Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) and the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WebAssembly System Interface</a> (WASI) provide interoperability across operating systems.</li>



<li><strong>Programming language/library</strong>: Programming languages’ standard libraries and runtimes provide interoperability across system interfaces.</li>
</ul>



<p>Targeting compatibility with an OS at that layer allows one to abstract over the language/runtime that a customer might want to use, because common OS’s are almost universally supported by languages, libraries, and application programs—but that comes at the cost of requiring that a specific relatively-heavyweight execution environment be provided. On the other hand, very lightweight services can and do abstract over the details of their not-a-full-OS execution environment by changing the standard library of a single language to support their platform, which offers vastly improved performance—at the cost of requiring that a specific language be used to implement programs running in that environment.</p>



<p>WASI and the WebAssembly Component Model provide a middle ground between these contrasting abstractions: by implementing these interfaces, one can allow any lightweight execution environment to run programs written in (nearly) any language. Hyperlight Wasm takes advantage of this to allow you to implement a small set of high-level, performant, abstractions in almost any execution environment and provide a very fast, hardware protected, but nevertheless widely-compatible execution environment.</p>



<h2 id="introducing-the-hyperlight-wasm-guest">Introducing the Hyperlight Wasm guest</h2>



<p>How compatible? Well, building Hyperlight with a WebAssembly&nbsp;runtime—<a href="https://wasmtime.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasmtime</a>—enables any programming language to execute in a protected Hyperlight micro-VM without any prior knowledge of Hyperlight at all. As far as program authors are concerned, they’re just compiling for the&nbsp;<strong>wasm32-wasip2</strong>&nbsp;target. This means they can run their programs locally using runtimes like&nbsp;<a href="https://wasmtime.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasmtime</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jco</a>. Or run them on a server using for <a href="https://unit.nginx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nginx Unit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spinframework/spin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spin</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WasmCloud</a>—or now also <a href="https://aka.ms/hyperlight-wasm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyperlight Wasm</a>. If done right, developers don’t need to think about what runtime their code will run on as they’re developing it. That is a degree of developer flexibility that is only possible through standards.</p>



<p>Executing workloads in the Hyperlight Wasm guest isn’t just possible for compiled languages like C, Go, and Rust, but also for interpreted languages like Python, JavaScript, and C#. The trick here, much like with containers, is to also include a language runtime as part of the image. For example, for JavaScript, the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StarlingMonkey JS Runtime</a>&nbsp;was designed to natively run in WebAssembly.</p>



<p>Programming languages, runtimes, application platforms, and cloud providers are all starting to offer rich experiences for WebAssembly out of the box. If we do things right, you will never need to think about whether your application is running inside of a Hyperlight Micro-VM in Azure. You may never know your workload is executing in a Hyperlight Micro VM. And that’s a good thing.</p>



<h2 id="more-layers-of-security-fewer-layers-in-total">More layers of security, fewer layers in total</h2>



<p>The big magic trick we’re performing by combining Hyperlight with WebAssembly is that we’re achieving more security and performance than traditional VMs by doing less work overall. When traditional virtual machine managers (VMMs) create a new virtual machine, they first need to create new virtual devices, then load a kernel, then load an operating system, and only then are they able to start the application. The lower end of this will take about 125 milliseconds.</p>


<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.webp" alt="Diagram showing that traditional hypervisors have four layers of heavy work for each instance of an application: the VM guest, guest kernel, OS distribution, and the application binaries." srcset="" data-orig-src="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.webp"></figure>



<p>With Hyperlight and Hyperlight Wasm we end up doing far less than traditional VMs. When the Hyperlight VMM creates a new VM, all it needs do to is create a new slice of memory and load the VM guest, which in turn loads the wasm workload. This takes about 1-2 milliseconds today, and work is happening to bring that number to be less than 1 millisecond in the future.</p>


<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-5.webp" alt="Diagram showing that hyperlight removes three layers of heavy work for each instance of an application compared to the traditional microservices approach." srcset="" data-orig-src="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-5.webp"></figure>



<p>Not only is this architecture good for start times, fast start times also affect the way you can schedule your applications. If starting a workload takes about a millisecond, you can afford not to have any idling instances. If you do choose to have a warm pool ready, the memory footprint is drastically smaller. It also allows you to do more work on cheaper hardware, located closer to users. That’s the logic behind our upcoming Azure Front DoorEdge Actions service, powered by Hyperlight and soon to be in private preview.<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>



<p>Combining Hyperlight with wasm is not just good for performance either; it is also good for security. Under the covers, the Hyperlight Wasm guest uses the best-in-class wasmtime runtime, compiled into a Hyperlight guest as a Rust no_std module. Wasmtime provides strong isolation boundaries for wasm workloads via a software-defined runtime sandbox. While potential attackers will have a bad time breaking out of wasm’s sandbox, on the Hyperlight Wasm guest, even if they could manage to, they would be facing the challenge of then also escaping the VM. One layer of sandboxing is good. But having two layers is even better.</p>



<h2 id="udp-echo-example">UDP echo example</h2>



<p>Alright, let’s look at how to use Hyperlight Wasm from Rust. For our example, we’ll run a simple User Datagram Protocol (UDP) echo server that uses a portion of the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sockets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasi:sockets</a> interface. Luckily for us, we don’t have to write that program ourselves: we can download a pre-compiled wasm program (if you want to compile it yourself, <a href="https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/wasm-udp-echo-sample" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the source is available here</a>) and run it. Let’s start by doing that first. Assuming you have a working Rust installation, start <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools#installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by installing the wkg tool</a> to download wasm binaries from GitHub Artifacts, and then use that to get a copy of the wasm binary:</p>


<div><pre title="">cargo install wkg
wkg oci pull ghcr.io/hyperlight-dev/wasm-udp-echo-sample/udp-echo-server:latest -o echo.wasm
</pre></div>


<div>
<p>Now that we have a Wasm Binary, we can start wiring up the Hyperlight host. Right now that is a little complicated, since we haven’t yet published cargo crates. So let’s start by git cloning our example repo:</p>


<div><pre title="">git clone https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight-wasm-sockets-example
mv echo.wasm hyperlight-wasm-sockets-example
cd hyperlight-wasm-sockets-example
</pre></div></div>



<div>
<p>If you look at the code in the repo, you’ll notice it is structured like a regular Rust project. That’s because it is. It includes several files, most of which are there to implement boilerplate interfaces that the echo sample uses. In the root of the project there is a file called <em>hyperlight.wit</em>. This file is a text representation in the WebAssembly Interface Types (WIT) language that specifies the precise interfaces that the host is making available to, and expects to get from, the wasm module. We need to process this file into a binary wasm representation, which will be used when hyperlight-wasm is built:</p>


<div><pre title="">wasm-tools component wit hyperlight.wit -w -o hyperlight-world.wasm 
export HYPERLIGHT_WASM_WORLD=$(readlink -f hyperlight-world.wasm)
</pre></div></div>



<p>Now, let’s take a look at the code that uses hyperlight-wasm to run a component. To get bindings that we can use to easily implement imports/call exports of the wasm module, we can use <code><strong>hyperlight_component_macro::host_bindgen</strong></code>:</p>



<p><code><strong>// bindings.rs<br>extern crate alloc;<br>hyperlight_component_macro::host_bindgen!();</strong></code></p>



<p>This generates a set of traits representing the WebAssembly component model instances imported and exported by the component inside the sandbox. We define a state structure which keeps track of everything we need to implement the imports (but in this sample application, that is not used):&nbsp;</p>


<div><pre title="">// state.rs
pub struct MyState {}
impl MyState {
    pub fn new() -&gt; Self { MyState {} 	}
}
</pre></div>


<p>We then need to specify that this state representation can be used to implement the interfaces that the component uses:</p>


<div><pre title="">// main.rs
use bindings::*;
impl root::component::RootImports for MyState {
    type Udp = MyState;
    fn udp(&amp;mut self) -&gt; &amp;mut Self  { self }
    // ... one for each imported instance
}
</pre></div>


<p>The wasi:sockets udp interface is very simple to implement, since it doesn’t actually have any functions not associated with a resource:</p>


<div><pre title="">// udp.rs 

impl wasi::sockets::Udp&lt; 

    ErrorCode, 

    IpSocketAddress, 

    (), 

    MyPollable&gt; 

for MyState {} 

</pre></div>


<p>But, since it does export a <code><strong>UdpSocket</strong></code> resource, we need to implement that resource, specifying the host type that underlies it and how to implement its methods on the host:</p>


<div><pre title="">impl wasi::sockets::udp::UdpSocket&lt;
    wasi::sockets::network::ErrorCode,
    MyDatagramStream,
    wasi::sockets::network::IpSocketAddress,
    (),
    MyDatagramStream,
    MyPollable
    &gt;
for MyState {
     type T = MySocket;
    fn start_bind(
        &amp;mut self,
        self_: BorrowedResourceGuard&lt;MySocket&gt;,
        _network: BorrowedResourceGuard&lt;()&gt;,
        local_address: wasi::sockets::network::IpSocketAddress
    ) -&gt; Result&lt;(), wasi::sockets::network::ErrorCode&gt; {
        *(*self_).os.lock().unwrap() = Some(Arc::new(
            std::net::UdpSocket::bind(local_address)
                .map_err(|_| wasi::sockets::network::ErrorCode::Unknown)?));
        Ok(())
    }
    fn stream(
        &amp;mut self,
        self_: BorrowedResourceGuard&lt;Self::T&gt;,
        _remote_address: Option&lt;IpSocketAddress&gt;
    ) -&gt; Result&lt;(MyDatagramStream, MyDatagramStream), ErrorCode&gt; {
        let sock = (*self_).os.lock().unwrap();
        let sock = sock.as_ref().unwrap();
        Ok((MyDatagramStream { socket: sock.clone() },
            MyDatagramStream { socket: sock.clone() }))
    }

    fn finish_bind(
        &amp;mut self,
        _self: BorrowedResourceGuard&lt;Self::T&gt;
    ) -&gt; std::result::Result&lt;(), ErrorCode&gt;  {
        Ok(())
    }

    fn r#subscribe(
        &amp;mut self,
        _self: BorrowedResourceGuard&lt;Self::T&gt;
    ) -&gt; MyPollable  {
        MyPollable::AlwaysReady
    }
}

</pre></div>


<p>Now that we have that, we’re ready to run Hyperlight and point it to our Wasm binary. And all that takes is a little bit of boilerplate. In the code below, we’re first creating a new Hyperlight sandbox with enough memory to run a Wasm runtime. Then, we’re registering the bindings we just wrote. And finally, we load our Wasm Component and run it.</p>


<div><pre title="">fn main() {
    let state = State::new();
    // Setup the sandbox with enough resources to run a Wasm runtime
    let mut sb: hyperlight_wasm::ProtoWasmSandbox =
        hyperlight_wasm::SandboxBuilder::new()
            .with_guest_input_buffer_size(5_000_000)
            .with_guest_heap_size(10_000_000)
            .with_guest_panic_context_buffer_size(10_000_000)
            .with_guest_stack_size(10_000_000)
            .with_guest_function_call_max_execution_time_millis(0)
            .build()
            .unwrap();

    // Register the host functions
    let rt = crate::bindings::register_host_functions(&amp;mut sb, state);

    // Load our Wasm Component and run it
    let sb = sb.load_runtime().unwrap();
    let sb = sb.load_module("echo.wasm").unwrap();
    let mut wrapped = bindings::RootSandbox { sb, rt };

    let run_inst = root::component::RootExports::run(&amp;mut wrapped);
    let _ = run_inst.run();
}

</pre></div>


<p>Finally, before we can run the sample Wasm binary, we need to Ahead-Of-Time compile it into a format that wasmtime can load without having to generate code at runtime:&nbsp;</p>


<div><pre title="">cargo install --git https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight-wasm --branch hyperlight-component-macro hyperlight-wasm-aot 
hyperlight-wasm-aot compile --component echo.wasm echo.bin 
</pre></div>


<p>And now we’re ready to start the application and run it. You can do that by running cargo run in one terminal, which will start a server listening on port 8080:&nbsp;</p>



<p><code><strong>cargo run</strong></code></p>



<p>And in another terminal, we can now send User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. You can do that using the netcat utility as follows (for Windows <a href="https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight-wasm-sockets-example" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find a netcat alternative here</a>):&nbsp;</p>



<p><code><strong>nc -u 127.0.0.1&nbsp; 8080</strong></code></p>



<p>Now you’re free to type! Whatever you send to the server will be echoed back. And that’s the basics of Hyperlight’s Wasm guest.</p>



<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>



<p>So far we’ve mostly talked about using WASI on Hyperlight for portability between operating systems and VMs. But it doesn’t just stop there: because the WebAssembly instruction set and the Component Model abstract binary interface (ABI) are not tied to any one machine architecture, wasm applications are also portable between different instruction sets. You can soon expect Hyperlight Wasm to also work on Arm64 processors. Rebuilding your host will just work, without you ever needing to recompile the wasm applications running inside.</p>



<p>You may also have noticed that, while we can support WASI APIs in the guest, the VMM host doesn’t provide its own default implementation of WASI interfaces, so you have to implement them yourselves. While many applications will appreciate that flexibility, including cloud vendors like Microsoft who are using Hyperlight to create products, it does mean that getting started and trying things out can take some time. For that reason, we’re planning to <a href="https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extend Hyperlight-Wasm with default bindings</a> for some WASI interfaces soon. That way, if you just want to sandbox an HTTP server or a service that listens on a socket, you don’t need to do much else to get started.</p>



<h2 id="get-involved-with-hyperlight">Get involved with Hyperlight</h2>



<p>Hyperlight has been donated by Microsoft to the CNCF’s Sandbox program. Our goal is to raise the bar for fast, efficient, and secure cloud-native computing. The Hyperlight Wasm guest is our latest addition to the Hyperlight project, making it convenient to write programs that run on Hyperlight.</p>



<p>As an open-source project licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, Hyperlight underscores Microsoft’s commitment to fostering innovation and collaboration within the tech community. We welcome developers, solution architects, and IT professionals to help build and enhance Hyperlight. To get started with Hyperlight, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/hyperlight-dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the repo at Hyperlight</a>&nbsp;and let us know what you think.</p>

And that’s all I have to say about that.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At a Senate hearing yesterday, the director of national intelligence, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/tulsi-gabbard/">Tulsi Gabbard</a>, and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Ratcliffe, were both asked about the Signal chat, to which Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of <em>The Atlantic</em>, was inadvertently invited by National Security Adviser Michael Waltz. “There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal group,” Gabbard told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Ratcliffe said much the same: “My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/donald-trump/">President Donald Trump</a>, asked yesterday afternoon about the same matter, said, “It wasn’t classified information.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">These statements presented us with a dilemma. In <em>The Atlantic</em>’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">initial story about the Signal chat</a>—the “Houthi PC small group,” as it was named by Waltz—we withheld specific information related to weapons and to the timing of attacks that we found in certain texts. As a general rule, we do not publish information about military operations if that information could possibly jeopardize the lives of U.S. personnel. That is why we chose to characterize the nature of the information being shared, not specific details about the attacks.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">Read: The Trump administration accidentally texted me its war plans</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump—combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts—have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions. There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Experts have repeatedly told us that use of a Signal chat for such sensitive discussions poses a threat to national security. As a case in point, Goldberg received information on the attacks two hours before the scheduled start of the bombing of Houthi positions. If this information—particularly the exact times American aircraft were taking off for Yemen—had fallen into the wrong hands in that crucial two-hour period, American pilots and other American personnel could have been exposed to even greater danger than they ordinarily would face. The Trump administration is arguing that the military information contained in these texts was not classified—as it typically would be—although the president has not explained how he reached this conclusion.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Yesterday, we asked officials across the Trump administration if they objected to us publishing the full texts. In emails to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Council, the Department of Defense, and the White House, we wrote, in part: “In light of statements today from multiple administration officials, including before the Senate Intelligence Committee, that the information in the Signal chain about the Houthi strike is not classified, and that it does not contain ‘war plans,’ <em>The Atlantic</em> is considering publishing the entirety of the Signal chain.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We sent our first request for comment and feedback to national-security officials shortly after noon, and followed up in the evening after most failed to answer.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Late yesterday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emailed a response: “As we have repeatedly stated, there was no classified information transmitted in the group chat. However, as the CIA Director and National Security Advisor have both expressed today, that does not mean we encourage the release of the conversation. This was intended to be a an [<em>sic</em>] internal and private deliberation amongst high-level senior staff and sensitive information was discussed. So for those reason [<em>sic</em>] — yes, we object to the release.” (The Leavitt statement did not address which elements of the texts the White House considered sensitive, or how, more than a week after the initial air strikes, their publication could have bearing on national security.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A CIA spokesperson asked us to withhold the name of John Ratcliffe’s chief of staff, which Ratcliffe had shared in the Signal chain, because CIA intelligence officers are traditionally not publicly identified. Ratcliffe had testified earlier yesterday that the officer is not undercover and said it was “completely appropriate” to share their name in the Signal conversation. We will continue to withhold the name of the officer. Otherwise, the messages are unredacted.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/03/jeffrey-goldberg-group-chat-broke-internet/682161/">Listen: Jeffrey Goldberg on the group chat that broke the internet</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As we wrote on Monday, much of the conversation in the “Houthi PC small group” concerned the timing and rationale of attacks on the Houthis, and contained remarks by Trump-administration officials about the alleged shortcomings of America’s European allies. But on the day of the attack—Saturday, March 15—the discussion veered toward the operational.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At 11:44 a.m. eastern time, Hegseth posted in the chat, in all caps, “TEAM UPDATE:”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The text beneath this began, “TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.” Centcom, or Central Command, is the military’s combatant command for the Middle East. The Hegseth text continues:</p><div><ul><li>“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)”</li> <li>“1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)”</li></ul></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Let us pause here for a moment to underscore a point. This Signal message shows that the U.S. secretary of defense texted a group that included a phone number unknown to him—Goldberg’s cellphone—at 11:44 a.m. This was 31 minutes before the first U.S. warplanes launched, and two hours and one minute before the beginning of a period in which a primary target, the Houthi “Target Terrorist,” was expected to be killed by these American aircraft. If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests—or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media—the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds. The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The Hegseth text then continued:</p><div><ul><li>“1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)”</li> <li>“1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based’ targets)”</li> <li>“1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts – also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”</li> <li>“MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)”</li> <li>“We are currently clean on OPSEC”—that is, operational security.</li> <li>“Godspeed to our Warriors.”</li></ul></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Shortly after, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/j-d-vance/">Vice President J. D. Vance</a> texted the group, “I will say a prayer for victory.”</p><section data-event-module="recirc" data-flatplan-ignore="true"><h2>Recommended Reading</h2><ul><li></li><li></li><li><gpt-ad lazy-load="3" format="native" sizes-at-0="native" targeting-pos="native-article-related" targeting-native="native"></gpt-ad></li></ul></section><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At 1:48 p.m., Waltz sent the following text, containing real-time intelligence about conditions at an attack site, apparently in Sanaa: “VP. Building collapsed. Had multiple positive ID. Pete, Kurilla, the IC, amazing job.” Waltz was referring here to Hegseth; General Michael E. Kurilla, the commander of Central Command; and the intelligence community, or IC. The reference to “multiple positive ID” suggests that U.S. intelligence had ascertained the identities of the Houthi target, or targets, using either human or technical assets.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Six minutes later, the vice president, apparently confused by Waltz’s message, wrote, “What?”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At 2 p.m., Waltz responded: “Typing too fast. The first target – their top missile guy – we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Vance responded a minute later: “Excellent.” Thirty-five minutes after that, Ratcliffe, the CIA director, wrote, “A good start,” which Waltz followed with a text containing a fist emoji, an American-flag emoji, and a fire emoji. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Later that afternoon, Hegseth posted: “CENTCOM was/is on point.” Notably, he then told the group that attacks would be continuing. “Great job all. More strikes ongoing for hours tonight, and will provide full initial report tomorrow. But on time, on target, and good readouts so far.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It is still unclear why a journalist was added to the text exchange. Waltz, who invited Goldberg into the Signal chat, said yesterday that he was investigating “how the heck he got into this room.”</p><hr><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Screenshot" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/TcCybzsovOAQXiH4pDwlQupnLFw=/665x1043/media/img/posts/2025/03/01/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/TcCybzsovOAQXiH4pDwlQupnLFw=/665x1043/media/img/posts/2025/03/01/original.jpg" width="665" height="1043"></picture></figure></div><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Screenshot" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/FhihKmaLvlfIcMIVFcgSPrN-oBQ=/665x682/media/img/posts/2025/03/02/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/FhihKmaLvlfIcMIVFcgSPrN-oBQ=/665x682/media/img/posts/2025/03/02/original.jpg" width="665" height="682"></picture></figure></div><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Screenshot" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/kIKTbDhSKlL_iuvGm5pFHTszLhw=/665x693/media/img/posts/2025/03/3/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/kIKTbDhSKlL_iuvGm5pFHTszLhw=/665x693/media/img/posts/2025/03/3/original.jpg" width="665" height="693"></picture></figure></div><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Screenshot" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vu8kjot67dB-EFFOe3RnCDP-EH0=/665x886/media/img/posts/2025/03/4-1/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vu8kjot67dB-EFFOe3RnCDP-EH0=/665x886/media/img/posts/2025/03/4-1/original.jpg" width="665" height="886"></picture></figure></div><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Screenshot" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/dNqd2GHAyg_36cCKXc_DI8ld6QA=/665x698/media/img/posts/2025/03/5-1/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/dNqd2GHAyg_36cCKXc_DI8ld6QA=/665x698/media/img/posts/2025/03/5-1/original.jpg" width="665" height="698"></picture></figure></div><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Screenshot" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/M4ZxZ9qUdDgtJgftzmy47PDsDx8=/665x1046/media/img/posts/2025/03/6-1/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/M4ZxZ9qUdDgtJgftzmy47PDsDx8=/665x1046/media/img/posts/2025/03/6-1/original.jpg" width="665" height="1046"></picture></figure></div><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Screenshot" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vR86C30Jo--TfZ-a4uIyOP_7brA=/665x988/media/img/posts/2025/03/7/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vR86C30Jo--TfZ-a4uIyOP_7brA=/665x988/media/img/posts/2025/03/7/original.jpg" width="665" height="988"></picture></figure></div><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Screenshot" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw -

          <p>Picking the technology stack for a project is an important and consequential decision. In the enterprise space in particular, it often involves a multi-year commitment with long-lasting implications on the roadmap of the project, the pace of its development, the quality of the deliverables, and even the ability to assemble and maintain a happy team.</p>
<p>The open-source software model is a fundamental answer to this. By using software that is developed in the open, anyone is free to extend it or modify it in whatever way fits their use case. More crucially, the portability of open-source software gives developers and organisations the freedom to move their infrastructure between different providers without fear of getting locked in to a specific vendor.</p>
<p>This is the expectation with Next.js, an open-source web development framework created and <a href="https://nextjs.org/governance">governed by Vercel</a>, a cloud provider that offers managed hosting of Next.js as a service.<!--more--></p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with a company profiting from an open-source software it created, especially when that helps fund the development of the project. In fact, there are plenty of examples of that model working successfully in our industry.</p>
<p>But I think that can only work sustainably if the boundaries between the company and the open-source project are abundantly clear, with well-defined expectations between the maintainers, the hosting providers and the users about how and where each feature of the framework can be used.</p>
<p>I want to explain why I don't think this transparency exists today.</p>
<p>My goal is not to stop anyone from using Next.js, but to lay out as much information as possible so developers and businesses can make an informed decision about their technology stack.</p>
<h2 id="declaration-of-interest"><a href="#declaration-of-interest">¶</a> Declaration of interest</h2>
<p>Let me lead with a declaration of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>I work at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and have done so for over four years</li>
<li>Netlify is a frontend cloud platform that supports Next.js and other web frameworks as part of its product offering</li>
<li>Netlify and Vercel are direct competitors</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important for me to establish this for a few reasons.</p>
<p>My job involves building the infrastructure and tooling needed to support the full feature set of Next.js on Netlify, which has exposed me to the internals of the framework in a way that most people won't see. Over the years, I have seen concerning patterns of tight coupling between the open-source framework and the infrastructure of the company that builds it.</p>
<p>My employment is also the reason why I have always been very wary of voicing these concerns in public. As a Netlify employee, I don't really get to voice an objective concern about Next.js without people dismissing my claims as Netlify unleashing one of its minions to spread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt">FUD</a> about a competitor.</p>
<p>I'm not keen on exposing myself and the company to that type of debate, so I have always chosen to work behind the scenes in supporting the developers who decide to deploy their sites on Netlify and shield them from all the complexity that goes into making that possible.</p>
<p>But then something happened.</p>
<p>Last weekend, Vercel disclosed a critical security vulnerability with Next.js. This type of issue is normal, but the way Vercel chose to handle it was so poor, reckless and disrespectful to the community that it has exacerbated my concerns about the governance of the project.</p>
<p>For me, things change once your decisions put other people at risk, so I felt the urge to speak up.</p>
<h2 id="openness-and-governance"><a href="#openness-and-governance">¶</a> Openness and governance</h2>
<p>I'll come back to this incident later, but before that I want to back up a little and give you a peek behind the curtain. My history of reservations about the openness and governance of Next.js stem from a series of decisions made by Vercel over the years that make it incredibly challenging for other providers to support the full feature set of the framework.</p>
<p>I'll cover these by laying out a series of facts about how Next.js is built. I'll then add some of my own considerations about how those facts live up to the expectations of an open, interoperable, enterprise-grade software product.</p>
<h3 id="fact-1-no-adapters"><a href="#fact-1-no-adapters">¶</a> Fact #1: No adapters</h3>
<p>Most modern web development frameworks use the concept of adapters to configure the output of the framework to a specific deployment target: <a href="https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/runtimes">Remix</a>, <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/adapter-reference/">Astro</a>, <a href="https://nitro.build/deploy/custom-presets">Nuxt</a>, <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters">SvelteKit</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/adapters/">Gatsby</a> are just a few examples. This pattern allows developers to keep the core of their applications untouched, and simply swap the adapter if they decide to start deploying to a different provider.</p>
<p>These adapters can be maintained by framework authors, by the hosting providers, by the community, or all of the above. Frameworks are typically structured in such a way that it’s possible for anyone to build their own adapter in case one isn’t available for the provider of their choice.</p>
<p>Next.js does not have the concept of adapters and they have <a href="https://archive.leerob.io/blog/using-nextjs#open-source-and-framework-boundaries">stated in the past</a> that they would not support them. The output of a Next.js build has a proprietary and undocumented format that is used in Vercel deployments to provision the infrastructure needed to power the application.</p>
<p>Vercel's alternative to this was the Build Output API, a documented specification for the output format of frameworks who wish to deploy to Vercel.</p>
<p>This is not an adapter interface for Next.js, and in fact has nothing to do with Next.js. The <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/build-output-api">announcement blog post</a> said that Next.js supports this format, but as of today that isn’t true.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/958dcbc7e35dac5b84dd5a3bd3f4bb7f5ba0bf1a">Next.js documentation has been updated</a> to say that Next.js would adopt the Build Output API in the following major version of the framework (which would be version 15):</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Next.js produces a standard deployment output used by managed and self-hosted Next.js. This ensures all features are supported across both methods of deployment. In the next major version, we will be transforming this output into our <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3?utm_source=next-site&amp;utm_medium=docs&amp;utm_campaign=next-website">Build Output API specification</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Next.js 15.0.0 was <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15">released in October 2024</a> without support for the Build Output API</p>
<p>Vercel have built the Build Output API because they wanted their customers to leverage the rich ecosystem of frameworks in the space, but their own framework doesn't support it to this day.</p>
<p>This means that any hosting providers other than Vercel must build on top of undocumented APIs that can introduce unannounced breaking changes in minor or patch releases. (And they have.)</p>
<p>Late last year, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/builder-day-2024-announcements/#cloudflare-joins-opennext">Cloudflare</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-joins-opennext/">Netlify</a> have joined <a href="https://opennext.js.org/">OpenNext</a>, a movement of different cloud providers that collaborate on open-source adapters for Next.js. Shortly after, Vercel have engaged with the movement and committed to building support for adapters. They haven't made any timeline commitments, but have <a href="https://x.com/feedthejim/status/1903837444648382758?s=46">recently said they are actively working on it</a>.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that it's been almost three years since the launch of the Build Output API, and to this day the framework still isn't portable. I'm cautiously optimistic about that actually changing this time.</p>
<h3 id="fact-2-no-official-serverless-support"><a href="#fact-2-no-official-serverless-support">¶</a> Fact #2: No official serverless support</h3>
<p>The official methods for <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#self-hosting">self-hosting Next.js</a> require running the application in a stateful way, as long-running servers. While technically possible, this is very hard to operate in any real-world production environment where a single instance isn’t sufficient.</p>
<p>The setup needs to be able to dynamically scale up very quickly in order to handle sudden bursts of traffic, while at the same time being able to scale down to zero in order to be cost-effective. This last part is essential when working with <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components">server components</a>, for example, where the deep tangling between client and server code <a href="https://x.com/youyuxi/status/1804331313421521101">can break older clients</a> unless every version of the server code ever deployed is available indefinitely.</p>
<p>One obvious answer to these requirements is serverless computing, as attested by official Next.js documentation that <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8#serverless-nextjs">confirms the benefits of this model</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Serverless allows for distributed points of failure, infinite scalability, and is incredibly affordable with a "pay for what you use" model.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This clearly advantageous computing paradigm is precisely how Vercel has run Next.js sites in their own infrastructure for years. Given that Next.js is an open framework, it is reasonable to expect that you'd be able to use that same model in any serverless provider of your choice. But it's not that simple.</p>
<p>Next.js once had <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8#serverless-nextjs">a serverless mode</a> that you could enable with a configuration property, but it was <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/41495">removed without further explanation in October 2022</a>. No equivalent mode was ever introduced.</p>
<p>The official React documentation, which is <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/41495">the Next.js team help maintain</a>, says that Next.js can be <a href="https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app#nextjs-app-router">deployed to <em>any serverless hosting</em></a>, but there is no official documentation whatsoever for this.</p>
<p>This means that any providers who want to offer support for Next.js with the same computing model that the framework itself promotes must reverse-engineer their way to a custom implementation.</p>
<h3 id="fact-3-vercel-specific-code-paths"><a href="#fact-3-vercel-specific-code-paths">¶</a> Fact #3: Vercel-specific code paths</h3>
<p>Next.js has <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Avercel%2Fnext.js+NEXT_MINIMAL+path%3A%2F%5Epackages%5C%2Fnext%5C%2F%2F&amp;type=code">code paths</a> that are only ever executed for sites deployed to Vercel. An example of this is a private flag called <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/29801"><em>minimal mode</em></a>, which allows Vercel to shift work away from the framework and run it on their edge infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here's an example of why that matters. <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#introducing-middleware">Next 12 introduced middleware</a>, a way to address use cases such as feature flags, A/B tests and advanced routing. What's common in all of these use cases is the need to run logic on the hot path, behind the cache, with very low latency.</p>
<p>The announcement included this:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This works out of the box using <code>next start</code>, as well as on Edge platforms like Vercel, which use Edge Middleware.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, this means that you have two options: use <code>next start</code> and run middleware alongside the rest of your application in your <em>origin</em> server (which is typically running in a single region, after the cache), or use one of the «<em>Edge platforms like Vercel</em>» to run middleware at the edge, before the cache, unlocking all the incredible use cases that <a href="https://vercel.com/resources/edge-middleware-experiments-personalization-performance">Vercel boasted in the resources linked in the announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The phrase «<em>Edge platforms like Vercel</em>» surely means that there are many alternatives out there because other providers were given the option to also implement middleware at the edge, right? No.</p>
<p>This secret minimal mode is what allowed Vercel to break out middleware from the rest of the application so they could run it at the edge, but only Vercel has access to it.</p>
<p>Netlify does support running middleware at the edge, but we've done it at the expense of having a full team of engineers dedicated to reverse-engineering the framework and building our own edge middleware implementation on top of undocumented APIs. This type of commitment is just impossible for smaller companies that simply do not have the resources to fight this battle, which makes most of them <a href="https://www.stormkit.io/blog/why-we-are-dropping-support-for-next-js">stop trying</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Netlify is the only cloud provider to support the full feature set of Next.js outside of Vercel, which doesn't make sense to me. With Next.js having such a sizeable share of the market, I would expect a lot more hosting options, which would foster competition and innovation across the board, ultimately benefitting users and the web.</p>
<p>So why is there a hidden door in Next.js for which only Vercel holds the key? I think it's expected that the framework maintainers regularly experiment with features before they're launched, but minimal mode isn't that. We're talking about entirely different operation mode for the framework, which has been in the code base for many years and which unlocks capabilities that are reserved for the for-profit company that owns the framework.</p>
<p>If WordPress had a privileged code path that was only accessible to sites deployed to Automattic properties, would it be trusted as a truly open project and would it have the dominance it has today?</p>
<h2 id="security-posture"><a href="#security-posture">¶</a> Security posture</h2>
<p>Let's go back to the security incident. On Friday, March 21st at 10:17 AM (UTC), Vercel published <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw">a CVE for a critical security incident</a>, ranked with a severity of 9.1 out of 10.</p>
<p>In essence, it was possible for anyone to completely bypass Next.js middleware by sending a specific header in the request. This is important because <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#introducing-middleware">authorisation was one of the flagship use cases of middleware</a>, and this exploit meant that anyone could bypass the authentication layer and gain access to protected resources.</p>
<p>As the incident unravelled, a few things became apparent. First of all, the vulnerability was <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/cve-2025-29927#timeline">reported to the Next.js team on February 27th</a>, but it wasn't until March 14th that the team started looking into it. Once they did, they started pushing fixes for <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/5fd3ae8f8542677c6294f32d18022731eab6fe48">Next 14</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/52a078da3884efe6501613c7834a3d02a91676d2">Next 15</a> within a couple of hours.</p>
<p>So by March 14th (at the latest), Vercel knew they had a serious incident on their hands. The responsible thing to do at that point would be immediately disclosing the vulnerability to other providers, so that they could assess the impact to their own customers and take any necessary actions to protect them as quickly as possible. At times like these, our duty to protect users should rise above any competition between companies.</p>
<p>That is not what happened. It took Vercel 8 (eight) days to reach out to Netlify. In that time, they managed to push patches to Next.js, cut two releases, and even write a blog post that framed the incident as something that Vercel's firewall had <em>«proactively protected»</em> their customers from (even though <a href="https://x.com/cramforce/status/1903648110863343871?s=46">their CTO later said</a> that their firewall had nothing to do with it).</p>
<p>I think it's incredibly disingenuous to spin a critical security vulnerability in your open-source project as a strength of your product, with absolutely no consideration for whether users in other providers were also affected and what they should do to mitigate. In fact, they wouldn't even know this, because they hadn't even reached out to us at this point.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/eduardoboucas.com/post/3lky5uuo5os2o">being called out on social media</a>, Vercel have rewritten the blog post to remove any mention of their firewall and clarify which providers had been affected whether their customers had to take any action.</p>

<p>Vercel has then <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/postmortem-on-next-js-middleware-bypass#2025-03-21">released a postmortem</a> where they said — for the first time — that on March 21st they were able to «<em>verify Netlify and Cloudflare Workers were not impacted</em>». This is directly contradicted by their staff <a href="https://x.com/eduardoboucas/status/1904672921206865935">reaching out to Netlify on March 22nd</a> offering help to «<em>get a patch up</em>». If we were not impacted, what was there to patch?</p>
<p>This lack of consideration for any users outside of Vercel has created unnecessary anxiety and confusion for a lot of people, leaving some providers scrambling to <a href="https://x.com/elithrar/status/1903411980070797691">find a solution</a> and then having to <a href="https://x.com/elithrar/status/1903526240847331362">partially roll it back</a>, others <a href="https://x.com/ClerkDev/status/1903497002828120426">announcing that they were not vulnerable</a> when in reality <a href="https://x.com/n2d4wastaken/status/1903748178874360024?s=46">they were</a>, etc.</p>
<p>As you read this, it's impossible for anyone to know how many sites out there are still vulnerable to this exploit, many of which would've been safe if things were handled differently.</p>
<p>And at the height of all this mess, Vercel's leadership had... <a href="https://x.com/rauchg/status/1903528305002762387">a different focus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="but-vercel-owns-next-js"><a href="#but-vercel-owns-next-js">¶</a> But Vercel owns Next.js</h2>
<p>They do. And they have every right to make a business out of the framework that they've put so much work, talent, time and energy into building and growing. I'm not disputing that.</p>
<p>But that growth holds them to a high bar of standards that, in my opinion, they have repeatedly failed to meet.</p>
<p><em>«If Vercel own Next.js, what incentive do they have to open it up to other providers?»</em> is <a href="https://x.com/jamonholmgren/status/1904174718779072575">a question I sometimes see</a> and which I find intriguing. What incentives does Redis have for opening up their software when they own Redis Cloud? Why make Grafana open when Grafana Cloud is owned by the same company? Or WordPress, ClickHouse and many others?</p>
<p>The incentive is that they <em>have</em> to do those things if they choose to publish their software as open-source and not as a closed, proprietary solution. Their success is intrinsically associated their users having the guarantee that they are free to choose whatever provider offers the service that meets your needs at any given time.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up"><a href="#wrapping-up">¶</a> Wrapping up</h2>
<p>It's not my business to say which framework you should use. If you like Next.js and you still think it's the best tool for the problem you need to solve, you should absolutely use it. But I hope that this information helps you feel more confident about your decision, whichever way you're leaning.</p>
<p>As for me, I'll keep doing my job to help support the developers who chose to deploy their sites to Netlify, whatever their framework of choice is. And competition aside, I'm genuinely looking forward to help Vercel make Next.js more open and interoperable through the OpenNext movement. ∎</p>
