  <p>
    Published 27 May, 2024 by Louis Pilfold
  </p>
<p>Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v1.2.0">v1.2.0</a> has been published, a release
that focuses on improving the language server and developer experience. It’s a
big one both in terms of size and impact, so let’s take a look as what it
includes.</p>

<h2 id="fault-tolerant-compilation">Fault tolerant compilation</h2>

<p>Gleam’s compiler has traditionally halted immediately when a compile time error
was encountered, presenting the error to the programmer and requiring them to
fix it before compilation can be attempted again.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this is that the programmer has just the first and
most important error, rather than a mix of the real error and a bunch of
red-herring cascading errors. On the other hand, if there’s multiple genuine
errors the programmer can only see first the one, which may not be the one they
want to work on, or the most understandable.</p>

<p>Even worse, this halting behaviour causes major issues for the Gleam Language
Server (the engine that text editors like Neovim, Helix, Zed, and VS Code use to
get IDE features for Gleam). The language server internally uses the compiler to
build and analyse Gleam projects, so when the compiler halts with an error the
language server is left without up-to-date information about the code. Without a
successful build some language server features may not work, and the longer a
project goes without successful compilation (such as during a large refactoring)
the more drift there can be between the language server’s understanding of the
code and the reality.</p>

<p>With this release when the compiler encounters an error during analysis it will
move on to the next definition in the module, returning all of the errors along
with updated code information once the whole module has been analysed. This has
resulted in a dramatic improvement in the experience when using the Gleam
language server, it being much more responsive and accurate in its feedback.</p>

<p>In future releases we will continue to improve the granularity of the fault
tolerant compilation and we will also introduce fault tolerant parsing.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Acepie">Ameen Radwan</a> and myself for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="language-server-imports-improvements">Language server imports improvements</h2>

<p>This is a Gleam import statement:</p>
<pre><code>import gleam/option.{type Option, Some, None}
//     ^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//      the module     unqualified imports
</code></pre>

<p>The language server could previously autocomplete module names, but now it can
also autocomplete types and values when importing them in the unqualified
fashion.</p>

<p>You can also hover types and values in an import statement to see their
documentation, and use go-to definition on them and the module itself to jump
to where they defined in your project or its dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="single-line-pipelines">Single line pipelines</h2>

<p>Gleam’s much loved <code>|&gt;</code> pipe operator can be used to pipe the output from one
function into the input of another, not dissimilar to <code>|</code> pipes in bash, etc.
Gleam’s code formatter would always put each function of a sequence of pipes on
individual lines, but now you can opt to put them all on one line, so long as
altogether they are short enough to fit.</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] |&gt; list.map(int.to_string) |&gt; string.join(with: "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>In addition you can also force the formatter to break a pipe on multiple lines
by adding a line break. This:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] |&gt; list.map(int.to_string)
// By putting a newline here I'm telling the formatter to split the pipeline
|&gt; string.join(with: "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Will turn into this:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3]
|&gt; list.map(int.to_string)
|&gt; string.join(with: "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you to our formatter wizard <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>
for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="improved-error-messages-for-use-expressions">Improved error messages for <code>use</code> expressions</h2>

<p>Gleam’s <a href="https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use-sugar/"><code>use</code> expressions</a>
are very powerful and can be used to replicate many built-in features of other
languages such as Go’s <code>defer</code>, procedural languages’ early returns, Haskell’s
do-notation, and more. As an unusual and powerful feature they can be confusing
at first, and that was made worse as any type errors from incorrect <code>use</code>
expressions would be generic ones rather than being specific to <code>use</code>.</p>

<p>These errors have been greatly refined and we hope this will help folks learning
the language and debugging their code. Here’s some specific examples:</p>

<p>This error message is used when the right-hand-side of <code>&lt;-</code> in a <code>use</code>
expression is not a function:</p>
<pre><code>error: Type mismatch
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:2:8
  │
2 │ use &lt;- 123
  │        ^^^

In a use expression, there should be a function on the right hand side of
`&lt;-`, but this value has type:

    Int

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>This error message is used when the right-hand-side of <code>&lt;-</code> is a function,
but it takes no arguments:</p>
<pre><code>error: Incorrect arity
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:3:8
  │
3 │ use &lt;- func
  │        ^^^^ Expected no arguments, got 1

The function on the right of `&lt;-` here takes no arguments.
But it has to take at least one argument, a callback function.

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>And this one is used when it takes arguments, but not the correct number of
arguments:</p>
<pre><code>error: Incorrect arity
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:3:8
  │
3 │ use &lt;- f(1, 2)
  │        ^^^^^^^ Expected 2 arguments, got 3

The function on the right of `&lt;-` here takes 2 arguments.
All the arguments have already been supplied, so it cannot take the
`use` callback function as a final argument.

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>And more! Too many to list here. Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>
for these big improvements!</p>

<h2 id="typevalue-mix-up-feedback">Type/value mix up feedback</h2>

<p>One common mistake is to try and import a type as a value, or a value as a type.
When an imported item is found not to exist the compiler will now check to see
if there is a matching type or value and explain the mix-up.</p>
<pre><code>error: Unknown module field
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:1:19
  │
1 │ import gleam/one.{One}
  │                   ^^^ Did you mean `type One`?

`One` is only a type, it cannot be imported as a value.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>error: Unknown module type
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:1:19
  │
1 │ import gleam/two.{type Two}
  │                   ^^^^^^^^ Did you mean `Two`?

`Two` is only a value, it cannot be imported as a type.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/Pi-Cla/">Pi-Cla</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="assertion-exhaustiveness-checking">Assertion exhaustiveness checking</h2>

<p>Gleam has a <code>let assert</code> syntax to apply a pattern to a value, extracting values
contained within if the pattern matches, and crashing the program if it does
not.</p>

<p>The compiler now performs exhaustiveness checking on these assertions to find
patterns that are total and warn that the <code>assert</code> is redundant as a result.</p>
<pre><code>warning: Redundant assertion
  ┌─ /home/lucy/src/app/src/app.gleam:4:7
  │
4 │   let assert x = get_name()
  │       ^^^^^^ You can remove this

This assertion is redundant since the pattern covers all possibilities.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature.</p>

<h2 id="catching-common-crash-mistakes">Catching common crash mistakes</h2>

<p>Gleam has <code>todo</code> and <code>panic</code> expressions, both of which crash the program due to
it being incomplete or in an invalid state respectively. The syntax looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>panic as "The session is no longer valid, this should never happen!"
</code></pre>

<p>A common mistake is to try and give the message string using the function call
syntax like so:</p>
<pre><code>panic("The session is no longer valid, this should never happen!")
</code></pre>

<p>This is valid Gleam code, but it is not using that string as a message for the
panic. The string unreachable as the program panics before it is evaluated. A
compiler warning is now emitted when code like this is found.</p>
<pre><code>warning: Todo used as a function
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:2:16
  │
2 │           todo(1)
  │                ^

`todo` is not a function and will crash before it can do anything with
this argument.

Hint: if you want to display an error message you should write
`todo as "my error message"`
See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/todo/
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="invalid-constant-error-message-improvement">Invalid constant error message improvement</h2>

<p>Gleam’s constants are limited to a subset of the language that be evaluated at
compile time, and as such arbitrary functions cannot be called within them.
Previously if you tried to call a function you would get a somewhat confusing
parse error, but with this version it’ll emit a much more helpful error message.</p>
<pre><code>error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:3:18
  │
3 │ const wib: Int = wibble(1, "wobble")
  │                  ^^^^^^^ Functions can only be called within other functions
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/nino">Nino Annighoefer</a> for this improvement!</p>

<h2 id="unreachable-code-detection">Unreachable code detection</h2>

<p>Code that comes after a <code>panic</code> expression is unreachable and will never be
evaluated as the program will crash before it is reached. The compiler will now
warn in these situations to catch these mistakes.</p>

<p>For example, this code will emit this warning:</p>

<pre><code>pub fn main() {
  panic
  my_app.run()
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>warning: Unreachable code
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:3:11
  │
3 │    my_app.run()
  │    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

This code is unreachable because it comes after a `panic`.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="further-hex-integration">Further Hex integration</h2>

<p>Gleam is part of the Erlang ecosystem, and as such it uses the
<a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex package manager</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>gleam hex revert</code> has been added to the Gleam binary. It can be used to
unpublish a package release within the first 24 hours of it being published.
After 24 hours Hex package releases become immutable and cannot be removed.</p>

<p>Additionally the error message that is emitted when you attempt to publish a
package that has already been published has been improved:</p>
<pre><code>error: Version already published

Version v1.0.0 has already been published.
This release has been recently published so you can replace it
or you can publish it using a different version number

Hint: Please add the --replace flag if you want to replace the release.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/Pi-Cla">Pi-Cla</a> for these features!</p>

<h2 id="erlang-module-collision-prevention">Erlang module collision prevention</h2>

<p>The Erlang virtual machine supports loading new versions of existing module,
enabling an application to be upgraded while it is still running. One
unfortunate consequence of this is that if you accidentally reuse a module name
loading it into the VM will cause the application to be upgraded to the new
version, causing confusing errors as functions that no longer exist are called
and crash.</p>

<p>The Gleam build tool would return an error and refuse to compile Gleam modules
that would overwrite each other, but with this version it will also emit an
error if a Gleam module would overwrite a built-in Erlang/OTP module.</p>
<pre><code>error: Erlang module name collision

The module `src/code.gleam` compiles to an Erlang module named `code`.

By default Erlang includes a module with the same name so if we were to
compile and load your module it would overwrite the Erlang one, potentially
causing confusing errors and crashes.

Hint: Rename this module and try again.
</code></pre>



<p>A helpful error message is now shown if the <code>manifest.toml</code> file has become
invalid, perhaps due to a git rebase or accidental edit.</p>
<pre><code>error: Corrupt manifest.toml

The `manifest.toml` file is corrupt.

Hint: Please run `gleam update` to fix it.
</code></pre>

<p>Previously when no package versions could be found that satisfy the project’s
requirements a very cryptic message would printed that detailed all the
constraints from all the versions that were incompatible. This was overwhelming
and practically impossible to read, so it has been replaced with a much simpler
message.</p>
<pre><code>error: Dependency resolution failed

An error occurred while determining what dependency packages and
versions should be downloaded.
The error from the version resolver library was:

Unable to find compatible versions for the version constraints in your
gleam.toml. The conflicting packages are:

- hellogleam
- lustre_dev_tools
- glint
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/zahash">zahash</a> for these improvements!</p>

<h2 id="redundant-pattern-matching-warnings">Redundant pattern matching warnings</h2>

<p>Gleam’s case expressons support pattern matching on multiple values at the same
time. This is uncommon so people used to other languages may habitually wrap
multiple values in a tuple or a list to match on them. The compiler will now
warn when this is done:</p>
<pre><code>warning: Redundant list
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:2:14
  │
2 │         case [1, 2] {
  │              ^^^^^^ You can remove this list wrapper

Instead of building a list and matching on it, you can match on its
contents directly.
A case expression can take multiple subjects separated by commas like this:

    case one_subject, another_subject {
      _, _ -&gt; todo
    }

See: https://tour.gleam.run/flow-control/multiple-subjects/
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature.</p>

<h2 id="redundant-pattern-matching-auto-fix">Redundant pattern matching auto-fix</h2>

<p>And further still, if you are using the Gleam language server then a code action
is offered to automatically fix redundant tuple wrappers. Place your cursor on
the tuple and select this language action and the language server will remove
the tuple from the values as well as from all patterns in the case expression.</p>
<pre><code>case #(x, y) {
  #(1, 2) -&gt; 0
  #(_, _) -&gt; 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Is rewritten to:</p>
<pre><code>case x, y {
  1, 2 -&gt; 0
  _, _ -&gt; 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/nicklimmm">Nicky Lim</a> for this code action, and
for laying the foundation for other code actions like this in future!</p>

<h2 id="a-helping-hand-for-javascript-programmers">A helping hand for JavaScript programmers</h2>

<p>JavaScript programmers sometimes type <code>===</code> by mistake in their Gleam code. We
have an error message for that too now:</p>
<pre><code>error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:4:37
  │
4 │   [1,2,3] |&gt; list.filter(fn (a) { a === 3 })
  │                                     ^^^ Did you mean `==`?

Gleam uses `==` to check for equality between two values.
See: https://tour.gleam.run/basics/equality
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/rabingaire">Rabin Gaire</a> for this feature!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/doing-is-normally-distributed-learning-is-log-normal/">https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/doing-is-normally-distributed-learning-is-log-normal/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40497623">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>There are few things I think about more than the essays on
<a href="https://gwern.net/index">gwern.net</a>,
and there are few with as satisfying a theoretical payout
to contemplate in my orb as
<a href="https://gwern.net/note/pipeline">his essay on “leaky pipelines”</a>,
aka log-normal distributions.</p><p>The skulk: Say you’re working on a Laravel web app.
You’re about 90% sure you know how to start the app. You’re
80% sure you know how to handle the infra you’ll need to
get it online. And you’re 70% sure you know how to get your
first customer. What is your chance of successfully going
from zero to first customer? 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.7 = a little over
0.5. That’s … a lot less encouraging than any of the
previous numbers, if you buy my multi-step modelling.</p><p>Software estimation is such a mess in part because
it has trouble recognizing that, at least,
<a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/03/just-in-case-versus-just-in-time/">just-in-time</a>
learning is at least <em>non-normally distributed</em>.
Everything we know about traditional project management,
from Waterfall to Gantt charts to estimation practices,
are on some level based around the idea that each individual
step in the chain is bell-shaped: A process taking twice as
long as it normally does might be 2 standard deviations out,
aka in the bottom 2.5% of outcomes. But in a log-normal
distribution, processes taking two, three, or five times as
long are much more common, and this throws things into
disarray. Some things happen much faster than usual - but
doing one estimated week-long project in half the time,
and another estimated week-long project in twice the time,
still leaves you in the red for your time budget.</p><p>Needless to say, it is almost never the case that in
software development you know all or even most of the
technical hurdles you will face in the processs of development.
An
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient markets hypothesis</a>
fanboy might say “If anyone already knew how to do it, it would
already be done by now”. I’m not that optimistic, but
I do think this leaky-pipeline approach can shed light
on some more counterintuitive things about our industry.</p><p>Such as the relentless emphasis, not only on relevant experience,
but on <em>knowing your specific tooling</em> when you apply to a given
job. You and I might be hardcore enough computer geeks that we
can pick up any language and be productive in it within a few
weeks, but if that doesn’t hold for the <em>median</em> software
developer, then employers really are justified in deciding that
e.g. they only want to hire Java devs with previous experience
in… Java. If there’s a 20% chance it takes 1 month, 20% for
2 months, … 20% for 5 months before your non-Java-background
Java dev has enough experience to finally start contributing
to the Java codebase, then yeah, it makes a lot of sense not
to want to gamble on that. Not only do you face the possibility
of paying a five- or six-figure sum for someone who’s useless,
you have very little ability to estimate as an employer
yourself when they will become useful.</p><p>Now what’s really interesting about this theory is that
it suggests that <strong>business processes that are normally-distributed
are the exception, not the norm</strong>, in a sense.
<em>Every</em> new process a person has to undertake will have at
least some phase which is dominated by learning. That’s as
true of web dev as it is of learning to operate the drive-thru
at McDonald’s. It takes a special kind of rigor to transform
that into an activity routine and repeatable enough that you
get a long tail of normally-distributed, profitable activity.
Again, this makes sense: I’ve been building Django and Hugo
websites and web apps for a few years now, and I’ve been using
Python much longer than that, and I sort of have an intuitive
sense by now for how long either of them would take me.
That’s not because I’m some genius savant - it’s because I have
already flowed through the leaky pipeline enough times
to know how I like to approach most things. The instant I’m
in new territory, we’re back to the leaky pipeline.</p><p>It may be the case that academic,
<a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/03/just-in-case-versus-just-in-time/">just-in-case</a>
learning is less this way, because
the actual things you need to learn is carefully plotted
ahead of time for you. This would explain the popularity of
tutorials online, as ways to tamp down on the worst-case
scenario where that thing you thought would take you a week
to do ends up taking you a year. That being said, I definitely
had some classes in college that unexpectedly took way less
time to me (wireless communication, DSP) and some that
unexpectedly took way more (Maxwellian electromagnetism).</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

			<p><span>T</span>he act of naming is always a form of propaganda. When you name something, you are never perfectly describing what it is, but are instead influencing how it is perceived.</p>
<p>Marketers know this better than anyone. Prior to 1977, there was no such thing as the Chilean sea bass; the fish was called, instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonian_toothfish">the Pata­gonian toothfish</a>. The Chilean sea bass <a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-invention-of-the-chilean-sea-bass/">isn’t a type of bass at all</a>, and most of them do not come from Chile. It was purely a marketing invention: an entrepreneur named Lee Lantz intuited that the American market might enjoy the <em>taste</em> of the Patagonian toothfish, but would never buy it under its given name. First, he chose to falsely call it a “bass” because Americans were comfortable with that type of fish. He then rejected the names “Pacific sea bass” and “South American sea bass,” on the grounds that they were too generic, and eventually settled on “Chilean sea bass” as a more exotic alternative.</p>
<p>The name of one of the most popular fish in the world therefore has nothing to do with what the fish really is. A type of cod that is primarily farmed near Antarctica became the Chilean sea bass as a Goldilocks branding compromise. The familiarity of the bass was married to the perceived exoticism of Chile so that an American entrepreneur could sell a fish nobody had ever heard of to high-end restaurants in the United States. This ploy worked so well that today nobody has ever heard of the Patagonian toothfish, while the Chilean sea bass has a secure and inalienable position on restaurant menus from sea to shining sea.</p>
<p>So its name is propaganda, but nobody cares. A lie that makes money will always be preferable to a truth that does not. Once you realize that <em>every name is propaganda</em>, it becomes readily apparent how much misconduct, greed, and corruption can be concealed behind an innocuously disingenuous name, especially a name that successfully evokes positive emotions in the general public.</p>
<p>Consider the word “nonprofit.” Whoever came up with the idea of calling these organizations “nonprofits” was a marketing genius on the level of Steve Jobs. When someone hears the word nonprofit, they assume that such an organization is working for the public good; that it serves the homeless, protects the weak, exists for the benefit and the betterment of society at large. Hearing that something is a “nonprofit” immediately gives a sense that the organization is trustworthy and the people running it are driven by a charitable agenda. It’s a word that shuts down the critical faculties and grants an instantaneous moral stature to any organization to which it is applied. Consequently, non­profits receive a benefit of the doubt that would not be granted to any other form of private corporation.</p>
<p>Yet nonprofit organizations are frequently the exact opposite of what they appear to be. As a consequence of the benefit of the doubt provided to nonprofits, there is rarely enough oversight to guarantee that they are doing what we pay them to do. In some cities, upwards of a billion dollars of public funds are paid to nonprofit organizations every year with glaringly insufficient safeguards to ensure that the money is used in a manner likely to serve the public interest.</p>
<p>This money is then spent in ways that would shock the taxpayers whose hard-earned dollars are being effectively stolen from them. Non­profits that self-righteously declare themselves providers of homeless services actively lobby to make homelessness worse in order to increase their own funding; nonprofit organizations hire convicted <span>felons—including</span> murderers, gang leaders, sex offenders, and <span>rapists—who</span> go on to commit more felonies while receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in government contracts; and the executives of nonprofits, the very people in charge of institutions whose stated purpose is not to make money, earn millions of dollars while catastrophically failing to deliver the public services we are paying them to provide.</p>
<p>And as all of that is going on, the nonprofits in question receive tax breaks from the IRS, ensuring that the incompetent organizations wors­ening your city’s homelessness crisis exert their corrupting influence all the way to the halls of power in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Money for Nothing</strong></span></h3>
<p>There is a notorious nonprofit in San Francisco called the Tenants and Owners Development Corporation, or <span>todco</span> for short. The Tenants and Owners Development Corporation, despite containing the word “development” in its name, has not developed a single property <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/He-s-been-blamed-for-killing-housing-but-16630332.php">in approximately twenty years</a>. More and more, <span>todco</span> isn’t spending its money to help its current tenants, either. The <em>San Francisco Standard</em> found that <span>todco</span>’s spending on resident services declined from 62 percent of revenue in 2012 <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/03/09/sf-housing-nonprofit-todco-politics-tenants-infestations-drug-overdose/">to only 45 percent eight years later</a>. The Standard interviewed tenants in one of <span>todco</span>’s buildings and was deluged with complaints about decaying accommodations and rodent infestations. A woman told them bluntly that there were rats in the walls and complaints to management went nowhere; the tap water tasted foul and she sometimes found roaches in her food. One man felt a bite on his neck and assumed at first that he’d been bitten by one of the multitude of vermin that crawled through the building’s light fixtures; in fact, he’d been accidentally shot and the bullet hole was still visible in his wall when reporters interviewed him several months after the fact.</p>
<p>It turned out that instead of spending money on housing development and tenant support, <span>todco</span> boosted executive pay and funneled millions into lobbying. As <span>todco</span>’s spending on its tenants declined by 17 percentage points, executive pay quadrupled. Meanwhile, <span>todco</span>’s president, John Elberling, launched the Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium, a political lobbying organization. Between 2012 and 2020, <span>todco</span>’s direct lobbying of legislative bodies increased <em>95 times</em>, from $5,000 to $470,000. The Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium spent another $1.35 million on ballot referenda between 2016 and 2021, and within the small pond of municipal politics, that much money, if strategically deployed, can buy a shocking amount of influence.</p>
<p>Here’s where the story gets strange. Although <span>todco</span>’s nonprofit status is predicated on helping poor people afford housing, <span>todco</span> lobbies incessantly to prevent the construction of affordable units in some of San Francisco’s most expensive neighborhoods. In 2018, <span>todco</span> sued to prevent the construction of a mixed-use building on the grounds <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/03/09/sf-housing-nonprofit-todco-politics-tenants-infestations-drug-overdose/">that it would cast “new shadows”</a> on a community garden; <span>todco</span> then agreed to drop this lawsuit after the building’s developer paid them $98,000, raising questions as to whether <span>todco</span> was merely using San Francisco’s byzantine permitting process to extract a bribe from another developer. In another case, <span>todco</span> lobbied to block a <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2021/10/28/supervisors-under-fire-vote-against-proposed-soma-apartment-building-sparks-furor-may-violate-state-law/">495-unit housing development</a> that would have included over a hundred affordable units. In other words, an affordable housing nonprofit has repeatedly sued other developers to prevent the construction of the same affordable units that it is supposed to be working to provide.</p>
<p>And then, in July of 2020, the strangest of <span>todco</span>’s fiascos took place. That year, <span>todco</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/bayarea/heatherknight/article/san-francisco-housing-17408816.php">prevented the construction</a> of over one thousand new apartments, including 350 affordable units, so it could run a “racial equity study,” which it then never bothered to conduct. San Francisco Supervisor Dean <span>Preston—a</span> <span>todco</span> political <span>ally—convinced</span> the land use committee to put off the development for six months, during which time <span>todco</span> would supposedly analyze the development’s impact on minority residents in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>By August 2022, <span>todco</span> had not even begun the study that was supposed to have been completed eighteen months earlier. When asked by reporters from the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> why the study had never been done, <span>todco</span>’s president told the <em>Chronicle</em> that Covid interfered with their plans and a consulting group they’d been relying on had dropped out. Both of these excuses are highly dubious. When <span>todco</span> lobbied to delay the housing development so it could run its mythic study, Covid had already been rampaging through the United States for six months, meaning that <span>todco</span> was not blindsided by Covid and cannot use it as an excuse for failure. Furthermore, one consulting group dropping out should not indefinitely delay a study when the organization running it has millions of dollars in annual revenue, tens of millions of dollars in total assets, and a bevy of political connections. If <span>todco</span> wanted to run the study they could have done so, but they have exhibited no sense of urgency despite the fact that their failure to conduct the promised study has indefinitely prevented the existence of 350 units of affordable housing.</p>
<p><span>Todco</span> is a nonprofit whose mandate is to provide affordable housing. Over the last twenty years, however, <span>todco</span> has produced no additional units of affordable housing, has allowed the units it already owns to decay, and has spent millions of dollars preventing other developers from building thousands of apartments and hundreds of affordable units. Paradoxically, a nonprofit meant to provide affordable housing is spending taxpayer money to prevent affordable housing from being built; an organization that exists with the explicit mandate to help alleviate San Francisco’s housing crisis is instead working tirelessly to make that crisis worse. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>To understand <span>todco</span>’s behavior, you need to know something about the business model of affordable housing nonprofits. An afford­able housing NGO makes more money as rents rise in the area where its buildings are located. Government subsidies make up the difference between what the NGO’s tenants are paying and what they <em>could be paying</em> if the building charged them the market rate. This means that a nonprofit, despite its name, has the <em>same profit incentive</em> as any other landlord, in that a lack of housing construction increases its profit margins by driving up rents. The only difference is that a nonprofit benefits from high rents through government subsidies instead of from directly charging its tenants.</p>
<p>And that is an obvious conflict of interest. Nonprofit housing providers <em>benefit financially</em> if less housing gets built because high rents increase their subsidies. Affordable housing nonprofits are therefore incentivized to work against housing affordability if they want to increase the amount their executives get paid. Everything <span>todco</span> is doing is a natural consequence of the nonprofit industrial complex. T<span>odco</span>’s subsidies rise in concert with rents; it then funnels the money it receives from the government back into lobbying the same politicians responsible for funding it; those politicians prevent the construction of housing on <span>todco</span>’s behalf, thereby ensuring that rents remain high and <span>todco</span> rakes in millions of additional dollars in government subsidies; and <span>todco</span>’s executives receive enormous boosts to personal compensation and buy million-dollar houses in the suburbs. It is a kickback scheme so ingenious it would make Al Capone green with envy.</p>
<p>This propensity for nonprofits to privilege their own finances over the needs of the poor is not unique to San Francisco. Last year, an initiative to establish a public social housing developer in Seattle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220713083723/https:/www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/a-new-tool-or-a-distraction-seattle-social-housing-initiative-faces-early-opposition/">was opposed by the Housing Development Consortium</a>, a lobbying organ­ization for affordable housing nonprofits. The <em>Seattle Times’</em> reporting on this initiative is revealing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Housing Development Consortium, a lobbying group whose members include King County’s major low-income housing de­velopers, financial institutions and governmental development agencies, <em>doesn’t want to compete with a new organization for funding</em>.</p>
<p>The Housing Development Consortium argues that Seattle should focus its resources on the existing system . . . <em>which in­volves a collaboration between the largely federally funded Seattle Housing Authority, local public development agencies and other nonprofit organizations</em> [emphasis added].</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, a lobbying organization for affordable housing nonprofits advocated against a social housing initiative on the grounds that it would direct funds away from its members. Many of the people involved in these affordable housing nonprofits would describe them­selves as socialists, and yet they argued <em>against</em> a more socialist form of public housing development and in favor of the privatized, complex, and inefficient system that just so happens to financially benefit themselves.</p>
<p>In the event that America tried to dramatically increase the amount of public housing, a policy advocated by many progressives, it is likely that some of the fiercest opponents would be nonprofit landlords who would be outraged at the prospect of direct competition from government-owned housing. This is normal behavior for a private organization that relies on the government as its primary revenue source, but it is directly contrary to what the term “nonprofit” would seem to imply. Despite their trustworthy name, nonprofits are not <span>now—nor</span> have they ever <span>been—the</span> uncorrupted agents of the public good that their defend­ers would have us believe.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Crime Inc.</strong></span></h3>
<p>Exacerbating the profound conflicts of interest created by outsourcing government services to private nonprofits is the near total lack of oversight of these nonprofits, particularly with respect to how their money is spent and whom they hire to provide their services. It is a regular occurrence that money given to nonprofits is misdirected in a way ruinously contrary to the public interest. In especially egregious cases, money given to nonprofits finds its way into the pockets of people who never would have been hired by a government agency due to either a lack of competence or a disqualifying criminal history.</p>
<p>For instance, San Francisco gave tens of millions of dollars to a nonprofit called the United Council of Human Services over the course of two decades; <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/02/10/sf-homeless-nonprofit-ceo-lavish-lifestyle-illegal-activity-lawsuit/">their CEO proceeded to spend large sums of money in a totally illegal manner</a>, buying at least five vehicles for herself and family members and driving around with a trunk full of expensive jewelry. She also allowed twenty of her friends, family, and employees to occupy government-subsidized apartments which were meant to be used as housing for low-income San Franciscans.</p>
<p>There is always going to be <em>some</em> level of malfeasance when large sums of money are involved, but what makes the United Council’s criminality inexcusable is that Gwendolyn Westbrook, the CEO who stole taxpayer dollars and spent them on herself, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/port-official-to-be-arraigned-in-embezzling-3109308.php">pleaded guilty in 1997 to stealing thousands of dollars in parking lot collections</a> while working for the Port of San Francisco. A nonprofit run by a woman with a proven history of stealing from government agencies was given tens of millions of dollars to provide affordable housing services, and San Francisco’s political class was somehow surprised when, true to her previous track record, she stole that money, too.</p>
<p>Following Westbrook’s fall from grace, a <em>San Francisco Standard</em> investigation discovered that the city had paid <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/01/12/san-francisco-nonprofits-revoked-suspended-delinquent-millions/">tens of millions of dollars to nonprofits that were ineligible for government funding</a>: $25 million went to charities that were either delinquent or suspended and another $65 million went to nonprofits that were later declared ineligible. At the time of the <em>Standard</em>’s investigation, San Francisco had another $300 million of future contractual obligations to NGOs it was not legally allowed to fund.</p>
<p>Although San Francisco is one of the worst cities when it comes to nonprofits behaving badly, these same problems exist in every city that makes excessive use of the nonprofit sector. Seattle, in particular, has a rather distressing tendency to give exorbitant sums of taxpayer money to convicted felons, up to and including violent criminals and registered sex offenders. In 2001, a man named Khalid Adams was convicted of first degree theft in an incident in which he allegedly <a href="https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20010329&amp;slug=mardigras29m1">groped his victim while shouting racial slurs</a>; two years later Adams was convicted again, this time of first degree robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm. Adams’s <span>third—but</span> not <span>final—conviction</span> came in 2021 when he pled guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon.</p>
<p>Only a year after Adams’s third conviction, however, he was hired to work as a “violence interrupter” by a government-funded Seattle-area nonprofit called Community Passageways. In November 2022, while receiving a salary from King County taxpayers to prevent gun violence, <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/king-county-gave-millions-to-no-new-youth-jail-activists-to-help-kids-then-they-looked-away">Adams broke into his ex-girlfriend’s apartment, held her new boyfriend at gunpoint, and was subsequently shot by the ex’s eighteen-year-old cousin</a>. Adding a surreal element to this already incredible story, Savior Wheeler, the young cousin who shot Khalid Adams, <em>was a client of Community Passageways</em>, one of the same at-risk young people that Adams was supposed to keep away from gun violence. A Seattle nonprofit therefore hired a three-time convicted felon who was fresh out of prison to work as a mentor for at-risk youths, and he was subsequently shot by one of those very at-risk youths while threatening an ex-girlfriend at gunpoint.</p>
<p>This is a surprisingly common occurrence in Seattle. In 2022, the city <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/renegades-for-life">gave $260,000 dollars to a registered sex offender who was operating under a fake name and credentials</a> to mentor at-risk young people. In 2020, they gave a $3 million no-bid <span>contract—one</span> of the largest grants in city <span>history—to</span> a nonprofit called Freedom Project <a href="https://sccinsight.com/2021/03/08/black-brilliance-research-project-wraps-up-with-allegations-recriminations-but-no-city-investigation/">to run a “racial equity study.”</a> Freedom Project’s executive director at the time <a href="https://sccinsight.com/2021/07/29/the-black-brilliance-research-project-beginning-to-end-part-2/">was David Heppard</a> who was convicted as a teenager <a href="https://washington.lexroll.com/in-re-personal-restraint-of-heppard-25154-0-ii-wash-app-2-9-2001/">for taking part in the gang rape of a pregnant seventeen-year-old</a>. Freedom Project’s finance director, <a href="https://freedomprojectwa.org/staff/">Quddafi Howell</a>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/state-v-howell-57/#f33e5844-49ea-4a7e-a9aa-8d5835fe0078-fn1">once shot up a man’s house as an intimidation tactic to prevent him from snitching on Howell’s drug dealing</a>.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the $3 million Seattle handed over to a bunch of convicted felons was somehow mismanaged. A local political blog called <em>Seattle City Council Insight</em> looked into the paperwork behind this contract and discovered that <a href="https://sccinsight.com/2021/07/29/the-black-brilliance-research-project-beginning-to-end-part-3/">hundreds of thousands of dollars were handed out to subcontractors for minimal work</a> and the project’s lead was paid <em>$300 per hour</em> while publicly claiming to be a volunteer.</p>
<p>In another case, a homelessness nonprofit called share (the Seattle Housing and Resource Effort) <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-weighs-charges-over-homeless-nonprofits-use-of-unlicensed-accountant/">turned out to employ an unlicensed accountant</a> at the same time they were handling millions of dollars in government funds. Share claimed that they were the victim in this case, as they were unknowingly defrauded by a man who held himself out as a legitimate accountant. Fair enough. Share, however, might have noticed that their accountant was unlicensed were it not for the fact that share’s <em>treasurer</em>, the man presumably responsible for handling all their money, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/911577965/12_2017_prefixes_84-91%2F911577965_201612_990_2017121215021639">was Lantz Rowland</a>, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/tent-city-dispute-sends-homeless-packing/">an unqualified homeless man who lived in a tent</a>. This nonprofit <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/911577965">had total annual revenue of approximately a million dollars in 2016</a>, which included grants from King County and the City of Seattle, and the people responsible for handling that money were an illegal accountant and a sixty-year-old homeless tent dweller with no discernible qualifications.</p>
<p>Leaving the West Coast for a moment, one finds similar outcomes arising from the overuse of nonprofits in the Windy City. In Chicago, an anti-violence nonprofit called CeaseFire has had a shocking number of its “violence interrupters” <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/4/10/18328589/ceasefire-worker-gets-27-months-in-prison-for-federal-gun-conviction">arrested for serious crimes since its incep­tion</a>. This ought to surprise nobody given that these “violence interrupters” are almost universally convicted felons. Ceasefire workers convicted of crimes while employed by the organization include <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/4/10/18328589/ceasefire-worker-gets-27-months-in-prison-for-federal-gun-conviction">a fifty-one-year-old arrested for illegal gun possession</a>, whom authorities alleged was also moonlighting as a national gang leader; a convicted felon <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/13/chicago-police-arrest-jerel-taylor-for-guns-and-drugs/">caught naked under his bed with $50,000, an illegal firearm, crack cocaine, and heroin</a>; and a woman who was hired despite four prior felony convictions and <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/ceasefire-worker-charged-in-diamond-theft/64106/">subsequently stole $10,000 worth of diamonds</a>.</p>
<p>Chicago also has a state-funded <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/news/press-release.26485.html#:~:text=CHICAGO%E2%80%94Ahead%20of%20Memorial%20Day,in%20the%20City%20of%20Chicago.">“Peacekeepers” program</a> in which “community-based organizations” deploy former convicts to act as vio­lence interrupters during times when tensions are expected to be high. Last Memorial Day, a “Peacekeeper” named Oscar Montes <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/man-in-peacekeepers-vest-charged-with-robbing-beating-man-in-little-village/3150581/">assaulted a motorist while on duty</a>, leaving the man with potentially permanent eye damage. Montes was hired by the Peacekeepers program only a year after serving a ten-year prison sentence for shooting a rival gang member.</p>
<p>What is instantly noticeable about the above examples is that none of these people could draw a government paycheck <em>unless it was laundered through a nonprofit</em>. A police department could never hire a convicted felon with long-term ties to street gangs, but a private nonprofit has looser standards regarding who is allowed access to public funds. This not only squanders money on people who are not capable of performing the roles they’re assigned, but is an active threat to public safety in circumstances where the state uses convict-staffed nonprofits for duties that ought to be reserved for the police.</p>
<h3><span><strong>The Progressive Doom Loop</strong></span></h3>
<p>At the start of this piece, I said that “the act of naming is a form of propaganda,” an aphorism which applies to nonprofits because the name they’ve been given is a marketing device, rather than an objective representation of their conduct and behavior. It’s important to recognize, though, that nonprofits aren’t the only group relevant to this story that has been given an inaccurate name as a marketing ploy. The political ideology that supports the nonprofit industrial complex is generally referred to as “progressivism,” which calls to mind the socialist-leaning Progressive movement of the early twentieth century. In spite of sharing a common name, however, today’s “progressivism” has nothing in common with the Progressive movements of the last century, is not socialist in any real sense, and is, if anything, an extremist libertarian movement that destroys the ability of the government to function, rather than using state power for the betterment of the poor.</p>
<p>Once you start digging into the evidence, you find that the places where “progressives” wield the most power are some of the <em>least</em> socialist governments in the country. In 2022, San Francisco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230327233844/https:/www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2023/san-francisco-contracts/">spent $5.8 billion on private contracts</a>, over 40 percent of all city government spending, while the entire budget of Houston, a city 2.5 times as large, <a href="https://communityimpact.com/houston/heights-river-oaks-montrose/government/2022/06/02/houston-city-council-approves-fiscal-year-2022-23-budget/">was only $5.7 billion</a>. It is a strange form of socialism that runs more than two-fifths of its government through private contractors, instead of using publicly owned developers and social housing.</p>
<p>Portland, Oregon, meanwhile, has been suffering from a serious trash crisis for the past several years, due both to the city’s soaring homeless population and the government’s refusal to enforce antidumping laws. Portland’s response to the festering trash piles now blighting a once-beautiful city has not been to dramatically increase the government’s capacity to pick up and process garbage; instead, Portland, in conjunction with the state of Oregon, <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/15/oregon-multnomah-county-fund-portland-trash-clean-up-program/">has paid millions of dollars to </a><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/15/oregon-multnomah-county-fund-portland-trash-clean-up-program/">nonprofits</a><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/15/oregon-multnomah-county-fund-portland-trash-clean-up-program/"> to deal with the trash problem</a>.</p>
<p>As Portland outsourced trash collection to private nonprofit organi­zations, the ability of the <em>government</em> to collect trash has been gutted by budget cuts and a lack of resources. According to <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/the-story/portland-task-force-trash-garbage-cleanup-downtown-central-city/283-2d09202c-837c-4147-b47d-69da51dfdd32">local activist Frank Moscow</a>, Portland used to sweep every street as a matter of course, but currently only has one functioning street sweeper in the entire city. Not that it matters much, <a href="https://www.portland.gov/transportation/maintenance/street-sweeping#:~:text=street%20cleaning%20pilot-,Overview,street%20sweeping%20June%2030%2C%202023.">since Portland’s Bureau of Transportation sus­pended all street sweeping activities last June after another series of budget cuts</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to Portland’s trash-addled misery is the city’s inability to stop anyone from dumping their trash where it is not legally allowed to do so. In 2016, <a href="https://www.oregonmetro.gov/news/illegal-dumping-year-numbers">the city issued thirty-one citations for illegal dumping</a>; in 2021, <a href="https://kpic.com/news/local/homeless-not-only-ones-contributing-to-portlands-trash-problem">they issued a grand total of one citation</a>, for a measly $154. <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/03/opinion-volunteers-alone-cant-clean-up-portlands-trash.html">An opinion column published in the <em>Oregonian</em> in 2022</a> asserted confidently that “you could dump 10 large bags of garbage in Pioneer Square tonight and drive off without fear of being caught or penalized,” before going on to complain that Portland picks up trash from residential units <em>every two weeks,</em> instead of offering weekly trash pickup like almost every other city of comparable size.</p>
<p>This is the state of affairs in almost every city where “progressives” have a large impact on local politics. Progressives claim to support government spending programs, but <em>also</em> have an anarchistic, anti-governmental attitude that can be seen in their support for policies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html">police abolition in 2020</a>. Although progressives want the government to <em>fund</em> public programs, their opposition to centralized state power means they often don’t want the government to <em>run</em> the programs being funded.</p>
<p>The cities progressives control therefore tend to underfund core government agencies in favor of “community-based organizations,” by which they mean NGOs and nonprofits. Once the government can no longer meet its responsibilities, progressive cities outsource those ser­vices to nonprofit organizations, effectively privatizing the government.</p>
<p>A serious problem then occurs. Using several nonprofits instead of one government agency is inherently inefficient due to weak oversight and an inability to take advantage of economies of scale. That’s why cities on the West Coast spend so much on homelessness to no end whatsoever. San Francisco’s spending on homeless services increased from <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2022/san-francisco-sros/">$200 million in 2016 to an astronomical $1.1 billion in 2021</a>. Despite this incredible investment, on an average night <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/05/sf-homeless-drop-pit-count-sip-hotels/">there were a thousand more homeless San Franciscans in 2022 than there were in 2015</a>. In fairness, there was a decline in the city’s homeless population between 2019 and 2022, leading the deputy director at the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing to declare that “investment works.” Yet San Francisco’s population <a href="https://datacommons.org/tools/timeline#&amp;place=geoId/0667000&amp;statsVar=Count_Person">fell by seventy thousand resi­dents between 2019 and 2022</a>, meaning the miniscule re­duction in homelessness was likely a mere by-product of massive population loss.</p>
<p>Nor are the problems that cities like San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle have with falling population unrelated. By funding inefficient nonprofits instead of more centralized, accountable government initia­tives, progressive cities have high <em>taxes</em> but poor <em>services</em>; residents receive nothing in return for the taxes they pay. <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/portland/report-high-tax-rates-could-be-driving-people-out-of-portland/#:~:text=According%20to%20their%20data%2C%20Portland's,have%20to%20make%20%2425%20million.">Portland has one of the highest municipal income tax burdens in the country</a>, <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/09/28/portland-ranks-48th-among-50-big-cities-for-cops-per-capita/">but is forty-eighth out of the fifty largest cities in police staffing</a>, has piles of festering, uncollected garbage littering its streets, and only has two thousand shelter beds <a href="https://www.portland.gov/wheeler/homelessness#:~:text=The%20complexity%20of%20the%20homelessness,from%201%2C887%20to%206%2C297%20individu">for a homeless population of 6,300</a>, requiring four thousand homeless Portlanders to sleep outside even if every one of them wanted a bed.</p>
<p>Contrary to the conservative assumption that high taxes are an inherent evil, people are often fine with higher taxes provided that the taxes are utilized to improve local living standards. What is taking place in America’s most performatively socialist urban areas is that taxes are constantly raised in order to fund public services, resulting in some of the most heavily taxed populations in the country. But this tax revenue is then squandered on private contracts to unaccountable nonprofit organizations whose activities do little to rectify the problems they are nominally being funded to address.</p>
<p>Taxes soar in concert with the collapse in local living standards and the decay in public services. Public parks where children used to play fill up with homeless drug addicts who leave used needles near jungle gyms; a six-year-old girl in California mistook a syringe for a thermometer <a href="https://abc7news.com/needles-found-in-sf-left-on-streets-report-study-san-francisco/2226877/">and put it in her mouth</a>, and an eleven-year-old stepped on a needle while swimming in Santa Cruz. The streets grow increasingly unsanitary due to spiraling homelessness, reintroducing diseases once considered eradi­cated by civilized living. Los Angeles <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/health/fleaborne-typhus-la-county-cdc-wellness/index.html">had three deaths from flea-borne typhus in 2022</a>, the first such deaths in three decades; a reverend who works on Skid Row <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2016/12/10/homeless-advocate-who-lost-leg-walking-skid-row-returns-to-the-streets/">lost both legs to an infection he contracted simply walking the neighborhood’s streets</a>; and Portland’s Old Town recently experienced an outbreak of Shigella, a disease mostly seen in developing countries that <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/homeless/contagious-illness-spreads-old-town-hospital/283-c5856d2a-c962-4270-b5b9-4d111abe9697">spreads through fecal matter</a>.</p>
<p>The inability of nonprofits to properly manage services results in European taxes for third-world state capacity. Residents don’t know what the problem is: they don’t know that their taxes go to “violence interrupters” who are convicted felons; they don’t know affordable housing nonprofits use taxpayer money to lobby against affordable housing; and they don’t know money is being misallocated due to insuf­ficient oversight of nonprofits.</p>
<p>All they know is they pay high taxes for no reason. And so they leave. Oregon’s largest county <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2023/03/multnomah-county-lost-residents-faster-than-any-other-oregon-county-census-bureau-says.html#:~:text=a%20million%20people.-,Oregon's%20largest%20county%20shed%202.5%25%20of%20its%20population%20from%20April,lost%20more%20than%2010%2C500%20residents.">lost 2.5 percent of its population between 2020 and 2022</a>. As the population declines, the tax base shrinks. San Francisco’s sales tax revenue <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/downtown-sf-retail-18076696.php">fell 22 percent between 2019 and 2022</a>, with the worst decline seen downtown, where office buildings <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/04/05/downtown-san-francisco-vacancies-hit-record-high-as-city-nears-breaking-point/">now have record-high vacancy rates</a>.</p>
<p>Many articles have been written recently about the threat such cities face <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/06/the-urban-doom-loop-threatening-cities-like-new-york-and-san-francisco.html">of an “urban doom loop,”</a> in which a falling population guts tax revenue, which forces cuts to city services, thus reducing livability and causing an accelerating population exodus in a vicious cycle. To my knowledge, however, nobody has ever argued that a major contributor to this death spiral is outsourcing government services to unaccountable nonprofit organizations, rather than increasing state capacity and im­proving the government’s ability to solve problems itself. In this contrarian narrative, American cities are not failing because they’re too socialist; they’re failing because they aren’t socialist enough.</p>
<p>And that, alas, is the state of the great American city in the early twenty-first century, where nothing is as it seems. Ours is a country where “progressivism” has nothing in common with the movement from which it takes its name; where “socialists” privatize government services at every opportunity; and where countless “nonprofits” exist solely for the misbegotten profit of the people who run them. Again and again, the names we use to explain the realities of modern urban politics are propagandistic marketing terms and not an accurate representation of what is taking place.</p>
<p>Just like with the invention of the Chilean Sea Bass, <span>however—which</span> is neither Chilean nor a <span>bass—many</span> people are making money off the scheme. Who cares if it’s all a lie?</p>

<p>It seems like just yesterday WordPress was <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/05/wordpress-is-a-teenager/">becoming a teenager</a>, and in a blink of the eye it’s now old enough to drink! 21 years since <a href="https://mikelittle.org/">Mike</a> and I did the first release of WordPress, forking <a href="https://miche.lv/">Michel’s</a> work on b2/cafélog.</p>



<p>There’s been many milestones and highlights along the way, and many more to come. I’ve been thinking a lot about elements that made WordPress successful in its early years that we should keep in mind as we build this year and beyond. Here’s 11 opinions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Simple things should be easy and intuitive, and complex things possible.</li>



<li>Blogging, commenting, and pingbacks need to be fun. Static websites are fine, but dynamic ones are better. Almost every site would be improved by having a great blog.</li>



<li>Wikis are amazing, and our documentation should be wiki-easy to edit.</li>



<li>Forums should be front and center in the community. <a href="https://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a> and <a href="https://buddypress.org/">BuddyPress</a> need some love.</li>



<li>Every plugin and theme should have all the infrastructure that we use to build WordPress itself—version control, bug trackers, forums, documentation, internationalization, chat rooms, P2, and easy pathways for contribution and community. We shouldn’t be uploading ZIPs in 2024!</li>



<li>Theme previews should be great, and a wide collection of non-commercial themes with diverse aesthetics and functionality are crucial. </li>



<li>We can’t over-index for guidelines and requirements. Better to have good marketplace dynamics and engineer automated feedback loops and transparency to users. Boundaries in functionality and design should be pushed. (But spam and spammy behavior deserves zero tolerance.)</li>



<li>Feedback loops are so important, and should scale with usage and the entire community rather than being reliant on gatekeepers.</li>



<li>Core should be opinionated and quirky: Easter eggs, language with personality even if it’s difficult to translate, jazzy.</li>



<li>Everyone developing and making decisions for software needs to use it.</li>



<li>It’s important that we all do support, go to meetups and events, anything we can to stay close to regular end-users of what we make.</li>
</ol>



<p>What would you add?</p>



<p>Fun fact: On May 27, 2003 I blogged “Working backwards, earlier tonight was great. Put&nbsp;WordPress&nbsp;out, which felt great.” as one sentence in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2003/05/locked-out/">953-word entry written from the porch of my parent’s house</a> where I was accidentally locked out all night until my Dad left in the morning to go to work. Had no idea WordPress would be as big as it is. Earlier that night had set up WP for my friend Ramie Speight, and done some phone tech support for another friend Mike Tremoulet I had met through the local blogger meetup. My friends from high school all had their own domains with WP and that feedback loop was magical for shaping the software.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We study whether transformers can learn to implicitly reason over parametric knowledge, a skill that even the most capable language models struggle with. Focusing on two representative reasoning types, composition and comparison, we consistently find that transformers can learn implicit reasoning, but only through grokking, i.e., extended training far beyond overfitting. The levels of generalization also vary across reasoning types: when faced with out-of-distribution examples, transformers fail to systematically generalize for composition but succeed for comparison. We delve into the model's internals throughout training, conducting analytical experiments that reveal: 1) the mechanism behind grokking, such as the formation of the generalizing circuit and its relation to the relative efficiency of generalizing and memorizing circuits, and 2) the connection between systematicity and the configuration of the generalizing circuit. Our findings guide data and training setup to better induce implicit reasoning and suggest potential improvements to the transformer architecture, such as encouraging cross-layer knowledge sharing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a challenging reasoning task with a large search space, GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini-1.5-Pro based on non-parametric memory fail badly regardless of prompting styles or retrieval augmentation, while a fully grokked transformer can achieve near-perfect accuracy, showcasing the power of parametric memory for complex reasoning.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://www.martin-loetzsch.de/gtfl/">http://www.martin-loetzsch.de/gtfl/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40494097">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Abstract</h3><p>GTFL is a graphical terminal for Common Lisp. The client is a
         html page running in a web browser and GTFL provides
         mechanisms for sending content to the client page from within
         Lisp (using <a href="http://www.weitz.de/hunchentoot/">HUNCHENTOOT</a> and <a href="http://martin-loetzsch.de/ht-simple-ajax">HT-SIMPLE-AJAX</a>).</p><p>It is meant for Lisp programmers who want to debug or
         visualize their own algorithms. Instead of printing tracing
         information to the Lisp listener (which everybody normally
         does to understand what's going on), more readable graphical
         representations of the algorithm's internals are sent to the
         GTFL client page.</p><p>GTFL also comes with mechanisms for visualizing
         complex (hierarchical) data or control structures. It
         provides functions for drawing trees and for hiding
         complexity in elements that expand when the user clicks on
         them.</p><p>Two real-life examples for an application of GTFL can be found <a href="http://www.martin-loetzsch.de/gtfl/application-example-1/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.martin-loetzsch.de/gtfl/application-example-2/">here</a>. These are debug traces of linguistic parsing and production in the <a href="http://fcg-net.org/">Fluid Construction Grammar</a> (FCG) framework. Such traces help the developers FCG to
        understand and debug their programs and they help users of FCG
        to see what their linguistic rules are doing. By encapsulating
        visualizations for representations in expandable html
        elements, the complete trace fits into one browser window and
        still includes every little detail and intermediate processing
        step of the involved FCG algorithms (which would be thousands
        of pages debugging output to the listener).</p><p>Below is another example of using GTFL for visualizing Lisp
         data structures. It was created with a few lines of code (<a href="http://www.martin-loetzsch.de/gtfl/examples/asdf-dependency-tree.lisp">examples/asdf-dependency-tree.lisp</a>) and shows the dependencies of an asdf system. Click

        server that mediates between your program and the client page.
        In order to push stuff from Lisp to the client, the Lisp side
        of GTFL maintains a "request list" into which the
        output routines put their content. The client page has a
        continuously running event loop that polls this list every
        200ms using asynchronous AJAX calls.</p><p>Here's now some basic usage examples:</p><pre>(<a href="#start-gtfl"><tt>start-gtfl</tt></a>)</pre><p>This starts the web server.

        functionality to create html elements that expand when the
        user clicks on them and that collapse again when they are
        clicked a second time. Furthermore, several elements can be
        expanded/ collapsed at once using another button.</p><p>In order to save browser resources (memory, time), the
        expanded and collapsed version of each element are kept in
        Lisp and are only sent to the browser when needed: the version
        that is initally sent to the client contains only the
        collapsed version and when the expand link is clicked, it is
        replaced with the expanded version stored on the lisp side.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>(<a href="#gtfl-out"><tt>gtfl-out</tt></a>

<p>Python’s <code><span>itertools</span></code> library is a gem - you can compose elegant solutions
for a variety of problems with the functions it provides. In <code><span>more-itertools</span></code>
we collect additional building blocks, recipes, and routines for working with
Python iterables.</p>

<p>Many large concerts feature wristbands that light up on command. They are used to produce varied visual effects across a stadium. One company that makes these is <a href="https://pixmob.com/">PixMob</a>. Their controllable, illuminated wristbands are currently being used as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour">Taylor Swift's Eras Tour</a>. A short Wired article <a href="https://wired.me/technology/the-tech-behind-taylor-swift-concert-wristbands/">here</a> gives some details and here's a video from the Wall Street Journal:</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCsmZA08oD8?si=e3755KHJFdna_zBV" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p><p>For the Eras Tour the company's X2 product is being used.

So, simply put, PixMob works by installed a really big (and moveable) IR remote control (you can read about this on their website <a href="https://pixmob.com/our-effects">here</a>) and transmitting commands to the bracelets to produce colours, fades, flashes, etc. Cute.</p><p>There are a bunch of hardware details <a href="https://yeokhengmeng.com/2019/08/teardown-of-ndp2019-led-wristband/">here</a>.</p><p>Since they are projecting infrared with moveable projector they can sweep effects around the stadium, and cover the projector with cut outs to make things like hearts. It's simple technology that works very nicely. And, of course, there's a reverse engineering community built up around this.</p><p>The best place to start learning about that is <a href="https://github.com/danielweidman/pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering">this</a> GitHub repository. It brings together a bunch of reverse engineering efforts that have looked into the IR protocol. These have been somewhat successful and, since the <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero</a> has IR capability, there's a <a href="https://github.com/danielweidman/flipper-pixmob-ir-codes">project</a> that makes it control the wristband.</p><p>Here's a short video of me making the wristbands fade orange.</p><p>Such nice simple technology that produces very cool effects.</p>

They were being sold at bargain prices but Dr Gradel could tell many were very valuable.</p><p>This time, he knew he had seen the Priapus cameo before.

The museum, which has now brought a civil court case against Dr Higgs, believes he was mostly targeting these uncatalogued artefacts - and that, this time, he had made a mistake.</p><p>Dr Higgs would have been able to see the cameo was a catalogued item, searchable by the public and staff alike. It was even on the museum’s website - it was not the kind of item that could disappear and not be missed.</p><p>If his tampering had been successful, says the museum in its court papers, it would have hidden the database photo of the cameo from view - but it says he failed.</p><p>The next day, Dr Higgs is known to have returned alone to the storeroom where the cameo was kept, the museum says.

It would be worth double that, says the museum, if it still had its gold mount.</p><p>Dr Gradel says it is “totally bizarre” that he could sit at a computer on a small Danish island and be the first person to discover something was awry at the British Museum.</p><p>He wrote to sultan1966, the man he knew as Paul Higgins, asking why the Priapus cameo had been withdrawn. The seller replied saying it had been a mistake - it belonged to his sister, who didn't want him to sell it.</p><p>Dr Gradel chose not to alert sultan1966 about his suspicions. “That would enable him to cover his tracks,” he said.</p><p>Instead he decided to keep an eye on him - to see if any other pieces belonging to the museum appeared.</p><p>Four years would pass before the next clue - when Dr Gradel would make the shocking discovery that it appeared to be an inside job.</p></div><div width="wide"><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="The-second-clue" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">The second clue</span></h2></p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>In May 2020, Dr Gradel noticed an image in a newly published book on gemstones.</p><p>Figure 736 was a gem featuring a man who resembled the Roman Emperor Augustus. It was labelled as belonging to the British Museum.</p><p>The figure portrayed on the gem had an usual hairstyle for the period.</p><p>Suspicious once again, Dr Gradel looked through his records. </p><p>He matched the image in the book to a photograph on his computer hard drive of an olive-green gem fragment that he had previously been offered for sale by a British dealer called Malcolm Hay.</p><p>Dr Gradel told him about his suspicions around the gem right away.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Photos of gem casts resembled the gem fragment. The production process would have reversed the cast imprint - hence the face on the gem looks to the left</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>But when Malcolm Hay wrote to the museum to make enquiries about the startling similarity, he was told it was closed because of the Covid lockdown.</p><p>“[Deputy Director] Jonathan Williams replied to me, and he said, of course, there's no way of confirming anything at the moment because no-one could get into the museum,” Mr Hay said. “He asked me to hold it.”</p><p>Luckily, the person who had first sold it to Mr Hay happened to be a mutual friend of Dr Gradel’s - a gallery-owner in Bath called Rolf von Kiaer. Dr Gradel got in touch with him immediately.</p><p>Rolf replied that he had bought the olive-green gem on eBay a few years before.</p><p>The name of the seller? Sultan1966.</p><p>At this point, Dr Gradel feared something was very wrong. He began to comb through computer files and paper records of everything he had bought from sultan1966.</p><p>He meticulously went through eBay listings, correspondences and transaction receipts, dating back to his very first purchase from sultan1966 in 2014.</p><p>An online receipt provided a crucial clue - apparently revealing the seller's real name. It was listed as Peter Higgs rather than Paul Higgins.</p><p>“A PayPal receipt has to be attached to a real bank account,” Dr Gradel explains. “So this had to be his real name.”</p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>He immediately called Rolf von Kiaer once again.</p><p>“[Rolf] then said to me, ‘Ittai, you do realise that is the name of a curator in the British Museum Greece and Rome department, don't you?’ And I remember that distinctly, my hair stood on end, I was absolutely shocked by this.”</p><p>Over the coming days, Dr Gradel continued to unearth new connections between the online seller and Peter Higgs.</p><p>He discovered that “sultan1966” was also Dr Higgs’s account name on Twitter - now known as X - and that 1966 was the year he was born.</p><p>“The email address on the PayPal account was Bodrum1966,” said Dr Gradel. “His specialty was actually working on sculpture from ancient Halicarnassus in modern day Turkey. And the modern name of that place is Bodrum.”</p><p>Finally, Dr Gradel found an eBay receipt for a gem he had bought from sultan1966 that gave a full private address. Dr Gradel decided to check it against property records - and the name given was Peter Higgs, the British Museum curator.</p><p>Everything suddenly made sense to the Danish collector with the photographic memory.</p><p>“There was no other possible conclusion to draw from this. It was what it seemed to be - that the British Museum curator was pilfering his own museum,” says Dr Gradel.</p><p>Dr Higgs has since denied all the allegations and is defending the civil claim the British Museum is bringing against him.</p></div><div width="wide"><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Someone-could-be-framing-him" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'Someone could be framing him'</span></h2></p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>While Dr Gradel was combing through his receipts, Peter Higgs’ career seemed to be going from strength to strength.</p><p>In January 2021, he was promoted to acting head of the Department of Greece and Rome, having built a reputation for helping track down stolen antiquities around the globe.</p><p>He had been described by the UK government as “a world-renowned curator” in 2015 after helping to return a stolen 2,000-year-old statue to Libya. Dr Higgs later appeared on BBC’s Crimewatch to describe his work.</p><p>When Dr Gradel emailed the museum’s management in February 2021 with his concerns about Dr Higgs, he got a return acknowledgement from deputy director Jonathan Williams but that was all.</p><p>Dr Gradel was unaware the management had already heard about the allegations against Dr Higgs just a day earlier, accompanied by a warning he might be being framed.  Dr Higgs had been tipped off by another archaeologist - Dorothy Lobel King, after Dr Gradel had approached her on social media for advice.</p><p>Ms Lobel King had become concerned Dr Higgs was being set up. She had emailed him, and he had forwarded the email on to Dr Williams the deputy director - the court documents now say.</p><p>The museum did investigate Dr Gradel’s concerns - but as it did so, Dr Higgs was allowed to keep running his department. He tried to throw colleagues off his scent, the museum says, by altering computer records and implying that items had gone missing decades earlier.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The museum believes Dr Higgs covered his tracks by writing a note and making it appear as though it had been written in 1963</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>The day after Dr Gradel emailed his allegations, according to the museum’s court documents, it believes Dr Higgs made a report falsely claiming that the olive-green gem, which had been bought by Malcolm Hay, had actually been lost decades ago.</p><p>The museum also believes Dr Higgs marked the item as lost in its catalogue entry by inserting a note made to look like it had been written in 1963.</p><p>The British Museum chairman, George Osborne, says the museum’s court evidence suggested the thief had gone to “pretty elaborate lengths” to cover his tracks.</p><p>In May 2021, Malcolm Hay was invited to a meeting to hand back his gem. He said the museum was not really interested in where he had got it: “They were just happy to have it back.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr Gradel was growing increasingly anxious that he hadn’t heard anything back about his allegations, despite asking for an update several times. </p><p>Finally, in July 2021, he received a reply from deputy director Dr Williams saying the museum had carried out a “thorough investigation”. All objects had been accounted for, he was told, and there was no suggestion of wrongdoing by staff.</p><p>Dr Gradel says this was “bizarre to say the least - totally absurd”.</p><p>He knew Mr Hay’s gem had gone missing, been bought online and was only in the collection after being handed back.

The following April, a curator was hired to check every single item - although under the supervision of department head, Peter Higgs.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was becoming clear that something was very wrong.</p><p>The museum says the hired curator discovered that more than 300 registered items, many with gold mounts, had been damaged or stolen. Some of those remaining had deep gouging and scratches, which looked like marks left by pliers.</p><p>When the curator went on to look at the unregistered items contained in one particular storeroom, court documents claim she discovered that 1,161 items were missing - more than three-quarters of its entire contents.</p><p>The curator handed over preliminary reports to her boss, Dr Higgs, in late December 2022 and the museum’s court documents claim Peter Higgs tried to delay escalating the findings several times.</p><p>At first, he said it wouldn’t be good to announce the news before a weekend or Christmas, the documents claim - then, they continue, he said it was his birthday and he didn’t want to deal with the matter.</p><p>But, according to the museum, the curator insisted and her findings quickly made their way to the top.</p><p>The museum’s director at the time, Hartwig Fisher, shared the information with chairman George Osborne.</p><p>Two months before, Dr Gradel had managed to reach Mr Osborne to tell him about his suspicions. Mr Osborne told us he had been assured at the time, that they had already been investigated.</p><p>This fresh information, however, seemed too much of a coincidence.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>George Osborne says it was “pretty traumatic” for museum investigators as the scale of the thefts emerged</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>“I immediately said: ‘Well, hold on, that must be linked to that email that I saw a couple of months ago,’” Mr Osborne told the BBC.</p><p>They decided to call the police immediately and Dr Higgs was suspended.</p><p>“It took us some time as an institution to accept the betrayal of trust that these thefts represented,” Dr Fischer later told the BBC. “Betrayal by an insider has been a hard lesson to learn, and hard to prepare for”. </p><p>He later resigned from his position early over the response to Dr Gradel’s allegations.</p><p>“I think it was pretty traumatic for the people who were investigating this, particularly as the scale of the thefts emerged,” said Mr Osborne.</p><p>Both Dr Higgs’ workspace and home were raided by the Metropolitan Police over the subsequent months.</p><p>According to the museum’s High Court documents, police found handwritten notes and printed instructions on editing museum records at his work, while at home they seized items believed to have come from the museum's collections.</p><p>“I'm 100% certain we've got our man, we know who has stolen these items,” says Mr Osborne, “missing coins were found in his house”.</p><p>Dr Higgs has denied the coins came from the museum, stating they belonged to a dead relative.</p><p>He was finally dismissed from the museum in July 2023 - more than two years after Dr Gradel first raised the alarm.</p><p>Mr Osborne told the BBC the Danish antiques dealer had done the museum a great service, and he was sorry he had not been listened to initially.</p><p>“I hope he can look at the changes… and see that some good has come out of what has been a very sad and unfortunate series of events,” said Mr Osborne.</p><p>These include a commitment to catalogue every single item in the collections and tighten security processes, ensuring no member of staff can enter a storeroom alone.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>A drawer of artefacts Dr Ittai Gradel says are from the British Museum, at his home in Denmark</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>Police say the investigation is ongoing and nobody has been arrested or charged with any offence.</p><p>As for Dr Gradel, he has handed back more than 360 gemstones he believes belong to the museum, including some he had sold to other dealers and tracked down to return.</p><p>“I encourage everybody who has come by these gems to do what I've done and just hand the gems back to the museum,” he said.</p><p>The British Museum’s lack of cataloguing means Dr Gradel has had to donate items that were in his possession, while the museum tries to prove ownership. </p><p>It is considering how to reimburse buyers who unwittingly bought items online and which it believes are from its collections.</p><p>Buyers like Ittai Gradel, who says he is still working out how much money he has lost paying for gems which shouldn't have been up for sale in the first place.</p><p>“I don't think there's much more I can do to assist the museum in retrieving gems,” he says. “It's like a sort of a closure.”</p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>Thief at the British Museum is available on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0hz3hz1#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BEditorialPromo_Box%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BPS_SOUNDS~N~p0hz3hz1~P_BritishMuseumIntro%5D">BBC Sounds</a> or you can hear it on Radio 4, weekdays at 13:45, between 27 May and 6 June.</p><p>You can watch a documentary of the same name on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001zrbs#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BEditorialPromo_Box%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BPS_IPLAYER~N~m001zrbs~P_BritishMuseum%5D">BBC iPlayer</a> or on BBC Two at 19:00 on 27 May.</p></div><div data-component="embed-ugc-uploader-block" id="uploader-33-u175515924" width="wide"><h2>Get in touch</h2><div><p>Do you have information about the British Museum thefts?</p></div></div><div data-component="topic-list" width="wide"><ul role="list" spacing="2"><li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cywd23g0wydt">George Osborne</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cz5jl0zr0gmt">British Museum</a></li></ul></div></article></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Wi-Fi-based Positioning Systems (WPSes) are used by modern mobile devices to learn their position using nearby Wi-Fi access points as landmarks. In this work, we show that Apple's WPS can be abused to create a privacy threat on a global scale. We present an attack that allows an unprivileged attacker to amass a worldwide snapshot of Wi-Fi BSSID geolocations in only a matter of days. Our attack makes few assumptions, merely exploiting the fact that there are relatively few dense regions of allocated MAC address space. Applying this technique over the course of a year, we learned the precise locations of over 2 billion BSSIDs around the world.
<br>The privacy implications of such massive datasets become more stark when taken longitudinally, allowing the attacker to track devices' movements. While most Wi-Fi access points do not move for long periods of time, many devices -- like compact travel routers -- are specifically designed to be mobile. We present several case studies that demonstrate the types of attacks on privacy that Apple's WPS enables: We track devices moving in and out of war zones (specifically Ukraine and Gaza), the effects of natural disasters (specifically the fires in Maui), and the possibility of targeted individual tracking by proxy -- all by remotely geolocating wireless access points. We provide recommendations to WPS operators and Wi-Fi access point manufacturers to enhance the privacy of hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Finally, we detail our efforts at responsibly disclosing this privacy vulnerability, and outline some mitigations that Apple and Wi-Fi access point manufacturers have implemented both independently and as a result of our work.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most computer systems we interact with have an auth system of some kind.
The problem is, that sentence is at best unclear and at worst nonsense.
"Auth" can mean at least two things: authentication or authorization<sup><a href="#or-verb-forms">1</a></sup>.
Which do we mean for an "auth system"?
It's never perfectly clear and, unfortunately, we often mean <em>both</em>.</p>
<p>This is a widespread problem, and it's well known.
One common solution, using the terms "authn" and "authz", doesn't solve the problem.
And this isn't just confusing, it leads to bad abstractions and general failures!</p>
<p><img src="https://ntietz.com/images/comics/logging-in.png" alt="Comic about an ambiguity in the term &quot;log in.&quot;" title="Tech support thought they had seen it all, but they hadn't met Sam yet"></p>
<h2 id="the-current-terms-fall-short">The current terms fall short</h2>
<p>Calling things just "auth" is common.
It's used in library names (<a href="https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/">django-allauth</a> is for authentication, and <a href="https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth">go-auth</a> is also authentication), package names (<code>django.contrib.auth</code>, which does both authentication and authorization), and even <a href="https://auth0.com/">company names</a>.</p>
<p>Since "auth" can mean two things, this naming leads to ambiguities.
When you see a new auth library or product, you don't know right away what it's able to handle.
And when you talk about it, it's also not clear what you're referring to.</p>
<p>The canonical solution is to call these "authn" and "authz", the n and z evoking the longer words.
Thes are just not satisfactory, though.
They're clunky and hard to understand: they're not universal enough to be able to skip explanation; they're easy to mishear and are close together; and what verb forms would we even use?</p>
<p>It's not just about bad communication, though.
This terminology implies that the two concepts, authentication and authorization, are more closely related than they are.
It encourages bad abstractions to combine them, because we have one word, so we feel like they <em>should</em> belong together.
But they are two pretty fundamentally distinct problems: checking who you are<sup><a href="#other-assertions">2</a></sup>, and specifying access rights.</p>
<p>There are some links between auth and auth<sup><a href="#sorry">3</a></sup>, because what you can do is tied to who you are.
But they're also very different, and deserve to be treated that way.
At the very least, recognizing that they're different leads to recognition that solving one does <em>not</em> solve the other.</p>
<h2 id="intead-use-permissions-and-login">Intead, use "permissions" and "login"</h2>
<p>We should always use the most clear terms we have.
Sometimes there's not a great option, but here, we have <em>wonderfully</em> clear terms.
Those are "login" for authentication and "permissions" for authorization.
Both are terms that will make sense with little explanation (in contrast to "authn" and "authz", which are confusing on first encounter) since almost everyone has logged into a system and has run into permissions issues.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use "login" here: the noun and the verb form.
The noun form is "login", which refers to the information you enter to gain access to the system.
And the verb form is "log in", which refers to the <em>action</em> of entering your login to use the system.</p>
<p>"Permissions" is just the noun form.
To use a verb, you would use "check permissions."
While this is long, it's also just... fine?
It hasn't been an issue in my experience.</p>
<p>Both of these are abundantly clear even to our peers in disciplines outside software engineering.
This to me makes it worth using them from a clarity perspective alone.
But then we have the big benefit to abstractions, as well.</p>
<p>When we call both by the same word, there's often an urge to combine them into a single module just by dint of the terminology.
This isn't necessarily wrong—there is certainly some merit to put them together, since permissions typically require a login.
But it's not necessary, either, and our designs will be stronger if we don't make that assumption and instead make a reasoned choice.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h3>May 27 2024</h3>


<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/zwn3aTE6nw" alt="social medai"></p>
<p>Ever since the supply of fresh IPv4 address blocks was depleted there has been a number of interesting market changes, mostly around the costs to either acquire or lease IPv4 address blocks. Since the demand for IPv4 addressing has not changed that much, prices have gone up, and more providers like AWS, Hetzner, OVH, etc who were previously pricing in the cost of IPv4, are now charging for it separately.</p>
<p>For some people this has been a bit of a pay day, while if you were to have had a block assigned to you in 2016, you would have gotten 4 /24’s (a /24 is the minimum you can reasonably route on the BGP backed internet), however if you were setting up shop in the 2000’s you could easily acquire a 256 /24’s in a single allocation!</p>
<p>These entities are now selling off (if they can) these blocks at prices 10,000+ USD per /24!</p>
<p>But for other networks this development in pricing has been devastating to the costs of business, industries that were used to assigning a single IPv4 address (or more) to every subscriber began to find that this model is unsustainable, and have had no option other than to deploy Carrier Grade NAT.</p>
<p>So what if we technically had another 524288 /24’s worth of IPv4 hanging around in standardisation limbo? It turns out, we do! It’s called “Class E space”</p>
<h2>The IPv4 Class E Origin Story</h2>
<p>Class E space as defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1112.html">RFC1112</a> lives at the end of IPv4 address space between 240.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.254, Right after the space used for IPv4 multicast. This space in this state has existed since 1989, however it has been mostly ignored as a relic of time until the existing IPv4 unicast space allocations had been mostly assigned.</p>
<p>Class E is not actually the only space that is now being reviewed. During the standardisation of where IPv4 blocks would go, several unnecessarily large allocations were made due to technical limitations at the time. Some obvious ones include 0.0.0.0/8 (A block where 0.0.0.0/24 would have been sufficient in hindsight), and 127.0.0.0/8 (the local loopback block, where 127.0.0.0/16 would have been sufficient).</p>
<p>Since the internet was at the start not obviously going to be used, the minimum allocation size for an address block was a /8 at the start, later on we got “classful” allocations where a /16 would be assigned instead (this is why you often see /16s assigned to universities or institutions of similar ages), later on we moved to being able to assign /24’s, later on the internet moved to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1519">CIDR</a>’s to better address various addressing needs. However the older allocations for 0.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8, and 240.0.0.0/4 were never revisited.</p>
<p>The best I can understand from talking to people. 240.0.0.0/4 was assigned for a future where a 3rd (and still mythical) type of routing was invented that was not unicast or multicast.</p>
<p>While there are somewhat ongoing efforts to see 0.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8 become routable unicast space, I will focus for the rest of this post on 240.0.0.0/4, since it is the largest, and most technically interesting, not to mention that Class E’s reimplementation as unicast space shares almost all of the same issues as the other blocks.</p>
<h2>Realistic expectations</h2>
<p>Ultimately the answer to the depletion of IPv4 and its effects on the wider ability for networks to acquire IPv4 space, is to deploy IPv6. However since IPv6 requires all networks to also implement, networks are likely going to see a need for at least some IPv4 space for a very long time, even if it is relegated to increasingly slower and unreliable CGNAT technologies.</p>
<p>As for Class E space, it is unlikely that we will ever see such space widely accepted into the internet routing table. This is because of known equipment and endpoint incompatibilities that already exist today that would have to be overcome globally, and doing any upgrade action on the internet globally is nearly impossible. Because of this, even if people were offered Class E space it is unclear who would want IP addresses that only work for a subset of users (there is a joke somewhere here that we already have this, it’s called IPv6!)</p>
<h2>Class E as a local unicast space</h2>
<p>However global routing is not the only usage for IP addresses, plenty of addresses get consumed today in local networks, or for network infrastructure itself! Since these use cases tend to use <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918.html">RFC1918</a> (10.0.0.0, 192.168.0.0, etc space), it is unlikely we will see such tech deployed in the home.</p>
<p>However there are a number of places where you can easily “run out” of local addresses. For that, Class E space is a useful addition due to its size and its implicit incompatibilities with the rest of the world. This allows you to build out a large network with these addresses, and save the address space that is usable for interoperation with other networks or customer equipment.</p>
<p>We already see some uses of this today, For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tcR-iQce7s&amp;t=1709s">AWS uses 240.0.0.0/4 for some of their network devices</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/ip-address-squatting">Evidence of Class E space usage in some home/SMB has been spotted</a></li>
<li><a href="https://labs.ripe.net/author/qasim-lone/2404-as-seen-by-ripe-atlas/">Some non AWS networks are also using Class E space</a></li>
<li><a href="https://canonical.com/blog/introducing-the-fan-simpler-container-networking">“Fan” networking by Canonical uses Class E space</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Cloudflare has a option to have <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/network/pseudo-ipv4/">IPv6 addresses hashed into a Class E address</a> as a way to allow systems not capable of handling IPv6 addresses to still be accessed with IPv6, this is ultimately a huge hack, and it’s unclear if anyone seriously uses this feature.</p>
<h2>How is vendor support?</h2>
<p>Any deployment discussion is only academic if we do not have equipment that is capable of handling such addresses. At the time of writing, the support for such addresses is quite patchy.</p>
<p>Endpoint (aka, users) software that works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux distros post 2008</li>
<li>Android 2009</li>
<li>MacOS/OSX post 2009 (with Apple iOS being included)</li>
<li>OpenBSD post October 2022</li>
</ul>
<p>Endpoint stuff that does not work:</p>
<ul>
<li>All known Windows versions</li>
<li>NetBSD/FreeBSD</li>
</ul>
<p>For actual networking equipment, the story is more complicated. To test compatibility I built a virtual network vendor testing lab:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/ys4UwXWEYZ" alt=""></p>
<p>The goal is to test two questions</p>
<ol>
<li>Can Class E be used for addresses between routers?</li>
<li>Can Class E be used with routing protocols like OSPF and BGP?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some router vendors are able to set Class E addresses out of the box, others need special configuration. For example JunOS needs <code>routing-options martians 240/4 orlonger allow</code> to be set in configuration before such addresses are allowed, similarly Arista EOS needs <code>use ipv4 routable 240.0.0.0/4</code> set before Class E addresses are accepted.</p>
<p>Other vendors flat out refuse to set Class E addresses on their interfaces.</p>
<p>The other question is that if dynamic routing protocols correctly function when Class E CIDRs are used? The answer is, sometimes:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Vendor</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Static Link IP</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Routed OSPF Works</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Arista EOS 4.29</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Yes (Extra Config)</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Unknown</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>JunOS 22</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Yes (Extra Config)</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Yes</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>RouterOS 7.7</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Yes</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Yes</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Cisco IOS XR</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Yes</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Yes</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Cisco IOS XE 16.12</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>No</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>No</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Nokia SR-OS 21.7</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>No</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>No</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Huawei VRP</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>No</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>No</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Extreme EXOS 32</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>No</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>No</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>However, there are some very sharp edges to using protocols like OSPF/IS-IS with such address space that you should be aware of if you are planning to deploy this in your own environment:</p>
<h2>OSPF Surprises</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/52oVWQIdbp" alt=""></p>
<p>In the following example, we have two routers, one that supports Class E space being installed into the data (forwarding) plane, and the other (Nokia) that does not. However, because of how OSPF works, the routes will be carried by the Nokia router as if it can route for them, but since it never installs these routes it will drop traffic for it. (or worse, use a default route instead)</p>
<p>If ask the MikroTik to traceroute to a class E address that is behind the Nokia router, it knows to try and send it to the Nokia router, however the traffic is lost, when trying the same with a “regular” unicast address (of 6.6.6.6), then traffic is forwarded:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/mpxz2aXZwO" alt=""></p>
<p>This means that if you wish to deploy Class E space in such an environment, you must be sure that all devices in the path (and possible backup paths) can support it, else traffic may be dropped when they get used.</p>
<h2>Surprise real world test</h2>
<p>Because of the previously mentioned issues, I would not have thought it was worthwhile to try and test in in the real world, however you can imagine my surprise that a few days afterwards I got this email from a Internet Exchange mailing list</p>
<pre><code>Dear peering partners,

We started to announce a prefix 242.242.0.0/16 from our experimental ASN
8747.  242.242.1.1 should be pingable if such a route passes your
filters and router setup.

Current test results are that IOS XR supports class E routes with no
issues by default. With JunOS, using a command "set routing-options
martians" etc. is necessary.  Your feedback regarding other platforms is
appreciated.

S pozdravem/Best Regards,

Zbyněk Pospíchal
Quantcom, a.s.
</code></pre>
<p>This was super surprising to see! Quantcom staff had decided to give Class E a go, and since they had real customers with RIPE Atlas probes, we could run “best case” tests to see how real “SOHO” hardware handled class E space:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/9RUe9SWzhS" alt=""></p>
<p>… and it was about 50%, not terrible, but still far away from the numbers you would want to see. Usefully Quantcom also have BGP downstreams with RIPE Atlas probes, so I tested those too:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/lbTWR7NLeW" alt=""></p>
<p>Also 50%! Since most RIPE Atlas hardware is deployed inside homes and small businesses we can predict that if Class E was deployed today, the maximum acceptance on end devices is about 50%</p>
<p>I got in touch with Zbyněk from Quantcom, and he agreed to setup a IPv4 scan of the internet from the announced Class E space. This is helpful because it allows us to determine which of Quantcom’s BGP peers accepted the prefix (Implying a total lack of BGP filtering), and whose infrastructure can actually route class E IP addresses.</p>
<p>The scan concluded that 184,496 IP addresses responded to the ping, using bgp.tools’es <a href="https://map.bgp.tools/">map data</a> we would expect a fully reachable prefix to have 380,286,307 responses, so this puts the full reachability of this test Quantcom prefix at 0.04%.</p>
<p>This low reachability is without a doubt caused by the fact that Quantcom can only give the test prefix to their downstreams and direct BGP peers over internet exchanges, since their transit providers and internet exchange route servers will filter this out automatically preventing other networks from learning the prefix.</p>
<p>Networks that seem to have accepted the prefix directly include:</p>
<ul>
<li>AS2686 AT&amp;T EMEA</li>
<li>AS3216 VEON / Beeline / VimpelCom</li>
<li>AS5416 Bahrain Telecommunications Company</li>
<li>AS6740 InterneXt 2000</li>
<li>AS8926 Moldtelecom</li>
<li>AS9050 Orange Romania</li>
<li>AS13335 Cloudflare (Prague PoP only)</li>
<li>AS16625 Akamai</li>
<li>AS19281 Quad9</li>
<li>AS20485 TransTeleKom (and some of their downstreams)</li>
<li>AS25424 InterneXt</li>
<li>AS28725 CETIN</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these results surprised me, since they imply that for these networks involved, you could announce almost anything (maybe not RPKI invalids, who knows though) and they would accept and propagate across their network, including their downstreams!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/OwaPhiDY9v" alt=""></p>
<p>In the case of AS20485 TransTeleKom, their acceptance of the route allowed the bulk of the 184,496 IP’s to be able to respond. As I have only listed the networks that appear to have directly accepted the route over an IXP.</p>
<p>Maybe we still have a long way to go with BGP filtering in practice! It is also entirely possible that more networks that directly peer with Quantcom would have accepted this route if it was better supported by vendors out of the box.</p>
<p>Closing up, we can now better answer the root question of this entire post…</p>
<h2>Should you use Class E space?</h2>
<p>The short version is, Typically no. Unless you have supernatural control of your network vendor decisions, and cannot migrate to IPv6 for all workloads. However Class E could be very useful if you have control over your entire network for the use cases of local/private addressing.</p>
<p>As for Class E being globally reachable space, It is clear that there lies ahead major roadblocks for Class E space adoption. Not only does it require changes to user software that has an installation count of at least 1 billion, but it also requires that a policy be created within IANA and the IETF to change the purpose of this space.</p>
<p>Now, Having gone through the IETF recently for something unrelated to this, I can only assume that if such a thing is ever accepted, it would be a considerably long battle. It also opens up a second battle over what regional RIRs get the newly created address space. There are 5 RIRs, but 8 /8’s worth of address space up for grabs in Class E. It is not clear how you would split this up.</p>
<p>Finally, changing software is extremely hard, and getting Class E prompts some extremely difficult software deployment challenges. Since the customers/members of the RIRs would be reluctant to accept address space that does not work for all users. If we are going to start using address space that might not work for all users, it would be wise to pick the address space that we already have a considerable head start on getting accepted: IPv6.</p>

"Housing costs are another place where people are experiencing this financial squeeze."</p><p>In recent months, the White House has tried to address concerns about affordability head on, offering proposals such as rules to limit closing costs and a $10,000 tax credit for first time homebuyers.</p><p>It marks a shift in tone, after years of focusing on the economy's strengths, including low unemployment. But with few immediate levers for Mr Biden to pull, it's not clear the efforts are resonating. </p><p>His support has especially eroded among younger people - whose record turnout in 2020 helped put him in office. Voters in this demographic are least likely to own homes and most likely to see housing affordability as a top concern. </p><p>"I don't see any platform that purposely looks out for somebody like first-time homebuyers, wanting to ease their pain," says Braiden Dogherty, a 30-year-old from Florida who works in manufacturing and has been checking for houses daily for three years. </p><p>Despite a $50,000 inheritance, no debt, and decent jobs, he and his wife can't find an affordable two-bedroom near their families in the Orlando area.  </p><p>He says the problem of housing costs is too big to blame on any one politician or party, but the seeming lack of solutions has contributed to his wider political disillusionment. He is uncertain how he will vote in November.</p><p>"I'm fed up," he says. "Housing is part of it."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The growing outcry has raised pressure on the US central bank to cut interest rates to bring relief, a move Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has said is likely at some point.</p><p>But expectations that a cut would happen early this year, helping to improve the country's mood, have been steadily pushed back. This reflects concerns that progress in lowering inflation - which was hovering at 3.4% in April, still well above the bank's 2% target - could be stalling.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Julia Mokhnatkiina (JM Photos Inc)</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Mimi Than and her husband are among those affected by the rise in interest rates this year</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Instead, since January mortgage rates have mostly moved higher. </p><p>Mimi Than, a 29-year-old who recently bought a three-bedroom condo in the Boston, Massachusetts area, says she is facing roughly $200 more in monthly costs than when she and her husband were pre-approved for a loan in March. </p><p>They did not lock in the rate then, unaware borrowing costs might shift significantly. When they returned to their lender in April after making an offer, the interest rate they were offered was 6.9%, up from 6.5%.</p><p>She’s hoping that they will drop back later this year, allowing them to refinance.</p><p>"I'm obsessively checking the rates," she says. </p><p>Many analysts maintain it is only a matter of time until inflation slows down, clearing the way for a cut. </p><p>They note reports by private firms that show rental increases - which play a big role in calculations of US inflation - cooling from the torrid pace of the pandemic amid a jump in apartment supply.</p><p>With wages growing, an increase in new homes under construction and rents and home prices rising more slowly,  Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at the housing site Zillow, says he sees affordability challenges easing as well - albeit not in time for November's election.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>New home construction has increased significantly from pre-pandemic levels, but supplies still fall short of demand</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"It's working itself out," he says. "We still have a long way to go, of course, but we're seeing some improvement and I think we're going to see more improvement."</p><p>But there's a gloomier view. </p><p>With more people priced out of homeownership, rental rates may prove more resilient than expected, keeping inflation elevated.</p><p>And if mortgage rates do not drop significantly, the step-change in borrowing costs may act as a long-term constraint on supply, as builders pull back and homeowners who secured mortgages when rates were lower forego moving.  </p><p>Braiden, from Florida, sees no easy fix from the Fed, which he fears helped shape the current crisis by letting rates stay unusually low in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis. </p><p>"No matter what happens - whether they raise, lower or hold them - I feel as though the next decade is probably just going to be difficult no matter what for most people," he says.</p></div><div data-component="embed-ugc-uploader-block" id="uploader-16-u175766247"><h2>Get in touch</h2><div><p>Are you affected by issues covered in this story?</p></div></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p></section></article></main></div></div>]]></description>
