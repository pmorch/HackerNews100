  </div><div><p>Since X, formerly Twitter, changed its terms of service, fewer companies are offering customer service via the platform. Scammers are taking advantage of that by posing as companies’ customer services and actively approaching customers who have questions, <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/beurs/artikel/5414660/twitter-oplichting-fake-accounts-webcare">RTL Nieuws</a> reports.</p>

<p>The name is one of many things that changed at Twitter since Elon Musk took over. Another change is that it is no longer always possible for companies to load questions asked via DM on the platform into their customer service systems. Many companies, therefore, no longer offer customer service on X.</p>

<p>KLM is one such company. “Due to the recent changes to Twitter’s terms and conditions, our customer service through this platform is currently unavailable,” the Dutch airline warns in a post pinned to its profile. </p>

<p>However, customers must click to KLM’s profile to see that warning - it doesn’t pop up when sending the airline a post. And scammers take advantage of that by actively approaching customers who ask the airline public questions on X. </p>

<p>“We apologize for the inconvenience,” a scammer responded to a KLM customer’s post, using an account with KLM in the handle and the company logo in their profile. “Please send your telephone number so that we can help you.” According to RTL, people who send their numbers are then approached on WhatsApp, where the scammers ask for private information and credit card details. </p>

<p>“It’s a known problem,” a KLM spokesperson told the broadcaster. The company reports all fake accounts it spots to X. “But a few days later, another fake account pops up.”</p>

<p>Other companies affected by this problem include several foreign banks, Turkish Airlines, British Airways, Ryanair, Hotels.com, and LastMinute.com. </p>

<p>There are several ways to check whether an X account approaching you is reliable, according to RTL’s tech editor, Harm Teunis. “First, check whether there is a checkmark next to the account name and what color that checkmark is.” Accounts with a blue checkmark used to be verified, but anyone who pays for a subscription now gets a blue checkmark. “Verified accounts have a golden checkmark.”</p>

<p>You can also check when an account was created, how many followers the account has, and check its username and handle. “You cannot change the handle if the name is already in use. @KLM is already taken by the real company, so scammers use @KLM210, for example.” Grammatical errors can also indicate that things are dodgy. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Danny Mekić, an Amsterdam-based PhD researcher, was studying a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/europe-break-encryption-leaked-document-csa-law/">proposed European law</a> meant to combat child sexual abuse when he came across a rather odd discovery. All of a sudden, he started seeing <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/EUHomeAffairs/status/1703693679230083398" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/EUHomeAffairs/status/1703693679230083398&quot;}" href="https://x.com/EUHomeAffairs/status/1703693679230083398" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ads on X</a>, formerly Twitter, that featured young girls and sinister-looking men against a dark background, set to an eerie soundtrack. The advertisements, which displayed stats from a survey about child sexual abuse and online privacy, were paid for by the European Commission.</p><p>Mekić thought the videos were unusual for a governmental organization and decided to delve deeper. The survey findings highlighted in the videos suggested that a majority of EU citizens would support the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/europe-csam-scanning-law-chat-encryption/">scanning of all their digital communications</a>. Following closer inspection, he discovered that these findings appeared biased and otherwise flawed. The survey results were gathered by misleading the participants, <a data-offer-url="https://da.nny.nl/202310/de-europese-commissies-misleidende-desinformatiecampagne-en-illegale-advertenties-horen-niet-thuis-in-onze-democratie" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://da.nny.nl/202310/de-europese-commissies-misleidende-desinformatiecampagne-en-illegale-advertenties-horen-niet-thuis-in-onze-democratie&quot;}" href="https://da.nny.nl/202310/de-europese-commissies-misleidende-desinformatiecampagne-en-illegale-advertenties-horen-niet-thuis-in-onze-democratie" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">he claims</a>, which in turn may have misled the recipients of the ads; the conclusion that EU citizens were fine with greater surveillance couldn’t be drawn from the survey, and the findings clashed with those of <a data-offer-url="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/umfrage-72-der-buergerinnen-gegen-eu-plaene-zur-automatisierten-nachrichten-und-chatkontrolle-mit-strafanzeigeautomatik/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.patrick-breyer.de/umfrage-72-der-buergerinnen-gegen-eu-plaene-zur-automatisierten-nachrichten-und-chatkontrolle-mit-strafanzeigeautomatik/&quot;}" href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/umfrage-72-der-buergerinnen-gegen-eu-plaene-zur-automatisierten-nachrichten-und-chatkontrolle-mit-strafanzeigeautomatik/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">independent</a> <a data-offer-url="https://stopscanningme.eu/en/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://stopscanningme.eu/en/&quot;}" href="https://stopscanningme.eu/en/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">polls</a>.</p><p>The micro-targeting ad campaign categorized recipients based on religious beliefs and political orientation criteria—all considered sensitive information under EU data protection laws—and also appeared to <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785251066343473?s=20" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785251066343473?s=20&quot;}" href="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785251066343473?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">violate</a> X’s terms of service. Mekić found that the ads were meant to be seen by select targets, such as <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785259459138020" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785259459138020&quot;}" href="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785259459138020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">top ministry officials</a>, while they <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785256976097556" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785256976097556&quot;}" href="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785256976097556" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">were concealed</a> from people interested in Julian Assange, Brexit, EU corruption, Eurosceptic politicians (Marine Le Pen, Nigel Farage, Viktor Orban, Giorgia Meloni), the German right-wing populist party AfD, and “anti-Christians.”</p><p>Mekić then found out that the ads, which have garnered at least 4 million views, were only displayed in seven EU countries: the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, and the Czech Republic.</p><p>At first, Mekić could not figure out the country selection, he tells WIRED, until he realized that neither the timing nor the purpose of the campaign was accidental. The Commission’s campaign was launched a day after the EU Council met without securing sufficient support for the proposed legislation Mekić had been studying, and the targeted counties were those that did not support the draft.</p><p>The legislation in question is a controversial <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A209%3AFIN">proposal</a> by the EU Commission known as Chat Control or CSA Regulation (CSAR) that would obligate digital platforms to detect and report any trace of child sexual abuse material on their systems and in their users’ private chats, covering platforms such as Signal, WhatsApp, and other messaging apps. Digital rights activists, privacy regulators, and national governments <a data-offer-url="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/&quot;}" href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">have strongly criticized</a> the proposal, which the European data protection supervisor (EDPS) Wojciech Wiewiorowski said would amount to “crossing the Rubicon” in terms of mass surveillance of EU citizens.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“I think it is fair to say that this was an attempt to influence public opinion in countries critical of the indiscriminate scanning of all digital communications of all EU citizens and to put pressure on the negotiators of these countries to agree to the legislation,” says Mekić. “If the European Commission, a significant institution in the EU, can engage in targeted disinformation campaigns, it sets a dangerous precedent.”</p><p>The Dutch researcher’s find adds to the controversy surrounding the Commission, which has recently come under fire due to <a data-offer-url="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/&quot;}" href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">allegations</a> that certain <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/ashton-kutcher-thorn-spotlight-rekognition-surveillance.html">AI firms</a> and advocacy groups with significant financial backing have had a notable level of influence over the shaping of CSAR—allegations that lead Commissioner Ylva Johansson countered, asserting that <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_23_4763">she had committed no wrongdoing</a>. Johansson’s office did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.</p><p>“There’s an inexplicable obsession with this file [CSAR] in the Commission. I don’t know where that comes from,” EU lawmaker Sophie in ’t Veld told WIRED after she submitted a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2023-003037_EN.html">priority parliamentary question</a> on the case. “Why are they doing [the campaign] while the legislative process is still ongoing?”</p><p>As the pressure on the Commission has been mounting, Johansson <a href="https://commissioners.ec.europa.eu/news/setting-record-straight-2023-10-15_en">lashed out</a> against the influential civil rights nonprofit European Digital Rights, one of the strongest critics of the legislation and a defender of end-to-end encryption. She referred to its funding from Apple, suggesting EDRi was laundering the company’s talking points. “Apple was accused of moving encryption keys to China, which critics say could endanger customer data. Yet no one asks if these are strange bedfellows, no one assumes Apple is drafting EDRI’s speaking points,” she noted in a Commission blog on October 13.</p><p>Referring to EDRi’s independence and transparent funding processes, senior policy adviser Ella Jakubowska tells WIRED: “Attempts to delegitimize civil society suggest a worrying effort to silence critical voices, in line with broader trends of shrinking civic space. When both the content and the process regarding this law are so troubling, we need to ask how the European Commission allowed it to reach this point.”</p><p>Adding to the Commission’s conspicuous ad campaign, Mekić’s discovery came on the same day the European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_4953">formally sent X</a> a request for information under the Digital Services Act, the sweeping <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-eu-is-playing-by-elon-musks-rules/">EU digital disinformation law</a>, following indications of “spreading of illegal content and disinformation” on the platform.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“The Commission’s ability to enforce the DSA could be undermined if their own services are willing to flagrantly disregard these rules. Whilst the DSA is supposed to rein in the power of big tech, the CSA Regulation would force digital service providers to become a privatized police force in all our online chats, emails, and messages,” says Jakubowska. “It’s hard to see how these regimes can coexist or more broadly, how the EU can uphold fundamental human rights if it passes a law which could violate the essence of certain rights.”</p><p>The votes in the European Parliament and EU Council are still pending. “The Commission seems to forget its own role here: It is not a legislator. It only has the prerogative of proposing legislation,” says in ’t Veld. “It has no business interfering in the internal debate, neither in the Council nor in the European Parliament. The Commission is completely out of bounds here.”</p><p>Commenting on the negotiations, the outcome of which remains uncertain, EDRi’s Jakubowska observed that “it is reassuring to see that many lawmakers are alert to just how terrifying it would be for the EU to endorse a proposal that in essence amounts to distributed spyware on everyone’s devices.”</p><p>As far as the contested ad campaign is concerned, Wiewiorowski, the European data protection supervisor, initiated a pre-investigation <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/FantaAlexx/status/1713538934993498261?s=20" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/FantaAlexx/status/1713538934993498261?s=20&quot;}" href="https://x.com/FantaAlexx/status/1713538934993498261?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">requesting</a> from the Commission “information related to the described use of microtargeted ads,” with a response due by the end of last week. Wiewiorowski’s office declined WIRED’s request to comment on the potential for a formal investigation.</p><p>Ironically, Danny Mekić now believes he’s been <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712834547488846009?s=20" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712834547488846009?s=20&quot;}" href="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712834547488846009?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shadowbanned</a> by X, alongside other <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/KuypersMarieke" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/KuypersMarieke&quot;}" href="https://twitter.com/KuypersMarieke" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">journalists</a>, <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/ArmandGirbes" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/ArmandGirbes&quot;}" href="https://twitter.com/ArmandGirbes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">scientists</a>, and <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/bert_hubert" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/bert_hubert&quot;}" href="https://twitter.com/bert_hubert" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">researchers</a> who have been critical of CSAR.

            <p><span>As the COVID-19 pandemic was getting underway in early 2020, doctors in Wuhan, China, began to report that many patients hospitalized with the disease had cardiac injuries. Heart attacks were frequent, especially in patients with underlying risk factors, and there were numerous cases of myocarditis, which occurs when the heart’s muscle layers become inflamed. Roughly a quarter of patients with severe COVID-19 had elevated blood levels of troponin, a protein marker for cardiac damage.</span></p><p><span>This evidence altered how COVID-19 was viewed; previously considered primarily a form of pneumonia, it now took on a coronary dimension. “We began to understand that it’s also a cardiovascular disease,” says Peter Libby, the Mallinckrodt Professor of Medicine at HMS and a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.</span></p><p><span>H</span><span>ospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have since fallen off, the result of widespread vaccinations and the population’s growing immunity against severe disease. But SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is still with us, along with the risk it poses to heart health, especially in people with blocked arteries, hypertension, diabetes, and other predisposing factors. Millions of people who recover from COVID-19 have gone on to develop lingering cardiovascular symptoms, including abnormal heartbeats, dizziness, and </span><span>s</span><span>hortness of breath.</span> &nbsp;</p><p><span>The number of COVID-19 cases is once again spiking — and the coronavirus continues to evolve. The latest omicron variant, BA.2.86, has more than thirty mutations that could allow it to evade the immune system’s defenses. Given the ongoing threat, research into COVID-19’s cardiovascular effects “remains vitally important,” says Anne-Marie Anagnostopoulos, a cardiologist and an HMS instructor in medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. “We need a greater understanding of the associated pathophysiology to develop better treatments.”</span></p><h3><span><strong>Heart ills resulting from COVID</strong></span></h3><p><span>In most people — especially those who’ve been vaccinated — COVID-19 produces flu-like symptoms that typically resolve within a few days or weeks. But other people progress to a second, and more dangerous, phase of the disease, as pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines proliferate in the blood. During this so-called cytokine storm, the immune system becomes hyperactive, “causing a different set of problems,” says Dara Lee Lewis, MD ’92, an HMS instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women’s and director of noninvasive testing and co-director of the Women’s Cardiology Program at the Lown Cardiology Group in Boston. “Patients can develop weakened heart muscles, low oxygen levels, blood clots, fluid in the lungs — problems that may require hospitalization.”</span></p><blockquote><p><span>We need a greater understanding of the associated pathophysiology to develop better treatments.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>More importantly, pre-existing cardiac risk factors, such as coronary artery disease and obesity — which can predispose patients to metabolic inflammation — raise the likelihood for poor outcomes. People with vulnerable hearts, Lee Lewis explains, are more likely to succumb to COVID-19 complications than others who do not have these risk factors. In a worst-case scenario, patients could experience a type 1 myocardial infarction, which is a heart attack caused when a blood clot blocks flow in the arteries.</span></p><p><span>But COVID-19 patients are also unusually prone to a different type of heart attack called a type 2 myocardial infarction. In these cases, the problem isn’t a blockage in the arteries, but rather a mismatch between oxygen supply and oxygen demand. Fever and inflammation accelerate heart rate and increase metabolic demands on many organs, including the heart. If infected lungs are incapable of effectively exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide, then stressed hearts might suffer damage due to insufficient oxygen.</span></p><p><span>Lee Lewis says that early in the pandemic, myocarditis was also a major concern, especially for student athletes. “These kids didn’t need to just go back to work and life,” she says. “They needed to get back to competitive play.” Some students she cared for who had been sick with COVID-19 showed up with chest pain, racing hearts, shortness of breath, and evidence of myocarditis on magnetic resonance imaging.</span></p><figure role="group"><div>

<figcaption>Dara Lee Lewis</figcaption></figure><p><span>Studies from around the world were reporting that up to one-third of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 also showed evidence of asymptomatic myocarditis on imaging studies. This was troubling, since post-viral myocarditis is a known cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. “We worried that many of our student athletes would be unable to return to competitive play,” Lee Lewis says. Fortunately, the asymptomatic cases turned out to be uneventful, and the affected students made full recoveries. “Asymptomatic myocarditis wasn’t as big an issue as we initially feared it would be,” Lee Lewis adds. “So, we stopped doing MRIs on everyone who walked in the door.”</span></p><h3><span><strong>A push to understand SARS-CoV-2</strong></span></h3><p><span>That COVID-19 could be so closely associated with heart health wasn’t entirely unexpected. Scientists already knew that other types of infections, such as flu and bacterial sepsis, can amplify cardiac risk factors. It’s not uncommon for older people to have inactive plaques in coronary arteries. The plaques can be destabilized by a localized inflammatory response to remote infections. COVID-19 put a spotlight on these connections and led to greater awareness of the interplay between infections and cardiac disease.</span></p><p><span>But as an unknown virus, SARS-CoV-2 raised many new questions. One example — whether the virus infects myocytes, the cells responsible for heart contractions — “was initially a big issue,” Libby says.</span></p><p><span>Research has since shown that myocytes for the most part escape infection. Instead, SARS-CoV-2 damages the heart indirectly by unleashing inflammatory reactions that affect cardiovascular functioning. Upon invading the body, SARS-CoV-2 latches onto cells studded with receptors that are susceptible to the coronavirus spike protein. The spike protein is key to the virus’s infectivity. Once the spike protein is docked to cell-based receptors, it acts to allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter a cell.</span></p><p><span>Respiratory epithelial cells are considered to be key targets of infection, as are pericytes, which are cells that wrap around capillaries. When infected by the virus, these cells release cytokines that, in turn, act on other cell types that collectively form the interior lining of all blood vessels in the body. This lining, known as the vascular endothelium, “can be thought of as an organ in and of itself,” Lee Lewis says. “The endothelium has a huge job in preventing inappropriate blood clots and allowing blood vessels to constrict and dilate when they normally should.”</span></p><p><span>Normally, the endothelium keeps blood flowing in a liquid state. But when cytokines activate endothelial cells, the cells transition to a defensive posture: they mobilize macrophages and other immune cells and release molecules that promote blood clotting.</span></p><p><span>“Cytokines speak to cells throughout the body,” explains Jeremy Luban, a professor at UMass Chan Medical School who also serves on the executive committee of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, an HMS-led multi-institutional effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prepare for future pandemics. “And among the cells that may be listening are endothelial cells, which constantly have to monitor for coagulation and tissue damage states and induce actions like clotting to stop bleeding and other measures to prevent harm to tissues.”</span></p><p><span>But blood clots can be lethal. They can, for instance, obstruct arteries feeding the brain. During the pandemic’s early months, arterial blockages were implicated in strokes in numerous patients, even in young people without predisposing risk factors. Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 revealed clots throughout the body and evidence of multiple organ failure. Up to one-third of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were shown to have myocardial injuries that Libby attributes to microvascular clots and endothelial dysfunction, among other conditions.</span></p><h3><span><strong>POTS and viral infection</strong></span></h3><p><span>Microvascular damage has also been implicated in the long-term symptoms that now constitute a growing focus of COVID-19 research. “Even five months after the acute phase of the illness, we can detect these disturbances,” Libby says. He adds that answers to the mystery of what causes long COVID may be found in microvascular dysfunction.</span></p><p><span>Bruce Levy, the Parker B. Francis Professor of Medicine at HMS and a co-founder of Brigham and Women’s COVID Recovery Center, agrees. The fact that microvessels are present throughout the body, Levy says, might explain why long COVID has been associated with more than 200 symptoms affecting nearly every organ. Brain fog and the confusion and forgetfulness that attends it, for instance, might result from inflammation’s effects on blood vessels in the central nervous system, while long-term cardiovascular symptoms might arise from inflammation in the small vessels leading to and surrounding the heart.</span></p><p><span>A paper that appeared in August 2023 in </span><em><span>Nature Medicine </span></em><span>reported an extensive analysis of health care data collected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs during a two-year follow-up of veterans who survived the first thirty days of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and data from a control cohort that had not shown evidence of infection. The study looked at risk of death, hospitalization, and pulmonary and nonpulmonary sequelae. Its findings showed that cardiovascular problems sometimes linger even in people who were never hospitalized for COVID-19. Levy, however, points out that severe initial disease is still the best predictor of long-term symptoms.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>POTS is something that we need to be on the lookout for. Many people suffer with it for weeks or months before getting a diagnosis.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Among the more common lingering problems — affecting up to one-third of all patients with long COVID — is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which causes the heart to beat abnormally fast. POTS can be diagnosed if a patient’s standing heart rate test measures a sustained increase of at least 30 beats per minute that persists for ten minutes or more after a patient stands. In many patients with POTS, standing heart rates exceed 120 beats per minute. People who have the condition often feel dizzy, fatigue easily, have trouble exercising, and are prone to fainting.</span></p><p><span>“POTS is something that we as cardiologists, friends, and neighbors need to be on the lookout for,” Lee Lewis says. “Many people suffer with it for weeks or months before getting a diagnosis.” POTS affects up to three million people in the United States, most of them women between the ages of 15 and 50, and often begins after pregnancy, trauma, or a major surgery. A family history of POTS also boosts the risk. But, according to Lee Lewis, POTS cases associated with COVID-19 can affect men or women. At this time clinicians are unsure what the prognosis will be for these patients.</span></p><p><span>How does virally triggered POTS develop in the first place? Mounting evidence points to inflammatory effects on nerves that control blood flow and heart rate. Apart from acting directly on the endothelium, inflammation targets small nerve fibers that dictate when blood vessels should dilate or constrict. Impulses sent through the sympathetic nervous system, for instance, normally tell blood vessels to constrict and the heart rate to increase during standing in order to maintain adequate blood pressure to the brain. However, in people with POTS, the blood vessels may not constrict appropriately. Instead, the heart rate must rise even more than normal to compensate for the “lazy” blood vessels, says Lee Lewis. Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system kicks in when the body rests, instructing blood vessels to dilate and instructing the heart to beat more slowly so the blood pressure goes down.</span></p><p><span>When people stand, blood moves to the lower extremities. To counter this drop, the brain triggers the release of a burst of norepinephrine, which signals the sympathetic nervous system to cause vessels to constrict and the heart to beat faster, moving the blood back to the brain and torso. In someone with POTS, that normal response “gets thrown out of whack,” Lee Lewis says. The vessels don’t constrict and blood stays pooled in the legs, yet the heart rate speeds up and stays elevated.</span></p><p><span>Lee Lewis often works with Peter Novak, an associate professor of neurology at Brigham and Women’s and a specialist in long COVID. He describes POTS as one of many dysautonomias resulting from imbalances in the autonomic nervous system, which includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary physiological processes; not just heart rate and blood pressure, but also breathing, digestion, and sexual arousal. Novak estimates that 60 to 80 percent of patients with long COVID have symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, with POTS being the most common.</span></p><h3><span><strong>Treatments for long COVID</strong></span></h3><p><span>Levy describes long COVID as a post-pandemic pandemic. “Something like sixty-five million people worldwide have been affected,” he says, adding that long COVID profoundly affects people’s ability to work, go to school, or both. The COVID Recovery Center at Brigham and Women’s currently sees up to 150 patients each month and has a waiting list of four to six weeks. About 10 percent of the roughly four thousand patients seen so far were evaluated for cardiovascular problems.</span></p><p><span>But that’s probably an underestimate, Levy says, since patients with POTS and other cardiovascular symptoms are likely to be referred directly to cardiology and not the recovery center for initial evaluation and treatment.</span></p><p><span>According to Anagnostopoulos, therapeutic strategies for patients with long COVID and a POTS-like syndrome or exercise intolerance and tachycardia emphasize light exercise and structured endurance training. The goal is to ward off a “deconditioning spiral” that might cause the original problem to worsen. Similar to POTS, if patients remain sedentary for too long, Anagnostopoulos says, they could develop cardiac atrophy; decreased stroke volume, meaning that the heart doesn’t pump enough blood out of the left ventricle during contraction; or compensatory tachycardia, characterized by resting heart rates that exceed 100 beats per minute.</span></p><figure role="group"><div>

<figcaption>Anne-Marie Anagnostopoulos</figcaption></figure><p><span>“It’s important to acknowledge that these patients are suffering,” Anagnostopoulos says. “Many of them are young and unaccustomed to being sick or held back in any way from what they want to do. They often feel they haven’t been taken seriously. And what they want to know is that the doctor sitting with them is developing a plan for improvement.” Anagnostopoulos points to a 2022 report on long COVID in adults by the American College of Cardiology, which cautions against starting treatment for tachycardia or POTS with upright exercise such as power walking or jogging. According to the report, these activities might “worsen fatigue, resulting in post-exertional malaise.” The report’s authors recommend instead a preliminary strategy of recumbent and semi-recumbent exercises, such as stationary biking and rowing, with increasing intensity as a patient regains functional capacity.</span></p><p><span>Researchers are also making headway on how best to approach cardiovascular threats in acutely ill patients with COVID-19. Given a high prevalence of clotting disorders, it might be assumed that anticoagulants and antiplatelet treatments would improve outcomes. But some clinicians caution that bleeding risks from those drugs may outweigh their potential benefits. Advances are also being made in the use of anticytokines, such as glucocorticoids and monoclonal antibodies, to counter systemic inflammation.</span></p><p><span>Libby emphasizes that future trials investigating COVID-19’s cardiovascular effects need to be better coordinated. An initial rush to respond to the pandemic produced a flood of observational and non-randomized studies in this area, he says, which spread more confusion than illumination.</span></p><p><span>Although the pandemic seems to be receding, Luban cautions against complacency. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer and, after declining for years, deaths from heart attack and stroke rose again as SARS-CoV-2 spread worldwide. Fortunately, the virus has not yet evolved to a more virulent form, he says, adding that “it’s heartening that vaccine protection against hospitalization and severe disease seems to be hanging in there. But who knows what will happen? This virus has surprised us every step of the way.”</span></p><p><em><span>Charles Schmidt is a writer based in Maine.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Images: Dung Hong (collage); John Soares (Lee Lewis, Anagnostopoulos)</span></em><br>&nbsp;</p>

The data show encouraging signs of clinical activity and an increased persistence of cancer-specific CAR-T cells when combined with CARVac. At the ESMO Congress 2023 in Madrid, Prof. John Haanen, M.D., Ph.D., Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), Amsterdam, Netherlands presented the data in an oral late-breaking data session which confirms the positive interim data presented at this year’s American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, USA.</p>                            <p>“Our goal is to unlock the potential of CAR-T for solid tumors and to help improve the outcomes for a broad range of hard-to-treat tumors,” said <b>Prof. Özlem Türeci, M.D., Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer at BioNTech</b>. “BNT211 aims to address two of the key limitations of CAR-T cell approaches in solid tumors, namely the lack of suitable cancer-specific cell surface targets and the limited persistence of CAR-T cells. To address this challenge, we have designed a CLDN6-specific autologous CAR-T cell therapy that we combine with our mRNA-based vaccine CARVac.”</p>                            <p>The data update included 44 patients who received CLDN6 CAR-T cells at four dose levels alone or in combination with CARVac. Patients with germ cell tumors (n=16), ovarian cancer (n=17) and other solid tumor types (n=11) were treated. In course of the dose escalation, a dose-dependent increase in adverse events was observed, with cytokine release syndromes occurring in 23 of 44 safety evaluable patients. In most cases, these were of grade 1 and 2, with one patient with a grade 3 and one with a grade 4 event. Neurotoxicity was mild and self-limiting in two patients. Of the total 44 patients, 38 were efficacy evaluable. The overall response rate (“ORR”) for these 38 patients was 45% and the disease control rate (“DCR”) 74%. Further, 27 patients were treated with CLDN6 CAR-T cells at dose level 2 (1x10<sup>8</sup> CAR-T cells) with or without CARVac. At this dose level, 13 patients showed partial responses resulting in an ORR of 59% and a DCR of 95%. Additionally, in the same cohort, patients who received CARVac showed a prolonged persistence of CAR-T cells. </p>                            <p>These results further underline the potential of BioNTech’s BNT211 program. One objective of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial is to determine the recommended dose for the initiation of a potential pivotal Phase 2 trial in patients with germ cell tumors which is expected to be initiated in 2024. </p>                                         <p><b>About BNT211</b><br>To harness the power of cell therapies for solid cancers, BioNTech has combined their CAR-T and FixVac platform technologies to develop a tumor-specific CAR-T cell therapy which is enhanced by a <b><u>C</u></b>AR-T Cell <b><u>A</u></b>mplifying <b><u>R</u></b>NA <b><u>Vac</u></b>cine (CARVac) that is based on BioNTech’s mRNA-lipoplex technology and encodes for the CAR-T target antigen. The mRNA vaccine is designed to boost CAR-T persistence and functionality.

        <p><em>Translations: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/itelma/blog/550620/" target="_blank">Russian</a></em></p>
        <p>In <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/">Software Disenchantment</a> we’ve seen how software has degraded in the past two decades. Recently Jonathan Blow gave a talk where he explained why it might be happening:</p>
        <figure>
          <iframe width="635" height="358" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pW-SOdj4Kkk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </figure>
        <p>The talk is very, very good, but since I already know you won’t find time to watch it here’s my interpretation.</p>
        <p>The software crisis is systemic and generational. Say, the first generation works on thing X. After X is done and becomes popular, time passes and the next generation of programmers comes and works on Y, based on X. They do not need to know, exactly, how X is built, why it was built that way, or how to write an alternative X from scratch. They are not lesser people or lazier, they just have no real need to write X<sub>2</sub> since X already exists and allows them to solve more pressing tasks.</p>
        <p>The biggest a-ha moment of the talk was that if you are working on Y and Y is based on X, that does not imply automatically that you would know X also. Even if the people who build X are still around, knowledge does not spread automatically and, without actual necessity, it will go away with the people who originally possessed it.</p>
        <p>This is counter-intuitive: most people would think that if we’ve built, for example, a space ship or a complex airplane in the past, we could build it again at any time. But no, if we weren’t building a particular plane uninterruptedly, then after just 50 years it is already easier to develop a new one from scratch rather than trying to revive old processes and documentation. <em>Knowledge does not automatically transfer to the next generation.</em></p>
        <p>In programming, we are developing abstractions at an alarming rate. When enough of those are stacked, it becomes impossible to figure out or control what’s going on down the stack. This is where my contribution begins: I believe I have found some pretty vivid examples of how the ladder of abstractions has started to fall and nobody can do anything about it now because we all are used to work only at the very tip of it.</p>
        <p>Enter macOS Catalina. Every year Apple releases a new operating system and every year it needs a flagship feature to promote it. This year it was a long-overdue standalone Music app. Well, what could be simpler, right? List of files, categories, filters, smart lists. All that has been around in iTunes at least since 2001. But even if it wasn’t, how hard is it to build a decent music player? Many companies order of magnitude smaller than Apple have done it successfully in the past.</p>
        <p>And yet, it didn’t go smoothly. Guys at <a href="https://annoying.technology/" target="_blank">Annoying.Technology</a> have some great examples.</p>
        <p>Clicking one thing <a href="https://annoying.technology/posts/04769fafdac16826/" target="_blank">shows another</a>:</p>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls="" width="1044" height="678">
            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/smartitunesstore.mp4?t=1697909370" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>The Music.app header <a href="https://annoying.technology/posts/802dfae3517d4419/" target="_blank">is rendering wrong</a>:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/musicappcatalina.png?t=1697909369" width="311" height="149">        </figure>
        <p>The problem is not limited to just Music. In Podcasts, some items are highlighted on selection, while others <a href="https://annoying.technology/posts/da8e5b3f56d9f767/" target="_blank">are not</a>:</p>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls="" width="504" height="612">
            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/sidebarclickable.mp4?t=1697909370" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>As Philipp correctly mentioned,</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It’s not some odd, third-party utility that somehow looks a bit funky on an obscure version of macOS. It’s the flagship rewrite of the new Music.app shipping with Catalina.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I think this is a great example because all the possible explanations you might have for this if it was some other app, any other app, do not apply here.</p>
        <p>Lack of attention? Well, they CHOSE to make Music app. They CHOSE to make it a flagship product of Catalina. So there must’ve been thousands of eyes looking and checking. Didn’t help.</p>
        <p>Lack of resources? This is Apple, a company that could’ve hired anyone in the world. There are probably more people working on Music player than on the entire Spotify business. Didn’t help.</p>
        <p>They simply do not care? Well, again, Apple has been known for its attention to detail in the past and it has served them well. I doubt they intentionally completely changed company priorities just in this case. It’s only logical to assume they did care, but it didn’t help.</p>
        <p>This is just too far-fetching for a single bug? Well, the bugs are multiple and they contaminate all Catalina apps.</p>
        <p>A bug is too obscure? Well, What could be more evident than clicking on one thing and not have it selected?</p>
        <p>Lack of expertise? They’ve been building music players for 18 years now!</p>
        <p>Is the problem too complex? Is the scope too big? Actually, no. Music app is less powerful and more limiting than iTunes. That’s expected, of course, since iTunes had its time to develop, but still. This is a freaking music player. It’s not rocket science!</p>
        <p>Yes, these particular bugs are pretty minor and probably do not affect business in the short run, only Apple’s reputation. Still, <em>it is a big deal.</em> Imagine how tall, opaque and unstable that ladder of abstractions is that it’s even possible to fail such a simple thing as selecting an item in a list??? It is a freaking list and if you click it, it should select a thing that you just clicked. How hard of a task do you think that is? Why it has worked flawlessly since the first iPod with a monochrome screen and quarter of computing power of modern watch, but can’t be done in a flagship product of the most advanced operating system in the world?</p>
        <p>Because advanced means complex. So complex that no one could reasonably understand it or have control over it, even if they wanted. Apple DID want it. But even they couldn’t. Even with all the resources in the world.</p>
        <p>At this point, you might think I’m just picking on Apple or Catalina. God knows what went wrong there. Maybe they did change priorities and re-hired all the programmers. But no. This problem is universal.</p>
        <p>Amazon can’t <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/status/1206562961688596483" target="_blank">make a screen with two checkboxes</a>:</p>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls="" width="309" height="550">
            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/amazon@2x.mp4?t=1697909369" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>I mean, yeah, Amazon was never known for producing quality software. Yet, I insist, the task is SO trivial, it’s so impossible to fail that it only demonstrates how bad people understand or control their tool.</p>
        <p>Twitter newly rebuilt UI <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkxBzJ8lYAY" target="_blank">takes 7× longer to load first tweet</a>, giving you essentially the same stuff but much later and with much more effort:</p>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls="" width="686" height="562">
            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/twitter.mp4?t=1697909370" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>I don’t have numbers, but I’ve heard Gmail rewrite also made it much slower with no apparent new functions. It’s still pretty drastic if you put GMail next to Fastmail, or Twitter next to Tweetdeck, both of which didn’t get any full rewrites in the last decade, so you can see how fast even Web UI could be if we weren’t constantly climbing up the abstraction ladder.</p>
        <p>Docker and Electron are the most hyped new technologies of the last five years. Both are not about improving things, figuring out complexity or reducing it. Both are just compromised attempts to hide accumulated complexity from developers because it became impossible to deal with.</p>
        <p>And that’s sad.</p>

<p>What follows is, unspun and unvarnished, my account of my interview under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act as given to my lawyers:</p>
<p>I arrived from Keflavik airport, Iceland to Glasgow airport at about 10am on Monday 16 October. After passport control I was stopped by three police officers, two male and one female, who asked me to accompany them to a detention room.</p>
<p>They seated me in the room and told me:</p>
<p>I was detained under Section 7 of the Terrorism Act</p>
<p>I was not arrested but detained, and therefore had no right to a lawyer.</p>
<p>I had no right to remain silent. I had to give full and accurate information in response to questions. It was a criminal offence to withhold any relevant information.</p>
<p>I had to give up any passwords to my devices. It was a criminal offence not to do this.</p>
<p>They searched my baggage and my coat, going through my documents and taking my phone and laptop. They did not look at one document from Julian Assange’s lawyers that I told them was privileged.</p>
<p>They asked me about boarding cards for Brussels and Dublin they found and what I had been doing there. I replied I was at a debate at Trinity College in Dublin, while in Brussels I had attended a human rights meeting focused on the case of Julian Assange.</p>
<p>They asked me to identify the individuals from some visiting cards I had from the Brussels meeting (one was a German MP).</p>
<p>They asked me the purpose of my visit to Iceland. I told them that I was attending a coordinating meeting of the campaign to free Julian Assange. I said I had also attended a pro-Palestinian rally outside the Icelandic parliament, but that had not been a prior intention.</p>
<p>They asked how I earnt my living. I said from two sources: voluntary subscriptions to my blog, and my civil service pension.</p>
<p>They asked what organisations I am a member of. I said the Alba party. I said I worked with Wikileaks and the Don’t Extradite Assange campaign, but was not formally a “member” of either. I was a life member of the FDA union. No other organisations.</p>
<p>They asked if I received any money from Wikileaks, from Don’t Extradite Assange or from the Assange family (separate questions). I replied no, except occasional travel expenses from Don’t Extradite Assange. In December I had done a tour of Germany and received a fee from the Wau Holland Foundation, a German free speech charity.</p>
<p>They asked what other campaigns I had been involved in. I said many, from the Anti-Nazi League and Anti-Apartheid movement on. I had campaigned for Guantanamo inmates alongside Caged Prisoners.</p>
<p>They asked why I had attended the pro-Palestine demo in Iceland. I said one of the speakers had invited me, Ögmundur Jónasson. He was a former Icelandic Interior Minister. I said I did not know what the speeches said as they were all in Icelandic.</p>
<p>They asked whether I intended to attend any pro-Palestinian rallies in the UK. I said I had no plans but probably would.</p>
<p>They asked how I judged whether to speak alongside others on the same platform. I replied I depended on organisers I trusted, like the Palestine Solidarity Committee or Stop the War. It was impossible to know who everyone was at a big rally.</p>
<p>They asked if anyone else posted to my twitter or blog. I replied no, it was all me.</p>
<p>They asked how considered my tweets were. I replied that those which were links to my blog posts were my considered writing. Others were more ephemeral, and like everyone else I sometimes made mistakes and sometimes apologised. They asked if I deleted tweets and I said very seldom.</p>
<p>I volunteered that I thought I understood the tweet that worried them and agreed it could have been more nuanced. This was the limitation of twitter. It was intended to refer only to the current situation within Gaza and the Palestinian people’s right of self-defence from genocide.</p>
<p>That was more or less it. The interview was kept to exactly an hour and at one point one said to another “18 minutes left”. They did not tell me why. At one point they did mention protected journalistic material on my laptop but I was too dazed to take advantage of this and specify anything.</p>
<p>They took my bank account details and copies of all my bank cards.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
<p>This is an enormous abuse of human rights. The abuse of process in refusing both a lawyer and the right to remain silent, the inquiry into perfectly legal campaigning which is in no way terrorism-associated, the political questioning, the financial snooping and the seizure of material related to my private life, were all based on an utterly fake claim that I am associated with terrorism.</p>
<p>I have to date not been arrested and not charged. Contempt of court is therefore not in play and you are free to comment on the case (although in the current atmosphere any kind of free thought is liable to vicious state action). I am safe and currently in Dublin. I intend next to travel to Switzerland to take this up with the United Nations.</p>
<p>My legal team have already made a submission against this outrage to the United Nations Human Rights Committee and are looking at the possibility of judicial review in the UK. We also have to prepare the defence against possible terrorism charges, ludicrous as that sounds. </p>
<p>I am afraid this all costs money. I am grateful for the unfailing generosity of people in what seems a continual history of persecution.</p>

It’s a question Dominique Gonçalves has had to ponder as she leads the elephant ecology project at Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park, which is not surrounded by a physical barrier.</p>
      
    <p>A number <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12898" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">of pioneering studies</a> <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12679" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">throughout Sub-Saharan</a> Africa over the past several years showed a solution that was simple and natural: bees. As it turns out, the tiny, ubiquitous honeybee has the power to terrify a mammal that’s 22 million times its size. </p><p>In fact, even the sound of the insect’s buzz is enough to send a family of elephants into a panic, showed <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(07)01718-6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies by Lucy King</a>, an Oxford zoologist and preeminent researcher in human-elephant coexistence at the nonprofit <a href="https://www.savetheelephants.org/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Save the Elephants</a>. Upon hearing the telltale hum, elephants will run, kick up dust, shake their heads as if trying to swat the bees out of the air, trumpeting distressed warnings to other elephants as they flee.</p>
          <p>Of course, a bee’s stinger can’t penetrate the thick hide of an elephant. But when bees swarm—and African bees swarm aggressively—hundreds of bees might sting an elephant in its most sensitive areas, like the trunk, the mouth, and eyes. And it hurts.</p><blockquote>
<p>The bee has the power to terrify a mammal that’s 22 million times its size.</p>
</blockquote><p>Building on King’s insights, Paola Branco of the University of Idaho conducted a massive two-year-long experiment in Gorongosa that culminated in <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12679" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2019 paper</a> she co-authored with King, Marc Stalmans, Gorongosa’s director of scientific services, Princeton zoologist Robert Pringle, and others.<sup>1</sup> Their research aimed to settle tensions between human farmers and the park’s growing population of marauding pachyderms—with the help of bees.</p><p>Although elephants are peaceful by nature, they can and will trample grain, swipe crops, topple down silos, and knock down entire houses. Given half a chance, elephants from the fenceless sprawl of Gorongosa in the Lower Rift Valley will steal across the Pungwe River—which acts as the southern border between the million-acre park and the rest of rural Mozambique—stomping into villages in search of a meal.</p>
          <p>Humans share blame in the squabble. Natural habitats for elephants are rapidly being tilled into croplands, encroaching on food sources, often leaving the animals little choice but to ransack and steal. And while the population of African elephants has been precipitously dropping, the number of humans in Sub-Saharan Africa continues to skyrocket, rising from 930 million in 2012 to 1.2 billion in 2022, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=ZG" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">data from the World Bank show</a>.</p><p>The result is that elephants and people are often competing for the same resources. The animals—which typically eat about 300 pounds of vegetation a day—can decimate an entire farm’s harvest overnight.</p><p>In a way, it’s not a terrible problem to have, says Gonçalves, who grew up in the town of Beira, a few hours away from Gorongosa.</p><p>The Mozambican civil war, which raged from 1977 to 1992, saw 95 percent of Gorongosa’s large animals killed. The <a href="https://nautil.us/elephants-never-forget-war-367462/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact on elephants</a> was especially profound. Slaughtered by warring troops who traded their tusks for more guns, the park’s pre-war population of elephants dwindled from 4,000 to only about 200 by the time the conflict ended. Thirty years on, says Gonçalves, that population is bouncing back and now numbers a little more than 1,000. The crop raids are a side effect of that recovery.</p>
          <p>But straying elephants cause havoc for small-scale subsistence farmers in Gorongosa’s buffer zone, the liminal area that stretches around the 1,500 square miles of the park and is home to more than 200,000 people. The more elephant numbers bounce back, the more of them there are to go on nighttime ransacking missions.</p><p>“It’s a question of how humans and elephants are overlapping,” says Gonçalves. “If there are agricultural plots, that can create situations of conflict, when elephants either eat or trample or destroy. That has a huge economic security impact for farmers.”</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="348" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/fGnkPbMc-Digges_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=png&amp;h=445&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/fGnkPbMc-Digges_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/fGnkPbMc-Digges_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/fGnkPbMc-Digges_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>BUZZ OFF: </strong>Buckets of bees are strung on a fence wire along a river in Mozambique. When elephants trip the wire, bees swarm out of the boxes. The elephants hightail back to where they came from. <em>Courtesy of Gorongosa National Park.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Most subsistence farmers don’t have the resources to surround their plots with expensive wire fences, and often must resort to <a href="https://elephantsandbees.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Weinmann-2018-Impacts-of-Elephant-Crop-Raiding-on-Subsistence-Farmers-and-Approaches-to-Reduce-Human-Elephant-Farming-Conflict-in-Sagalla-Kenya.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">less effective deterrents</a> like banging sheet metal to scare elephants away, burning tires to produce acrid smoke, or lying in wait in the bushes at night with flashlights and fireworks to startle the animals.</p>
          <p>These confrontations can prove lethal for both sides. In <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.africanews.com/2022/07/14/at-least-five-persons-killed-by-elephants-in-northern-mozambique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July of 2022</a>, five people harvesting their crops in the Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado—870 miles northeast of Gorongosa—were trampled by elephants from the Quirimbas National Park. On occasion, humans retaliate. In Kenya, for instance, wildlife authorities <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/elephants/human_elephant_conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shoot between</a> 50 and 120 elephants per year.</p><p>“That’s the worst-case scenario,” Gonçalves says. “Both people and elephants end up being dead.” So she and her colleagues at Gorongosa decided to intervene to keep the two sides happy.</p><p>It began, as many science things do, with an experiment. In 2017, researchers strung a series of fences at well-trafficked elephant crossing points along the Pungwe River. Some of the fences relied on methods of elephant deterrent already popular among small-scale farmers, such as twine soaked in chilis.<sup>1</sup> But between others, the researchers ran bailing twine from which they suspended hives populated by the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/IN1205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famously irascible</a> African bee, a species nearly identical to its European and North American cousins—but for its more aggressive tendencies. Still others combined chili-coated twine <em>and</em> bee hives.</p><p>The researchers then tranquilized and fitted 12 male elephants—males being more apt to forage in croplands—with GPS collars. Satellite data pinged from the collars, combined with the observations of local community members, allowed the researchers to keep exacting tabs on where the elephants wandered and whether the experimental fences prevented them from stumbling into neighboring farmsteads to rummage.</p>
          <p>Sure enough, the fences worked. The chili fences reduced elephant river crossings by 80 percent—while the beehive fences thwarted a whopping 95 percent of cross-river forays by the animals. (Beehives strung on twine coated in chilis were, surprisingly, the least effective. King and her co-authors surmised that the coating weighed the twine down, making it easier for elephants to simply step over it.)</p><p>Cameras placed near fences involving beehives showed that the elephants would trip the bailing twine, thus shaking the suspended beehives. Immediately, this would stir the bees to action, and they would swarm and mount an attack. In footage taken at night, shadowy silhouettes of peeved elephants <a href="https://gorongosa.org/human-wildlife-coexistence/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">can be seen</a> turning tail and lolloping in unison out of the frame.</p><blockquote>
<p>Beehive fences thwarted a whopping 95 percent of forays by the animals.</p>
</blockquote><p>The true beauty of this method, write Branco and her coauthors in the study, is that it allows discontinuous fencing to block key corridors used by elephants as they go on crop raids rather than fencing individual farms or entire nature preservers, like Gorongosa—which both for the farmers and the park could prove prohibitively expensive, running into the thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars. To build 15 hives and string them from posts, Branco and her team spent a total of $773.</p>
          <p>The results at Gorongosa jibed with those from <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another field study</a> that King conducted in Kenya in 2017.<sup>2</sup> In that experiment, researchers strung beehive fences around 10 farms that were located near a nature preserve, reducing elephant raids by 80 percent. Bee fences have also been found to be an effective deterrent against crop raiding Asian elephants as well, showed <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31649-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2018 study</a> King conducted in Sri Lanka.<sup>3</sup> In that case, merely playing recordings of angry bees through speakers in the field was enough to cause the elephants to flee.</p><p>Gonçalves says the bee barriers set an important precedent for future conservation efforts by offering a nonlethal method of control that doesn’t create divisions between the park and the people who live near it.</p><p>Bee fences alone aren’t enough. Other animals that are less flustered by bees, such as baboons and honey badgers, can be drawn to the honey the bees produce, disturbing the hives to the point at which the bees themselves take flight and move out. King’s studies in Kenya, however, suggested that small cages can be placed around hives to prevent them from being disturbed by these other foragers. The dry seasons, too, can dampen bee populations in hives as they flee and search for moister climes.</p><p>But the elephant intellect, says Gonçalves, proves the biggest obstacle to a static set of beehive fences. They have not, for instance, deterred clever elephants from seeking out alternative crossing points and taking up near-permanent residence in the buffer zone.</p>
          <p>Indeed, Stalmans says, sometimes a traditional, or even electric, fence is the best resort—but even those prove, over time, to be no match to an elephant’s keen navigational sense. Just as they are smart enough not to get stung or shocked, they’re also smart enough to simply chart routes around most human-made impediments and find their way to nearby farm settlements.</p><p>It is here that Gonçalves <a href="https://nautil.us/a-fragile-equilibrium-421685/" target="_blank" aria-label="joins efforts (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">joins efforts</a> with Gorongosa’s <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gorongosa.org/human-wildlife-coexistence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human-wildlife coexistence</a> team. Together, they chart the peregrinations of known elephant families that have been collared with GPS devices and can thereby spot areas of potential human-elephant conflict before they erupt. <img decoding="async" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""> </p><p><em>Lead photo by Kevin Berger.</em></p><p><em>The &nbsp;</em>Nautilus<em>&nbsp;Gorongosa Series is published in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>Discover more from More Than Moore</h4><p>The latest in semiconductors: silicon, AI, processors, market trends.</p><p>Over 3,000 subscribers</p> </div><div dir="auto"><p>A quick one for you. I have received reports, now from multiple sources, that the major torch bearer of the RISC-V platform, a company known as SiFive and formed from the original architects of the RISC-V instruction set, has gone through some major changes.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/the-risk-of-risc-v-whats-going-on?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/the-risk-of-risc-v-whats-going-on?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>RISC-V is well known as the royalty free alternative to other core architectures on the market. The idea is that anyone can pick up the architecture, build their own core out of it, add their own custom features to it, then build it without any royalty payments. The problem is that building a core, or building an SoC, isn't that simple. Lots of techniques go into designing a core, and simply having an architecture isn't the end-point, it's merely the start. That's why RISC-V has seen a lot of adoption for people who want to design cores on paper, but then it has taken time to come into silicon. Even beyond that, if you want a chip that is either high performance, or high efficiency, or both, then you still need a team of dedicated core and SoC designers to go make that happen.</p><p><span>RISC-V has seen major pickup in the low-end core space, particularly replacing microcontrollers. Companies like Western Digital have been very public about their RISC-V cores replacing microcontrollers and other functions in their storage devices. Other companies like NVIDIA, Google, and recently Qualcomm, have staked their RISC-V intentions, and since the bust-up between Arm and China, RISC-V is taking a footing over there as well. Some companies are looking at high performance RISC-V cores, such as Tenstorrent (you can watch my video of their 128-core chiplet </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spipSjgKXu0" rel="">here</a><span>) and Ventana Micro. A lot of the companies involved in RISC-V are part of the RISC-V International consortium which essentially manages the ecosystem, with a lot of companies upstreaming key parts of the architecture and microarchitecture for performance, security, and other aspects. A level playing field for foundational support, such as an equivalent to ARM's SBSA L3 that ensures all servers meet specific minimum requirements, is also the target of RISC-V International.</span></p><p>There are also a number of companies in the Core IP business for RISC-V cores. SiFive has been the biggest for a while - it has achieved $365m in venture capital to date up to Series F, as well as sold off part of its assets for $220m in the last 12 months or so. Things have been riding high - it has a portfolio of cores that companies can license for their RISC-V designs, from microcontrollers to scalar cores to vector cores. It still follows the Arm model of licensing a core, but maintains the open-ness and customization that RISC-V offers.</p><p>So what is this news today? Through multiple sources, SiFive has instigated a large number of layoffs. Numbers vary, from 100 to 300+, but multiple sources confirm that most of the engineering team, especially the physical design engineers, sales, and product team. The management team have also been fired from what I've been told, leaving the founders and CEO Patrick Little at the helm. That's a heck of a shake up.</p><p>But that's not all. The product portfolio is also being gutted. SiFive's business always had two elements - predesigned cores you can pick up, most of which have already been silicon proved, and SiFive even announced two new cores literally only a week ago. The other half of the business is custom cores - where clients would approach the team with specific requirements and then SiFive would actually go and design it, to be installed into a full SoC. My contacts are telling me (although not to the same level of certainty as the layoffs) that the pre-designed core portfolio is no more. SiFive from now on it seems will only be working on custom cores.</p><p>I approached SiFive's PR agency to get details. They provided me with an official statement:</p><blockquote><p>“As we adjust to the rapidly changing semiconductor end markets, SiFive is realigning across all of our teams and geographies to better take advantage of the opportunities ahead, reduce operational complexities and increase our ability to respond quickly to customer product requirements. Unfortunately, as a result some positions were eliminated last week. The employees are being offered severance and outplacement assistance. SiFive continues to be excited about the momentum and long-term outlook for our business and RISC-V.”</p></blockquote><p>That statement confirms stuff is going on, but also doesn't say much. It confirms there are layoffs for sure, but then also says 'reduce operational complexity', which often means cutting the product portfolio. 'Responding quickly' means smaller teams more often than not, and 'realigning across geographies' may suggest pulling out of certain markets (i.e., sales). Perhaps a formal announcement will be made in due course.</p><p>This is a bit of a stab into the belly of RISC-V, given the prominence with which SiFive has taken to the industry in promoting RISC-V technology. It sounds like SiFive will stick around, however I wonder how long the founders will stay there if the only business being done is custom cores. Perhaps SiFive's big business was custom cores, and this is not much of a change, but given the numbers for layoffs I'm hearing, it sounds like there will be fewer contributions to the RISC-V standards from SiFive from now on. There's also the question of what this means for investors, what questions they'll be asking, and what answers they'll be getting.</p><p>More on this story as it develops. There's also a video version for those interested:</p><div id="youtube2-l0DUHZ1e48U" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;l0DUHZ1e48U&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l0DUHZ1e48U?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><h5><span>More Than Moore, as with other research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, which may include advertising on the </span><a href="http://www.more-moore.com/" rel="">More Than Moore</a><span> newsletter or </span><a href="http://www.techtechpotato.com/" rel="">TechTechPotato</a><span> YouTube channel and related social media.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/blog/goodbye-nodejs-buffer">https://sindresorhus.com/blog/goodbye-nodejs-buffer</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37996291">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-container"><p>The <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html"><code>Buffer</code></a> type has been the cornerstone for binary data handling in Node.js since the beginning. However, these days we have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array"><code>Uint8Array</code></a>, which is a native JavaScript type and works cross-platform. While <code>Buffer</code> is an instance of <code>Uint8Array</code>, it introduces numerous methods that are not available in other JavaScript environments. Consequently, code leveraging Buffer-specific methods needs polyfilling, preventing many valuable packages from being browser-compatible.</p>
<p><code>Buffer</code> also comes with additional caveats. For instance, <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufslicestart-end"><code>Buffer#slice()</code></a> creates a mutable segment linked to the original <code>Buffer</code>, while <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray/slice"><code>Uint8Array#slice()</code></a> creates an immutable copy, resulting in possible unpredictable behavior. The problem is not the behavior of the <code>Buffer#slice()</code> method, but the fact that <code>Buffer</code> is a subclass of <code>Uint8Array</code> and completely changes the behavior of an inherited method. Instead of <code>Buffer#slice()</code>, use <code>Uint8Array#subarray()</code> or <code>Buffer#subarray()</code>. Furthermore, <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/41588#issuecomment-1016269584">buffers expose private information</a> through global variables, a potential security risk.</p>
<p>It is time to move on.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p>I intend to move <a href="https://github.com/search?q=owner%3Asindresorhus+%22node%3Abuffer%22&amp;type=code">all my packages</a> from using <code>Buffer</code> to <code>Uint8Array</code>. If you are a maintainer of a JavaScript package, I encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p><code>Buffer</code> will never be removed, and probably never even deprecated, but at least the community can slowly move away from it. My hope is that the Node.js team will at least start discouraging the use of <code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<p>First, familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffers-and-typedarrays">subtle incompatibilities</a> between <code>Uint8Array</code> and <code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<p>I have made the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/uint8array-extras"><code>uint8array-extras</code> package</a> to make the transition easier. Pull requests are welcome for additional utilities.</p>
<p>If your code accepts a <code>Buffer</code> and doesn’t use any <code>Buffer</code>-specific methods, you can simply update your docs and types to <code>Uint8Array</code>. Changing the input type from <code>Buffer</code> to <code>Uint8Array</code> is a non-breaking change since <code>Buffer</code> is an instance of <code>Uint8Array</code>.</p>
<p>Changing the return type from <code>Buffer</code> to <code>Uint8Array</code> is a breaking change, because consumers may use <code>Buffer</code>-specific methods.</p>
<p>If you absolutely need to convert a <code>Uint8Array</code> to a <code>Buffer</code>, you can use <code>Buffer.from(uint8Array)</code>. However, there’s usually a better way.</p>
<p>The primary transition steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all <code>import {Buffer} from 'node:buffer'</code> imports.</li>
<li>Remove all occurrences of the <code>Buffer</code> global.</li>
<li>Stop using <code>Buffer</code>-specific methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<h4 id="why-did-buffer-exist-in-the-first-place">Why did <code>Buffer</code> exist in the first place?</h4>
<p><code>Buffer</code> was created long before <code>Uint8Array</code> existed.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-i-convert-to-and-from-base64-with-uint8array">How can I convert to and from Base64 with <code>Uint8Array</code>?</h4>
<p>You can use my <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/uint8array-extras"><code>uint8array-extras</code> package</a> for now. It will most likely eventually be <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-base64/issues">supported natively</a> in JavaScript.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-handle-nodejs-apis-that-return-a-buffer-like-the-fs-methods">How do I handle Node.js APIs that return a <code>Buffer</code>, like the <code>fs</code> methods?</h4>
<p>Since <code>Buffer</code> is a subclass of <code>Uint8Array</code> you can just treat it like a <code>Uint8Array</code>. Just make sure you don’t use any Buffer-specific.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<h4 id="javascript">JavaScript</h4>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span><span>+</span>import {stringToBase64} from 'uint8array-extras';</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span><span>-</span>Buffer.from(string).toString('base64');</span></span>
<span><span><span>+</span>stringToBase64(string);</span></span></code></pre>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span> import crypto from 'node:crypto';</span></span>
<span><span><span>-</span>import {Buffer} from 'node:buffer';</span></span>
<span><span><span>+</span>import {isUint8Array} from 'uint8array-extras';</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span> export default function hash(data) {</span></span>
<span><span><span>-</span>	if (!(typeof data === 'string' || Buffer.isBuffer(data))) {</span></span>
<span><span><span>+</span>	if (!(typeof data === 'string' || isUint8Array(data))) {</span></span>
<span><span> 		throw new TypeError('Incorrect type.');</span></span>
<span><span> 	}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span> 	return crypto.createHash('md5').update(data).digest('hex');</span></span>
<span><span> }</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Most Node.js APIs accept <code>Uint8Array</code> too, so no extra work was required. Ideally, this code should also transition to <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/webcrypto.html">Web Crypto</a>, but that’s not relevant to this example.</p>
<h5 id="typescript">TypeScript</h5>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span><span>-</span>import {Buffer} from 'node:buffer';</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span><span>-</span>export function getSize(input: string | Buffer): number { … }</span></span>
<span><span><span>+</span>export function getSize(input: string | Uint8Array): number { … }</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
<p>I recommend enforcing <code>Uint8Array</code> over <code>Buffer</code> with linting.</p>
<p>Add this to your ESLint config:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>'no-restricted-globals'</span><span>: [</span></span>
<span><span>		</span><span>'error'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>		{</span></span>
<span><span>			name: </span><span>'Buffer'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>			message: </span><span>'Use Uint8Array instead.'</span></span>
<span><span>		}</span></span>
<span><span>	],</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>'no-restricted-imports'</span><span>: [</span></span>
<span><span>		</span><span>'error'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>		{</span></span>
<span><span>			name: </span><span>'buffer'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>			message: </span><span>'Use Uint8Array instead.'</span></span>
<span><span>		},</span></span>
<span><span>		{</span></span>
<span><span>			name: </span><span>'node:buffer'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>			message: </span><span>'Use Uint8Array instead.'</span></span>
<span><span>		}</span></span>
<span><span>	]</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And if you use TypeScript, add this:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>'@typescript-eslint/ban-types'</span><span>: [</span></span>
<span><span>		</span><span>'error'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>		{</span></span>
<span><span>			types: {</span></span>
<span><span>				Buffer: {</span></span>
<span><span>					message: </span><span>'Use Uint8Array instead.'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>					suggest: [</span></span>
<span><span>						</span><span>'Uint8Array'</span></span>
<span><span>					]</span></span>
<span><span>				}</span></span>
<span><span>			}</span></span>
<span><span>		}</span></span>
<span><span>	]</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you use <a href="https://github.com/xojs/xo">XO</a>, it will soon come with this config by default.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-help">How Can I Help?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/41588">Voice your support</a> for Node.js using <code>Uint8Array</code> for new APIs.</p>
<p>Help me move <a href="https://github.com/search?q=owner%3Asindresorhus+%22node%3Abuffer%22&amp;type=code">my packages</a> to <code>Uint8Array</code>. Pick one and give it a go.</p>
<p>Help us make a <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/issues/1808">lint rule</a> to prevent the use of <code>Buffer</code> methods.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p><code>Uint8Array</code> (or rather <code>TypedArray</code>) need more utility methods!</p>
<p>For example, there is currently no good built-in way to convert a <code>Uint8Array</code> to Base64 or Hex. Although, it looks like this is <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-base64">most likely coming</a>.</p>
<p>Consider proposing missing bits to <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals">TC39</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>Let’s make the JavaScript package ecosystem more cross-platform. Thanks for reading.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content--about-revert" dir="auto"><a href="#-about-revert">⭐ About Revert</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Revert makes it incredibly easy to build integrations with any third party API such as</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Go-to-market tools like CRMs (Salesforce, Hubspot).</li>
<li>Communication tools (Slack, MS Teams)</li>
<li>Ticketing tools like (Jira, Asana)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We believe an <strong>open source unified API</strong> enables us to cover the long tail of third party APIs while empowering engineers to customise the integration code we offer out of the box. This way engineers can use us over building everything from scratch.</p>

    <h2>
    <a href="#Unified-Versus-Split-Diff"><span>Unified Versus Split Diff</span> <time datetime="2023-10-23">Oct 23, 2023</time></a>
    </h2>
<p><span>Which is better for code reviews, a unified diff or a split diff?</span></p>
<p><span>A split diff looks like this for me:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277481233-026508cf-47ed-4897-934a-fee18b708553.png">
</figure>
<p><span>And this is a unified one:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277481510-12ee62af-0305-412b-9f37-57a37744751b.png">
</figure>
<p><span>If the changes are simple and small, both views are good. But for larger, more complex changes</span>
<span>neither works for me.</span></p>
<p><span>For a large change, I don</span>’<span>t want to do a </span>“<span>diff review</span>”<span>, I want to do a proper code review of a</span>
<span>codebase at a particular instant in time, paying specific attention to the recently changed areas,</span>
<span>but mostly just doing general review, as if I am writing the code. I need to run tests, use goto</span>
<span>definition and other editor navigation features, apply local changes to check if some things could</span>
<span>have been written differently, look at the wider context to notice things that </span><em><span>should</span></em><span> have been</span>
<span>changed, and in general notice anything that might be not quite right with the codebase,</span>
<span>irrespective of the historical path to the current state of the code.</span></p>
<p><span>So, for me, the ideal diff view would look rather like this:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277485436-5e9ff9d5-325b-4e2c-8285-4acb6a8c088b.png">
</figure>
<p><span>On the left, the current state of the code (which is also the on-disk state), with changes subtly</span>
<span>highlighted in the margins. On the right, the unified diff for the portion of the codebase currently</span>
<span>visible on the left.</span></p>
<p><span>Sadly, this format of review isn</span>’<span>t well supported by the tools </span>—<span> everyone seems to be happy</span>
<span>reviewing diffs, rather than the actual code?</span></p>
<p><span>I have a low-tech and pretty inefficient workflow for this style of review. A </span><a href="https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/master/xtool/src/gpr.rs"><code>gpr</code>
<span>script</span></a><span> for checking out a pull</span>
<span>request locally:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>$</span> gpr 1234 --review</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Internally, it does roughly</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>$</span> git fetch unstream refs/pull/1234/head</span>
<span><span>$</span> git switch --detach FETCH_HEAD</span>
<span><span>$</span> git reset $(git merge-base HEAD main)</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The last line is the key </span>—<span> it erases all the commits from the pull request, but keeps all of the</span>
<span>changes. This lets me abuse my workflow for staging&amp;committing to do a code review </span>—
<a href="https://github.com/kahole/edamagit"><span>edamagit</span></a><span> shows the list of changed files, I get </span>“<span>go to</span>
<span>next/previous change</span>”<span> shortcuts in the editor, I can even use the staging area to mark hunks I have</span>
<span>reviewed.</span></p>
<p><span>The only thing I </span><em><span>don</span>’<span>t</span></em><span> get is automatic synchronization between magit status buffer, and the file</span>
<span>that</span>’<span>s currently open in the editor. That is, to view the current file and the diff on the side, I</span>
<span>have to manually open the diff and scroll it to the point I am currently looking at.</span></p>
<p><span>I wish it was easier to get this close to the code without building custom ad-hoc tools!</span></p>

<p>The update, which took almost 18 hours to complete, was transmitted to help Voyager 2 avoid the same problem that its sibling, <a href="https://bgr.com/tag/voyager-1/">Voyager 1</a>, experienced last year. Back in 2022, NASA reported issues with <a href="https://bgr.com/science/a-bizarre-mystery-surrounding-nasa-voyager-1-probe-is-being-investigated/">readings from Voyager 1’s AACS</a>, which stands for attitude articular and control system. The telemetry data that NASA was getting didn’t make sense, and NASA was concerned it had lost the probe forever.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the issue doesn’t seem to have caused any lasting issues with Voyager 1, but NASA wants to avoid the same thing happening with Voyager 2, so it just sent out this huge software update. The patch is essentially an insurance policy that NASA hopes will project the probe for future interstellar space exploration.</p>

<p>Because the space probe is so far away, the data it sends back is exceptionally unique and important. And, since it took so long to send the update, NASA scientists are carrying out a readout of the AACS memory to ensure that it is in the right place for the update. If there aren’t any issues, it will trigger the Voyager 2 update on October 28.</p>
<p>Considering <a href="https://bgr.com/science/voyager-2-signal-reestablished-after-nasa-shouted-into-the-cosmos/">NASA lost contact with Voyager 2</a> briefly earlier this year, the test has many people on the edge of their seats, waiting to see where things go.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-team-focuses-on-software-patch-thrusters">NASA plans</a> to use Voyager 2 as a testbed for the update. If all goes according to plan, it will also send the patch to Voyager 1, which is currently more than 15 billion miles away from Earth, thus making its data even more valuable than that of Voyager 2. </p>
<p>The space agency says it is also allowing both probes to turn more before reorienting them in an attempt to slow the build-up of propellant residue in the fuel lines. Either way, both probes will hopefully get the update, allowing them to run for several more years before NASA has to worry about either of them giving out.</p>

<!-- cache hit 1090:single/related:4f6936a0faae1fbdbb0ed14e7e27b054 --><!-- empty -->
<p>1Password, a password manager used by millions of people and more than 100,000 businesses, said it detected suspicious activity on a company account provided by Okta, the identity and authentication service that disclosed a breach on Friday.</p>
<p>“On September 29, we detected suspicious activity on our Okta instance that we use to manage our employee-facing apps,” 1Password CTO Pedro Canahuati wrote in an email. “We immediately terminated the activity, investigated, and found no compromise of user data or other sensitive systems, either employee-facing or user-facing.”</p>
<p>Since then, Canahuati said, his company had been working with Okta to determine the means that the unknown attacker used to access the account. On Friday, investigators confirmed it resulted from a breach Okta reported hitting its customer support management system.</p>
<p>Okta said then that a threat actor <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/okta-says-hackers-breached-its-support-system-and-viewed-customer-files/">gained unauthorized access</a> to its customer support case management system and, from there, viewed files uploaded by some Okta customers. The files the threat actor obtained in the Okta compromise comprised HTTP archive, or HAR, files, which Okta support personnel use to replicate customer browser activity during troubleshooting sessions. Among the sensitive information they store are authentication cookies and session tokens, which malicious actors can use to impersonate valid users.
</p><p>Security firm BeyondTrust said it discovered the intrusion after an attacker used valid authentication cookies in an attempt to access its Okta account. The attacker could perform “a few confined actions,” but ultimately, BeyondTrust access policy controls stopped the activity and blocked all access to the account. 1Password now becomes the second known Okta customer to be targeted in a follow-on attack.</p>
<p>Monday’s statement from 1Password provided no further details about the incident, and representatives didn’t respond to questions. A report dated October 18 and shared on an internal 1Password Notion workspace said the threat actor obtained a HAR file a company IT employee had created when recently engaging with Okta support. The file contained a record of all traffic between the 1Password employee’s browser and Okta servers, including session cookies.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>1Password representatives didn’t respond to a request to confirm the document's authenticity, which was provided in both text and screenshots by an anonymous 1Password employee.</p>
<p>According to the report, the attacker also accessed 1Password’s Okta tenant. Okta customers use these tenants to manage the system access and system privileges assigned to various employees, partners, or customers. The threat actor also managed to view group assignments in 1Password’s Okta tenant and perform other actions, none of which resulted in entries in event logs. While logged in, the threat actor updated what’s known as an IDP (identity provider), used to authenticate to a production environment provided by Google.</p>
<p>1Password’s IT team learned of the access on September 29 when team members received an unexpected email suggesting one of them had requested a list of 1Password users with admin rights to the Okta tenant. Team members recognized no authorized employee had made the request and alerted the company’s security response team. Since the incident came to light, 1Password has also changed the configuration settings for its Okta tenant, including denying logins from non-Okta identity providers.</p>
<p>A summary of the actions the attacker took are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempted to access the IT employee’s Okta dashboard but was blocked</li>
<li>Updated an existing IDP tied to 1Password’s production Google environment</li>
<li>Activated the IDP</li>
<li>Requested a report of administrative users</li>
</ul>
<p>On October 2, three days following the event, the attackers logged back into 1Password’s Okta tenant and tried to use the Google IDP they had previously enabled. The actor was unsuccessful because the IDP had been removed. Both the earlier and subsequent accesses came from a server provided by cloud host LeaseWeb in the US and used a version of Chrome on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>The Okta breach is one of a series of attacks in recent years on large companies that provide software or services to large numbers of customers. After gaining entry to the provider, attackers use their position in follow-on attacks targeting the customers. It is likely that more Okta customers will be identified in the weeks to come.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-codehighlight-element="code" fs-toc-element="contents" fs-toc-offsettop="6rem" fs-toc-hideurlhash="true" fs-codehighlight-theme="base16/phd"><h2>What is Generative AI?</h2><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b2da25475be2a2a5f6aac_d7a7a360.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Example of background AI generated images</figcaption></figure><p>Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating new content that has not been explicitly programmed into the system. This is achieved by using machine learning algorithms to analyze and learn from large datasets, and then using that knowledge to create new content such as images, music, text, or even video.</p><p>Generative AI models are typically based on neural networks that use probabilistic methods to generate content that is similar to the training data, but not identical. For example, a generative AI model trained on a dataset of bird images might be able to generate new images of birds that have never been seen before.</p><h2>Why is Generative AI Useful?</h2><p>Generative AI has the potential to automate and streamline many tasks and processes, improve the quality and diversity of content, and provide new insights and predictions that can help individuals and organizations make better decisions. Specifically, it can be used in a variety of ways, such as:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Content Creation</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create new and original content, such as images, music, and text, that can be used in various industries, such as advertising, marketing, and entertainment.</li><li><strong>Data Augmentation</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create new data samples that are similar to existing data, which can be used to train machine learning models and improve their performance.</li><li><strong>Simulation</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create simulated environments and scenarios that can be used to test and evaluate new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and robots.</li><li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create personalized content, such as product recommendations and news articles, based on individual user preferences and behaviour.</li><li><strong>Predictive Analysis</strong>: Generative AI can be used to generate predictions and insights based on large datasets, such as predicting stock prices or identifying potential health risks.</li></ol><h2>What Images Can You Expect to Generate?</h2><p>Generative AI models excel at generating varying images in which there is a prominent object in the foreground and contextualized background. In these conditions, the models are capable of seamlessly replacing objects or backgrounds, changing graphic styles, or creating similar variations on images. This can allow users to easily create high quality art, create production quality product advertisement photos, or even augment and populate computer vision datasets by replacing backgrounds or foreground objects to cover edge cases.</p><h2>What are Some Generative AI Methods?</h2><p>There are many methods to generate data, ranging from more traditional cut-and-paste methods to from-scratch generation using state-of-the-art probabilistic models.</p><h4>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h4><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of generative AI technique that uses a system of two neural networks to generate new content. The first network, called the generator, creates new samples, such as images or text, from a random noise signal. The second network, called the discriminator, evaluates whether the generated samples are similar enough to the training data.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b302a33d628c34a69a920_7de59d54.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>GAN architecture diagram (<a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/gan_structure" target="_blank">source</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>The generator and discriminator are trained together in a process known as adversarial training. The generator tries to create samples that can fool the discriminator into thinking they are real, while the discriminator tries to correctly classify the generated samples as fake. The result of this process is a generator network that is able to create new samples that are similar to the training data.</p><p>Despite their impressive results, GANs can be challenging to train and can suffer from issues such as mode collapse, where the generator produces a limited set of outputs rather than diverse and unique samples.</p><h4>Stable Diffusion</h4><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b305d23fd983a2c83ee95_4170454c.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Stable Diffusion model architecture diagram (<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/binxuw/classes/machine-learning-scratch/materials/stable-diffusion-scratch">source</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>Stable Diffusion is a variant of the diffusion process, which is a probabilistic model used in statistical physics to describe the behaviour of particles in a fluid. In the context of generative AI, <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release" target="_blank">Stable Diffusion</a> refers to a method that gradually generates an image from a noise signal. The noise signal is passed through a sequence of increasingly complex convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with each network generating a slightly more refined version of the image. This process continues until the final output is generated, which is a high-quality image that is similar to the original training data.</p><p>The Stable Diffusion technique is designed to address some of the limitations of other generative AI techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can be unstable and difficult to train. Stable Diffusion is more stable and can produce high-quality, diverse, and realistic images that are suitable for a wide range of applications.</p><h2>Generating Product Images with Generative AI</h2><p>In this example, we will look at how we can combine certain methods together with traditional Computer Vision algorithms to generate more pristine images. The task for this example will be background augmentation for single objects, which can be used for a variety of applications such as object identification and product placement.</p><p>The three key ingredients for convincing and sufficiently varied images are:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Object Transform and Color Augmentations</strong>: creates more variation of the object to widen the variety of environments and scenarios it can be placed in.</li><li><strong>Background In-Painting</strong>: creates environmental variation in the background.</li><li><strong>Object In-Painting</strong>: fills in the background completely for a smoother transition between foreground and background.</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b30ca6c21bdbdd8611f1f_e34a2ec3.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>(a) Input image of a bottle of turmeric and ginger gummies (<a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0542/8677/8559/products/Tumeric-and-Ginger-Gummy-Vitamin_a_1200x1200.jpg?v=1621213802" target="_blank">source</a>), and (b) binary mask of the bottle. The object is filled with black pixels which are preserved during the in-painting process, while the remaining parts of the image with white pixels will be regenerated by Stable Diffusion.</figcaption></figure><p>All experiments below are run on a NVIDIA RTX 3080. If you wish to replicate the results or perform your own testing, it is recommended to use a GPU with at least 12GB of VRAM.</p><h4>Stable Diffusion In-Painting</h4><p>The original intent of Stable Diffusion was to generate new images from pure noise. However, one modification that has been gaining attention is the process of in-painting. It is traditionally a computer vision technique used to fill in or restore missing or damaged parts of an image. It involves automatically filling in the missing regions of an image with plausible content, such that the filled-in areas appear visually coherent and seamless with the surrounding areas. By masking certain areas of an image, we can direct Stable Diffusion to modify only the masked areas by iteratively re-noising and then denoising them based on a textual prompt.</p><p>We first need to obtain a segmentation mask of the object, which we can annotate on Datature’s Nexus to obtain a segmentation polygon. We then convert the polygon into a binary mask, where black pixels are preserved and white pixels will be in-painted.</p><div><pre><code>def annotation_to_mask(image, annotation):
   """Converts annotation to binary mask and saves it to disk.


   Args:
       image (np.array): Image to be masked.
       annotation (list):
           Annotation coordinates in the form of [x1, y1, x2, y2, ...].
   """
   annotation = np.array([(int(x), int(y))
                          for x, y in zip(*[iter(annotation)] * 2)])
   mask = np.ones(image.shape[:2], np.float32) * 255
   cv2.fillPoly(mask, [annotation], color=(0, 0, 0))
   cv2.imwrite(f"./mask/{IMAGE_NAME}", mask)</code></pre></div><p>We can then set up the Stable Diffusion pipeline by loading the image, mask, and set various parameters that are listed in the full code. To learn more on how the experimental parameters affect image generation, check out this <a href="https://blog.openart.ai/2023/02/13/the-most-complete-guide-to-stable-diffusion-parameters/" target="_blank">handy guide</a>. The prompt we will be using is “<em>on a table with turmeric and ginger</em>”.</p><div><pre><code># Load Stable Diffusion v2.1 checkpoint

However, there are a few imperfections, most notably that the borders between the object and the background are not pristine. The denoising process can sometimes warp the object which might not be ideal.</p><p>A less noticeable imperfection can be seen in the bottom row of text, which becomes gibberish. Though Stable Diffusion is known to be decent in generating text, especially in StabilityAI’s <a href="https://stability.ai/stablediffusion">latest XL model</a>, the text generation is typically guided by the prompt. In this case where there is existing text, it is not able to accurately reconstruct the text as this semantic information is not retained during the re-noising process. While larger text can be accurately reconstructed to a large degree, smaller text will suffer from being completely unintelligible. This is an issue that increasing the number of inference (denoising) steps to improve image quality and detail cannot solve.</p><h4>Two-Stage Background In-Painting</h4><p>To workaround this issue, we can perform object in-painting as a second stage to generate a pristine background. We then overlay the object (segmented from the original image using the binary mask) on top of the pristine background.</p><div><pre><code>
# Invert the binary mask so that object is in-painted

    out_image, out_image, mask=inverted_mask)

           out_image[i][j][:] = input_image[i][j][:]
       else:
           out_image[i][j][:] = out_background[i][j][:]

</code></pre></div><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b31e3e6c2b20c08bfb064_0af1d71d.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>(a) Output image from Stable Diffusion in-painting with the object masked out, (b) output image of the full background after a second pass through Stable Diffusion, and (c) final image after overlaying the segmented object onto the background.</figcaption></figure><p>The final image is crisper and looks more realistic. This seems to be a potential solution that can be used for image augmentation. However, we note that the object is still static. Its dimensions, location, and orientation are unchanged. This limits the amount of variation in the resulting generated dataset, and also limits Stable Diffusion in its generative power.</p><p>A solution to this is to perform traditional augmentations to the original image before it is fed into the Stable Diffusion pipeline. A popular library to do this is <a href="https://albumentations.ai/" target="_blank">Albumentations</a>, which efficiently implements a rich variety of image transform operations that are optimized for performance. It is widely used both in industry and in deep learning research.</p><div><pre><code>

   A.ShiftScaleRotate(shift_limit=0.3,
                      scale_limit=[-0.4, -0.3],

                      mask_value=[255, 255, 255])
])

</code></pre></div><p>A sample transformation is shown by shifting, scaling, and rotating the object with varying parameters. When the transformed image is fed into the Stable Diffusion pipeline, we obtain the following images:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b35988a08e9c914fc737d_fda0e507.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Output images after transformations and in-painting.</figcaption></figure><p>Further testing with other input images yields the following results:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b35988a08e9c914fc73f4_e6b5802e.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>(a) Input image of a pink luggage (<a href="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gh-072522-away-luggage-1658760915.png?crop=0.651xw:1.00xh;0.175xw,0&amp;resize=1200:*">source</a>), and (b) binary mask of the pink luggage.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b3599a725242fc8b4f2f9_345d9441.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Output images with prompt: “<em>luggage on the sidewalk</em>”.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b35992bb254ea3ad44b68_87c9a5e9.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Output images with prompt: “<em>luggage in a train station</em>”.</figcaption></figure><p>The benefit of using transformation augmentations is that segmentation masks already exist for the objects, as the same transformations can be easily applied to the original mask.</p><h4>Colour Augmentation with InstructPix2Pix</h4><p>To create even more variation, we can utilize InstructPix2Pix to modify other aspects of the object. InstructPix2Pix is a conditional diffusion method for editing images from human instructions that combines the powers of Stable Diffusion and GPT-3. It is currently not robust enough to make drastic modifications to images without losing semantic information, hence our example will simply be to modify the colour of an object.</p><div><pre><code>

As pointed out by a fellow HackerNews reader, we clearly forgot to include our code snippet for ControlNet in the article.</blockquote><p>ControlNet can be similarly utilized If you wish to have some control over what is being generated, or perform some style transfers to your objects and backgrounds. Any input images can first be preprocessed to generate a Canny edge map, which is then fed into the ControlNet pipeline for directed generation. Further preprocessing may be needed depending on your input image and the level of detail desired for the image generation to be visually realistic.</p><div><pre><code>

There is no universal solution that can reliably work on custom datasets and there is insufficient fine-grained control over how images can be specifically augmented.</p><p>The generation is also not fully automatic since there is a lot of prompt engineering and cherry picking involved, which requires a lot of user intervention and a deeper understanding of the nature of the dataset. Due to the compute power and time necessary to generate these images, it would be impractical to scale up to large dataset generation without investing heavily in dedicated hardware.</p><div>

<p id="subtitle">A protocol for secure browser sessions on the World Wide Web</p>

<p id="date">Last update: <time datetime="2023-06-14">2023-06-14</time></p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>This is a work in progress, based on my talk at Identiverse 2023. It’s intended
to be a starting point for discussion, not a complete or unambiguous spec.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>WebSession is a proposed replacement for cookies when establishing and
maintaining user sessions in a Web browser. Its goals are to be more secure,
offer more user control, and protect privacy better than cookies, while
remaining fast and easy to implement.</p>
<p>WebSession is separate from authentication protocols like usernames and
passwords, <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a>, and <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>. Those <em>prove</em> who you are;
WebSession is a way for the server to <em>remember</em> who you are across multiple
HTTP requests. WebSession also allows for existing unauthenticated use cases
supported by cookies, where you may not have a user account (or want to log
in), but still need to maintain state across requests. Examples include
anonymous shopping carts and ‘guest’ checkout, personalization without creating
a user account, A/B testing, analytics, and more.</p>
<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-cookies">What’s wrong with cookies?<a href="#whats-wrong-with-cookies" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="security">Security<a href="#security" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Currently when you log into a website, the server generates a unique session
ID and stores it in your browser as a <strong>cookie</strong>. On every subsequent request,
your browser sends this cookie to the server to prove that it’s you making the
request. This cookie, whether a <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a> or opaque session identifier, is called
a <strong>bearer token</strong>, because it grants the holder the right to skip a full
authentication ceremony on every request, and no additional ‘proof’ is required
other than knowledge of the token.</p>
<p>If someone steals this cookie, they can impersonate you. Stolen cookie attacks
have happened in the past <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvkqb/how-ea-games-was-hacked-slack">with disastrous effect</a>, and there
is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/operation-cookie-monster-international-police-action-seizes-dark-web-market-2023-04-05/">a thriving trade in stolen cookies on the dark web</a>.</p>
<p>Cookies have a large surface area of attack, and little room for error. Secure
use of cookies for tracking a browser session includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the <code>Secure</code> flag so they are only sent over secure connections;</li>
<li>Setting the <code>SameSite</code> flag to prevent <abbr title="Cross-Site Request
  Forgery">CSRF</abbr> attacks;</li>
<li>Setting the <code>HttpOnly</code> flag to stop them from being read in JavaScript and/or
  stolen in <abbr title="Cross-Site Scripting">XSS</abbr> attacks;</li>
<li>Setting a reasonable expiry, and enforcing it on the server;</li>
<li>Correctly scoping the domain and path so that only the endpoints that are
  authorized to use the session receive the session cookie;</li>
<li>Ensuring your server does not have any application code that may
  inadvertently reflect a Cookie header back to a client (which would break the
  protection given by <code>HttpOnly</code>);</li>
<li>Ensuring cookies are not inadvertently logged or stored unsafely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with all of these, a compromised client, an unsecured application log, or
an eavesdropper on the connection after TLS termination could result in a
cookie being stolen. It is difficult to distinguish an attacker using a stolen
cookie from the legitimate user to whom it was originally issued.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-user-control-and-user-experience">Privacy, User Control, and User Experience<a href="#privacy-user-control-and-user-experience" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cookies were invented in 1994, and started out as a generic
mechanism for persistent key-value state which were quickly
adopted to provide authentication too. However as an ad hoc K/V
store, there is nothing reliably distinguishing ‘essential’
(i.e. authentication) cookies from analytics, tracking,
advertising, or preference cookies. As a result of increasingly
strict privacy laws across the world, users are now beset with
<a href="https://cookieinformation.com/cookie-banner/">cookie banners</a> across the Web, with no standard way to
either consent to or reject non-essential cookies.</p>
<p>We need a protocol that is dedicated to session maintenance, that gives control
back to the user either through prior browser configuration or a
consent-on-first-visit model. Browsers could use system-native, accessible UIs
that don’t interrupt content loading or page layout.</p>
<p>It’s also very common that a website wants credentials to be cleared when the
user is inactive for a certain amount of time. This is important for sensitive
applications such as banking and healthcare. Currently there’s no way to
enforce that a cookie is cleared on device lock or user inactivity,
<em>especially</em> because security requires that such cookies not be visible to
JavaScript. A native session management solution should be able to request that
the browser clear a session in the case of device lock, the user navigating
away, etc.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-websession-solve-these-problems">How would WebSession solve these problems?<a href="#how-would-websession-solve-these-problems" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="security_1">Security<a href="#security_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>WebSession does not rely on bearer tokens. Instead, the browser and server
agree on a shared secret at the beginning of the session, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman
key exchange (DHKE)</a>. This secret is never sent over the network, and it
cannot be computed by an eavesdropper, even with full observation of requests
and responses, thanks to the security guarantees of DHKE.</p>
<p>For every request, the browser generates a unique string (aka a ‘nonce’), which
it <em>signs</em> with the shared secret. The nonce and signature are sent with the
request, and the server can then verify that signature, while also checking to
make sure that nonce has not been used before.</p>
<p>WebSession does not treat security as optional, so there are no flags like
<code>Secure</code>, <code>SameSite</code>, or <code>HttpOnly</code> to forget. An endpoint that inadvertently
reflects headers would be useless if the server is tracking nonces properly. A
server-side expiry mechanism is still needed, and domain/path scoping may be
necessary. Even so, if a ‘bad’ endpoint receives a valid WebSession header, it
is limited to forging a single request, rather than having a reusable session
cookie that may allow an unbounded number of impersonated requests.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy<a href="#privacy" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>WebSession tokens are opaque identifiers, unlinkable back to real-world user
identities. Without extra work, they only identify the browser instance
between requests, not the user.</p>
<p>Because WebSession is dedicated to session maintenance and nothing else, a
client could theoretically reject <em>all</em> cookies on any supporting site, ideally
skipping the jarring cookie banner experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the browser-native integration could include things like a request
to clear a session on inactivity, device lock, navigation away from the page,
etc. This is best done via a browser-integrated, purposeful protocol for
session management rather than ad hoc JavaScript on every site.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-could-websession-provide">What else could WebSession provide?<a href="#what-else-could-websession-provide" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Typically a browser session is identified with a particular human user, and one
of the most exciting new standards on the web today is <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a>, which
allows for cryptographically secure user verification. In theory, WebSession
could be extended with options asking the client to use the WebSession derived
secret as the challenge for a WebAuthn assertion. This would provide strong
proof to the server that the session has been established by the authenticated
user, thwarting even active MITM attacks.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-description">Protocol Description<a href="#protocol-description" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="initial-request">Initial Request<a href="#initial-request" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The browser makes a standard GET request to the website. In this case we’ll
assume the URL is <code>https://example.com/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="server-challenge">Server Challenge<a href="#server-challenge" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The server generates and stores an ephemeral keypair for DHKE, hereby referred
to as <code>Spub</code> and <code>Spriv</code>. This will most likely be a point on the NIST P-256 or
X25519 elliptic curves.</p>
<p>The server then responds to the initial request with a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code>
header with the auth scheme <code>WebSession</code>, followed by a <strong>challenge</strong> as
unpadded <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5">base64url</a>-encoded <a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a>. These parameters include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alg</code>: an indication of the DHKE algorithm and other parameters.
  For example:</li>
<li><code>P256</code>, <code>P384</code>, <code>P521</code> etc.: ECDH over the corresponding NIST prime curves;</li>
<li><code>X25519</code>, <code>X448</code>: ECDH over Curve25519 and Curve448.
  At a minimum, implementations should support <code>P256</code> and <code>X25519</code>, since these
  are compact, widely available, and provide 128 bits of security.</li>
<li><code>exp</code>: the session expiry, as a UNIX timestamp (seconds since the epoch in
  UTC);</li>
<li><code>h</code>: which hashing algorithm to use for signatures. Must be one of <code>SHA-256</code>,
  <code>SHA-384</code>, or <code>SHA-512</code>.</li>
<li><code>s</code>: the encoding of <code>Spub</code>, specific to <code>alg</code>. Weierstrass curves like
  the NIST prime curves should use the compressed point format; Curve25519 and
  Curve448 points are usually only expressed in compressed form anyway. Since
  we’re using CBOR, these can be included in the object as a raw byte string.</li>
<li>Any as-yet undefined options.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example">Example<a href="#example" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>

<h3 id="client-response">Client Response<a href="#client-response" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>At this point the browser can decide whether to initiate a session or not,
either based on interactive user feedback, previous behavior, or prior
configuration. If no session is desired, the client simply doesn’t respond to
the challenge, and continues making requests as usual. The rest of this
document assumes a session is desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>The client generates its own keypair, scoped to the origin (hereafter <code>Cpub</code>
  and <code>Cpriv</code>);</li>
<li>It derives a shared secret, using DH between <code>Spub</code> and <code>Cpriv</code>, and then
  applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF">HKDF</a> on the resulting bytes (with the hashing algorithm <code>h</code>
  requested by the server earlier);</li>
<li>It chooses a 32-byte secure random nonce;</li>
<li>It builds a token <strong>body</strong> as a CBOR object containing:</li>
<li><code>s</code>: the server public key;</li>
<li><code>c</code>: the client public key;</li>
<li><code>o</code>: the origin;</li>
<li><code>n</code>: the nonce.</li>
<li>It produces a <strong>signature</strong> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a>ing the token body using the shared secret
  as the key;</li>
<li>Finally, it constructs an ASCII token by unpadded base64url-encoding the
  signature and body and then concatenating them with a ‘.’ character.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Python pseudocode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>c_pub</span><span>,</span> <span>c_priv</span> <span>=</span> <span>gen_keypair</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>This token is then included in the next client request in the <code>Authorization</code>
header, with an auth scheme of <code>WebSession</code>. For example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>GET / HTTP/1.1

</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="server-validation">Server Validation<a href="#server-validation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The server validates an incoming request by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Splitting the token signature and body at the ‘.’ character and base64url-decoding them;</li>
<li>CBOR-parsing the body to extract <code>Cpub</code>, <code>Spub</code>, <code>origin</code> and <code>nonce</code>;</li>
<li>Looking up the corresponding <code>Spriv</code> for the session;</li>
<li>Deriving the same shared secret, using <code>Cpub</code> and <code>Spriv</code> and HKDF;</li>
<li>The shared secret may be cached for subsequent requests against the same
    <code>Spub</code> and <code>Spriv</code>; if it is not cached, the server MUST validate that the
    included <code>Cpub</code> does not change across requests.</li>
<li>Validating that the nonce has not been used already for this session.
  <strong>Important:</strong> at this point, the nonce should be added to the ‘seen’ set,
  because nonces should be invalidated whether the signature validation passes
  or fails. Failure to do so can allow attackers to brute-force a valid
  signature for a single nonce.</li>
<li>(Recommended) validating the origin is as expected;</li>
<li>Computing the HMAC over the provided token body and checking the signature.
  <strong>Note</strong>: it’s important to use a constant-time comparison function for the
  signature checking. Many crypto libraries have a ‘verify’ function which will
  do this, rather than computing the signature as a string and checking for
  equality.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/10/23/how-does-macos-manage-virtual-cores-on-apple-silicon/">https://eclecticlight.co/2023/10/23/how-does-macos-manage-virtual-cores-on-apple-silicon/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37991295">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-first_letter="O">
		<p>One of the most distinctive features of Apple silicon chips is that they have two types of CPU core, E (Efficiency) cores that are energy efficient but slower than the P (Performance) cores, which normally run much of the code in the apps we use. Apps don’t decide directly which cores they will be run on, that’s a privilege of macOS, but they register their interest by setting a Quality of Service, or QoS, which is then taken into account when they’re scheduled to run. With the introduction of <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/10/18/how-game-mode-manages-cpu-and-gpu/">Game Mode</a> in Sonoma, CPU scheduling can now work differently, with E cores being reserved for the use of games. This article looks at another atypical situation, when running a macOS virtual machine (VM) assigned a set number of virtual cores. How does macOS Sonoma handle that?</p>
<h4>CPU cores</h4>
<p>M-series chips contain different types and numbers of CPU cores, depending on the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base models contain 4 E and 4 P cores; for the M1, those are Icestorm and Firestorm respectively, while the M2 has Blizzard and Avalanche. These are configured in two clusters, one containing the E cores, the other the P cores. Within each cluster, all cores are run at the same frequency, and they share L2 cache.</li>
<li>Pro and Max models contain 2-4 E and 6-8 P cores, in one E cluster and two P clusters, again running at a common frequency within the cluster, and sharing L2 cache.</li>
<li>Ultra models contain 4 (M1) or 8 (M2) E and 16 P cores, their clusters having common frequencies and L2 caches.</li>
</ul>
<p>In broad terms, allocation of executable threads to different cores depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>QoS</strong> assigned to each thread. Those given low values for background and maintenance tasks, including Time Machine backups and Spotlight indexing, are run on E cores, and have no external control to allow their rescheduling to P cores. Those with higher QoS can be run on either P or E cores, and external controls can restrict them to E cores alone, although they’ll normally be run on P cores when they’re available.</li>
<li><strong>Clustering</strong>. Because all cores in a cluster run at the same frequency, it’s more efficient to recruit additional cores in the same cluster, as they’ll already be running at a higher frequency, rather than a core in a different cluster, whose frequency may then need to be increased. Clusters are normally recruited in sequence too: in Macs with two P clusters, threads are normally run on the first of those (P0), and only when additional cores are required is the second (P1) recruited. Running with a light load, P0 is therefore likely to be more active than other P clusters, which may spend long periods idling.</li>
<li><strong>Order</strong> within a cluster. Although applied more loosely than other principles, there is an observed tendency to recruit cores in order within a cluster. Where the P0 cluster contains cores P2, P3, P4 and P5, threads tend to be loaded onto P2 first, and P5 last. However, running threads are often relocated within a cluster, following which P2 may be left idle, while P5 bears the brunt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thread scheduling and dispatch contains many more subtleties, but those influences normally dominate what you see in practice.</p>
<h4>Virtual CPU cores</h4>
<p>Under macOS lightweight virtualisation, virtual machines (VMs) are allocated a number of virtual CPU cores, all of which are the same type, equivalent to a P core. There is thus no option to allocate threads running in the VM to E cores on the host. This is illustrated in the following examples shown in Activity Monitor’s CPU History window.</p>

<p>Two different loads were applied to the M1 Max shown here: the two long peaks seen on the E cores were floating-point threads at a QoS of 9 for a background task, while the shorter peaks on four P cores were the same threads at a QoS of 33 for priority user tasks.</p>

<p>When the same sequence was run on a VM with 4 virtual CPU cores, the QoS made no difference to the performance or core allocation seen in the VM.</p>

<p>On the host, both thread loads were run similarly on the first cluster of P cores. This might suggest that the host simply hands over the cluster of P cores to be scheduled and dispatched by the VM. If you rely on what you’re shown in Activity Monitor, you could be tempted to reach that conclusion.</p>
<h4>Methods</h4>
<p>To assess core allocation for VMs, I used a Mac Studio M1 Max running Sonoma 14.0. A Sonoma 14.0 VM was built using Viable, and run during tests using that virtualisation app. Test loads were applied from the VM using my app AsmAttic, each thread running 5 x 10^8 tight loops of purposeless assembly code performing floating point arithmetic using registers alone. I detailed <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/11/26/how-can-you-compare-the-performance-of-m1-chips-2-core-allocation/">this here</a>. Each thread typically takes about 3.2 seconds to complete, and serves here as an in-core load, not a benchmark. During each of those runs, <code>powermetrics</code> was run on the host to log <code>cpu_power</code> measurements over 0.1 second sampling periods. Frequency and active residency for all the cores was then extracted and analysed using DataGraph. Test runs included the same VM configured with 3 and 4 virtual cores, and with 1-6 threads, all at a QoS of 33.</p>
<h4>Single threads</h4>

<p>Running a single thread on three or four virtual cores resulted in the expected rapid change in P0 cluster frequency (above), and in active residency (percentage of available processor cycles that aren’t idle), shown below. As this gives total active residency for the whole cluster of four cores, its maximum is 400%. Although there are small peaks above the expected 100% for a single thread, those were probably threads from other processes.</p>

<h4>Multiple threads</h4>
<p>As the number of threads run on the VM increases, so the number of cores running them rises to the limit imposed by the number of virtual cores. Looking first at the effect on host clusters, these might imply that VM threads are confined to the single P cluster, P0.</p>

<p>This chart shows cluster frequencies for the three clusters in the M1 Max. The test load was applied just after 1 second, and was completed at about 4 seconds, matching the reported elapsed time of about 3.2 seconds. P0 frequency (solid line) rose rapidly to just over 3,000 MHz, and was sustained at that until completion. The other P cluster (P1) was run much of that time at its idle of 600 MHz, with short peaks up to 2,500 MHz. The E cluster was run throughout at about 1,000 MHz, with fewer and smaller peaks.</p>

<p>Here, to enable easier comparison, cluster active residency is shown with a scale maximum of 100% for each of the three clusters. The effect of the load on P0 active residency (solid line) dominates much as it did for frequency, but there are also many smaller and briefer peaks. To unravel what those represent, you need to analyse individual core responses.</p>
<h4>Individual P cores</h4>
<p>A simple starting point is analysing the active residency in P0 by individual core, for a single thread test.</p>
<p><span><img data-attachment-id="75512" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/vm3core1thractresbycore/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png" data-orig-size="1050,850" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vm3core1thrActResByCore" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=940" loading="lazy" src="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=940" alt="vm3core1thrActResByCore" srcset="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png 1050w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=150&amp;h=121 150w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=300&amp;h=243 300w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=768&amp;h=622 768w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=1024&amp;h=829 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px"></span></p>
<p>This bar chart shows just the test period, here as sample number rather than time (each sample representing approximately 0.1 second). Active residency for the first core, P2, is shown in red, P3 in orange, P4 in blue, and P5 in purple. The bulk of the test thread was run on P2 to begin with, swapped over to P4, then brought back to P2 to complete. There are, though, significant contributions made by P3 as well.</p>
<p>Extending this analysis to other thread numbers, and 4 virtual cores, demonstrated that all cores in the P0 were used to run the test threads, which were moved around not infrequently during each test run.</p>
<p><span><img data-attachment-id="75517" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/vm4core4threadpcoresares/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm4core4threadpcoresares.png" data-orig-size="1108,871" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="VM4core4threadPcoresARes" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm4core4threadpcoresares.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm4core4threadpcoresares.png?w=940" loading="lazy" src="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm4core4threadpcoresares.png?w=940" alt="VM4core4threadPcoresARes" srcset="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm4core4threadpcoresares.png 1108w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm4core4threadpcoresares.png?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm4core4threadpcoresares.png?w=300&amp;h=236 300w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm4core4threadpcoresares.png?w=768&amp;h=604 768w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm4core4threadpcoresares.png?w=1024&amp;h=805 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1108px) 100vw, 1108px"></span></p>
<p>It’s only when you look at active residency across all P cores that the picture becomes clear: when the second P cluster is active, it appears to be handling some of the test load. This shows active residency for all eight P cores, when running 4 threads on 4 virtual cores. To maintain the 400% required to complete the threads on time, there are several sample periods in which P6 and P7 take significant load, for example in samples 12 and 27, about 1 and 2.5 seconds into the test.</p>
<p>Core allocation of threads being run on virtual cores thus appears to follow the same general rules as host threads running at high QoS, and shows no particular affinity for clusters or cores. Thus virtualisation isn’t a different mode, as far as core allocation is concerned.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Threads from VM virtual cores are invariably run at high QoS, and are scheduled and dispatched by the host macOS in accordance with its normal rules. Virtualisation doesn’t bring any special core allocation or CPU performance mode.</li>
<li>Those threads are mobile across cores as with any other thread.</li>
<li>There’s no evidence that macOS makes any attempt to allocate virtual cores to physical cores.</li>
<li>Software in a VM has no means of designating that any of its threads should be run at lower QoS, or on host E cores. VMs thus lack energy efficiency and background performance advantages of macOS running on an Apple silicon host.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks" id="incArticle"><p>Modern cars are indeed very smart, though no car is perfect. One enterprising developer decided to make his <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/mazda-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mazda</a> a little smarter through code and share his work with others like him online. Unfortunately, the automaker took issue with his improvements, and hit the project with a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claim, forcing it to be taken down.</p><p>Developer Brandon Rothweiler authored Mazda-specific integrations for Home Assistant, an open-source platform that can be used to run and establish interoperability between a variety of connected devices. Rothweiler's code plugged into Mazda's Application Programming Interface or API, allowing owners to create and share a number of seemingly inoffensive, convenience-minded functions, like checking and alerting fuel levels before a daily commute, or <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/why-the-iphone-15-pros-action-button-doubles-as-the-perfect-car-key-fob" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remotely unlocking and firing up the car</a> when outside temperature drops below a certain threshold, as <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/mazdas-dmca-takedown-kills-a-hobbyists-smart-car-api-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ars Technica</a></em> summed up in its coverage.</p><p>Mazda caught wind, however, and served Home Assistant, GitHub (where the software was hosted), and Rothweiler cease and desist orders, citing a number of infringements. The automaker argued that Rothweiler's work contained code that violated its copyrights; used its "proprietary API information" to create more code; and that the integrations provided functionality identical to what currently exists in Mazda's own mobile apps. <em>The Drive</em> reached out to Mazda to clarify its position on these claims, and will update this story should we learn anything.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">Interior of the Mazda CX-90 SUV. <em>Mazda</em></span></figure><p>Rothweiler promptly pulled his work and told <em>Ars </em>that he was ultimately left with little choice. "My options were to either comply or open myself up to potential legal risk," the developer told the publication. "Even if I believe that what I'm doing is morally correct and legally protected, legal processes still have a financial cost. I can't afford to take on that financial risk for something that I do in my spare time to help others."</p><p>Responses to <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/10/13/removal-of-mazda-connected-services-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home Assistant's own takedown announcement</a>, as well as posts on a <a href="https://www.cx70forum.com/threads/mazda-has-forced-home-assistant-to-remove-their-extremely-useful-mazda-integration.337/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mazda SUV forum</a>, make the owner community's frustration clear. One such user dismayed at the news wrote that the features he had been using for his <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/44641/2023-mazda-cx-60-new-rwd-based-hybrid-suv-platform-debuts-with-323-hp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CX-60</a> "make Home Assistant more useful, save money, and make me happier about my Mazda ownership."</p><p>It's unclear what legal basis Mazda has to order a DMCA takedown, as <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101849#issuecomment-1758780625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one GitHub user highlighted</a> that they weren't able to locate any copyrighted code in Rothweiler's work, and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/reverse-engineering-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> believes that reverse engineering for the purposes of interoperability can qualify as fair use.</p><p>Regardless, maximizing the convenience of connected cars in a manner that doesn't sacrifice the safety or security of those vehicles, or steal software that legally belongs to an automaker is an undeniable facet of car modification in the modern age. In fact, many manufacturers appear to be OK with especially resourceful owners optimizing their cars in this way. Home Assistant's integration library <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#car" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features at least six automakers</a>, including BMW and Volvo, while <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/transportation/tesla-finally-supports-third-party-apps-with-official-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla recently published details</a> of its new, official, open API for third-party developers to employ.</p><p>Carmakers can pretend all they like that <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/all-these-promised-ev-swaps-need-high-voltage-inverters-automakers-step-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrification</a> and ever-more connected vehicles will offer the same degree of room for personalization and independence as cars always have, but until they start backing that up with real action and back down from <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/feds-ok-massachusetts-right-to-repair-law-so-the-state-can-finally-enforce-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their litigious ways</a>, it'll all be insincere.</p></section></div>]]></description>

</p></figure>







<p>In a shocking turn of events, several smartphone manufacturers, including industry giant Samsung, have taken a drastic step that has left customers outraged. These companies have remotely disabled phones purchased through gray markets, effectively holding the users’ data hostage until they buy new phones from official retailers. This unethical practice has raised questions about consumer rights, the role of governments, and the level of control that manufacturers can exert over devices.</p>







<p><strong>Gray Market Phones in Mexico</strong></p>



<p>Many people in countries like Mexico often purchase gray market phones due to economic constraints. These devices are not stolen but are originally intended for other regions. They work perfectly well in their new homes, providing cost-effective alternatives to official store purchases.</p>



<p>However, users of these gray market phones in Mexico started receiving alarming messages on their devices. These messages warned them that their devices would be disabled for not complying with Mexican regulations, and they were urged to buy approved devices. Such messages appeared on phones from various manufacturers, but Samsung was the most aggressive in its approach.</p>











<p><strong>Samsung’s Heavy-Handed Approach</strong></p>



<p>Samsung’s actions were particularly egregious. Not only did they send messages regarding non-compliance with Mexican regulations, but they also remotely disabled users’ phones, rendering them virtually useless. This move was far from the expected outcome – if a device truly posed safety risks, it should have been switched off completely. Instead, Samsung allowed the devices to turn on but denied users access to their data and applications.</p>











<p><strong>Battery Voltage and Charging Safety Claims</strong></p>



<p>To justify their actions, Samsung cited battery voltage and charging safety as the reasons for disabling these devices. They claimed that these devices were approved for correct charging and safe use within Mexico, which was far from the truth. In reality, Samsung uses the same battery voltage in all regions, and they even stopped including chargers in the box, further undermining their own argument.</p>











<p><strong>Environmental Concerns and Manufacturer Greed</strong></p>



<p>Samsung’s dubious explanation is an attempt to greenwash their actions by framing them as environmentally conscious decisions. The reality, however, is that they are using these claims to extract more money from consumers. This is not about safety or the environment; it’s about profit.</p>











<p><strong>Government Response and Consumer Backlash</strong></p>



<p>The Mexican government swiftly responded to these unethical actions, siding with consumers’ rights. On October 19, the Federal Consumer Protection Agency (PROFECO) and the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT) issued a suspension against manufacturers who had disabled these mobile devices, as they had violated consumer rights by blocking imported phones. Motorola and Samsung, the main culprits, had to cease their actions immediately and issued statements agreeing to cooperate with the Mexican government to find a solution.</p>











<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>This incident serves as a wake-up call for consumers and highlights the importance of protecting our digital rights. Manufacturers should not have the power to remotely disable devices that consumers have legitimately purchased. It’s a gross violation of trust, privacy, and consumer rights.</p>



<p>While some companies like Xiaomi opted for a more user-friendly approach by sending messages but not disabling devices, others like Samsung resorted to extreme measures, leaving users stranded with locked devices. This raises important questions about who controls the devices we own and how they can be used against us.</p>



<p>As consumers, it’s essential to remain vigilant, advocate for our rights, and support government agencies that stand up against unethical practices. In this case, the Mexican government’s swift response demonstrated the power of collective action in safeguarding consumer rights. Samsung and other manufacturers must be held accountable for their actions, and consumers should be cautious when dealing with companies that prioritize profit over ethical conduct.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/github-stars-black-market-coders-cheat/">https://www.wired.com/story/github-stars-black-market-coders-cheat/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37990338">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The index is a good predictor of whether a company will raise a round, says Konstantin Vinogradov, a general partner at Runa. Around a third of all the companies listed in the index since its <a data-offer-url="https://runacap.com/ross-index/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://runacap.com/ross-index/&quot;}" href="https://runacap.com/ross-index/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">launch in 2020</a> have raised subsequent rounds within the next 12 months, he says.</p><p>Over time, metrics can invalidate themselves, says Stuart Geiger, an assistant professor at UC San Diego. He says two “laws” attributed to social scientists sum up why: The more a metric is used in decisionmaking, the more it will be manipulated (<a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Campbell’s law</a>), and a metric that becomes a target ceases to be useful (<a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Goodhart’s law</a>).</p><p>The line between smart strategy and cheating can be blurry. “If a company becomes number one on Product Hunt, they put it on their website, then maybe it will increase their conversion rate for customers,” says Vinogradov. “Is it just winning the game? Or is it a business-driven, reasonable strategy?”</p><p>Kevin Zhang, a former venture investor now building his own startup, says GitHub stars have seemed to become a target for entrepreneurs looking to impress. “I started noticing that founders were putting more star growth on their decks,” he says. “That always gives you a little bit of suspicion right? Oh, maybe it’s a little bit gamed.”</p><p>But Zhang and other investors say that while gaming a metric like stars might help a startup get a first meeting with VCs, it’s unlikely to get them a second. Investor perspectives on GitHub metrics have changed in recent years as a result of gamification and an increased understanding of the open source market, Zhang says. Good GitHub engagement is one promising signal, but it's not a bulletproof sign of success, Zhang, Vinogradov, and Aiyagari all say, with information on the founding team, market, and many other data points all considered before making an investment.</p><p>Cryptocurrency Preferred</p><p><a data-offer-url="https://baddhi.shop/shop/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://baddhi.shop/shop/&quot;}" href="https://baddhi.shop/shop/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Baddhi Shop</a>, an online store offering inauthentic metrics, rolled out its GitHub services earlier this year. It also sells Product Hunt upvotes, as well as upvotes, followers, and views on Kaggle. When WIRED sent messages to the LinkedIn account of the site’s founder, Naga Durgarao Baddhi, responses came back claiming the business was aboveboard.</p><p>When an order comes in for GitHub stars or another metric, a team of 11 get clicking, “from different cloud devices,” Baddhi said, adding that this wasn’t spam because the shop respects each website's terms of service. GitHub is not the most popular metric-cheating offering, Baddhi added. Discord, a chat room service popular with crypto projects, gets daily purchases, and metrics for 10 other services are also popular, Baddhi says. Kellyn Slone, a spokesperson for Discord, says creating or selling fake accounts violates its terms of service, and it takes action in response, including removing users from the service.</p></div></div>]]></description>
