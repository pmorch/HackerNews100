With artificial intelligence, we can see its trajectory shifting from a tool to a utility: from something people use to something they can put to work. If 2024 was about laying the multimodal foundations for this era, 2025 was the year AI began to really think, act and explore the world alongside us. With quantum computing, we made progress towards real-world applications. And across the board, we helped turn research into reality, with more capable and useful products and tools making a positive impact on people's lives today.</p><p data-block-key="2qvrh">Here’s a look back at some of the breakthroughs, products and scientific milestones that defined the work of Google, Google DeepMind and Google Research in a year of relentless progress<b>.</b></p></div>

It topped the LMArena Leaderboard and redefined multimodal reasoning with breakthrough scores on benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam — a fiendishly hard test for AI models to see if AI can truly think and reason like humans — and GPQA Diamond. It also set a new standard for frontier models in mathematics, achieving a new state-of-the-art of 23.4% on MathArena Apex. We followed shortly with Gemini 3 Flash, which combines Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost, making it the most performant model for its size. Gemini 3 Flash's quality surpasses our previous Gemini 2.5 Pro-scale model's capabilities at a fraction of the price and substantially better latency, continuing our Gemini-era trend of 'the next generation's Flash model is better than the previous generation's Pro model'.</p><p data-block-key="2qsdp">Learn more about our progress on our world-class AI models this year:</p><ul><li data-block-key="4aapd"><a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-flash/">Gemini 3 Flash: frontier intelligence built for speed</a> (Dec 2025)</li><li data-block-key="8p9pt"><a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/">A new era of intelligence with Gemini 3</a> (Nov 2025)</li><li data-block-key="2ku9h"><a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/nano-banana-pro/">Introducing Nano Banana Pro</a> (Nov 2025)</li><li data-block-key="1oibr"><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/introducing-veo-3-1-and-new-creative-capabilities-in-the-gemini-api/">Introducing Veo 3.1 and new creative capabilities in the Gemini API</a> (Nov 2025)</li><li data-block-key="5o13k"><a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/">Gemini 2.5: Our most intelligent AI model</a> (March 2025)</li></ul></div>

<figcaption>Machine Head - Derek Hobbs 1995</figcaption>
<p>I grew up in the San Jose Bay Area. As of writing this, our company just graduated from the YC Fall 2025 batch. I'm not new to hustle-culture. I'm only where I am right now out of grit and the effort I invested into the things I loved in high school and college. Recently however, as a founder, I've become more attuned to Twitter (X) and LinkedIn, keeping up with <em>the vibes</em>.</p>
<p>There's a massive amount of hustle-culture being pushed on my timeline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Performative posts from people showcasing themselves coding in the most absurd situations</li>
<li>If you don't do X you're not going to make it (where X is some out of touch work hour target)</li>
<li>Good morning posts &amp; various rage-bait engagement farming tactics</li>
<li>Ratio's and one-up's</li>
</ul>
<p>Every machine serves a purpose. People need <em>purpose</em>. The temptation to <em>become the machine</em> is higher than ever. The promise of the machine is alluring. If I can just keep chugging forward, I will end up somewhere that is not here. If I can turn myself into a mechanism that takes input and consistently works towards some goal, I will make it.</p>
<p>I believe in hard work, but I think hustle-culture and the <em>vision</em> being pushed on my timeline is a corrupted one. It's engineered for engagement, optimized by millions competing with one another with just one goal: to capture your attention.</p>
<p>You're not working hard enough. You need to wake up at 5am. You need to be the first to arrive and the last to leave.</p>
<p>This messaging works. Look at me. I feel the need to write a post about it. But it is completely wrong.</p>
<p>Hustle-culture optimizes for work input because it's <em>sexy</em>. It's easy to post the inputs. It's hard to face the output.</p>
<p>The truth is you don't have to become the machine in order to succeed. The machine can't adapt. It can't learn the rules of the game. It is deterministic, set in place, chugging along at a linear pace.</p>
<p>Instead, aim to be nimble. Adapt quick. Define your goal but don't let it become your purpose. Your purpose is sacred; only you truly understand it. Do what you need to do in order to achieve your goals. Don't optimize for sweat. Try to find the most rewarding solution. Optimize for what matters: speed, efficiency, or quality—whatever it may be.</p>
<p>You're not a machine. You're a person. Play to your strengths. Be sharp and strategic like a scalpel, not blunt like a mallet. Stop fetishizing the grind. Dream bigger.</p>
<p><strong>You aren't a stupid blunt tool. Stop acting like one.</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article aria-labelledby="P0-0-title"><div data-slot="body"><p>At Waymo, our mission is to be the world’s most trusted driver. We know trust is built through consistent behavior over time—earned through every mile we drive and every interaction we have with the community. This past Saturday, as a widespread PG&amp;E outage cut power to nearly one-third of San Francisco, our service was put to the test. With power now restored, we want to share an account of our operations during the outage and how we are evolving to better serve the city.</p><p>The scale of the outage and the sheer number of disabled traffic lights were the primary contributors to city-wide gridlock. As signals went dark across major corridors, the resulting congestion required law enforcement to manually manage intersections. The situation was severe enough that the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management advised residents to stay home, underscoring the extraordinary nature of the weekend’s disruptions.</p><p>Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology. While the Waymo Driver is designed to handle dark traffic signals as four-way stops, it may occasionally request a confirmation check to ensure it makes the safest choice. While we successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday, the outage created a concentrated spike in these requests. This created a backlog that, in some cases, led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets.</p><p>We established these confirmation protocols out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment, and we are now refining them to match our current scale. While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the Driver with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.</p><p>As the outage persisted and City officials urged residents to stay off the streets to prioritize first responders, we temporarily paused our service in the area. We directed our fleet to pull over and park appropriately so we could return vehicles to our depots in waves. This ensured we did not further add to the congestion or obstruct emergency vehicles during the peak of the recovery effort.</p><h4 id="the-path-forward"><b>The path forward</b></h4><p>We’ve always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails. We are analyzing the event, and are already integrating the lessons from this weekend’s PG&amp;E outage. Here are some of the immediate steps we’re taking:</p><ul><li><p><b>Integrating more information about outages: </b>While our Driver already handles dark traffic signals as four-way stops, we are now rolling out fleet-wide updates that give our vehicles even more context about regional outages, allowing them to navigate these intersections more decisively.</p></li><li><p><b>Updating our emergency preparedness and response: </b>We will improve our emergency response protocols, incorporating lessons from this event. In San Francisco, we’ll continue to coordinate with Mayor Lurie’s team to identify areas of greater collaboration in our existing emergency preparedness plans.</p></li><li><p><b>Expanding our first responder engagement: </b>To date, we’ve trained more than 25,000 first responders in the U.S. and around the world on how to interact with Waymo. As we discover learnings from this and other widespread events, we’ll continue updating our first responder training.</p></li></ul><h4 id="undaunted-in-our-mis"><b>Undaunted in our mission to make our streets safer</b></h4><p>We live and work in San Francisco, and we are grateful to the city’s first responders for their tireless work, and to Mayor Lurie for his leadership.</p><p>Backed by 100M+ miles of fully autonomous driving experience and a <a href="https://waymo.com/safety/impact"><u>record</u></a> of improving road safety, we are undaunted by the opportunity to challenge the status quo of our roads, and we’re proud to continue serving San Franciscan residents and visitors.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

Apple Accounts for users under 18 would need to join a Family Sharing group, with new controls available for parents and restrictions for minors.</p>
<p>In a preliminary injunction that delays the implementation of the act, Judge Robert Pitman said that it violates the First Amendment and is "more likely than not unconstitutional."<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The Act is akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book. As set out below, the Court finds a likelihood that, when considered on the merits, SB 2420 violates the First Amendment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The injunction was in response to a motion filed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a group that includes Apple and Google. Today's decision is a win for Apple, as Apple has been fighting against age assurance requirements in Texas and other states. Apple says that the Texas law impacts user privacy.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>While we share the goal of strengthening kids' online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores.</p></blockquote>
<p>The court will move on to determining whether the law is facially invalid, which would mean that it is unconstitutional and will be entirely thrown out.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:54:30 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/x-ray">https://github.com/freelawproject/x-ray</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46369923">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freelawproject/x-ray/main/redacted.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freelawproject/x-ray/main/redacted.png" alt="Image of REDACTED STAMP"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">x-ray is a Python library for finding bad redactions in PDF documents.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why?</h2><a id="user-content-why" aria-label="Permalink: Why?" href="#why"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">At Free Law Project, we collect millions of PDFs. An ongoing problem
is that people fail to properly redact things. Instead of doing it the right
way, they just draw a black rectangle or a black highlight on top of black
text and call it a day. Well, when that happens you just select the text under
the rectangle, and you can read it again. Not great.</p>
<p dir="auto">After witnessing this problem for years, we decided it would be good to figure
out how common it is, so, with some help, we built this simple tool. You give
the tool the path to a PDF. It tells you if it has worthless redactions in it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What next?</h2><a id="user-content-what-next" aria-label="Permalink: What next?" href="#what-next"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Right now, <code>x-ray</code> works pretty well and we are using it to analyze documents
in our collections. It could be better though. Bad redactions take many forms.
See the issues tab for other examples we don't yet support. We'd love your
help solving some of tougher cases.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With uv, do:</p>

<p dir="auto">With pip, that'd be:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>uvx</code> lets you run this without even installing it. For example, here's an amicus brief we filed that doesn't have any bad redactions:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="uvx --from x-ray xray https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346.45.0.pdf
{}"><pre><code>uvx --from x-ray xray https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346.45.0.pdf
{}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Once you <em>do</em> install x-ray, you can easily use it on the command line. Once installed, just:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% xray path/to/your/file.pdf
{
  &quot;1&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;bbox&quot;: [
        58.550079345703125,
        72.19873046875,
        75.65007781982422,
        739.3987426757812
      ],
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The Ring travels by way of Cirith Ungol&quot;
    }
  ]
}"><pre>% xray path/to/your/file.pdf
{
  <span><span>"</span>1<span>"</span></span>: [
    {
      <span><span>"</span>bbox<span>"</span></span>: [
        58.550079345703125,
        72.19873046875,
        75.65007781982422,
        739.3987426757812
      ],
      <span><span>"</span>text<span>"</span></span>: <span><span>"</span>The Ring travels by way of Cirith Ungol<span>"</span></span>
    }
  ]
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or if you have the file on a server somewhere, give it a URL. If it starts with <code>https://</code>, it will be interpreted as a PDF to download. Here's congressional testimony our directory made (it doesn't have any bad redactions):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% xray https://free.law/pdf/congressional-testimony-michael-lissner-free-law-project-hearing-on-ethics-and-transparency-2021-10-26.pdf
{}"><pre>% xray https://free.law/pdf/congressional-testimony-michael-lissner-free-law-project-hearing-on-ethics-and-transparency-2021-10-26.pdf
{}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">A fun trick you can do is to make a file with one URL per line, call it <code>urls.txt</code>. Then you can run this to check each URL:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="xargs -n 1 xray  < urls.txt"><pre>xargs -n 1 xray  <span>&lt;</span> urls.txt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">However you run <code>xray</code> on the command line, you'll get JSON as output. When you have that, you can use it with tools like <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/" rel="nofollow"><code>jq</code></a>. The format is as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It's a dict.</li>
<li>The keys are page numbers.</li>
<li>Each page number maps to a list of dicts.</li>
<li>Each of those dicts maps to two keys.</li>
<li>The first key is <code>bbox</code>. This is a four-tuple that indicates the x,y positions of the upper left corner and then lower right corners of the bad redaction.</li>
<li>The second key is <code>text</code>. This is the text under the bad rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Simple enough.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also use it as a Python module, if you prefer the long-form:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% python -m xray some-file.pdf"><pre><code>% python -m xray some-file.pdf
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">But that's not as easy to remember.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want a bit more, you can, of course, use <code>xray</code> in Python:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from pprint import pprint
import xray
bad_redactions = xray.inspect(&quot;some/path/to/your/file.pdf&quot;)  # Pathlib works too
pprint(bad_redactions)
{1: [{'bbox': (58.550079345703125,
               72.19873046875,
               75.65007781982422,
               739.3987426757812),
      'text': 'Aragorn is the one true king.'}]}"><pre><span>from</span> <span>pprint</span> <span>import</span> <span>pprint</span>
<span>import</span> <span>xray</span>
<span>bad_redactions</span> <span>=</span> <span>xray</span>.<span>inspect</span>(<span>"some/path/to/your/file.pdf"</span>)  <span># Pathlib works too</span>
<span>pprint</span>(<span>bad_redactions</span>)
{<span>1</span>: [{<span>'bbox'</span>: (<span>58.550079345703125</span>,
               <span>72.19873046875</span>,
               <span>75.65007781982422</span>,
               <span>739.3987426757812</span>),
      <span>'text'</span>: <span>'Aragorn is the one true king.'</span>}]}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The output is the same as above, except it's a Python object, not a JSON object.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you already have the file contents as a <code>bytes</code> object, that'll work too:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="some_bytes = requests.get(&quot;https://lotr-secrets.com/some-doc.pdf&quot;).content
bad_redactions = xray.inspect(some_bytes)"><pre><span>some_bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>"https://lotr-secrets.com/some-doc.pdf"</span>).<span>content</span>
<span>bad_redactions</span> <span>=</span> <span>xray</span>.<span>inspect</span>(<span>some_bytes</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that because the <code>inspect</code> method uses the same signature no matter what,
the type of the object you give it is essential:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th><code>xray</code>'s Assumption</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>str</code> or Pathlib <code>Path</code></td>
<td>local file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>str</code> that starts with <code>https://</code></td>
<td>URL to download</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bytes</code></td>
<td>PDF in memory</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">This means that if you provide the filename on disk as a bytes object instead
of a <code>str</code>, it's not going to work. This will fail:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="xray.inspect(b&quot;some-file-path.pdf&quot;)"><pre><span>xray</span>.<span>inspect</span>(<span>b"some-file-path.pdf"</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">That's pretty much it. There are no configuration files or other variables to
learn. You give it a file name. If there is a bad redaction in it, you'll soon
find out.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Under the covers, <code>xray</code> uses the high-performant <a href="https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow">PyMuPDF project</a> to parse PDFs. It has been a wonderful project to work with.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can read the source to see how it works, but the general idea is to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Find rectangles in a PDF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Find letters in the same location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Render the rectangle as an image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Inspect the rectangle to see if it's all one color. If it is, then that's a
bad redaction. If not, then we assume you can see a mix of text and
drawings, indicating a redaction that's OK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The PDF format is a big and complicated one, so it's difficult to do all this perfectly. We do our best, but there's always more to do to make it better. <a href="https://free.law/donate/" rel="nofollow">Donations</a> and sponsored work help.</p>

To LG's credit, the TV automatically detected all of my devices -- my PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Fire TV Stick 4K Max -- and applied the best settings for each.

It's called Live Plus.    </p>    <p>If you've never heard of Live Plus before, it's a feature on LG smart TVs that uses ACR (automatic content recognition) to analyze what's displayed on your screen (via <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2023/12/12/your-smart-tv-knows-what-youre-watching" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Markup</a>). LG then uses that data to offer "personalized services," including content recommendations and advertisements.</p>    <p>Naturally, reading what the feature was on my TV was a bit of a shock. I wasn't thrilled to discover a setting enabled by default that essentially spies on my screen just for ads, but at the same time, I felt a wave of relief when I realized how easy it is to turn off. If you don't want your LG TV quietly snooping on what you watch and using it to serve you ads, here's how to turn Live Plus off.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><h2 id="how-to-turn-off-live-plus-on-your-lg-tv">

<p>Thankfully, LG doesn't make disabling Live Plus too hard, though you do have to click through a few menus. If you want to turn it off, here's how:</p>    <p>1. Press the <strong>Settings</strong> button on your remote (the gear icon).</p>    <p>2. When the side menu pops up, select <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>    <p>3. Chose the <strong>General</strong> option.</p>    <p>4. Scroll down and select <strong>System</strong>.</p>    <p>5, Select <strong>Additional Settings</strong>.</p>    <p>6. <strong>Toggle Live Plus off</strong>.</p>    <p>In the Settings menu on its TVs, LG says, "By turning Live Plus on, you understand that the content displayed on your TV can be recognized, and that the viewing information may be used to provide you with an enhanced viewing experience and personalized services including content recommendations and advertisements."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>People examining documents released by the Department of Justice in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Jeffrey Epstein</a> case discovered that some of the file redaction can be undone with Photoshop techniques, or by simply highlighting text to paste into a word processing file.</p><p>Un-redacted text from these documents began circulating through social media on Monday evening. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251219222621/https://www.justice.gov/multimedia/Court%20Records/Matter%20of%20the%20Estate%20of%20Jeffrey%20E.%20Epstein,%20Deceased,%20No.%20ST-21-RV-00005%20(V.I.%20Super.%20Ct.%202021)/2022.03.17-1%20Exhibit%201.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">exhibit </a>in a civil case in the Virgin Islands against Darren K Indyke and Richard D Kahn, two executors of Epstein’s estate, contains redacted allegations explaining how Epstein and his associates had facilitated the sexual abuse of children. The exhibit was the second amended complaint in the state case against Indyke and Kahn.</p><p>In section 85, the redacted portion states: “Between September 2015 and June 2019, Indyke signed (FAC) for over $400,000 made payable to young female models and actresses, including a former Russian model who received over $380,000 through monthly payments of $8,333 made over a period of more than three and a half years until the middle of 2019.”</p><p>Prosecutors in the Virgin Islands settled its civil sex-trafficking case against Epstein’s estate, Indyke and Kahn in 2022 for $105m, plus one half of the proceeds from the sale of Little St James, the island on which Epstein resided and on which many of his crimes occurred. The justice department <a href="https://usvidoj.com/u-s-virgin-islands-attorney-general-settles-sex-trafficking-case-against-estate-of-jeffrey-epstein-and-co-defendants-for-over-105-million/" data-link-name="in body link">press release</a> announcing the settlement did not include an admission of liability.</p><p>Indyke, an attorney who represented Epstein for decades, has not been criminally indicted by federal authorities. He was hired by the Parlatore Law Group in 2022, before the justice department settled the Epstein case. That firm represents the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and previously represented Donald Trump in his defense against charges stemming from the discovery of classified government documents stored at Trump’s Florida estate. Calls and email seeking comment from Indyke and the Parlatore Law Group have not yet been returned.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities and any wrongdoing.</p><p>Other sections further allege how Epstein’s enterprise concealed crimes.</p><p>“Defendants also attempted to conceal their criminal sex trafficking and abuse, conduct by paying large sums of money to participant-witnesses, including by paying for their attorneys’ fees and case costs in litigation related to this conduct,” reads one redacted passage.</p><p>“Epstein also threatened harm to victims and helped release damaging stories about them to damage their credibility when they tried to go public with their stories of being trafficked and sexually abused. Epstein also instructed one or more Epstein Enterprise participant-witnesses to destroy evidence relevant to ongoing court proceedings involving Defendants’ criminal sex trafficking and abuse conduct.”</p><p>Redactions of sections 184 through 192 of the document describe property taxes paid by companies incorporated by Epstein on properties that were not on the balance sheet for those firms.</p><p>“For instance, Cypress’s Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 did not reflect any assets other than cash of $18,824. Further, Cypress reported only $301 in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, despite it paying $106,394.60 in Santa Fe property taxes on November 6, 2018,” reads one redacted passage.</p><p>“Similarly, in 2017, Cypress reported as its only asset cash in the amount of $29,736 and expenses of $150, despite it paying $55,770.41 and $113,679.56 in Santa Fe property taxes during 2017.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405" data-link-name="in body link">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a> signed into law last month permits the Department of Justice “to withhold certain information such as the personal information of victims and materials that would jeopardize an active federal investigation”.</p><p>It was unclear how property material complies with the redaction standard under the law.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://danburzo.ro/http-caching-refresher/">https://danburzo.ro/http-caching-refresher/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46368616">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
			
<article data-pagefind-body="">
	
	
	
	<p>This is a reading of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111"><abbr>RFC 9111</abbr></a> (2022), the latest iteration of the <abbr>HTTP</abbr> Caching standard.</p>
<p>It defines the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cache-Control"><code>Cache-Control</code></a> <abbr>HTTP</abbr> header as a way to prescribe how caches should store and reuse <abbr>HTTP</abbr> responses, with regards to not just the browser cache, but to any other intermediary caches, such as proxies and content delivery networks, that may exist between the client and the origin server.</p>
<img src="https://danburzo.ro/img/http-caching-refresher/cache-chain.png" alt="A crude illustration depicting a browser with its private cache, two intermediary services with their shared caches, and the origin server" width="1000" height="310">
<p>The <code>Cache-Control</code> header accepts a set of comma-separated directives, some of which are meant to be added to <abbr>HTTP</abbr> requests, and others to <abbr>HTTP</abbr> responses. A typical response header:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/2 200
Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate
</code></pre>
<p>Some of these directives specifically target <em>shared caches</em>, that is intermediary caches that serve the same cached responses to many users, while others also apply to <em>private caches</em> such as the browser cache.</p>
<h2>What’s fresh?</h2>
<p>Whenever the cache receives a request, it must figure out if the cached response is still <strong>fresh</strong> and can therefore be reused without incurring the performance tax of an <abbr>HTTP</abbr> request, or whether it has gone <strong>stale</strong> and should be validated with the server.</p>
<p>To decide on freshness, the cache compares the age of the response to the response’s so-called freshness timeline.</p>
<p>The age of a cached response is the time elapsed since it was last generated or revalidated by the origin server. To the time spent in its own cache, the browser will add any <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Age"><code>Age: &lt;seconds&gt;</code></a> header received from intermediary caches.</p>
<p>The freshness timeline is a duration beyond which the cached response is to be considered stale. It’s usually signaled by the server via the appropriate response headers, but may also be guesstimated by the cache in the absence of explicit, valid cues. In order of precedence:</p>
<ul>
<li>the server establishes a freshness timeline, in seconds, with the <a href="#max-age-response"><code>Cache-Control: max-age=&lt;number&gt;</code></a> directive on the response; otherwise,</li>
<li>the cache falls back to computing the interval between the <code>Expires: &lt;date&gt;</code> and <code>Date: &lt;date&gt;</code> response headers, if available; otherwise,</li>
<li>if there’s no <code>Expires</code> header, the response lacks an explicit expiration, and a heuristic freshness based on the <code>Last-Modified</code> response header might be applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>For shared caches, the special <a href="#s-maxage-response"><code>s-maxage=&lt;number&gt;</code></a> directive takes precedence over all others.</p>
<h2>Going past expiration</h2>
<p>Just because a response has gone stale, it doesn’t mean it needs to be thrown out.</p>
<p>When it receives a request for a stale cached response, the cache should validate it with its upstream server. Although validation always generates an <abbr>HTTP</abbr> request, it avoids a data transfer when there’s no newer version of the cached response on the server, so it can still be faster than a regular request.</p>
<p>Validation uses a mechanism known as a conditional <abbr>HTTP</abbr> request, which includes one or more special headers called preconditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the precondition with the highest precedence is met, the server responds with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/200"><abbr>HTTP 200 OK</abbr></a> and an updated response body; otherwise,</li>
<li>it responds with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/304"><abbr>HTTP 304</abbr> Not Modified</a> and an empty body, confirming the existing response can be reused.</li>
</ul>
<p>To generate the preconditions needed for these conditional requests, which the server uses to compare the cached response to the freshest version available, responses must be tagged in a way that’s unique to each version:</p>
<ul>
<li>historically, this was done with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Last-Modified"><code>Last-Modified: &lt;date&gt;</code></a> header, corresponding to the latest update to the content;</li>
<li>a more flexible and robust alternative is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag"><code>ETag: "&lt;value&gt;"</code></a> header, which stores an arbitrary <abbr>ASCII</abbr> string that uniquely identifies the response. This string is usually a hash incorporating one or more aspects: the modification time, the file size, and the file content.</li>
</ul>
<p>When performing the validation, the cached response headers are mirrored as preconditions for the conditional request:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Last-Modified: &lt;date&gt;</code> becomes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-Modified-Since"><code>If-Modified-Since: &lt;date&gt;</code></a>;</li>
<li><code>ETag: "&lt;value&gt;"</code> becomes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-None-Match"><code>If-None-Match: "&lt;value&gt;"</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When both preconditions are present, only <code>If-None-Match</code> is evaluated.</p>
<p>Regardless of the result of the validation request, the cached response headers are updated with the new values received from the server, and the fresh-o-meter on the cached response is reset.</p>
<p>Certain caches may be set up to serve stale responses in some circumstances, such as when losing the connection to the server or in the event of an <abbr>HTTP 5xx</abbr> server error. There are also <code>Cache-Control</code> directives that influence how stale responses are handled, covered in the next section.</p>
<h2>Cache-Control response directives</h2>
<h3 id="max-age-response">
<p><code>max-age=&lt;number&gt;</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>max-age</code> response directive defines the response’s freshness timeline in seconds, after which the response should be considered stale. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-max-age-2">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.1</abbr></a></p>
<h3 id="must-revalidate-response">
<p><code>must-revalidate</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>must-revalidate</code> response directive indicates that the cache must not reuse a stale response until it’s been successfully validated by the origin server. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-must-revalidate">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.2</abbr></a></p>
<p>If the server throws an error, the cache must surface that instead of reusing a stale response. If the cache is disconnected, it must produce an error with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/504"><abbr>HTTP 504</abbr> Gateway Timeout</a> status code, or another more applicable error code.</p>
<p><strong>Side effects:</strong> <code>must-revalidate</code> is one of the directives, along with <code>s-maxage</code> and <code>public</code>, that allow shared caches to <a href="#caching-authenticated-responses">store and reuse a response to a request containing an <code>Authorization</code> header</a>, which they are generally prohibited from doing.</p>
<h3 id="no-cache-response">
<p><code>no-cache</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>no-cache</code> response directive indicates that the cache must not reuse <em>any</em> response until it’s successfully validated by the origin server. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-cache-2">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.4</abbr></a></p>
<p>This is similar to <code>must-revalidate</code> but refers to all cached responses, not just stale ones. In effect, <code>no-cache</code> is a sort of <code>max-age=0, must-revalidate</code>.</p>
<h3 id="no-store-reponse">
<p><code>no-store</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>no-store</code> response directive indicates that private and shared caches must not store any part of the request or the response, and to never reuse the response. The standard is quick to warn that the effect is not guaranteed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<span>MUST NOT</span> store” in this context means that the cache <span>MUST NOT</span> intentionally store the information in non-volatile storage and <span>MUST</span> make a best-effort attempt to remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as possible after forwarding it. This directive is not a reliable or sufficient mechanism for ensuring privacy. In particular, malicious or compromised caches might not recognize or obey this directive, and communications networks might be vulnerable to eavesdropping. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-store-2">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.4</abbr></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Side effects:</strong> The directive can also influence non-<abbr>HTTP</abbr> caches. Most browsers will <a href="https://web.dev/articles/bfcache#minimize-no-store">exclude from the back/forward cache</a> pages having the <code>no-store</code> response directive. Chrome, however, has recently started to make <em>some</em> of these pages <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/bfcache-ccns">eligible for bfcache</a> when the browser deems it safe.</p>
<h3 id="must-understand-response">
<p><code>must-understand</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>must-understand</code> response directive indicates that the cache shouldn’t store or reuse responses with <abbr>HTTP</abbr> status codes whose semantics the cache doesn’t understand and conform to. The directive is meant to future-proof existing implementations from status codes that might have special requirements in regards to caching. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-must-understand">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.3</abbr></a></p>
<p>It’s recommended to use <code>must-understand, no-store</code> together as a fallback, and caches are encouraged to ignore the <code>no-store</code> directive if they do understand the semantics of the <abbr>HTTP</abbr> status code. This ensures older caches that don’t recognize the <code>must-understand</code> directive don’t cache the response at all, although by 2025 this should be an exceedingly rare sight.</p>
<h3 id="private-response">
<p><code>private</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>private</code> response directive indicates that the response is meant for a single user. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-private">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.7</abbr></a>.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>a shared cache must not store the response; and</li>
<li>a private cache may store the response even if the response wouldn’t otherwise be heuristically cacheable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>private</code> directive can be used to guard against other directives that might inadvertently make <a href="#caching-authenticated-responses">authenticated responses available to shared caches</a>.</p>
<h3 id="public-response">
<p><code>public</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>public</code> response directive indicates two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a shared cache may <a href="#caching-authenticated-responses">store and reuse a response to a request containing an <code>Authorization</code> header</a>, which it’s generally prohibited from doing; and</li>
<li>a private cache may store the response even if the response wouldn’t otherwise be heuristically cacheable.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-public">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.9</abbr></a></p>
<h3 id="s-maxage-response">
<p><code>s-maxage=&lt;number&gt;</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>s-maxage=&lt;number&gt;</code> response directive is analogous to <code>max-age</code>, but only affects shared caches. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-s-maxage">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.10</abbr></a>.</p>
<p>The directive also incorporates the semantics of the <code>proxy‑revalidate</code> response directive, in that a shared cache must not use a stale response until it has been successfully validated with the origin server.</p>
<p><strong>Side effects:</strong> <code>s-maxage</code> is one of the directives, along with <code>must-revalidate</code> and <code>public</code>, that allow shared caches to <a href="#caching-authenticated-responses">store and reuse a response to a request containing an <code>Authorization</code> header</a>, which they are generally prohibited from doing.</p>
<h3 id="proxy-revalidate-response">
<p><code>proxy-revalidate</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>proxy-revalidate</code> response directive is analogous to <code>must-revalidate</code>, but only affects shared caches. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-proxy-revalidate">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.8</abbr></a>.</p>
<h3 id="no-transform-response">
<p><code>no-transform</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>no-transform</code> response directive indicates that intermediaries, regardless of whether they implement a cache or not, must not transform the response content, such as optimizing images or compressing stylesheets and scripts. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-transform-2">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.6</abbr></a>.</p>
<h3 id="stale-while-revalidate-response">
<p><code>stale-while-revalidate=&lt;number&gt;</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>stale-while-revalidate</code> response directive was defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5861"><abbr>RFC 5861</abbr>: <abbr>HTTP</abbr> Cache-Control Extensions for Stale Content</a> (2010). It indicates that the cache may use a cached response if it hasn’t exceeded its freshness lifetime by more than the specified number of seconds.</p>
<p>Whenever the presence of this directive causes a stale response to be served, the cache should trigger a background revalidation of the response.</p>
<p>The author of the <abbr>RFC</abbr>, Mark Nottingham, <a href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/06/01/chrome_and_stale-while-revalidate">has written a rationale</a> for this directive.</p>
<h3 id="stale-if-error-response">
<p><code>stale-if-error=&lt;number&gt;</code></p>
</h3>
<p>Also defined in the <abbr>RFC 5861</abbr> extension, the <code>stale-if-error</code> response directive indicates that the cache may use a cached response if it hasn’t exceeded its freshness lifetime by more than the specified number of seconds, if the attempt to validate the stale response results in an error.</p>
<p><a href="https://cache-tests.fyi/"><abbr>HTTP</abbr> Caching Tests</a> suggests this directive is not well supported.</p>
<h2>Cache-Control request directives</h2>
<p>As web developers, we most often deal with <code>Cache-Control</code> in <abbr>HTTP</abbr> responses, but this header can also be included on <abbr>HTTP</abbr> requests. Browsers, for example, use them when the user refreshes the page.</p>
<p>When used in <abbr>HTTP</abbr> requests, <code>Cache-Control</code> directives express the client’s preference in regards to the freshness or age of the response. Caches reconcile these requests with the <code>Cache-Control</code> response directives of its cached responses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit#cache"><code>cache</code> option</a> for <code>fetch()</code> has a separate set of values that map to <code>Cache-Control</code> request directives, but the mappings are not always intuitive. For example, <code>cache: 'no-cache'</code> maps to <code>Cache-Control: max-age=0</code>. For the curious, the mappings are <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-network-or-cache-fetch">defined here</a>. You can always set your <code>Cache-Control</code> headers directly with the <code>headers</code> option.</p>

<h3><code>max-age=&lt;number&gt;</code></h3>
<p>The <code>max-age</code> request directive indicates that the client wants a fresh response whose age is less than or equal to the specified number of seconds. When combined with <code>max-stale</code>, the client will accept some stale responses. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-max-age">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.1</abbr></a>.</p>
<h3><code>max-stale=&lt;number&gt;</code></h3>
<p>The <code>max-stale</code> request directive indicates that the client will accept a stale response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime by no more than the specified number of seconds. When used without an argument, <code>max-stale</code> indicates that the client will accept any stale response, no matter how old. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2.1.2">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.2</abbr></a></p>
<h3><code>min-fresh=&lt;number&gt;</code></h3>
<p>The <code>min-fresh</code> request directive indicates that the client prefers a response that still has at least the specified number of seconds of freshness left. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-min-fresh">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.3</abbr></a></p>
<h3><code>no-cache</code></h3>
<p>The <code>no-cache</code> request directive indicates that the client prefers caches not to use a stored response without successfully validating it with the origin server. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-cache">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.4</abbr></a></p>
<h3><code>no-store</code></h3>
<p>The <code>no-store</code> request directive indicates that a cache must not store any part of either this request or any response to it. The same caveats as to <a href="#no-store-response">its response counterpart</a> apply. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-store">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.5</abbr></a></p>
<p>If a cache serves this request with a response that was previously stored, the <code>no-store</code> request directive doesn’t cause the cache to remove the response after serving it.</p>
<h3><code>no-transform</code></h3>
<p>The <code>no-transform</code> request directive indicates that the client is asking for intermediaries to avoid transforming the content. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-transform">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.6</abbr></a></p>
<h3><code>only-if-cached</code></h3>
<p>The <code>only-if-cached</code> request directive indicates that the client only wants a stored response. Caches should respond with either a stored response that satisfies all the other constraints, or an <abbr>HTTP 504</abbr> Gateway Timeout status code. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-only-if-cached">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.7</abbr></a></p>
<h3><code>stale-if-error=&lt;number&gt;</code></h3>
<p>Similarly to <a href="#stale-if-error-response">its response counterpart</a>, the <code>stale-if-error</code> request directive indicates that the client will accept a stale response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime by no more than the specified number of seconds, if an attempt to validate it resulted in a server error.</p>
<h2>Browser refresh mechanisms</h2>
<p>Browsers typically offer two refresh mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>soft reloads</em>, triggered by the reload button, a corresponding menu item and keyboard shortcut, and the pull-to-refresh gesture in mobile browsers, are meant to get an updated representation of the page, for example getting the latest posts on a social media timeline.</li>
<li><em>hard reloads</em>, enabled with a modifier key, skip the cache altogether and are meant to fix interrupted loads, outdated cached responses, and other broken states.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how some browsers on macOS implement these behaviors.</p>
<h3>Soft reloads</h3>
<p>Triggered by <kbd>Ctrl + R</kbd> on Windows/Linux and <kbd>Command + R</kbd> on macOS.</p>
<p>Firefox triggers a conditional request to revalidate the cached response for the main resource (the <abbr>HTML</abbr> file). Sub-resources such as stylesheets, scripts, and images are reloaded as usual, according to their cache directives.</p>
<p>Chrome behaves similarly, with the difference that the validation request for the main resource also includes a <code>Cache-Control: max-age=0</code> directive (which can’t hurt).</p>
<p>Instead of revalidating its cached response, Safari performs a non-conditional request for the main resource, then loads sub-resources as usual.</p>
<h3>Hard reloads</h3>
<p>Triggered by <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + R</kbd> on Windows/Linux and <kbd>Command + Shift + R</kbd> on macOS except Safari, which uses <kbd>Command + Option + R</kbd>. (If you’ve applied your muscle memory to Safari before, you know all too well that the common shortcut opens Reader Mode instead…)</p>
<p>On a hard reload, all three browsers trigger non-conditional requests with the <code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code> directive on the <abbr>HTML</abbr> page and its sub-resources.</p>
<p>Curiously, once you perform a hard reload in Safari, subsequent soft reloads will still use the <code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code> request directive to fetch the main resource, which is probably an unintended, but otherwise benign behavior.</p>
<h3>The <code>immutable</code> response directive</h3>
<p>Reloading a web page didn’t always work like this. Historically, when performing a soft reload, all the sub-resources would be revalidated along with the main resource, in effect freshening up the cache for the current page.</p>
<p>Circa 2015, Facebook was seeing several <abbr>HTTP 304</abbr> Not Modified responses on long-lived resources like scripts and stylesheets whenever a user would refresh their feed page with the browser’s reload button.</p>
<p>To address this issue, Patrick McManus from Mozilla <a href="https://bitsup.blogspot.com/2016/05/cache-control-immutable.html">proposed</a> the <code>immutable</code> response directive, which later became <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8246"><abbr>RFC 8246</abbr>: <abbr>HTTP</abbr> Immutable Responses</a>.</p>
<p>The directive indicates that the origin server won’t update a resource during the freshness lifetime of the cached response, so a cache shouldn’t issue conditional requests for responses that are still fresh when the user reloads the page, unless the user really, really wants an updated response (e.g. a hard reload).</p>
<p>Around the time that <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/01/using-immutable-caching-to-speed-up-the-web/">support for <code>immutable</code></a> landed in Firefox 49 and Facebook began to use it to great effect, Chrome introduced a <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/01/reload-reloaded-faster-and-leaner-page_26.html">new way to perform reloads</a> that solved the problem without introducing additional directives: instead of revalidating everything on a soft reload, just revalidate the main resource and load sub-resources as usual. Safari switched over to the new reload policy soon after [<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169756">Webkit#169756</a>], and Firefox eventually did with <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/firefox/100.0/releasenotes/">Firefox 100</a>.</p>
<p>That leaves the <code>immutable</code> directive in an awkward place. Safari added support [<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167497">Webkit#167497</a>] but Chrome representatives remain unconvinced that it offers a significant benefit on top of the current reload behavior [<a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41253661">Chromium#41253661</a>].</p>
<h2 id="caching-authenticated-responses">
Caching responses to authenticated requests
</h2>
<p>One of the more confusing aspects of <abbr>HTTP</abbr> caching is how various <code>Cache-Control</code> response directives affect the way shared caches treat responses to requests that contain an <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-authorization"><code>Authorization</code> header</a>, which are understood as specific to a single user.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-storing-responses-to-authen"><abbr>RFC 9111 § 3.5</abbr></a>, shared caches are not allowed to store these responses <q>unless the response contains a Cache-Control field with a response directive that allows it to be stored by a shared cache, and the cache conforms to the requirements of that directive for that response.</q></p>
<p>The three directives that enable shared caches to store authenticated responses, and which must therefore be carefully evaluated before deploying, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#public-response"><code>public</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#s-maxage-response"><code>s-maxage=&lt;number&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#must-revalidate-response"><code>must-revalidate</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, a <a href="#private-response"><code>private</code></a> directive prevents any other directive from making authenticated responses eligible to shared caches.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I wrote this article to clarify for myself what the various cache directives stand for and how they overlap and interact. It only covers the main ideas, without delving into the more obscure corners of <abbr>HTTP</abbr> semantics. I approached the subject with a “clear cache”, and mainly used the normative references (<abbr>RFC 9111</abbr> and its extensions), aided by various guides from different eras:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/">Caching Tutorial for Web Authors and Webmasters</a> (1998—) by Mark Nottingham;</li>
<li><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/">Caching best practices &amp; max-age gotchas</a> (2016) by Jake Archibald;</li>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/articles/http-cache">Prevent unnecessary network requests with the <abbr>HTTP</abbr> Cache</a> (2018) by Ilya Grigorik and Jeff Posnik;</li>
<li><a href="https://csswizardry.com/2019/03/cache-control-for-civilians/">Cache control for civilians</a> (2019–2025) and <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2025/03/why-do-we-have-a-cache-control-request-header/">Why Do We Have a Cache-Control Request Header?</a> (2025) by Harry Roberts;</li>
<li><a href="https://grayduck.mn/2021/09/13/cache-control-recommendations/">Cache-Control Recommendations</a> (2021) by April King;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Caching">Web Caching</a> on <abbr>MDN</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s interesting about these guides is that the recommendations don’t just encode an interpretation of the specs, but also incorporate safeguards against non-conformant or outdated browser caches and intermediares.</p>
<p>In light of developments as recent as 2022, it would be cool to figure out to what extent things have improved, and which of these safeguards can be discarded. <a href="https://cache-tests.fyi/"><abbr>HTTP</abbr> Caching Tests</a> seems to be a good resource for assessing the situation.</p>

I flew back to Italy for the Christmas holidays, as I usually do. Here I have my childhood c64, on which I learend how to program, and which in the last few years I took to refurbishing.<br>
In general, everytime I'm back to my parent's place I spend some time fixing and sorting out things, and this is one of them.</p><p>

Now it works like a charm, and of course I also added some <a href="https://c64os.com/buyersguide/">bells and whistles</a>, mostly stuff that allows me to easily tranfer programs from a PC (a kung-fu cart and a pi1541) - so this year I thought it was time to actually do something with it! </p><p>

I decided to turn it into a cozy fireplace:</p><center><a href="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/cozy.jpg" aria-label="link to large image"><img src="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/THUMBS/cozy.png" width="350" max-height="292" alt="(click on the image for the full-color version)"></a><br><small>(click on the image for the full-color version)</small></center><p>
I was quite surprised that it worked, that I managed to complete this project in a few hours over two days, and that it was, most of all, fun! </p><p>

I expected... more friction, having to work with arcane cross-platform toolchains and the like, but instead I completed almost of all it in a web-based IDE/emulator combo!</p><p>

Moreover, I am far from being an expert when it comes to c64 coding. Yes, I used to program with one... when I was six or seven! And yes, I do follow its demoscene, and over the years I've read quite a bit about its chips and inner workings, but I've never written any demo effect for it. </p><p>

In other words... if I managed, you can too! That's what made me want to write this post...</p><p>

<b>All you need for Christmas...</b><br>
...is a 6502.</p><p>

Here, I'll give you a crash course on the c64 - the key points of what I knew before starting this.</p><p>

If you know how modern CPUs work, and how to optimize for them - try to forget all of that. The 64 comes from an era where RAM was faster than compute. Lookup tables are your friend, as it is fully unrolling loops / code generation. We have no caches!</p><p>

Don't be surprised then to learn that the famous 6502 CPU has only one arithmetic register, the "accumulator". There are also two "index" registers used to offset memory locations, a status register, and a program counter - but you can't do math on any of these, at best, test or increment/decrement.<br>
Moreover, the program counter is the only 16-bit register, all the others are 8-bit.</p><p>

But who needs registers when you have fast RAM? Memory is your register file: pretty much all 6502 instructions operate between the accumulator and memory locations (or numeric constants, that are still memory, just part of the instruction itself).</p><p>

To further facilitate this, the 6502 comes with a rich set of addressing modes, most instructions can fetch memory in few different ways: at absolute addresses, at addresses offset with one of the two index registers or even at indirect addresses (addresses contained in memory locations).<br>
There is also a special memory area, called the "zero page", the first 256 bytes of memory (a page is, unsurprisingly, 256 bytes), which has an extra optimization: addressing there takes one cycle less, because the address can be encoded in the instruction in a single byte instead of two.</p><p>

Have a look at the <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html">6502 instruction set</a>, it's very simple! Won't take more than 15 minutes to skim over them all.</p><p>

<b>The plan.</b></p><p>

Where things get less simple is to deal with all the c64 custom chips, the SID (sound) and the VIC-II (graphics). That's how demo-scene effects are done! Manipulating these chips in very precise ways to cause them to generate crazy stuff, most of which was never considered possible by the c64 designers back then!</p><p>

The average c64 demo effect is all about this - generating lookup tables and unrolled assembly to then be able to exactly time internal chip status changes as the video signal is being generated line by line ("racing the beam"). Usually, what is shown on screen is not at all what it seems - i.e. it's not how you would create a similar effect on a PC.</p><center><a href="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/demo.jpg" aria-label="link to large image"><img src="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/THUMBS/demo.png" width="350" max-height="197" alt="We won't be porting Second Reality..."></a><br><small>We won't be porting Second Reality...</small></center><p>
I know almost nothing of any of this - so my plan was to avoid it all! I wanted to set the VIC-II in some graphic mode that gave me a decently simple, linear framebuffer, and from there on write the code like I would have done on any other computer, hoping that a fire effect is simple enough to compute that the 64 would just be able to cope with it.</p><p>

Luckily, there is one such mode. The default, vanilla, character mode! Here, we have 40x25 characters on screen, chosen from a set of 256. So, one byte per "pixel", and 1000 pixels in total - great!</p><center><a href="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/petscii.png" aria-label="link to large image"><img src="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/THUMBS/petscii.png" width="350" max-height="180" alt="The default &quot;petscii&quot; character set."></a><br><small>The default "petscii" character set.</small></center><p>
Now, the default character set does not really lean itself to creating a demo effect, but I knew I could create a custom one. My idea was to simply making a dither pattern, and as much as possible work like I had a 8-bit "grayscale" screen. </p><p>

C64 characters are 8x8, so I could create a dither pattern that has a number of "on" pixels in the character corresponding to its position in the charset: 0 being fully off (background color), 64 being fully on (foreground color), and everything in between being a mix.<br>
Of course though this would give us only 64 values, ideally, I wanted to utilize the whole 8-bit space... On obvious idea is that we could add colors to the mix. For example, having the first 64 values go from black (background) to brown (foreground), then the next 64 have brown as background and red as foreground, then red and yellow, and finally yellow and white.</p><center><a href="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/chars.png" aria-label="link to large image"><img src="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/THUMBS/chars.png" width="350" max-height="249" alt="My custom charset. Made by hand in C64Studio."></a><br><small>My custom charset. Made by hand in C64Studio.</small></center><p>
This can't be achieved in the default character mode, unfortunately, as only the foreground color is controllable per-character (via another memory location, still using one byte per character - easy), while the background is shared. Luckily though, there is an <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Extended_color_mode">"extended color mode"</a> that fits the bill exactly. In this mode the character set is limited to 64, but the two high bits of each character can be used to control the background color, while the foreground remains in the separate memory location as usual.</p><p>

<b>Implementation.</b></p><p>

All development was done in the <a href="https://ide.retrogamecoders.com/">retrogamecoders c64 IDE</a>, which handly couples the <a href="https://cc65.github.io/">cc65 compiler</a> with an emulator.</p><p>

Writing c64 code in C is generally a terrible idea, and cc65 is not even the "best" compiler out there (is quite old and barely does optimize the generated code - <a href="https://llvm-mos.org/wiki/Welcome">llvm-mos</a> might be better), but being able to test in C and then gradually "port" to assembly was crucial for a noob like me. If I were to keep working on this, I'd probably move to <a href="https://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html#frontpage">Kick Assembler</a>, which is particularly suited for the kind of code-generation that you want to do in demo-coding.</p><p>

Anyhow, here are the .c files, step by step, in chronological order. You can just copy and paste them in the retrogamecoders IDE and see how things work, start tinkering if you like! Enjoy!</p><center><a href="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/final.png" aria-label="link to large image"><img src="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/THUMBS/final.png" width="350" max-height="222"></a></center>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Part 2 of our video streaming saga. </span><a href="https://blog.helix.ml/p/we-killed-webrtc-and-nobody-noticed" rel="">Read Part 1: How we replaced WebRTC with WebSockets →</a></em></p><p>Let me tell you about the time we spent three months building a gorgeous, hardware-accelerated, WebCodecs-powered, 60fps H.264 streaming pipeline over WebSockets...</p><p><span>...and then replaced it with </span><code>grim | curl</code><span> when the WiFi got a bit sketchy.</span></p><p>I wish I was joking.</p><p><span>We’re building </span><a href="https://github.com/helixml/helix" rel="">Helix</a><span>, an AI platform where autonomous coding agents work in cloud sandboxes. Users need to watch their AI assistants work. Think “screen share, but the thing being shared is a robot writing code.”</span></p><p>Last week, we explained how we replaced WebRTC with a custom WebSocket streaming pipeline. This week: why that wasn’t enough.</p><p><strong>The constraint that ruined everything:</strong><span> It has to work on enterprise networks.</span></p><p>You know what enterprise networks love? HTTP. HTTPS. Port 443. That’s it. That’s the list.</p><p>You know what enterprise networks hate?</p><ul><li><p><strong>UDP</strong><span> — Blocked. Deprioritized. Dropped. “Security risk.”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>WebRTC</strong><span> — Requires TURN servers, which requires UDP, which is blocked</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Custom ports</strong><span> — Firewall says no</span></p></li><li><p><strong>STUN/ICE</strong><span> — NAT traversal? In </span><em>my</em><span> corporate network? Absolutely not</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Literally anything fun</strong><span> — Denied by policy</span></p></li></ul><p>We tried WebRTC first. Worked great in dev. Worked great in our cloud. Deployed to an enterprise customer.</p><p>“The video doesn’t connect.”</p><p><em>checks network</em><span> — Outbound UDP blocked. TURN server unreachable. ICE negotiation failing.</span></p><p>We could fight this. Set up TURN servers. Configure enterprise proxies. Work with IT departments.</p><p><span>Or we could accept reality: </span><strong>Everything must go through HTTPS on port 443.</strong></p><p><span>So we built a </span><strong>pure WebSocket video pipeline</strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>H.264 encoding via GStreamer + VA-API (hardware acceleration, baby)</p></li><li><p>Binary frames over WebSocket (L7 only, works through any proxy)</p></li><li><p>WebCodecs API for hardware decoding in the browser</p></li><li><p>60fps at 40Mbps with sub-100ms latency</p></li></ul><p>We were so proud. We wrote Rust. We wrote TypeScript. We implemented our own binary protocol. We measured things in microseconds.</p><p><strong>Then someone tried to use it from a coffee shop.</strong></p><p>“The video is frozen.”</p><p>“Your WiFi is bad.”</p><p>“No, the video is definitely frozen.

Great idea. Now it’s 10Mbps of blocky garbage that’s </span><em>still</em><span> 30 seconds behind.</span></p><p>We tried everything:</p><p><strong>“What if we only send keyframes?”</strong></p><p>This was our big brain moment. H.264 keyframes (IDR frames) are self-contained. No dependencies on previous frames. Just drop all the P-frames on the server side, send only keyframes, get ~1fps of corruption-free video. Perfect for low-bandwidth fallback!</p><p><span>We added a </span><code>keyframes_only</code><span> flag. We modified the video decoder to check </span><code>FrameType::Idr</code><span>. We set GOP to 60 (one keyframe per second at 60fps). We tested.</span></p><p>We got exactly ONE frame.</p><p>One single, beautiful, 1080p IDR frame. Then silence. Forever.</p><pre><code><code>[WebSocket] Keyframe received (frame 121), sending

But our WebSocket streaming layer sits on top of the Moonlight protocol, which is reverse-engineered from NVIDIA GameStream. Somewhere in that protocol stack, </span><em>something</em><span> decides that if you’re not consuming P-frames, you’re not ready for more frames. Period.</span></p><p>We poked around for an hour or two, but without diving deep into the Moonlight protocol internals, we weren’t going to fix this.

  screenshotImg.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  setTimeout(fetchScreenshot, 100) // yolo
}</code></code></pre><p>We did it. We’re sending JPEGs.</p><p><span>And you know what? </span><strong>It works perfectly.</strong></p><p>Here’s the thing about our fancy H.264 pipeline:</p><p><span>PropertyH.264 StreamJPEG SpamBandwidth40 Mbps (constant)100-500 Kbps (varies with complexity)StateStateful (corrupt = dead)Stateless (each frame independent)Latency sensitivityVery highDoesn’t careRecovery from packet lossWait for keyframe (seconds)Next frame (100ms)Implementation complexity3 months of Rust</span><code>fetch()</code><span> in a loop</span></p><p><span>A JPEG screenshot is </span><strong>self-contained</strong><span>. It either arrives complete, or it doesn’t. There’s no “partial decode.” There’s no “waiting for the next keyframe.” There’s no “decoder state corruption.”</span></p><p>When the network is bad, you get... fewer JPEGs. That’s it. The ones that arrive are perfect.</p><p><span>And the size! A 70% quality JPEG of a 1080p desktop is like </span><strong>100-150KB</strong><span>. A single H.264 keyframe is 200-500KB. We’re sending LESS data per frame AND getting better reliability.</span></p><p><span>We didn’t throw away the H.264 pipeline. We’re not </span><em>complete</em><span> animals.</span></p><p>Instead, we built adaptive switching:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Good connection</strong><span> (RTT &lt; 150ms): Full 60fps H.264, hardware decoded, buttery smooth</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Bad connection detected</strong><span>: Pause video, switch to screenshot polling</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Connection recovers</strong><span>: User clicks to retry video</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The key insight: </span><strong>we still need the WebSocket for input</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Keyboard and mouse events are tiny. Like, 10 bytes each. The WebSocket handles those perfectly even on a garbage connection. We just needed to stop sending the massive video frames.</p><p>So we added one control message:</p><p>json</p><pre><code><code>{"set_video_enabled": false}</code></code></pre><p>Server receives this, stops sending video frames. Client polls screenshots instead. Input keeps flowing. Everyone’s happy.</p><p>15 lines of Rust. I am not joking.</p><p>rust</p><pre><code><code>if !video_enabled.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
    continue; // skip frame, it's screenshot time baby
}</code></code></pre><p>We almost shipped a hilarious bug.</p><p>When you stop sending video frames, the WebSocket becomes basically empty. Just tiny input events and occasional pings.</p><p><strong>The latency drops dramatically.</strong></p><p>Our adaptive mode sees low latency and thinks: “Oh nice! Connection recovered! Let’s switch back to video!”</p><p>Video resumes. 40Mbps floods the connection. Latency spikes. Mode switches to screenshots.</p><p>Latency drops. Mode switches to video.</p><p>Latency spikes. Mode switches to screenshots.</p><p><strong>Forever. Every 2 seconds.</strong></p><p><span>The fix was embarrassingly simple: once you fall back to screenshots, </span><strong>stay there until the user explicitly clicks to retry</strong><span>.</span></p><p>typescript</p><pre><code><code>setAdaptiveLockedToScreenshots(true) // no oscillation for you
```

We show an amber icon and a message: "Video paused to save bandwidth. Click to retry."

Problem solved. User is in control. No infinite loops.

## Ubuntu Doesn't Ship JPEG Support in grim Because Of Course It Doesn't

Oh, you thought we were done? Cute.

`grim` is a Wayland screenshot tool. Perfect for our needs. Supports JPEG output for smaller files.

Except Ubuntu compiles it without libjpeg.
```
$ grim -t jpeg screenshot.jpg
error: jpeg support disabled</code></code></pre><p><em>incredible</em></p><p>So now our Dockerfile has a build stage that compiles grim from source:</p><p>dockerfile</p><pre><code><code>FROM ubuntu:25.04 AS grim-build
RUN apt-get install -y meson ninja-build libjpeg-turbo8-dev ...
RUN git clone https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/grim &amp;&amp; \
    meson setup build -Djpeg=enabled &amp;&amp; \
    ninja -C build
```

We're building a screenshot tool from source so we can send JPEGs in 2025. This is fine.
