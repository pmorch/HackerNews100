<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><span>Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai stood smiling in a leafy-green California garden in September 2020 and declared that the IT behemoth was entering the “most ambitious decade yet” in its climate action.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>“Today, I’m proud to announce that we intend to be the first major company to operate carbon free — 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year,” he said, in a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPz-6eCXpCo"><span>video announcement</span></a><span>.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Pichai added that he knew the “road ahead would not be easy,” but Google “aimed to prove that a carbon-free future is both possible and achievable fast enough to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change.”</span></p></div><div><p dir="ltr"><span>Five years on, just how hard Google’s “energy journey” would become is clear. In June, Google’s Sustainability website proudly boasted a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626204437/https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/"><span>headline pledge</span></a><span> to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. By July, that had all changed.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>An investigation by&nbsp;</span><em>Canada’s National Observer</em><span> has found that Google’s net-zero pledge has&nbsp;quietly been scrubbed, demoted from having its own section on the site to an entry in the appendices of the company's sustainability report.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Genna Schnurbach, an external spokesperson for Google,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/sustainability.google/reports/google-2025-environmental-report/__;!!IfJP2Nwhk5Z0yJ43lA!M4oP5acacqxrtEdl52f1SQT4d-pYzAmOrRLnHVshoF7VBBrgaFOK-szSZlvqRfnKtN9xGtYBCsKbszzmD718fuLYmg$"><span>referring to the report</span></a><span>, told us: “As you can see from the document, Google is still committed to their ambition of net zero by 2030.”&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p dir="ltr"><span>By tracing back through the history of Google’s Sustainability website, we found that the company edited it in late June, removing almost all mention of its lauded net-zero goals. (A separate website referring to data centres specifically&nbsp;</span><a href="https://datacenters.google/operating-sustainably/"><span>has maintained its existing language</span></a><span> around net-zero commitments.)&nbsp;</span></p><div>  <blockquote>Five years ago, Google’s climate action ambitions were the gold standard for Big Tech. Then, with power demand spikes from AI data centres, in July it scrubbed its sustainability website of its 2030 net zero pledge.</blockquote>  </div><p dir="ltr"><span>The page on Operating Sustainably has been rebranded to Operations, and the section on net-zero carbon was deleted. In its place is a new priority area: Energy.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>“Running the global infrastructure behind our products and services, including AI, takes considerable energy,” said Google in its Environment 2025 report, which explained that it will be almost impossible to meet its erstwhile net-zero ambitions, partly due to its expansion in AI.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>These significant removals come as Big Tech is racing to build new, power-devouring, hyperscale data centres to capitalize on the global boom in artificial intelligence. They are also coming at a time when the Trump administration has targeted institutions that have environmental ambitions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>“While we remain committed to our climate moonshots, it’s become clear that achieving them is now more complex and challenging across every level — from local to global,” the Google report authors state. In the same report last year, Net Zero Carbon was a key priority.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>First in Big Tech to make net-zero pledge</strong></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>Google, which has data centres in Toronto, Ont., and Montreal, Que., was one of the first tech giants to set sweeping sustainability goals — and it appears to be one of the first to be considering sweeping them out of sight. The latest sustainability reports from Big Tech peers, Microsoft and Amazon, by contrast, still present net-zero emissions as a headline priority area.&nbsp;</span></p><figure role="group"><article>            <picture>                  <source srcset="https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_width_lg_1x/public/img/2025/09/03/drop.png?itok=EF620-6s 1x, https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_width_lg_2x/public/img/2025/09/03/drop.png?itok=VWBS_Ifa 2x" media="all and (min-width: 1024px)" type="image/png" width="1290" height="668">              <source srcset="https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_width_md_1x/public/img/2025/09/03/drop.png?itok=v1AjomkU 1x, https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_width_md_2x/public/img/2025/09/03/drop.png?itok=YzxPXgKQ 2x" media="all and (min-width: 768px)" type="image/png" width="800" height="414">              <source srcset="https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_width_xs_1x/public/img/2025/09/03/drop.png?itok=ORex2_dz 1x, https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_width_xs_2x/public/img/2025/09/03/drop.png?itok=VJSfhfNw 2x" media="all and (min-width: 430px)" type="image/png" width="475" height="246">              <source srcset="https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_width_xxs_1x/public/img/2025/09/03/drop.png?itok=iQBwMtIq 1x, https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_width_xxs_2x/public/img/2025/09/03/drop.png?itok=KZUrml9C 2x" media="all and (max-width: 429px)" type="image/png" width="400" height="207">                  <img loading="lazy" width="1290" height="668" src="https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_width_lg_1x/public/img/2025/09/03/drop.png?itok=EF620-6s" alt="">  </picture>    </article><figcaption>Canada's National Observer used the online tool Wayback Archive to examine the history of Google's operating sustainability page, discovering that it no longer lists net-zero as a headline priority area.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>Google’s yearly electricity consumption increased by 26 per cent in 2024 to 32.2 terrawatt-hours, which is almost as much as the consumption of Ireland.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	  <p>From <a href="https://southpasadenareview.com/2022/11/26/city-council-oks-contract-for-flock-safety-cameras/">Pasadena, California</a> to <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/news/2022/11/28/lexington-s-officials-wanting-to-provide-more-flock-safety-cameras">Lexington, Kentucky</a> to <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/inno/stories/news/2022/03/22/wisconsin-cities-recover-stolen-cars-flock-safety.html">Menasha, Wisconsin</a>, to <a href="https://www.newarkadvocate.com/story/news/2022/11/28/newark-city-council-approves-negotiating-deal-for-flock-safety-cameras/69672495007/">Newark, New Jersey,</a> the surveillance company Flock Safety is blanketing American cities with dangerously powerful and unregulated automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) cameras. While license plate readers have been around for some time, Flock is the first to create a nationwide mass-surveillance system out of its customers’ cameras.</p>
<p>Working with police departments, neighborhood watches, and other private customers, Flock not only allows private camera owners to create their own “hot lists” that will generate alarms when listed plates are spotted, but also runs all plates against state police watchlists and the FBI’s primary criminal database, the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). Flock’s goal is to expand to “every city in the United States,” and its cameras are already <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/about/meet-flock-safety">in use</a> in over 2,000 cities in at least 42 states.</p>
<p>Unlike a targeted ALPR camera system that is designed to take pictures of license plates, check the plates against local hot lists, and then flush the data if there’s no hit, Flock is building a giant camera network that records people’s comings and goings across the nation, and then makes that data available for search by any of its law enforcement customers. Such a system provides even small-town sheriffs access to a sweeping and powerful mass-surveillance tool, and allows big actors like federal agencies and large urban police departments to access the comings and goings of vehicles in even the smallest of towns. And every new customer that buys and installs the company’s cameras extends Flock’s network, contributing to the creation of a centralized mass surveillance system of Orwellian scope. Motorola Solutions, a competitor to Flock, is pursuing a similar business model.</p>
<p>If the police or government leaders are pushing for Flock or another centralized mass-surveillance ALPR system in your community, we urge you to oppose it, full stop. You can do this by urging your local councilperson or other elected representatives to adopt our recommendations into law, attending public meetings and hearings, and raising the profile of the issue by writing letters to the editor and op-eds. You can also use social media to highlight the issues — be sure to tag your elected officials — including by sharing this blog post. If you’re an elected official or community leader, you may also be able to engage directly with your police department — we have found that some departments are willing to do so.</p>
<p>In a few places, residents concerned about privacy and over-policing have successfully blocked their police departments’ acquisition of Flock or other ALPR systems. But, in many other cities, those efforts have been thwarted. In communities where such systems can’t be stopped entirely, we can still help protect our and our neighbors’ civil liberties by working with our local police department and elected officials to ensure that local ALPR cameras do not feed into a mass surveillance system that lets potentially every law enforcement department in the world spy on the residents and visitors of any city in America.</p>
<p>We don’t find every use of ALPRs objectionable. For example, we do not generally object to using them to check license plates against lists of stolen cars, for AMBER Alerts, or for toll collection, provided they are deployed and used fairly and subject to proper checks and balances, such as ensuring devices are not disproportionately deployed in low-income communities and communities of color, and that the “hot lists” they are run against are legitimate and up to date. But there’s no reason the technology should be used to create comprehensive records of everybody’s comings and goings — and that is precisely what ALPR databases like Flock’s are doing. In our country, the government should not be tracking us unless it has individualized suspicion that we’re engaged in wrongdoing. We more fully lay out our concerns with this technology in a March 2022 <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/flock_1.pdf">white paper</a> on Flock, and in a 2013 <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/location-tracking/you-are-being-tracked">report</a> on law enforcement use.</p>
  </div><div>
	  <p>Many police departments neither understand nor endorse Flock’s nationwide, mass surveillance-driven approach to ALPR use, but are adopting the company’s cameras simply because other police departments in their region are doing so. As such, they may be amenable to compromise. That might even include using another vendor that does not tie its cameras into a mass-surveillance system. In other cases, you may be able to get your police department or local legislators to add addendums to Flock’s standard contract that limit its ALPR system’s mass surveillance capabilities and highly permissive data sharing.</p>
<p>In those situations, the three most important areas for regulation and negotiation are how long the data is retained, who the data is shared with, and how that data is used by law enforcement. We obtained samples of Flock’s Government Agency Customer Agreements with the Greensboro, North Carolina Police Department and other Flock contracts with local police. Below is suggested contract language across these three areas, based on these agreements, that you can use in your local advocacy efforts.</p>
  </div><div>
	  <p>Whether ALPRs are being used for Amber Alerts, toll collection, or to identify stolen vehicles, a license plate can be run against a watchlist in seconds. The police do not need records of every person’s coming and goings, including trips to doctor’s offices, religious institutions, and political gatherings.</p>
<p>New Hampshire <a href="https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XXI/261/261-75-b.htm">state law</a>, which requires law enforcement to delete non-hit license plate capture data within three minutes, is a good model. But you should get the shortest retention period you can in your community. From worst to best, here are three approaches that can be taken to the retention of ALPR data:</p>
  </div><div>
	  <p>One of the most important privacy-protective steps you can take is to restrict your community’s ALPR system to local use, meaning local ALPR scans are only checked against locally developed watch lists. Allowing local ALPR data to be used by outside law enforcement creates significant risks. Your local ALPR data could be used to enforce anti-abortion or anti-immigrant laws from other jurisdictions, or even to assist foreign, authoritarian regimes in hunting down political opponents and refugees living in America (Flock’s default provisions give the company a “worldwide” license to use its customers’ APLR data).</p>
<p>These risks are simply not worth taking, especially since there are many other companies that sell locally focused systems. From worst to best, here are three data sharing and use approaches:</p>
  </div><p>As much as we might hope that all police watchlists were 100 percent reliable, we know they are not. In fact, the largest and most commonly used national watch list — the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database — does not even comply with the 1974 United States Privacy Act’s basic accuracy, reliability, and completeness requirements. That means allowing your ALPR data to be run against such databases will subject anyone living in or visiting your town to unjustified arrest and detention, which is an especially dangerous proposition for members of vulnerable, already overpoliced communities. Again, from worst to best, here are three database use approaches:</p><p>In the end, neither local police departments, nor government officials, nor residents should blindly accept Flock’s model simply because it advances Flock’s bottom line, or because other jurisdictions have unwisely chosen to do so. We continue to believe that using Flock cameras should be opposed outright. But where that battle can’t be won, then any system should at least be confined to the community itself and not made part of a national and international mass-surveillance system.</p></div>]]></description>

    <!--lit-part Q5cGFqZt+Y4=--><p>This code snippet is from the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/blob/gh-pages/service-worker/selective-caching/service-worker.js" target="_blank">service worker selective caching sample</a>. (see <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/service-worker/selective-caching/" target="_blank">selective caching live</a>) The code uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage/open"><code>CacheStorage.open()</code></a> to open any <code>Cache</code> objects with a <code>Content-Type</code> header that starts with <code>font/</code>.</p>
<p>The code then uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache/match"><code>Cache.match()</code></a> to see if there's already a matching font in the cache, and if so, returns it. If there isn't a matching font, the code fetches the font from the network and uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache/put"><code>Cache.put()</code></a> to cache the fetched resource.</p>
<p>The code handles exceptions thrown from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch" title="fetch()"><code>fetch()</code></a> operation. Note that an HTTP error response (e.g., 404) will not trigger an exception. It will return a normal response object that has the appropriate error code.</p>
<p>The code snippet also shows a best practice for versioning caches used by the service worker. Though there's only one cache in this example, the same approach can be used for multiple caches. It maps a shorthand identifier for a cache to a specific, versioned cache name. The code also deletes all caches that aren't named in <code>CURRENT_CACHES</code>.</p>
<p>In the code example, <code>caches</code> is a property of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope"><code>ServiceWorkerGlobalScope</code></a>. It holds the <code>CacheStorage</code> object, by which it can access the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage"><code>CacheStorage</code></a> interface.</p>

So it was unusual, according to one longtime editor who was watching the page, that on the afternoon of January 20th, 2025, hours after Elon Musk made a gesture resembling a Nazi salute at a rally following President Donald Trump’s inauguration and well into the ensuing public outcry, no one had added the incident to the encyclopedia.</span></p><p><span>Then, just before 4PM, an editor by the name of PickleG13 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elon_Musk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1270703286#mw-diffpage-visualdiff-cite_note-597">added a single sentence</a> to Musk’s 8,600-word biography: “Musk appeared to perform a Nazi salute,” citing an article in <em>The</em> <em>Jerusalem Post</em>. In a note explaining the change, the editor wrote, “This controversy will be debated, but it does appear and is being reported that Musk may have performed a Hitler salute.” Two minutes later, another editor deleted the line for violating Wikipedia’s stricter standards for unflattering information in biographies of living people.</span></p><p><span>But PickleG13 was correct. That evening, as the controversy over the gesture became a vortex of global attention, another editor called for an official discussion about whether it deserved to be recorded in Wikipedia. At first, the debate on the article’s “talk page,” where editors discuss changes, was much the same as the one playing out across social media and press: it was obviously a Nazi salute vs. it was an awkward wave vs. it couldn’t have been a wave, just look at the touch to his shoulder, the angle of his palm vs. he’s autistic vs. no, he’s antisemitic vs. I don’t see the biased media calling out Obama for doing a Nazi salute in this photo I found on Twitter vs. that’s just a still photo, stop gaslighting people about what they obviously saw. But slowly, through the barbs and rebuttals and corrections, the trajectory shifted.</span></p><p><span>Wikipedia is the largest compendium of human knowledge ever assembled, with more than 7 million articles in its English version, the largest and most developed of 343 language projects. Started nearly 25 years ago, the site was long mocked as a byword for the unreliability of information on the internet, yet today it is, without exaggeration, the digital world’s factual foundation. It’s what Google puts at the top of search results otherwise awash in ads and spam, what social platforms cite when they deign to correct conspiracy theories, and what AI companies scrape in their ongoing quest to get their models to stop regurgitating info-slurry — and consult with such frequency that they are <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/">straining the encyclopedia’s servers</a>. Each day, it’s where <a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/en.wikipedia.org/reading/unique-devices/normal%7Cline%7C2-year%7C(access-site)~mobile-site*desktop-site%7Cdaily">approximately 70 million</a> people turn for reliable information on everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics">particle physics</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ronaldsay_sheep">rare Scottish sheep</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erfurt_latrine_disaster">Erfurt latrine disaster of 1184</a>, a testament both to Wikipedia’s success and to the total degradation of the rest of the internet as an information resource. </span></p><div><p><span><span>“It’s basically the only place on the internet that doesn’t function as a confirmation bias machine.”</span></span></p></div><p><span>But as impressive as this archive is, it is the byproduct of something that today looks almost equally remarkable: strangers on the internet disagreeing on matters of existential gravity and breathtaking pettiness and, through deliberation and debate, building a common ground of consensus reality.</span></p><p><span>“One of the things I really love about Wikipedia is it forces you to have measured, emotionless conversations with people you disagree with in the name of trying to construct the accurate narrative,” said DF Lovett, a Minnesota-based writer and marketer who mostly edits articles about local landmarks and favorite authors but later joined the salute debate to argue that “Elon Musk straight-arm gesture controversy” was a needlessly awkward description. “It’s basically the only place on the internet that doesn’t function as a confirmation bias machine,” he said, which is also why he thinks people sometimes get mad at it. Wikipedia is one of the few platforms online where tremendous computing power isn’t being deployed in the service of telling you exactly what you want to hear.</span></p><p><span>Whether Musk had made a Nazi salute or was merely awkward, the editors decided, was not for them to say, even if they had their opinions. What was a fact, they agreed, was that on January 20th, Musk had “twice extended his right arm toward the crowd in an upward angle,” that many observers compared the gesture to a Nazi salute, and that Musk denied any meaning behind the motion. Consensus was reached. The lines were added back. Approximately 7,000 words of deliberation to settle, for a time, three sentences. This was Wikipedia’s process working as intended.</span></p><p><span>It was at this point that Musk himself cannonballed into the discourse, tweeting that the encyclopedia was “legacy media propaganda!”</span></p><p><span>This was not Musk’s first time attacking the site — that appears to have been in 2019, when he complained that it <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/elon-musk-and-the-rights-war-on-wikipedia/">accurately described</a> him as an early investor in Tesla rather than its founder. But recently he has taken to accusing the encyclopedia of a liberal bias, mocking it as “wokepedia,” and calling for it to be defunded. In so doing, he has joined a growing number of powerful people, groups, and governments that have made the site a target. In August, Republicans on the US House Oversight Committee <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082725-letter-to-Wikimedia.pdf">sent a letter</a> to the Wikimedia Foundation requesting information on attempts to “inject bias” into the encyclopedia and data about editors suspected of doing so.</span></p><div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-1-full.gif"></p><p><em>Musk repeating the salute before saying: “My heart goes out to you.

Because it is edited by thousands of mostly pseudonymous volunteers around the world — and in theory, by anyone who feels like it — its contributors are difficult for any particular state to persecute. Since it’s supported by donations, there is no government funding to cut off or advertisers to boycott. And it is so popular and useful that even highly repressive governments have been hesitant to block it.</span></p><p><span>Instead, they have developed an array of more sophisticated strategies. In Hong Kong, Russia, India, and elsewhere, government officials and state-aligned media have accused the site of ideological bias while online vigilantes harass editors. In several cases, editors have been sued, arrested, or threatened with violence.</span></p><p><span>When several dozen editors gathered in San Francisco this February, many were concerned that the US could be next. The US, with its strong protections for online speech, has historically been a refuge when the encyclopedia has faced attacks elsewhere in the world. It is where the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that supports the project, is based. But the site has become a popular target for conservative media and influencers, some of whom now have positions in the Trump administration. In January, <a href="https://forward.com/news/686797/heritage-foundation-wikipedia-antisemitism/">the <em>Forward</em></a> published slides from the Heritage Foundation, the think tank responsible for Project 2025, <a href="https://forward.com/news/686797/heritage-foundation-wikipedia-antisemitism/">outlining a plan</a> to reveal the identities of editors deemed antisemitic for adding information critical of Israel, a cudgel that the administration <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment">has wielded against academia</a>. </span></p><p><span>“It’s about creating doubt, confusion, attacking sources of trust,” an editor told the assembled group. “It came for the media and now it’s coming for Wikipedia and we need to be ready.”</span></p><hr><p><span>In</span><span> 1967, <a href="https://archives.newyorker.com/newyorker/1967-02-25/flipbook/048/">Hannah Arendt published an essay in <em>The New Yorker</em></a> about what she saw as an inherent conflict between politics and facts. As varieties of truth go, she wrote, facts are fragile. Unlike axioms and mathematical proofs that can be derived by anyone at any time, there is nothing necessary about the fact, to use Arendt’s example, that German troops crossed the border with Belgium on the night of August 4th, 1914, and not some other border at some other time. Like all facts, this one is established through witnesses, testimony, documents, and collective agreement about what counts as evidence — it is political, and as the propaganda machines of the 20th century showed, political power is perfectly capable of destroying it. Furthermore, they will always be tempted to, because facts represent a sort of rival power, a constraint and limit “hated by tyrants who rightly fear the competition of a coercive force they cannot monopolize,” and at risk in democracies, where they are suspiciously impervious to public opinion. Facts, in other words, don’t care about your feelings. “Unwelcome facts possess an infuriating stubbornness,” Arendt wrote.</span></p><p><span>This infuriating stubbornness turns out to be important, though. A lie might be more plausible or useful than a fact, but it lacks a fact’s dumb arbitrary quality of being the case for no particular reason and no matter your opinion or influence. History once rewritten can be rewritten again and becomes insubstantial. Rather than believe the lie, people stop believing anything at all, and even those in power lose their bearings. This gives facts “great resiliency” that is “oddly combined” with their fragility. Having a stubborn common ground of shared reality turns out to be a basic precondition of collective human life — of politics. Even political power seems to recognize this, Arendt wrote, when it establishes ideally impartial institutions insulated from its own influence, like the judiciary, the press, and academia, charged with producing facts according to methods other than the pure exercise of power.</span></p><div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-1-left.jpg"></p><p><em>Leonardo DiCaprio is an American actor and film producer.</em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/3_0d06e1.png"></p><p><em>Outside Wikipedia, original research is a key part of scholarly work.

How to defend it from political attacks is not straightforward. At the conference, many editors felt both that attacks from the Trump administration were a genuine threat and that being cast as “the resistance” risked jeopardizing the encyclopedia’s position of trusted neutrality.</span></p><p><span>“I would really argue not to take the attack approach, to really take the passive approach,” said one editor when someone broached the idea of actively debunking some of the false information swamping the rest of the internet. “People see us as credible because we don’t attack, because we are just providing information to everyone all the time in a boring way. Sometimes boring is good. Boring is <em>credible</em>.”</span></p><p><span>Even the editor at the summit who had been most directly affected by the Trump administration urged against a direct response. Jamie Flood had been a librarian and outreach specialist at the National Agricultural Library, where among other duties she led group trainings and uploaded research on topics like germplasm and childhood nutrition to Wikipedia. Museums and libraries around the world employ such “Wikipedians in residence” to act as liaisons with the encyclopedia’s community for the same reason that <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/22-10-2020-the-world-health-organization-and-wikimedia-foundation-expand-access-to-trusted-information-about-covid-19-on-wikipedia">the World Health Organization partnered</a> with Wikipedia during the covid-19 pandemic to make the latest information available: if you want research to reach the public, there is no better place.</span></p><p><span>Along with several other Wikipedians employed by the federal government, Flood had just been laid off by DOGE, collateral damage in a general dismantling of research and archival institutions. “I’m a casualty of this administration’s war on information,” Flood said.</span></p><div><p><span><span>“‘Imagine a world where all knowledge is freely available to everyone.’”</span></span></p></div><p><span>Still, Wikipedia absolutely should not counterattack, Flood said. “Wikipedia is always in the background. They’re not making a big statement, and I don’t think they should. I’ve been training people for a long time and I still go back to this early quote of Jimmy Wales, one of the founders: ‘Imagine a world where all knowledge is freely available to everyone.’ That’s enough. That’s a statement in and of itself. In a time of misinformation, in a time of suppression, having this place where people can come and bring knowledge and share knowledge, that is a statement.”</span></p><p><span>Wikipedia should be, in other words, as stubborn as a fact. But then, facts are fragile things. </span></p><hr><p><span>A</span><span> common refrain among Wikipedians is that the site works in practice but not in theory. It seems to flout everything we’ve learned about human behavior online: anonymous strangers discussing divisive topics and somehow, instead of dissolving into factions and acrimony, working together to build something of value.</span></p><p><span>The project’s origins go back to 1999. Wales, a former options trader who had founded a laddish web portal called Bomis, wanted to start a free online encyclopedia. He hired an acquaintance from an Ayn Rand listserv that Wales previously ran, a philosophy PhD student named Larry Sanger. Their first attempt, called Nupedia, was not so different from encyclopedias as they have existed since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9die">Diderot’s <em>Encyclopédie</em></a> in 1751. Experts would write articles that went through seven stages of editorial review. It was slow going. After a year, Nupedia had just over 20 articles.</span></p><p><span>In an attempt to speed things along, they decided to experiment with wikis, a web format gaining popularity among open-source software developers that allowed multiple people to collaboratively edit a project. (Wiki is the Hawaiian word for “quick.”) The wiki was intended to be a forum where the general public could contribute draft articles that would then be fed into Nupedia’s peer-review pipeline, but the experts objected and the crowdsourced site was given its own domain, Wikipedia.com. It went live on January 15th, 2001. Within days, it had more articles than all of Nupedia, albeit of varying quality. After a year, Wikipedia had more than 20,000 articles.</span></p><div><p><span><span>“...write about <em>what people believe</em>, rather than <em>what is so</em>”</span></span></p></div><p><span>There were few rules at first, but one that Wales <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikien-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/E3MK6PICICOIS3M7UGRO472OUABHLQE3/#E3MK6PICICOIS3M7UGRO472OUABHLQE3">said</a> was “non-negotiable” was that Wikipedia should be written from a “neutral point of view.” The policy, abbreviated as NPOV, was imported from the “nonbias policy” Sanger had written for Nupedia. But on Wikipedia, Wales considered it as much a “social concept of cooperation” as an editorial standard. If this site was going to be open to anyone to edit, the only way to avoid endless flame wars over who is right was, provocatively speaking, to set questions of truth aside. “We could talk about that and get nowhere,” Wales wrote to the Wikipedia <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-September/006715.html">email list</a>. “Perhaps the easiest way to make your writing more encyclopedic is to write about <em>what people believe</em>, rather than <em>what is so</em>,” he <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Neutral_point_of_view">explained</a>.</span></p><p><span>Ideally, the neutrality principle would allow people of different views to agree, if not on the matter at hand, then at least on what it was they were disagreeing about. “If you’ve got a kind and thoughtful Catholic priest and a kind and thoughtful Planned Parenthood activist, they’re never going to agree about abortion, but they can probably work together on an article,” Wales would later say.</span></p><p><span>This view faced an immediate challenge, which is that people believe all sorts of things: that the Earth <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikien-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/OWRA4PUJFRG5AGD4R3LEQZSRRQL5NKX7/#ZIPOJJHIXN6WSVX2UJFMAOOGBBYNFOVZ">is 6,000 years old</a>, that <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikien-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/C3ESAN47MOASFAFYPN26QE6PPWOXJBSC/#C3ESAN47MOASFAFYPN26QE6PPWOXJBSC">climate change</a> is a scam, that <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikien-l@lists.wikimedia.org/message/4GIYS3ZSO77FLF36NYZZACFPL7BKEXZD/">the Holocaust was a hoax</a>, that <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikien-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/PBZYJFC2OCAFL6HDUDQUUREW3P563CFR/#YK3YM7BOPNQJRELE2N4OUJDUU7TVBDPG">the Irish potato famine was overblown</a>, that <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikien-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/OZBZBM7ZM2L5H52H5TVCMVRFNKM2OD2G/#773R74U5RYSS5VUQ3GN5OLZMGXBAM7CC">chiropractors are all charlatans</a>, that <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikien-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/DZKIXUNU4JYIMKX3Y5XNNN3QGX3CODZS/#DZKIXUNU4JYIMKX3Y5XNNN3QGX3CODZS">they have discovered a new geometry</a>, and that <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikien-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/JOXMMREF5DIHM66QHDUASCHUD4WEDRIL/#67DW2Y5JGJQK3O67HGXVMOHJKDMPDBUK">Mother Teresa was a jerk</a>.</span></p><div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-1-right.png"></p><p><em>Lawrence Mark Sanger is an American Internet project developer and philosopher who cofounded Wikipedia along with Jimmy Wales.</em> </p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-2.png"></p><p><em>Anti-denialist banner at the 2017 Climate March in Washington, DC.</em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-4.jpg"></p><p><em>Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu was an Albanian Indian Catholic nun, founded the Missionaries of Charity, and is a Catholic saint.</em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-3.png"></p><p><em>Young Earth creationism (YEC) is a form of creationism that holds as a central tenet that the Earth and its lifeforms were created by supernatural acts of the Abrahamic God between about 10,000 and 6,000 years ago, contradicting established scientific data that puts the age of Earth around 4.54 billion years.</em></p></div></div><p><span>In response, the early volunteers added another rule. You can’t just say things; any factual claim needs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability">citation that readers can check for themselves</a>. When people started emailing Wales their proofs that Einstein was wrong about relativity, he clarified that the cited source could not be your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research">“original research.”</a> Sorry, Wales <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-September/006718.html">wrote to an Einstein debunker</a>, it doesn’t matter whether your theory is true. When it is published in a physics journal, you can cite that.</span></p><p><span>Instead of trying to ascertain the truth, editors assessed the credibility of sources, looking to signals like whether a publication had a fact-checking department, got cited by other reputable sources, and issued corrections when it got things wrong. </span></p><p><span>At their best, these ground rules ensured debates followed a productive dialectic. An editor might write that human-caused climate change was a fact; another might change the line to say there was ongoing debate; a third editor would add the line back, backed up by surveys of climate scientists, and demand peer-reviewed studies supporting alternate theories. The outcome was a more accurate description of the state of knowledge than many journalists were promoting at the time by giving “both sides” equal weight, and also a lot of work to arrive at. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0541-6">A 2019 study published in <em>Nature</em></a> found that Wikipedia’s most polarizing articles — eugenics, global warming, Leonardo DiCaprio — are the highest quality, because each side keeps adding citations in support of their views. Wikipedia: a machine for turning conflict into bibliographies. </span></p><p><span>Coupled with some technical features of wikis, like the ability for anyone to edit anyone else’s writing, and some early administrative rules, like not being allowed to undo someone else’s edit more than three times per day, users were practically forced to talk through disagreements and arrive at “consensus.” This became Wikipedia’s governing principle.</span></p><p><span>This may make the process sound more peaceful than it is. Disputes were constant. Early on, Sanger, who had remained partial to a more hierarchical, expert-driven model, clashed repeatedly with editors he decried as “anarchists” and demanded greater authority for himself, which the editors rejected. When revenue from Bomis dried up after the dot-com crash, Wales laid Sanger off and took over management of the project.</span></p><p><span>Wales governed from a greater remove, appearing only occasionally to broker peace between warring editors, resolve an impasse, or <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikien-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/XVPJYPIZEOMRQ5L5R4RHP5ITZARJYQLJ/#GHKUV6C26BGYLMEBPKWAQXV77G43YWAC">reassure</a> people that they didn’t need to spend time devising procedures to screen out a sudden influx of neo-Nazis that were planning to overwhelm discussion, because if they showed up, “I will personally ban them all if necessary, and that’s that.” Editors sometimes ironically referred to him as their “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view/Archive_001">God King</a>” or “benevolent dictator,” but he described his role as a sort of constitutional monarch safeguarding the community as it developed the processes to fully govern itself. Because Wikipedia was under a Creative Commons license, anyone who didn’t like the way the project was run could copy it and start their own, as a group of Spanish users did when the possibility of running ads was raised in 2002. The next year Wales established a nonprofit, the Wikimedia Foundation, to raise funds and handle the technical and legal work required to keep the project running. The encyclopedia itself, however, would be entirely edited and managed by volunteers.</span></p><p><span>In early 2004, Wales delegated his moderating powers to a group of elected editors, called the Arbitration Committee. From that point onward, he was essentially another editor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales">screenname Jimbo Wales</a>, liable to have his edits undone like anyone else. He attempted several times to update <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=5987088">his own</a> birthdate to reflect the fact that his mother says he was born slightly before midnight on August 7th, 1966, not on August 8th, as his birth certificate read, only to be reprimanded for editing his own page and trying to cite his own “original research.” (After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jimmy_Wales/Birthdate">several years</a> of debates and citable coverage from reliable sources, August 7th eventually won, with a note explaining the discrepancy.)</span></p><div><p><span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith"><img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.sbnation.com/csk/uploads/verge-features/wikipedia/pqs/AGF.svg" alt="AGF"></a></span></span></p></div><p><span>Over the ensuing two decades, editors amended policies to cope with conspiracy theorists, revisionist historians, militant fandoms, and other perennial goblins of the open web. There were the three core content guidelines of Neutral Point of View, Verifiability, and No Original Research; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars">the five pillars of Wikipedia</a>; and a host of rules around editor conduct, like the injunction to avoid ad hominem attacks and assume good faith of others, defined and refined in interlinked articles and essays. There are specialized forums and noticeboards where editors can turn for help making an article more neutral, figuring out whether a source was reliable, or deciding whether a certain view was fringe or mainstream. By 2005, the pages where editors stipulated policy and debated articles were found to be <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/education/382v-s08/papers/viegas07.pdf">growing faster</a> than the articles themselves. Today, this administrative backend is at least five times the size of the encyclopedia it supports.</span></p><p><span>The most important thing to know about this system is that, like the neutrality principle from which it arose, it largely ignores content to focus on process. If editors disagree about, for example, whether the article for the uninhabited islands claimed by both Japan and China should be titled “Senkaku Islands,” “Diaoyu Islands,” or “Pinnacle Islands,” they first try to reach an agreement on the article’s Talk page, not by arguing who is correct, but by arguing which side’s position better accords with specific Wikipedia policies. If they can’t agree, they can summon an uninvolved editor to weigh in, or file a “request for comment” and open the issue to wider debate for 30 days.</span></p><p><span>If this fails and editors begin to quarrel, they might get called before the Arbitration Committee, but this elected panel of editors will also not decide who is right. Instead, they will examine the reams of material generated by the debate and rule only on who has violated Wikipedia process. They might ban an editor for 30 days for conspiring off-Wiki to sway debate, or forbid another editor from working on articles about Pacific islands over repeated ad hominem attacks, or in extreme cases ban someone for life. Everyone else can go back to debating, following the process this time.</span></p><p><span>As a result, explosive political controversies and ethnic conflicts are reduced to questions of formatting consistency. But because process decides all, process itself can be a source of intense strife. The topics of “gun control” and “the Balkans” are officially designated as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Contentious_topics/list">contentious</a>” due to recurring edit wars, where people keep reverting each other’s edits without attempting to build consensus; so, too, are the Wikipedia manual of style and the question of what information belongs in sidebars. In one infamous battle, debate over whether to capitalize “into” in the film title <em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em> raged for more than 40,000 words.</span></p><div><p><span><span>Because disputes on Wikipedia are won or lost based on who has better followed Wikipedia process, every dispute becomes an opportunity to reiterate the project’s rules and principles</span></span></p></div><p><span>In 2009, law professors David A. Hoffman and Salil K. Mehra <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1360&amp;context=elj">published a paper</a> analyzing conflicts like these on Wikipedia and noted something unusual. Wikipedia’s dispute resolution system does not actually resolve disputes. In fact, it seems to facilitate them continuing forever.</span></p><p><span>These disputes may be crucial to Wikipedia’s success, the researchers wrote. Online communities are in perpetual danger of dissolving into anarchy. But because disputes on Wikipedia are won or lost based on who has better followed Wikipedia process, every dispute becomes an opportunity to reiterate the project’s rules and principles.</span></p><p><span>Trolls who repeatedly refuse to follow the process eventually get banned, but initial infractions are often met with explanations of how Wikipedia works. Several of the editors I spoke with began as vandals only to be won over by someone explaining to them how they could contribute productively. Editors will often restrict who can work on controversial topics to people who have logged a certain number of edits, ensuring that only those bought into the ethos of the project can participate.</span></p><p><span>In 2016, <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22744">researchers published a study</a> of 10 years of Wikipedia edits about US politics. They found that articles became more neutral over time — and so, too, did the editors themselves. When editors arrived, they often proposed extreme edits, received pushback, and either left the project or made increasingly moderate contributions.</span></p><p><span>This is obviously not the reigning dynamic of the rest of the internet. The social platforms where culture and politics increasingly play out are governed by algorithms that have the opposite effect of Wikipedia’s bureaucracy in nearly every respect. Optimized to capture attention, they boost the novel, extreme, and sensational rather than subjecting them to increased scrutiny, and by sending content to users most likely to engage with it, they sort people into clusters of mutual agreement. This phenomenon has many names. Filter bubbles, <a href="https://medium.com/datasociety-points/agnotology-and-epistemological-fragmentation-56aa3c509c6b">epistemological fragmentation</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/353958/online-lies-invisible-rulers-book-successful-misinformation">bespoke realities</a>, the sense that everyone has lost their minds. On Wikipedia, it’s called a “point of view split,” and editors banned it early. You are simply not allowed to make a new article on the same topic. Instead, you must make the case for a given perspective’s place amid all the others while staying, literally, on the same page.</span></p><hr><p><span>In</span><span> February, the conservative organization Media Research Center released a report claiming that “Wikipedia Effectively Blacklists ALL Right-Leaning Media.” It was essentially a summary of a publicly available policy page on Wikipedia that lists discussions about the reliability of sources and color codes them according to the latest consensus — green for generally reliable, yellow for lack of clear consensus, and red for generally unreliable. <em>ProPublica</em> is green because it has an “excellent reputation for fact-checking and accuracy, is widely cited by reliable sources, and has received multiple Pulitzer Prizes.” <em>Newsweek</em> is yellow after a decline in editorial standards following its 2013 acquisition and recent use of AI to write articles. Newsmax, the One America News Network, and several other popular right-leaning sources are red due to repeatedly publishing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/10/dominion-sues-pro-trump-oan-newsmax-overstock-founder-over-election-conspiracies.html">stories that were proven wrong</a>. (As are some left-leaning sources, like Occupy Democrats.) The <em>New York Post</em> (generally unreliable, but marginally reliable on entertainment) used the report as the basis for an editorial titled “<a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/05/opinion/big-tech-must-block-wikipedia-until-it-stops-censoring-and-pushing-disinformation/">Big Tech must block Wikipedia until it stops censoring and pushing disinformation.”</a></span></p><p><span>The page is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources">Reliable sources/Perennial sources</a>, as in sources that are perennially discussed. Editors made the page in 2018 as a repository for past discussions that they could refer to instead of having to repeatedly debate the reliability of the <em>Daily Mail</em> — the first publication to be deprecated, the year before — every time someone tried to cite it. It is not a list of preapproved or banned sources, the page reads. Context matters, and consensus can change.</span></p><p><span>But to Wikipedia’s critics, the page has become a symbol of the encyclopedia’s biases. Sanger, the briefly tenured cofounder, has found a receptive audience in right-wing activist <a href="https://christopherrufo.com/p/larry-sanger-speaks-out">Christopher Rufo</a> and other conservatives by <a href="https://larrysanger.org/2021/06/wikipedia-is-more-one-sided-than-ever/">claiming Wikipedia has strayed from its neutrality principle</a> by making judgments about the reliability of sources. Instead, he argues, it should present all views equally, including things “many Republicans believe,” like the existence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election and the FBI playing a role in the January 6th Capitol attack.</span></p><p><span>Last spring, the reliable source page collided with one of the most intense political flashpoints on Wikipedia, the Israel-Palestine conflict. In April, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_434#Is_it_time_to_re-evaluate_the_ADL%3F">an editor asked</a> whether it was time to reevaluate the reliability of the Anti-Defamation League in light of changes to the way it categorizes antisemitic incidents to include protests of Israel, among other recent controversies. About 120 editors debated the topic for two months, producing text equal to 1.9 <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em>s, or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tomats">tomats</a>,” a standard unit of Wikipedia discourse. The consensus was that the ADL was reliable on antisemitism generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_439#RFC:_The_Anti-Defamation_League">but not when the Israel-Palestine conflict was involved</a>.</span></p><p><span>Unusually for a Wikipedia administrative process, the decision received enormous attention. <em>The Times of Israel</em> <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/wikipedia-rebuffs-jewish-groups-call-to-override-editors-move-against-adl/">called it a “staggering blow” for the ADL</a>, which mustered Jewish groups to petition the foundation to overrule the editors. <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2024/06/26/wikimedia-foundation-statement-volunteer-processes-reliable-sources/">The foundation responded</a> with a fairly technical explanation of how Wikipedia’s self-governing reliability determinations work.</span></p><p><span>In the year since, conservative and pro-Israel organizations have published a series of reports examining the edit histories of articles to make a case that Wikipedia is biased against Israel. In March, the ADL itself issued one such report, called “<a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/editing-hate-how-anti-israel-and-anti-jewish-bias-undermines-wikipedias-neutrality">Editing for Hate</a>,” claiming that a group of 30 “malicious editors” slanted articles to be critical of Israel and favorable to Palestine. As evidence, the report highlights examples like the removal of the phrase “Palestinian terrorism” from the introduction of the article on Palestinian political violence.</span></p><p><span>Yet the edit histories show that these examples are often plucked from long editing exchanges, the outcome of which goes unmentioned. The “terrorism” line that the ADL cited was indeed removed — it had also only just been added, was added back shortly after being cut, then was removed again, added back, and revised repeatedly before editors brokered a compromise on the talk page.</span></p><p><span><em>Breitbart</em>, <em>Pirate Wires</em>, and other right-leaning publications now regularly mine Wikipedia’s lengthy debates for headlines like “How Wikipedia Launders Regime Propaganda,” accusing the site of being a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, or “Cover Up: Wikipedia Editors Propose Deleting Page on Iran Advocating for Israel’s Destruction,” despite the article having just been created and the outcome being to merge the contents into the article on Iran-Israel relations. These reports are a dependable source of viral outrage on X. The strategy also appears effective at convincing lawmakers. In May, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) and 22 other members <a href="https://wassermanschultz.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3330">wrote to the Wikimedia Foundation</a> citing the ADL report and demanding Wikimedia “rein in antisemitism, uphold neutrality.”</span></p><div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-1-left-2.png"></p><p>The term filter bubble was coined by internet activist Eli Pariser, circa 2010.</p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-3-1.png"></p><p><em>Alice O’Connor, better known by her pen name Ayn Rand, was a Russian-born American writer and philosopher.

Last year, a researcher at the conservative <a href="https://manhattan.institute/article/is-wikipedia-politically-biased">Manhattan Institute</a> scraped Wikipedia for mentions of political terms and public officials and used a GPT language model to analyze them for bias. The report found “a mild to moderate” tendency to associate figures on the political right with more negative sentiment than those on the left. The study, which was not peer reviewed, has become a regular fixture in claims of liberal bias on Wikipedia.</span></p><p><span>The report still illustrates the challenges of evaluating the neutrality of a text as vast and stripped of subjective opinion as Wikipedia. An examination of the <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10775984">datasets</a> shows that the passages GPT classified as non-neutral are often anodyne factual statements: that a lawmaker won or lost an election, represented a certain district, or died. It also conflated unrelated people of the same name, so, for example, most of the non-neutral statements about Mike Johnson concern not Mike Johnson the current Republican House Majority Speaker but a robber in a 1923 silent film, a prog-rock guitarist, multiple football players, and a famous yodeler. </span></p><p><span>But the more fundamental question is whether balanced sentiment or balanced anything across the contemporary political spectrum is the correct expectation for a project that operates by a different standard, one based on measures of reliability. Supposing the sentiment readings do reflect a real imbalance, is that due to the biases of editors, biases in their sources, or some other external imbalance, like a tendency by right-leaning politicians to express negative sentiments of fear or anger (a possibility the report raises, then dismisses).</span></p><p><span>Wikipedia has a long history of attempting to disentangle and correct its various biases. The site’s editor community has been overwhelmingly white, male, and based in the United States and Europe since the site began. In 2018, <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Insights/2018_Report/Contributors#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20contributors%20who,and%209.3%25%20identified%20as%20female.">90 percent of editors were men</a>, and only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red">18 percent</a> of biographies in the encyclopedia were of women. That year, the Canadian physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Strickland">Donna Strickland</a> won a Nobel Prize, and people turning to Wikipedia to learn about her discovered she lacked an article.</span></p><div><p><span><span>Women have been historically excluded from the sciences, underrepresented in coverage of the sciences, and therefore underrepresented in the sources Wikipedia editors can cite</span></span></p></div><p><span>But the causal connection between these facts was not straightforward. Women have been historically excluded from the sciences, underrepresented in coverage of the sciences, and therefore underrepresented in the sources Wikipedia editors can cite. An editor had tried to make an article on Strickland several months before the Nobel but was overruled due to a lack of coverage in reliable sources. “Wikipedia is a mirror of the world’s biases, not the source of them. We can’t write articles about what you don’t cover,” <a href="https://x.com/krmaher/status/1047453672790093824">tweeted then-executive director Katherine Maher</a>.</span></p><p><span>Wikipedia’s sourcing guidelines are conservative in their deference to traditional institutions of knowledge production, like established newsrooms and academic peer review, and this means that it is sometimes late to ideas in the process of moving from fringe to mainstream. The possibility that covid-19 emerged from a lab was relegated to a section on conspiracy theories and is only now, after reporting by reliable sources, gaining a toehold on the covid pandemic article. Similarly, as awareness grew of the ways Western academic and journalistic institutions have excluded the perspectives of colonized people, critics argued that Wikipedia’s reliance on these same institutions made it impossible for the encyclopedia to be truly comprehensive.</span></p><p><span>Not all the bias comes from the project’s sources, though. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2378023118823946">A study that attempted to control for offline inequalities</a> by examining only contemporary sociologists of similar achievement found that male academics were still more likely to have articles. As volunteers, editors work on topics they think are important, and the encyclopedia’s emphases and omissions reflect their demographics. Minor skirmishes in World War II and every episode of <em>The Simpsons</em> have an article, some of which are longer than the articles on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Civil_War">Ethiopian civil war</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_the_Maldives">climate change in the Maldives</a>. In an effort to fill in these gaps, the foundation has for several years funded editor recruitment and training initiatives under the banner of “knowledge equity.”</span></p><p><span>“Most editors on Wikipedia are English-speaking men, and our coverage is of things that are of interest to English-speaking men,” said a retired market analyst in Cincinnati who has been editing for over 20 years. “Our sports coverage is second to none. Video games, we got it covered. Wars, the history of warfare, my god. Trains, radio stations... But our coverage of foods from other countries is very low, and there is an absolute systemic bias against coverage of women and people of color.” For her part, she tries to fill gaps around food, creating new articles whenever she encounters a Peruvian chili sauce or African <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fufu">fufu</a> that lacks one.</span></p><p><span>Yet these initiatives have come under attack as “DEI” by conservative influencers and Musk, who <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1871443771424116954?lang=en">called</a> for Wikipedia to be defunded until “they restore balance.”</span></p><div><p><span><span>If you think something is wrong on Wikipedia, you can fix it yourself</span></span></p></div><p><span>These accusations of bias, familiar from attacks on the media and social platforms, encounter some unique challenges when leveled against Wikipedia. Crucially, if you think something is wrong on Wikipedia, you can fix it yourself, though it will require making a case based on verifiability rather than ideological “balance.”</span></p><p><span>Over the years, Wikipedia has developed an immune response to outside grievances. When people on X start complaining about Wikipedia’s suppression of UFO sightings or refusal to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, an editor often restricts the page to people who are logged in and puts up a notice directing newcomers to read the latest debate. If anything important was missed, they are welcome to suggest it, the notice reads, provided their suggestion meets Wikipedia’s rules, which can be read about on the following pages. That is, Wikipedia’s first and best line of defense is to explain how Wikipedia works. </span></p><p><span>Occasionally, people stick around and learn to edit. More often, they get bored and leave.</span></p><hr><p><span>It</span><span> was not unusual for skirmishes to break out over the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International">Asian News International</a>, or ANI. It is the largest newswire service in India, and as its Wikipedia article explains, it has a history of promoting false anti-Muslim and pro-government propaganda. It was these facts that various anonymous editors — not logged into Wikipedia accounts, so appearing only as IP addresses — attempted to remove last spring. </span></p><p><span>As typically happens, an experienced editor quickly reinstated the deleted sentences, noting that they had been removed without explanation. Then came another drive-by edit: actually, ANI is not propaganda and very credible, someone wrote, citing a YouTube video. Reverted: YouTube commentary is not a reliable source. Then another IP address, deleting a sentence about ANI promoting a false viral story about necrophilia in Pakistan. Reverted again. Another IP address, deleting the mention of propaganda with the explanation that the sources were “leftist dogs and swine.”</span></p><p><span>As the edit battle escalated, an editor locked the page so that only people who were logged in and had made a certain number of edits could make changes, ending the barrage of IP addresses.</span></p><p><span>Two months later, ANI sued. </span></p><p><span>The lawsuit revealed that several of the IP addresses had belonged to representatives of ANI attempting to remove unflattering information about the company. Blocked from doing so, ANI sued for defamation under a recent amendment to India’s equivalent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation">Section 230</a> that places stricter requirements on platforms to moderate content. When the Wikimedia Foundation declined to reveal the identities of three editors who had defended the page, the presiding judge said he would ask the government to block the site, threatening to cut off the country with the highest number of English Wikipedia readers after the US and the UK. “If you don’t like India,” <a href="https://www.barandbench.com/news/will-ask-government-to-block-wikipedia-delhi-high-court-contempt-court-notice">the judge said</a>, “please don’t work in India.”</span></p><p><span>During the appeal, Wikimedia’s lawyer argued that disclosing the identities of editors would destroy the encyclopedia’s self-regulating system and expose contributors to reprisals. Also, he noted, the sentences in question, like every assertion on Wikipedia, were only summarizing other sources, and those sources — the publications <em>The Caravan</em> and <em>The Ken — </em>had not been sued for defamation. (As with editors, the foundation’s first response to external threats is often to explain how Wikipedia works.) The judge dismissed the argument, <a href="https://www.barandbench.com/news/ani-versus-wikipedia-what-is-at-stake">saying that</a> journalism might be “read by a hundred people, you don’t bother about it… it does not have the gravitas.” Wikipedia, however, is read by millions.</span></p><p><span>By this point the case had garnered enough coverage to warrant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International_vs._Wikimedia_Foundation">its own Wikipedia page</a>. This seemed to enrage the judge, particularly the line noting that the judge’s demand to reveal the identities of editors had been described as “censorship and a threat to the flow of information.” This “borders on contempt,” the judge said, demanding that the foundation take the page down within 36 hours. In a rare move, the foundation complied.</span></p><p><span>The case alarmed editors around the world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:2024_open_letter_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation">An open letter</a> calling on the Wikimedia Foundation to protect the anonymity of the editors garnered more than 1,300 signatures, the most of any letter directed at the foundation. Nevertheless, last December, the foundation disclosed the editors’ identities to the judge under seal. Responding to outrage on Wikipedia’s editor forum, Wales <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:2024_open_letter_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation/Archive_2">asked for calm</a> and urged people not to jump to conclusions.</span></p><p><span>The Wikimedia Foundation has historically taken a hard line against attempts to influence the project. In 2017, when the Turkish government demanded several articles be deleted, Wikipedia refused and was blocked for nearly three years as it fought to the country’s Constitutional Court and won. For the second half of 2024, <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/who-we-are/transparency/2024-2/user/">the most recent data available</a>, the foundation complied with about 8 percent of requests for user data, compared to Google’s 82 percent and Meta’s 77 percent. And the data provided was sparse, because Wikipedia retains <a href="https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal:Wikimedia_Foundation_Data_Retention_Guidelines">almost none</a>.</span></p><div><p><span><span>Instead of brute censorship, what has emerged is a sort of gray-zone information warfare</span></span></p></div><p><span>But attempts to influence the site have grown more sophisticated. The change is likely due to multiple factors: a global rise of political movements that wish to control independent media, the increased centrality of Wikipedia, and a technical change to the website itself. In 2015, Wikipedia switched to the encrypted HTTPS extension by default, making it impossible to see what pages users visited, only that they were visiting the Wikipedia domain. This meant that governments that had previously been censoring specific articles on opposition figures or historic protests had to choose between blocking all of Wikipedia or none of it. Almost every country save China (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/27/9210475/russia-wikipedia-ban-censorship">and Russia, for several hours</a>) chose to not to block it. This was a victory for open knowledge, but it also meant governments had a greater interest in controlling what was written in the encyclopedia.</span></p><p><span>Instead of brute censorship, what has emerged is a sort of gray-zone information warfare. After mainland China quashed protests against the Hong Kong national security law in 2019, a battle began <a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2021/07/11/wikipedia-wars-how-hongkongers-and-mainland-chinese-are-battling-to-set-the-narrative/">over how the protests would be remembered</a>. Editors in mainland China — which can edit using VPNs — argued for the inclusion of <a href="https://globalvoices.org/2021/09/28/a-veteran-hong-kong-wikipedia-editor-wikipedias-policies-are-vulnerable-to-authoritarian-abuse/">state-friendly media</a> that described the protests as “riots” or “terrorist attacks” while removing citations to independent media for unreliability and bias. In one case, an editor attempted to strip all citations to one of Hong Kong’s premier papers, <em>Apple Daily</em>, hours before it was shut down by the government. By conspiring offline and using fake accounts, they won elections to admin positions and with them the power to see other editors’ IP addresses, which they discussed using to reveal their opponents’ identities to the police. Shortly afterward, the <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikimedia-l@lists.wikimedia.org/message/6ANVSSZWOGH27OXAIN2XMJ2X7NWRVURF/">Wikimedia Foundation banned or restricted</a> more than a dozen editors operating from mainland China, saying that the project had been “infiltrated” and that “some users have been physically harmed as a result.”</span></p><p><span>Russia employed similar tactics after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. State media and government officials attacked Wikipedia in the press with accusations of anti-Russian bias, promulgation of fake news, and foreign manipulation. The site remained accessible, but Russian search engines put a banner above it saying it was in violation of the law. Meanwhile, the government harassed the foundation with a series of fines for publishing “false” information about the military, which the foundation has refused to pay. Finally, on the encyclopedia, state-aligned editors pushed the government’s view while vigilantes <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/russias-6-month-war-on-wikipedia/">doxxed and threatened</a> their opposition. Last year, the head of Wikimedia Russia was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-24/russia-s-wikipedia-shuts-down-under-pressure-from-putin">declared a “foreign agent”</a> and forced to resign from his job as a professor at Moscow State University.</span></p><p><span>In neighboring Belarus, editor Mark Bernstein was doxxed by a pro-Russian group in 2022, arrested, and sentenced to three years of home confinement. As many as five other editors have been detained by Belarusian authorities in recent months, according to media reports and editors.</span></p><p><span>As these battles continued, the Russian government supported the creation of a more compliant alternative, called Ruwiki, which launched early last year with the copying of 1.9 million articles from the originals, edited to reflect the government view. On Ruwiki, edits must comply with Russian laws and are subject to approval from outside experts.

In May, at a hearing on media safety for children, the head of the Russian Duma Committee on the Protection of the Family said that the encyclopedia’s “interpretation of our historical events feels so hostile that we need to raise the issue of blocking this information resource,” and that the encyclopedia’s depiction of history is opposed to Russian “<a href="https://www.moscowtimes.ru/2025/05/15/v-gosdume-prizvali-zablokirovat-v-rossii-vikipediyu-iz-za-vrazhdebnih-traktovok-istorii-a163473">traditional, spiritual values</a>.”</span></p><p><span>The goal of these campaigns is what the Wikimedia Foundation calls “project capture.” The term originates in an independent report the foundation commissioned in response to the takeover of the Croatian-language Wikipedia by a cabal of far-right editors.</span></p><p><span>In 2010, a group of editors won election to admin positions and began citing far-right alternative media to rewrite history. On Croatian Wikipedia, the Nazis invaded Poland to stop a genocide against the German people, Croatia’s role in the Holocaust is foreign propaganda, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratko_Mladi%C4%87">Ratko Mladić</a> was a decorated military leader whose conviction by the UN for genocide (briefly noted quite far down) was the result of an international conspiracy. When other editors attempted to correct the articles, the admins banned them for violating rules against hate speech or harassment.</span></p><p><span>The encyclopedia became so warped that it began receiving press coverage. The Croatian Minister of Education warned students not to use it. In an interview with a Croatian paper, Wales confirmed the foundation was aware of the problem and looking into it. Yet the foundation has a policy of allowing Wikipedia projects to self-govern, and interfering with Croatian Wikipedia risked opening a door to the many governments and companies that want things on Wikipedia changed.</span></p><p><span>Editors mounted a resistance and attempted to vote the admins out, but the admins defeated the attempt using votes from what were later revealed to be dozens of fake accounts. But because the admins were the only ones with the technical ability to trace IP addresses, the opposition had no way to prove this. The cabal now controlled all the levers of power. By 2019, nearly all of the editors who opposed them had been banned or harassed off the project.</span></p><p><span>In 2020, one of the few remaining dissident editors compiled a comprehensive textual and statistical analysis of editing patterns of dozens of accounts and filed a request for an admin to run IP traces to see if they were sock puppets. The admin stalled, then attempted to fudge the traces, but did so in such a transparent way that it was clear the accounts were indeed fakes.</span></p><p><span>This was the evidence required to procedurally break the cabal. High-ranking admins called “stewards” from other-language Wikipedias administered a new vote on banning the Croatian admins. This time, the admins lost. Their ringleader, username Kubura, was banned from all Wikipedia projects forever, a punishment that had been leveled against less than a dozen others in Wikipedia history. <a href="https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/kuburin-pad-dobio-je-globalnu-blokadu-a-njegovi-se-sljedbenici-sada-bez-vode-povlace-15046719">A local daily covered</a> the incident with the headline “Kubura’s Downfall: Banned Globally, His Followers Retreat, Leaderless.”</span></p><div><p><span><span>Wikipedia’s processes are only effective if they are administered by people who believe in the spirit of the project</span></span></p></div><p><span><a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Wikipedia_Disinformation_Assessment-2021">The foundation’s postmortem analysis</a> compared the takeover to “state capture, one of the most pressing issues of today’s worldwide democratic backsliding.” The clique still cited the reliability of sources and invoked rules of debate, but it bent these processes to serve their nationalist purpose. As many governments have discovered, it is extremely difficult to insert propaganda into Wikipedia without running afoul of some rule or another. But what the Croatia capture showed is that Wikipedia’s processes are only effective if they are administered by people who believe in the spirit of the project. If they can be silenced or replaced, it becomes possible to steer the encyclopedia in a different direction. </span></p><div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-1-right-1.png"></p><p><em>Donna Theo Strickland (born May 27th, 1959) is a Canadian optical physicist and pioneer in the field of pulsed lasers.</em> </p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-3-3.png"></p><p><em>A telescope in the Very Large Telescope system producing four orange laser guide stars.</em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-2-3.png"></p><p><em>Oral tradition, or oral lore, is a form of human communication in which knowledge, art, ideas, and culture are received, preserved, and transmitted orally from one generation to another.</em></p></div></div><p><span>One editor I spoke with, who asked to remain anonymous for reasons that will be obvious, had been editing Wikipedia for several years while living in a Middle Eastern country where much other media is tightly controlled. One day he received a call from a member of the intelligence service inviting him to lunch. He cried for hours — everyone knew what this meant. </span></p><p><span>The meeting was cordial but clear. They didn’t want him to stop editing Wikipedia. They wanted his help. They knew the encyclopedia has rules and you can’t just insert flagrant propaganda, but as a respected member of the community, maybe he could edit in ways that were a little friendlier to the government, maybe decide in its favor when certain topics came up for debate. In exchange, maybe the service could help him if he ever got in trouble with the police, for example, over his sexuality; he was gay in a country where that was illegal. </span></p><p><span>He fled the country weeks later. He now edits from abroad, but he knows of five to 10 others who have faced arrest or intimidation over their editing. They must do constant battle with editors he believes to be government agents who push the state’s perspective, debating tirelessly for hours because it is literally their job. </span></p><p><span>It’s a rare person who is able to uproot their life in the service of a volunteer side project. Understandably, many others faced with such threats become more cautious in their editing or stop altogether. Multiple editors based in India said that they now avoid editing topics related to their country. The ANI case had a chilling effect, as have recurring harassment campaigns. The far-right online publication <em>OpIndia</em> regularly accuses Wikipedia of “anti-Hindu and anti-India bias,” in ways that parallel attacks from the US right, down to citations of Manhattan Institute research and quotes from the disgruntled cofounder, Sanger. The organization has published the real names and employers of editors it accuses of being “leftists” or “Islamists,” leading at least one veteran editor to delete their account.</span></p><p><span>Even ancient history can be cause for reprisals. In February, after the release of a Bollywood action film about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhaji">Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj</a>, a 17th-century king who fought the Mughals, accounts on X began whipping up outrage over several facts on Sambhaji’s Wikipedia page that they deemed to be anti-Hindu. When editors reversed attempts to delete the offending lines, another X user posted their usernames and called on government officials to investigate them. Days later, local press reported that the Maharashtra cyber police opened cases against at least four editors.</span></p><div><p><span><span>“If you issue cases and file complaints against editors, they tend not to edit those pages anymore”</span></span></p></div><p><span>“Various editors have left Wikipedia over this persecution, fearing their own safety,” said an Indian Wikipedia editor who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation. “I believe this is completely useful for the right wing, if you issue cases and file complaints against editors, they tend not to edit those pages anymore, fearing for their safety in real life.”</span></p><p><span>He still edits, but mostly sticks to the safer ground of the Roman Empire.</span></p><hr><p><span>In</span><span> April, the Trump administration’s interim US attorney for DC, Edward Martin Jr., <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656720/ed-martin-dc-attorney-wikipedia-nonprofit-threat">sent a letter to the Wikimedia Foundation</a> accusing the organization of disseminating “propaganda” and intimating that it had violated its duties as a tax-exempt nonprofit.</span></p><p><span>From a legal perspective, it was an odd document. The tax status of nonprofits is not generally the jurisdiction of the US attorney for DC, and many of the supposed violations, like having foreign nationals on its board or permitting “the rewriting of key, historical events and biographical information of current and previous American leaders,” are not against the law. Sanger is quoted, criticizing editor anonymity. In several cases, the rules Martin accuses Wikipedia of violating are Wikipedia’s own, like a commitment to neutrality. But the implied threat was clear.</span></p><p><span>“We’ve been anticipating something like this letter happening for some time,” a longtime editor, Lane Rasberry, said. It fits the pattern seen in India and elsewhere. He has been hearing more reports of threats against editors who work on pages related to trans issues and has been conducting security trainings to prevent their identities being revealed. Several US-based editors told me they now avoid politically contentious topics out of fear that they could be doxxed and face professional or legal retaliation. “There are more Wikipedia editors getting threats, more people getting scared,” Rasberry said.</span></p><div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-1-partial.png"></p><p><em>The “little green men” were Russian soldiers who were masked and wore unmarked uniforms upon the outbreak of the Russo–Ukrainian War in 201</em>4.</p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-2-4.png"></p><p><em>The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests (also known by other names) were a series of demonstrations against the Hong Kong government’s introduction of a bill to amend the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance in regard to extradition. </em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-4-2.png"></p><p><em>May 2015 satellite image of the Crimean Peninsula</em>.</p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-6.png"></p><p><em>The owl of Athena, a symbol of knowledge in the Western world.</em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-3-4.png"></p><p><em>Sambhaji, also known as Shambhuraje, ruled from 1681 to 1689 as the second king (Chhatrapati) of the Maratha Empire, a prominent state in early modern India.</em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-5-1.png"></p><p><em>Stanislav Alexandrovich Kozlovsky is a Russian scientist-psychologist and specialist in the field of cognitive neuroscience of memory and perception.</em></p></div></div><p><span>Talking to editors, I encountered a confounding spread of opinions about the seriousness of the threat to Wikipedia, often in the same conversation. The site has sloughed off more than two decades of attacks, and so far the latest round is no different. The Heritage Foundation plan to dox editors has yet to materialize. Musk’s calls for his followers to stop donating have resulted in surges in donations, according to publicly available data.</span></p><p><span>In India, the High Court struck down the order to take down the article about ANI’s defamation case, though the case itself is ongoing. Wikipedia’s critics on the right and in the Silicon Valley elite often propose generative AI as the solution to Wikipedia’s perceived biases, for each user a bespoke source of ideologically agreeable information. Yet all these projects remain wholly reliant on Wikipedia, and so far the most aggressive such initiative, Musk’s Grok, has spent much of its existence flailing between fact-checking Musk’s own conspiracy theories and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/09/grok-ai-praised-hitler-antisemitism-x-ntwnfb">proclaiming itself MechaHitler</a>.</span></p><p><span>But new threats continue to appear. In August, the foundation lost its case arguing for an exemption from the UK’s Online Safety Act, which would force Wikipedia to verify the identities of its editors, though it is continuing to appeal. In Portugal the foundation received a court order arising from a defamation case brought by Portuguese American businessman Cesar DePaço, who objected to information on his page about past criminal allegations and links to the far-right Portuguese party Chega. Complying with the ruling, the foundation struck several facts from his biography and disclosed “a small amount of user data” about eight editors. The foundation is now bringing the case before the European Court of Human Rights. And in the US, there is the recent House Oversight letter.</span></p><p><span>No matter the outcome, these cases contribute to a general increase in pressure on the project’s already strained editors. English Wikipedia has fewer than 40,000 active editors, defined as users who have made five or more edits in the last month. The number of active administrators, crucial to maintaining the site and enforcing policy, peaked in 2008 and now stands at around 450. AI threatens to squeeze the editor pipeline further. The more people who get information from AI summaries of Wikipedia rather than the site itself, the fewer people who will wander down a rabbit hole, encounter an error that needs correcting, and become editors themselves. </span></p><div><p><span><span>“Wikipedia should not be taken for granted.”</span></span></p></div><p><span>At the same time, people are <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.wikinlp-1.12/">using AI</a> to add plausible-looking but false or biased information to the encyclopedia, increasing the workload for editors. Harassment, ideological editing campaigns, government investigations, targeted lawsuits — even if they lead nowhere, they will make the prospect of editing more daunting and increase the odds that current editors burn out. “Wikipedia should not be taken for granted,” Rasberry said. “This is an existential threat.” </span></p><p><span>The first reactions to the Martin letter on the Wikipedia editor forums were radical: the foundation should leave the US, maybe for France, or Iceland, or Germany. This would not be unprecedented, an editor pointed out. The Encyclopédistes fled to <a href="https://library.csun.edu/sca/peek-stacks/encyclopedie">Switzerland</a> when the ancien régime attempted to censor them. Maybe the site should go dark in protest. </span></p><p><span>But moderation soon prevailed. “The community needs to chill on the blackout talk,” wrote an editor by the name of Tazerdadog. “We’re not there yet.” Right now, the best response to these threats is to double down on Wikipedia’s policies, particularly the refusal to be censored and its dedication to neutral point of view, they wrote. </span></p><div><p><span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view"><img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.sbnation.com/csk/uploads/verge-features/wikipedia/pqs/NPOV.svg" alt="NPOV"></a></span></span></p></div><p><span>“I 100% agree with you, Tazerdadog,” replied “Jimbo Wales.” “Emphasizing to the WMF that NPOV is non-negotiable is not really the issue.” In fact, Wales wrote, he is chairing a working group on strengthening the policy. The initiative was announced in March, framed as a response to the <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/03/04/global-trends-2025/">global rise</a> in threats to sources of neutral information, and to a fragmentation of the public’s understanding of the very concepts of neutrality and facts. Wikipedia’s response, it seemed, would be to neutral harder. </span></p><p><span>In May, I met Wales for coffee at a members club in Chelsea where he had been granted an honorary membership after giving a talk. (Wikipedia, as journalists have noted for years, <a href="https://qz.com/98600/wikipedia-founder-jimmy-wales-is-only-worth-1-million">did not make Wales a tech billionaire</a>.) Extravagant bouquets of pastel flowers were arranged in an arch above the doorway and festooned the tables of the interior. Wales, dressed to meet his wife at the Chelsea Flower Show, matched the decor in a green linen suit and floral shirt. He does not, he said, normally dress like a leprechaun. </span></p><p><span>He was not particularly concerned about the attacks on Wikipedia, he said, though he warned that he is “pathologically optimistic.” Wikipedia has been attacked since it began. It fought Turkey’s ban to the Constitutional Court and won. Even Russian Wikipedia has proven resilient. In the US, the government lacks much of the leverage it has deployed against other institutions. Wikipedia doesn’t rely on government funding, and protections for online speech are strong. <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising/2023-24_Report#Average_Amount_by_Fiscal_Year">In the last fiscal year</a>, the foundation took in $170 million in donations, with an average size of about $10.</span></p><p><span>As for the accusations of bias, why not investigate? Whether the attacks are in good faith or bad, it doesn’t really matter, Wales said. The foundation had already decided that it was a good time, given the fragmented and polarizing world, to examine and bolster Wikipedia’s neutrality processes. Wales, leaning over the coffee table, seemed excited at the prospect. </span></p><p><span>“If somebody turns up on a talk page and says, ‘Hey, this article is a mess, it’s wrong. It’s really biased,’ the right answer is to not scream at them and run and hide. The right answer is go, ‘Oh, tell me more. Let’s dig in. Where is it biased? How do we think about how do we fix that?’”</span></p><p><span>Let’s figure out the best methodologies for studying neutrality, Wales said. Let’s look at how editors evaluate the reliability of sources. Maybe Wikipedia does use the label “far-right” more than “far-left,” Wales said, <a href="https://davidrozado.substack.com/p/mentions-of-political-extremism-in-wikipedia">a criticism that has been leveled at the site</a>. Is that because the media uses the term more, and does Wikipedia use the term more or less than the media does, and does the media use the term more because there are more far-right movements in the world today? </span></p><p><span>“You have to chew on these things. There’s no simple answers.”</span></p><p><span>But there are answers. If the social platforms and language models that increasingly shape our understanding of the world are inscrutable black boxes, Wikipedia is the opposite, maybe the most legible, endlessly explainable information management system ever made. For any sentence, there is a source, and a reason that that source was used, and a reason for that reason. </span></p><p><span>“Let’s dig in,” Wales repeated. “Let’s assess the evidence. Let’s talk to a lot of different people. Let’s really try and understand.” Come, be part of the process. His working group is starting to discuss the best approach. The meetings, Wales acknowledged, have been very tedious so far.</span></p><p><span>As for the letter from the interim DC attorney, Trump withdrew Martin’s nomination in May, though he still has a position leading the Justice Department’s retribution-oriented “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/politics/justice-department-rioter-weaponization.html">task force on weaponization</a>.” In any case, the Wikimedia Foundation responded promptly. </span></p><p><span>“The foundation staff spent a lot of passion writing it,” Wales said of the reply. “Then they ran it by me for review, and I was ready to jump in, but I was like, actually, it’s perfect.” </span></p><p><span>“It’s very calm,” Wales said. “Here are the answers to your questions, here is what we do.” It explains how Wikipedia </span><span>works.<span></span></span></p><div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-1-partial-1.png"></p><p><em>An edit-a-thon is an event where some editors of online communities such as Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap (also known as a “mapathon”), and LocalWiki edit and improve a specific topic or type of content. </em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-2-5.png"></p><p><em>The Quaker business method or Quaker decision-making is a form of group decision-making and discernment, as well as of direct democracy, used by Quakers, or members of the Religious Society of Friends, to organise their religious affairs.</em> </p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-4-4.png"></p><p><em>Wikipedia’s goal is to create a well-written, reliable encyclopedia like the</em> Encyclopædia Britannica<em>, except Wikipedia is much, much bigger:</em> Britannica <em>has about 120,000 articles, while the English Wikipedia has over 7 million articles.</em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/WIKI-GLOBE-5.gif"></p><p>The Wikipedia globe.</p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-7.png"></p><p><em>The Wikipedia Monument, located in Słubice, Poland, is a statue designed by Armenian sculptor Mihran Hakobyan honoring Wikipedia contributors.</em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-5-2.png"></p><p><em>Socrates was known to steadfastly assume others around him were acting in good faith.</em></p></div><div tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-3.jpg"></p><p><em>Jimmy Donal Wales (born August 7th, 1966), also known as Jimbo Wales, is an American internet entrepreneur and former financial trader. </em></p></div></div><div><h4>Credits</h4><p><span>Editor: Kevin Nguyen</span><span>Creative director: Kristen Radtke</span><span>Art director/designer: Cath Viginia</span><span>Developer: Graham MacAree</span><span>Copyeditor: Kallie Plagge</span><span>Factchecker: Tiên Nguyễn</span><span>Engagement editors: Esther Cohen &amp; Tristan Cooper</span><span>Managing editor: Kara Verlaney</span><span>Editor-in-chief: Nilay Patel</span><span>Publisher: Helen Havlak</span></p><p>Photos by A.

            <p>A little game by the name of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> just released, and it has thrown platforms into chaos.</p>
<p>As you can see from images captured by the Eurogamer team, the likes of Steam was brought to a grinding halt as many flocked to get their hands on the highly-anticipated sequel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several of us have been unable to add the game to our carts across Xbox, PlayStation and Switch. The PS store, for example, is stuck on Wishlisted at the time of writing.</p>
<p>
In the words of our Connor: "Steam it looks like every step has issues, trying to pay with Paypal is leading to error messages."</p>

I'm not sure that stunt PR acquisition offers are really our thing, but we'll leave that for them to do."</p><p>Perplexity has been providing early access to its own AI browser, which is named Comet.</p><p>The Browser Co. was valued at $550 million last year.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Managers and supervisors brace yourselves: calling the boss a dickhead is not necessarily a sackable offence, a tribunal has ruled.</p><p>The ruling came in the case of an office manager who was sacked on the spot when – during a row – she called her manager and another director dickheads.</p><p>Kerrie Herbert has been awarded almost £30,000 in compensation and legal costs after an employment tribunal found she had been unfairly dismissed.</p><p>The employment judge Sonia Boyes ruled that the scaffolding and brickwork company she worked for had not “acted reasonably in all the circumstances in treating [her] conduct as a sufficient reason to dismiss her”.</p><p>“She made a one-off comment to her line manager about him and a director of the business,” Boyes said. “The comment was made during a heated meeting.</p><p>“Whilst her comment was not acceptable, there is no suggestion that she had made such comments previously. Further … this one-off comment did not amount to gross misconduct or misconduct so serious to justify summary dismissal.”</p><p>The hearing in Cambridge was told Herbert started her £40,000-a-year role at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/northampton" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Northampton</a> firm Main Group Services in October 2018. The business was run by Thomas Swannell and his wife, Anna.</p><p>The tribunal heard that in May 2022 the office manager had found documents in her boss’s desk about the costs of employing her, and became upset as she believed he was going to let her go.</p><p>When Swannell then raised issues about her performance, she began crying, the hearing was told.</p><p>She told the tribunal that she said: “If it was anyone else in this position they would have walked years ago due to the goings-on in the office, but it is only because of you two dickheads that I stayed.”</p><p>She said Swannell retorted: “Don’t call me a fucking dickhead or my wife. That’s it, you’re sacked. Pack your kit and fuck off.”</p><p>Herbert said she asked if he was really firing her and he answered: “Yes I have, now fuck off.”</p><p>The office manager then sued the firm for unfair dismissal.</p><p>The hearing was told that under the terms of her contract, she could be fired for “the provocative use of insulting or abusive language”.</p><p>However, this required she be given a prior warning. Only more serious breaches such as “threatening and intimidating language” would be gross misconduct and warrant summary dismissal.</p><p>Boyes found that Herbert was summarily fired because of her use of the word “dickheads” and ruled that the company had failed to follow proper disciplinary procedures.</p><p>She concluded that calling her bosses dickheads was not sufficient to fire Herbert and ordered the firm to pay £15,042.81 in compensation.</p><p>In her latest judgment she also ruled it had to pay £14,087 towards her legal fees.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Attention is something we “have to protect.” And we have to “pay”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-169544261" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/attention#footnote-1-169544261" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> attention—like a tribute.</span></p><p>But we shouldn’t forget how interesting and overpoweringly pleasurable sustained attention can be. Slowing down makes reality vivid, strange, and hot.</p><p>Let me start with the most obvious example.</p><p>As anyone who has had good sex knows, sustained attention and delayed satisfaction are a big part of it. When you resist the urge to go ahead and get what you want and instead stay in the moment, you open up a space for seduction and fantasy. Desire begins to loop on itself and intensify.</p><p>I’m not sure what is going on here, but my rough understanding is that the expectation of pleasure activates the dopaminergic system in the brain. Dopamine is often portrayed as a pleasure chemical, but it isn’t really about pleasure so much as the expectation that pleasure will occur soon. So when we are being seduced and sense that something pleasurable is coming—but it keeps being delayed, and delayed skillfully—the phasic bursts of dopamine ramp up the levels higher and higher, pulling more receptors to the surface of the cells, making us more and more sensitized to the surely-soon-to-come pleasure. We become hyperattuned to the sensations in our genitals, lips, and skin.</p><p>And it is not only dopamine ramping up that makes seduction warp our attentional field, infusing reality with intensity and strangeness. There are a myriad of systems that come together to shape our feeling of the present: there are glands and hormones and multiple areas of the brain involved. These are complex physical processes: hormones need to be secreted and absorbed; working memory needs to be cleared and reloaded, and so on. The reason deep attention can’t happen the moment you notice something is that these things take time.</p><p><span>What’s more, each of these subsystems update what they are reacting to at a different rate. Your visual cortex can cohere in less than half a second. A stress hormone like cortisol, on the other hand, has a half-life of 60–90 minutes and so can take up to 6 hours to fully clear out after the onset of an acute stressor. This means that if we switch what we pay attention to more often than, say, every 30 minutes, our system will be more or less decohered—different parts will be “attending to” different aspects of reality.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-169544261" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/attention#footnote-2-169544261" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> There will be “attention residue” floating around in our system—leftovers from earlier things we paid attention to (thoughts looping, feelings circling below consciousness, etc.), which crowd out the thing we have in front of us right now, making it less vivid.</span></p><p>Inversely, the longer we are able to sustain the attention without resolving it and without losing interest, the more time the different systems of the body have to synchronize with each other, and the deeper the experience gets.</p><p>Locked in on the same thing, the subsystems begin to reinforce each other: the dopamine makes us aware of our skin, and sensations on the skin ramp up dopamine release, making us even more aware of our skin. A finger touches our belly, and we start to fantasize about where that finger might be going; and so now our fantasies are locked in, too, releasing even more dopamine and making us even more aware of our skin. The more the subsystems lock in, the more intense the feedback loops get. After twenty minutes, our sense of self has evaporated, and we’re in a realm where we do, feel, and think things that would seem surreal in other contexts.</p><p>Similar things happen when we are able to sustain our attention to things other than sex, too. The exact mechanics differ, I presume, but the basic pattern is that when we let our attention linger on something, our bodily systems synchronize and feed each other stimuli in an escalatory loop that restructures our attentional field.</p><p>Almost anything that we are able to direct sustained attention at will begin to loop on itself and bloom.</p><p>To take a dark example, if you focus on your anxiety, the anxiety can begin to loop on itself until you hyperventilate and get tunnel vision and become filled with nightmarish thoughts and feelings—a panic attack.</p><p><span>And you do the same thing with joy. If you learn to pay sustained attention to your happiness, the pleasant sensation will loop on itself until it explodes and pulls you into a series of almost hallucinogenic states, ending in cessation, where your consciousness lets go and you disappear for a while. This takes practice. The practice is called jhanas, and it is sometimes described as the inverse of a panic attack. I have only ever entered the first jhana, once while spending an hour putting our four-year-old to sleep and meditating on how wonderful it is to lie there next to her. It was really weird and beautiful. If you want to know more about these sorts of mental states, I recommend José Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente’s recent write-up of </span><a href="https://nintil.com/jhanas" rel="">his experiences</a><span>, Nadia Asparouhova on </span><a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/06/manufacturing-bliss" rel="">her experiences</a><span>, and her </span><a href="https://nadia.xyz/jhanas#jhanas-are-learned-by-doing-not-reading" rel="">how-to guide</a><span>.</span></p><p>Here is José, whose blog is normally detailed reflections on cell biology and longevity and metascience, describing the second evening of a jhana retreat:</p><blockquote><p>So I went down to the beach. “Kinda nice”, I thought. The sky had a particularly vibrant blue color, the waves had ‘the right size’, their roar was pleasant. I started to walk around trying to continue meditating. I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up (“Huh? I thought”). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling “It’s... always been like this!!!!” “What the fuck??!” followed by “This is too much!! Too much!!!”. The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what “painfully beautiful” means for the first time in my life.</p></blockquote><p><span>The fact that we can enter fundamentally different, and often exhilarating, states of mind by learning how to sustain our attention is fascinating. It makes you wonder what other states are waiting out there. What will happen if you properly pay attention to an octopus?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-169544261" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/attention#footnote-3-169544261" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> What about your sense of loneliness?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-169544261" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/attention#footnote-4-169544261" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> A mathematical idea?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-169544261" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/attention#footnote-5-169544261" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> The weights of a neural net?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-169544261" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/attention#footnote-6-169544261" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> The footnotes here take you to examples of people who have done that. There are so many things to pay attention to and experience.</span></p><p>One of my favorite things to sustain attention toward is art.</p><p>There was a period in my twenties when I didn’t get art. I thought artists were trying to say something, but I felt superior because I thought there had to be better ways of getting their ideas across (and also, better ideas). But then I realized that good art—at least the art I am spontaneously drawn to—has little to do with communication. Instead, it is about crafting patterns of information that, if you feed them sustained attention, will begin to structure your attentional field in interesting ways. Art is guided meditation. The point isn’t the words, but what happens to your mind when you attend to those words (or images, or sounds). There is nothing there to understand; it is just something to experience, like sex. But the experiences can be very deep and, sometimes, transformative.</p><p>In 2019, for example, I saw a performance of Jean Sibelius’s 5th Symphony at the University Hall in Uppsala.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xK2X!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xK2X!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xK2X!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xK2X!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xK2X!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xK2X!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg" width="1456" height="996" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:996,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Vault detail&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="Vault detail" title="Vault detail" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xK2X!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xK2X!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xK2X!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xK2X!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9dd1a48-4d99-46bd-af59-943842790142_2560x1751.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Before the concert began, I spent a few minutes with my eyes closed, doing a body scan, to be fully present when the music began. As the horns at the opening of the piece called out, I decided to keep my eyes closed, so I wouldn’t be distracted by looking at the hands of the musicians. Then… a sort of daydream started up. The mood suggested to me the image of a cottage overlooking a sloping meadow and a thick wood of pines, a few hours from Helsinki. It was a pretty obvious image, since I knew that Sibelius wrote the piece at Aniola, which is 38 km north of Helsinki. But then I saw an old man walking up the meadow and into the house. The camera cut. Through an open door, I saw the man, alone, working at a desk. I saw it as clearly as if it had been projected on a screen before me: the camera moved slowly toward the back of the man.</p><p>Through the window above his desk, I could see a light in the distance. Perhaps it was Helsinki? No, it felt alive, like a being—something alive and growing, something that was headed here. But then again, if you were to see a city from space, watching it sped up by 100,000x, it would look like a being moving through the landscape, spreading, getting closer. The old man sat there for a hundred years, watching the light. There was a sinking feeling in my body.</p><p>One spring, birds fell dead from the sky. They littered the fields, whole droves of them filled the ditches—blue birds, red birds, and black. The man carried them into his woodshed and placed them in waist-high piles.</p><p>The film kept going, and the emotional intensity and complexity gradually ramped up. For the thirty minutes that it took the orchestra to play the three movements of the symphony, I experienced what felt like two or three feature films, all interconnected by some strange emotional logic. In the third movement, a group of hunter-gatherers was living in a cave that reminded me of the entrance to a nuclear waste facility. A girl hiding behind a tree saw men with cars arrive…</p><p>The structure of the music was such that it gave me enough predictability and enough surprise to allow my attention to deeply cohere. The melody lines and harmonies dredged up memories and images from my subconscious, weaving them into a rich cinematic web of stories. Guided by the music, my mind could tunnel into an attentional state where I was able to see things I had never seen before and where I could work through some deep emotional pain that seemed to resolve itself through the images.</p><p>When the music stopped, I barely knew where I was.</p><p>I opened my eyes and remembered that my brother was sitting next to me.</p><p>“What did you think?” I said.</p><p>“I don’t know,” he said. “I felt kind of restless.”</p><p><em>Like always, the research for this essay was funded by the contribution of paying subscribers.

					<p>Building the AI browser for knowledge workers</p>
					</div><div>
					
<p>Today, I’m excited to share an exciting step forward for Atlassian. We’ve entered into an agreement to acquire The Browser Company of New York, the team behind the incredible Dia and Arc browsers.</p>



<p>By combining The Browser Company’s passion for building browsers people love with Atlassian’s deep expertise on how the world’s best teams operate, we have the opportunity to transform how work gets done in the AI era.</p>

<h2>A Browser for Doing, Not Just Browsing</h2>



<p>Today’s browsers weren’t built for work. They were built for browsing – reading the news, watching videos, looking up recipes. And sure, you may do some of those things in your browser during the workday, but most of those tabs represent a task that needs to get done. A meeting to schedule. A design to review. A work item to update in Jira. A memo to write. Before you know it, it’s hard to see through the forest of tabs.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="2043" height="1237" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tab-overload.png" alt="" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tab-overload.png 2043w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tab-overload-300x182.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tab-overload-600x363.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tab-overload-768x465.png 768w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tab-overload-1536x930.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2043px) 100vw, 2043px"></figure>



<p>Here’s the rub: your current browser isn’t designed to help you move any of that work forward. It was designed before the explosion of SaaS apps, and well before the current AI revolution. It’s a bystander in your workflow, treating every tab the same, with no awareness of your work context, no understanding of your priorities, and no help connecting the dots between your tools.</p>



<p>It’s time for a browser that’s actually built for work – a browser that helps you do, not just browse.</p>



<h2>Making Dia the Knowledge Worker’s Browser</h2>



<p>Knowledge workers need a browser designed for their specific needs, not one that’s been built for everyone on the planet. That’s what we will build with The Browser Company. Our vision is to make Dia the browser:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optimized for the SaaS apps where you spend your day.</strong> Whether you’re working in email or a project management tool or a design app, your tabs will be enriched with context that helps move your work forward.</li>
</ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="573" height="450" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/projectdoer_productdemos.gif" alt=""></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Packed with AI skills</strong> and your personal work memory to connect the dots between your apps, tabs, and tasks.</li>
</ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1152" height="648" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dia-search.gif" alt=""></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Built with trust and security in mind</strong>, so you can bring it to the office. While <a href="https://www.inforisktoday.in/whitepapers/gartner-report-future-enterprise-browsers-w-15316">85% of enterprise workflows</a> occur within web browsers, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-04-29-gartner-predicts-25-percent-of-organizations-will-use-secure-enterprise-browsers-to-enhance-remote-access-and-endpoint-security-by-2028">less than 10%</a> of organizations have adopted a secure browser. Security, compliance, and admin controls will be baked into every aspect of Dia.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>



<p>We are set to create a browser knowledge workers will love.</p>



<p>Together, we’re sprinting toward this opportunity, leveraging each other’s strengths. I am stoked for the road ahead and can’t wait to see how we will extend Atlassian’s mission – to unleash the potential of every team – to the browser.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="textsize">
            <p>Users across multiple Eastern European countries&nbsp;reported a significant and ongoing outage affecting a suite of <b>Google</b> services, causing widespread disruption to both work and daily life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BREAKING</a> <b>Google</b> services <b>down</b> in some countries, primarily felt across Southeastern <b>Europe</b> <a href="https://t.co/cMYRYPHFi8">pic.twitter.com/cMYRYPHFi8</a></p>

<p>Reports began flooding into downdetector.com and social media platforms around from users in Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece and other Eastern European countries. The issues appear to be widespread and are affecting core <b>Google</b> products.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><b>Google</b> <b>down</b> in the Caucasus, Turkey, and the Balkans <a href="https://t.co/E2SHOuKOA9">pic.twitter.com/E2SHOuKOA9</a></p>

<p><strong>Which Services Were Impacted?</strong></p>
<p>The outage did not seem to be universal for all <b>Google</b> services, but the affected apps were critical to many:</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube: Users experienced an inability to load videos, with many seeing error messages or an endless loading loop. Both the website and mobile app were affected.</li>
<li><b>Google</b> Maps: The service was failing to load map data, search for locations, or calculate routes, leaving travellers and commuters without navigation assistance.</li>
<li><b>Google</b> Search: In a particularly impactful failure, the core <b>Google</b> Search engine was returning error messages or failing to complete searches for a significant number of users.</li>
<li>Gmail: Some users were reporting issues with sending and receiving emails, though this appeared to be less consistent than the other outages.</li>
<li><b>Google</b> Drive: Access to cloud-stored documents and files was also disrupted for many.</li>
</ul>
<p>The common thread among error messages was a "<em>5xx server error</em>" – a type of error that indicates a problem on <b>Google</b>'s end, not with the user's individual internet connection.</p>

    Melvyn’s passion for the arts, his intellectual curiosity, and his unwavering commitment to public service broadcasting over the last 60-plus years have enriched the lives of millions. Through In Our Time on Radio 4 he has brought depth, insight, and humanity to our airwaves every single week for more than a quarter of a century. 
    
  </blockquote>
</span></p><div data-testid="textComponent"><p>Having presented well over 1,000 episodes of the much-loved BBC Radio 4 series, Melvyn Bragg has made the decision to step down from In Our Time following the series which aired earlier this year. Melvyn has presented every episode of In Our Time since the series first launched in 1998.</p>
<p>In Our Time is regularly one of the BBC’s most listened to on-demand programmes around the world, its appeal spanning generations. It is one of BBC Sounds' most popular podcasts amongst under 35s.</p>
<p>Over the last quarter of a century, Melvyn has skilfully led conversations about everything from the age of the Universe to ‘Zenobia’, Queen of the Palmyrene Empire. He has welcomed the company of the brightest and best academics in their fields, sharing their passion and knowledge with a fascinated audience right around the globe.</p>
<p>While he will be much missed on In Our Time, Melvyn will continue to be a friend of Radio 4 with more to come to celebrate his extraordinary career, and a new series in 2026 (details to be announced soon).</p>
<p>Melvyn Bragg says: "For a programme with a wholly misleading title which started from scratch with a six-month contract, it's been quite a ride! I have worked with many extremely talented and helpful people inside the BBC as well as some of the greatest academics around the world. It's been a great privilege and pleasure. I much look forward to continuing to work for the BBC on Radio 4. Thank you for listening."</p>
<p>Melvyn first joined the BBC in 1961 as a general trainee. His BBC career has spanned the World Service, a ten-year stint presenting Radio 4's Start the Week from 1988 - 1998 as well as numerous arts and culture programmes. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society and of The British Academy and was given a Peerage in 1998 and a Companion of Honour in 2017. Melvyn will continue to work with the BBC on future projects which are yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Tim Davie, BBC Director General, says: “Melvyn’s passion for the arts, his intellectual curiosity, and his unwavering commitment to public service broadcasting over the last 60-plus years have enriched the lives of millions. Through In Our Time on Radio 4 he has brought depth, insight, and humanity to our airwaves every single week for more than a quarter of a century. He leaves behind not just an extraordinary body of work, but a gold standard of broadcasting and interviewing excellence that will inspire generations to come.”</p>
<p>Mohit Bakaya, Director of Speech and Controller of BBC Radio 4 says: "Melvyn has been part of the heartbeat of Radio 4 for over three decades. His fierce intellect, coupled with a wonderful curiosity and extraordinary passion for knowledge marks him out as one of the broadcasting greats. Though we will miss him on In Our Time, he leaves behind a unique legacy: the treasure trove of over 1,000 archive episodes, which are a wonderful resource for all those with a love of learning. I look forward to working with him on new projects for Radio 4.”</p>
<p>To mark the end of an era, later this year Radio 4 will be airing some of Melvyn’s most cherished episodes and there will also be a curated selection on <a title="Opens BBC Sounds in a new window" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/b006qykl" target="_blank">BBC Sounds</a> chosen by some of In Our Time's most notable fans.</p>
<p>In Our Time will be back on Radio 4 with a new presenter who will be announced in due course.</p>

We often live near people of the same race and class. The education system funnels us into the same schools and similar jobs. Online algorithms group us with like-minded people. These relationships are called “bonding” social capital—a term popularized by Robert Putnam in his landmark 2000 book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone" target="_blank">Bowling Alone</a>. 
</p><p>But Putnam also pointed out that what we’re missing is “bridging” social capital—relationships with people unlike us. Most of our friends are of the same <a href="https://www.prri.org/press-release/prri-survey-friendship-networks-of-white-americans-continue-to-be-90-white/" target="_blank">race</a> and <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/socialcapital_nontech.pdf" target="_blank">class</a> as we are.

</p><p>In <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-28833-001" target="_blank">2014 study</a>, researchers conducted a series of experiments on Illinois trains and buses.

</p><p>Other commuters were told to <strong>talk to strangers</strong>; these participants predicted they would have a <strong>negative experience</strong>. They assumed strangers wouldn’t want to talk to them, that strangers wouldn’t like them, and that they would have trouble maintaining a conversation.

In short, we’ve created a world that is precarious and unstable for most people.

I’ve looked at homes for sale in remote areas where I can disappear with my friends and family—where I don’t have to rely on strangers.</p><!----> <!--[!--><!--]--></div><!----></div><!--]--><!--[--><p>27m 51s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>27m 52s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>27m 53s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>27m 54s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>27m 55s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>27m 56s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>27m 57s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>27m 58s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>27m 59s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 0s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 1s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 2s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 3s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 4s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 5s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 6s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 7s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 8s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 9s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 10s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 11s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 12s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 13s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 14s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 15s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 16s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 17s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 18s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 19s</p><!--]--><!--[!--><div><p>28m 20s</p> <p>By the end of these conversations, several participants seemed to realize that they may never see their conversation partner again, and had to say their bittersweet goodbyes.</p><!----></div><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 21s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 22s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 23s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 24s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 25s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 26s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 27s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 28s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 29s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 30s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 31s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 32s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 33s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 34s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 35s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 36s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 37s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 38s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 39s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 40s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 41s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 42s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 43s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 44s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 45s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 46s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 47s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 48s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 49s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 50s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 51s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 52s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 53s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 54s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 55s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 56s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 57s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 58s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>28m 59s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 0s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 1s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 2s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 3s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 4s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 5s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 6s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 7s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 8s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 9s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 10s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 11s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 12s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 13s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 14s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 15s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 16s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 17s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 18s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 19s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 20s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 21s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 22s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 23s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 24s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 25s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 26s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 27s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 28s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 29s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 30s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 31s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 32s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 33s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 34s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 35s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 36s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 37s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 38s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 39s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 40s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 41s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 42s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 43s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 44s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 45s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 46s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 47s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 48s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 49s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 50s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 51s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 52s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 53s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 54s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 55s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 56s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 57s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 58s</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>29m 59s</p><!--]--><!--[!--><div><p>30m 0s</p> <div><!----><p>A few months ago, I was taking the subway to work when a 16-year-old boy slipped on the subway platform and hit his chin on the ground. He stumbled onto the train and stood next to me. I kept my earbuds in and tried to convince myself this wasn’t my problem. Then out of the corner of my eye I saw that he’d split open his chin; blood and tears were gushing down his face. I looked around the train for someone else to help—maybe someone who works with kids. No one even looked up. So I grabbed some tissues from my backpack, turned to him, and told him to hold it against his chin. He was in shock. I tried to calm him down and told him to go to the nurse’s office when he got to school. 
</p><p>All I could think was: What if that was me? Who would help me? Would everyone stand around like they’re doing now?
</p><p>But when I ran out of tissues to stop this kid’s bleeding, people on the train noticed and handed me disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and bandages. We were able to stop the bleeding. When I got off the train, another stranger got up and stood by his side.
</p><p>When we’re wounded, we don’t trust the people around us. We shelter away because we think it’s the only way to be safe. We let strangers suffer because, in this emotional state, everyone is a threat. That means it’s hard to work with others to build the world we want. We’re left to hunker down for the inevitable dystopia that is to come. 
</p><p>But I don’t want to live in that world. I want to feel safe. I want to help others to feel safe. And I want people to do the same for me—regardless of whether I’m a stranger or not.</p><!----> <!--[!--><!--]--></div><!----></div><!--]--><!--]--><!----></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="closing-the-dataframe-scale-gap">Closing the DataFrame scale gap</h2>
<p>The General Availability of Polars Cloud on AWS marks a major milestone in closing the DataFrame scale gap—the historic divide between the ease of pandas locally and the scalability of PySpark remotely. By making Polars Cloud broadly accessible, we bring to life our mission of delivering fast, flexible and open-source data tools that run everywhere, giving users a single API that seamlessly scales from a laptop to the cloud.</p>
<p>Equally significant is the Open Beta of our Distributed Engine, which leverages Polars’ novel streaming architecture to offer not just horizontal but also vertical and diagonal scaling strategies. This design directly addresses the cost, complexity and performance tradeoffs users face today, while making high-performance compute broadly accessible.
Together, these launches represent a step-change: remote execution that feels native, distribution without friction, and an architecture built to meet the future of large-scale data processing head-on.</p>
<h2 id="1-what-is-polars-cloud">1. What is Polars Cloud</h2>
<p>Polars Cloud is a managed data platform that enables you to run <strong>Polars queries remotely in the cloud at scale</strong>. We will manage the cloud infrastructure and the scaling. Besides remote execution, Polars Cloud offers different scaling strategies, where distributed is most important. Our distributed engine uses our OSS streaming engine on the workers. This ensures we stay committed in making OSS Polars better as we will become one of the direct users. Because of Polars’ strength in vertical compute, Polars’ distributed offers not only horizontal, but also diagonal scaling strategies. Here we have a single big worker for tasks that would be better off on a beefy single node and would not benefit from the shuffling overhead. Polars Cloud will allow you to choose the best scaling strategy that fits your use case, offering one API for any scale, meaning you can reduce cost, time, and complexity.</p>
<p>Learn more about Polars Cloud in our initial <a href="https://pola.rs/posts/polars-cloud-what-we-are-building/">announcement post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2-polars-distributed-engine-in-public-beta">2. Polars Distributed Engine in Public Beta</h2>
<p>Our distributed engine is available in Public Beta. We are confident that we achieved a state where our distributed engine is useful and in some cases even one of the best options available. There are of course features we haven’t supported in a distributed manner yet, in that case we will automatically fall back to a single node for that operation. Among many other operations, we can run our <a href="https://github.com/pola-rs/polars-benchmark">PDS-H benchmark</a> fully distributed. If you want to stay updated of what our distributed engine is capable of, keep an eye on the <a href="https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/21487">tracking issue here</a>.</p>
<p>Where I think our distributed engine shines, is combining partitionable queries with order dependent data processing like in this query below.</p>

<p>This query really combines the power of Polars’ single node execution with the scalability of Polars’ distributed. It can horizontally partition over symbols and then utilize Polars’ fast query engine to process the partitions on powerful workers.</p>
<h2 id="3-near-future">3. Near future</h2>
<p>Features that will land soon are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>On premise support</strong></p>
<p>We have begun working on supporting the Polars Cloud distributed architecture on premise. We expect to onboard the first clients in the coming months. Are you interested in on-premise Polars Cloud, contact us via the form below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Live cluster dashboard</strong></p>
<p>The current version of Polars Cloud has a dashboard that shows you summaries of your queries, clusters, vCPU etc. The cluster dashboard we are building will have a direct connection to your cluster, allowing us to show much more information. And because Polars streaming executor is written from scratch, we can add custom tracing that can give you deep insights in the operations that your queries spend time and how much utilization it has at any point in time. The possibilities here are very exciting to me as our vertical integration means we have access to all the information in the stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Orchestration</strong></p>
<p>As we are building a data platform, as minimal version of task orchestration cannot be left out. We don’t aim to replace tools like Airflow or Prefect, but we do want to offer you the option to schedule your queries with Polars Cloud alone. Note that we believe in strong integration with other tools and have therefore chosen for a Polars Cloud client that can directly be used with Polars OSS and popular orchestration tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autoscaling</strong></p>
<p>As we can scale both vertically and horizontally with heterogenous worker sizes, we have unique scaling opportunities. We plan to land vertical and diagonal (where the big worker scales) autoscaling soon. Later we will expand that to horizontal autoscaling as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Catalog support</strong></p>
<p>Our early design partners informed us that most users were using iceberg to load their data. Since then we’ve made a <a href="https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/22450">large effort</a> to make our iceberg support native and distributed. Besides the iceberg table format, we will also expose a catalog so that users can organize their datasets easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-region</strong></p>
<p>Initially we launched in the US East region only. This gives us acceptable latencies for the US and western Europe. We are going to launch multi-region as soon as possible so that all regions will experience minimal latencies.</p>

</p>
<p>
<h2 id="_using-vim-packages">Using Vim packages</h2>


</p>
<div><p>
A Vim "package" is a directory that contains <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/usr_05.html#plugin">plugin</a>s.  Compared to normal
plugins, a package can...
</p><p> be downloaded as an archive and unpacked in its own directory, so the files
  are not mixed with files of other plugins.
</p><p> be a git, mercurial, etc. repository, thus easy to update.
</p><p> contain multiple plugins that depend on each other.
</p><p> contain plugins that are automatically loaded on startup ("start" packages,
  located in "pack/*/start/*") and ones that are only loaded when needed with
  <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html#%3Apackadd">:packadd</a> ("opt" packages, located in "pack/*/opt/*").
</p>
</div>
<div>
                                                        <p><span id="runtime-search-path"><a href="#runtime-search-path">runtime-search-path</a></span><br>
Nvim searches for <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html#%3Aruntime">:runtime</a> files in:
</p><p> 2. all "pack/*/start/*" dirs
</p>
</div>
<div><p>
Note that the "pack/*/start/*" paths are not explicitly included in
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'runtimepath'">'runtimepath'</a>, so they will not be reported by ":set rtp" or "echo &amp;rtp".
Scripts can use <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_list_runtime_paths()">nvim_list_runtime_paths()</a> to list all used directories, and
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_get_runtime_file()">nvim_get_runtime_file()</a> to query for specific files or sub-folders within
the runtime path. Example:</p><pre>" List all runtime dirs and packages with Lua paths.
:echo nvim_get_runtime_file("lua/", v:true)</pre>
<p>Using a package and loading automatically</p>

</div>
<div><p>
Let's assume your Nvim files are in "~/.local/share/nvim/site" and you want to
add a package from a zip archive "/tmp/foopack.zip":</p><pre>% mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo
% cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo
% unzip /tmp/foopack.zip</pre><p>
The directory name "foo" is arbitrary, you can pick anything you like.

</p></div>
<div><p>
You would now have these files under ~/.local/share/nvim/site:</p><pre>pack/foo/README.txt
pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim
pack/foo/start/foobar/syntax/some.vim
pack/foo/opt/foodebug/plugin/debugger.vim</pre><p>
On startup after processing your <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#config">config</a>, Nvim scans all directories in
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'packpath'">'packpath'</a> for plugins in "pack/*/start/*", then loads the plugins.

</p></div>
<p>
To allow for calling into package functionality while parsing your <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#vimrc">vimrc</a>,
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/syntax.html#%3Acolorscheme">:colorscheme</a> and <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/userfunc.html#autoload">autoload</a> will both automatically search under <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'packpath'">'packpath'</a>
as well in addition to <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'runtimepath'">'runtimepath'</a>.  See the documentation for each for
details.

</p>
<p>
In the example Nvim will find "pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim" and load
it.

</p>
<p>
If the "foobar" plugin kicks in and sets the <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'filetype'">'filetype'</a> to "some", Nvim will
find the syntax/some.vim file, because its directory is in the runtime search
path.

</p>
<p>
Nvim will also load ftdetect files, if there are any.

</p>
<p>
Note that the files under "pack/foo/opt" are not loaded automatically, only the
ones under "pack/foo/start".  See <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/pack.html#pack-add">pack-add</a> below for how the "opt" directory
is used.

</p>
<p>
Loading packages automatically will not happen if loading plugins is disabled,
see <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#load-plugins">load-plugins</a>.

</p>
<p>
To load packages earlier, so that plugin/ files are sourced:
    :packloadall
This also works when loading plugins is disabled.  The automatic loading will
only happen once.

</p>
<p>
If the package has an "after" directory, that directory is added to the end of
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'runtimepath'">'runtimepath'</a>, so that anything there will be loaded later.

</p>
<div>
<p>Using a single plugin and loading it automatically</p>

</div>
<div><p>
If you don't have a package but a single plugin, you need to create the extra
directory level:</p><pre>% mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/start/foobar
% cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/start/foobar
% unzip /tmp/someplugin.zip</pre><p>
You would now have these files:</p><pre>pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim
pack/foo/start/foobar/syntax/some.vim</pre><p>
From here it works like above.

</p></div>
<div>
<p>Optional plugins</p>
                                                        <p><span id="pack-add"><a href="#pack-add">pack-add</a></span><br>
To load an optional plugin from a pack use the <code>:packadd</code> command:</p><pre>:packadd foodebug</pre><p>
This searches for "pack/*/opt/foodebug" in <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'packpath'">'packpath'</a> and will find
~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/opt/foodebug/plugin/debugger.vim and source
it.

</p></div>
<p>
This could be done if some conditions are met.  For example, depending on
whether Nvim supports a feature or a dependency is missing.

</p>
<div><p>
You can also load an optional plugin at startup, by putting this command in
your <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#config">config</a>:</p><pre>:packadd! foodebug</pre><p>
The extra "!" is so that the plugin isn't loaded if Nvim was started with
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#--noplugin">--noplugin</a>.

</p></div>
<p>
It is perfectly normal for a package to only have files in the "opt"
directory.  You then need to load each plugin when you want to use it.

</p>

<p>
Since color schemes, loaded with <code>:colorscheme</code>, are found below
"pack/*/start" and "pack/*/opt", you could put them anywhere.  We recommend
you put them below "pack/*/opt", for example
"~/.config/nvim/pack/mycolors/opt/dark/colors/very_dark.vim".

</p>
<div><p>
Filetype plugins should go under "pack/*/start", so that they are always
found.  Unless you have more than one plugin for a file type and want to
select which one to load with <code>:packadd</code>.  E.g. depending on the compiler
version:</p><pre>if foo_compiler_version &gt; 34
  packadd foo_new
else
  packadd foo_old
endif</pre><p>
The "after" directory is most likely not useful in a package.  It's not
disallowed though.

</p></div>

</p>
<p>
This assumes you write one or more plugins that you distribute as a package.

</p>
<p>
If you have two unrelated plugins you would use two packages, so that Vim
users can choose what they include or not.  Or you can decide to use one
package with optional plugins, and tell the user to add the preferred ones with
<code>:packadd</code>.

</p>
<p>
Decide how you want to distribute the package.  You can create an archive or
you could use a repository.  An archive can be used by more users, but is a
bit harder to update to a new version.  A repository can usually be kept
up-to-date easily, but it requires a program like "git" to be available.
You can do both, github can automatically create an archive for a release.

</p>
<div><p>
Your directory layout would be like this:</p><pre>start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim          " always loaded, defines commands
start/foobar/plugin/bar.vim          " always loaded, defines commands
start/foobar/autoload/foo.vim        " loaded when foo command used
start/foobar/doc/foo.txt             " help for foo.vim
start/foobar/doc/tags                " help tags
opt/fooextra/plugin/extra.vim        " optional plugin, defines commands
opt/fooextra/autoload/extra.vim      " loaded when extra command used
opt/fooextra/doc/extra.txt           " help for extra.vim
opt/fooextra/doc/tags                " help tags</pre>

</div>
<div><p>
This allows for the user to do:</p><pre>mkdir ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack
git clone https://github.com/you/foobar.git myfoobar</pre><p>
Here "myfoobar" is a name that the user can choose, the only condition is that
it differs from other packages.

</p></div>
<div><p>
In your documentation you explain what the plugins do, and tell the user how
to load the optional plugin:</p><pre>:packadd! fooextra</pre><p>
You could add this packadd command in one of your plugins, to be executed when
the optional plugin is needed.

</p></div>
<div><p>
Run the <code>:helptags</code> command to generate the doc/tags file.  Including this
generated file in the package means that the user can drop the package in the
pack directory and the help command works right away.  Don't forget to re-run
the command after changing the plugin help:</p><pre>:helptags path/start/foobar/doc
:helptags path/opt/fooextra/doc</pre>
<p>Dependencies between plugins</p>
                                                        <p><span id="packload-two-steps"><a href="#packload-two-steps">packload-two-steps</a></span><br>
Suppose you have two plugins that depend on the same functionality. You can
put the common functionality in an autoload directory, so that it will be
found automatically.  Your package would have these files:

</p></div>
<div><p>
pack/foo/start/one/plugin/one.vim</p><pre>call foolib#getit()</pre><p>
pack/foo/start/two/plugin/two.vim</p><pre>call foolib#getit()</pre><p>
pack/foo/start/lib/autoload/foolib.vim</p><pre>func foolib#getit()</pre><p>
This works, because start packages will be searched for autoload files, when
sourcing the plugins.

</p></div>
<p>

<p>
WORK IN PROGRESS built-in plugin manager! Early testing of existing features
is appreciated, but expect breaking changes without notice.

</p>
<p>
Manages plugins only in a dedicated <span id="vim.pack-directory"><a href="#vim.pack-directory">vim.pack-directory</a></span> (see <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/pack.html#packages">packages</a>):
<code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site/pack/core/opt</code>. <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site</code> needs to
be part of <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'packpath'">'packpath'</a>. It usually is, but might not be in cases like <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#--clean">--clean</a>
or setting <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24XDG_DATA_HOME">$XDG_DATA_HOME</a> during startup. Plugin's subdirectory name matches
plugin's name in specification. It is assumed that all plugins in the
directory are managed exclusively by <code>vim.pack</code>.

</p>
<p>
Uses Git to manage plugins and requires present <code>git</code> executable of at least
version 2.36. Target plugins should be Git repositories with versions as named
tags following semver convention <code>v&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;</code>.

</p>

<div><p>
Basic install and management:
</p><div><p> Add <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/pack.html#vim.pack.add()">vim.pack.add()</a> call(s) to 'init.lua':
</p><pre><code>vim.pack.add({
  -- Install "plugin1" and use default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
  'https://github.com/user/plugin1',
  -- Same as above, but using a table (allows setting other options)
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin1' },
  -- Specify plugin's name (here the plugin will be called "plugin2"
  -- instead of "generic-name")
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/generic-name', name = 'plugin2' },
  -- Specify version to follow during install and update
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin3',
    -- Version constraint, see |vim.version.range()|
    version = vim.version.range('1.0'),
  },
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin4',
    -- Git branch, tag, or commit hash
    version = 'main',
  },
})
-- Plugin's code can be used directly after `add()`
plugin1 = require('plugin1')</code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<p> Restart Nvim (for example, with <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/gui.html#%3Arestart">:restart</a>). Plugins that were not yet
  installed will be available on disk in target state after <code>add()</code> call.
</p><p> To update all plugins with new changes:
</p><p> Execute <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/pack.html#vim.pack.update()">vim.pack.update()</a>. This will download updates from source and
    show confirmation buffer in a separate tabpage.
</p><p> Review changes. To confirm all updates execute <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/editing.html#%3Awrite">:write</a>. To discard
    updates execute <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/editing.html#%3Aquit">:quit</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div><p>
Switch plugin's version:
</p><p> Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have desired <code>version</code>. Let's say, plugin
  named 'plugin1' has changed to <code>vim.version.range('*')</code>.
</p><p><a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/gui.html#%3Arestart">:restart</a>. The plugin's actual state on disk is not yet changed.
</p><p> Execute <code>vim.pack.update({ 'plugin1' })</code>.
</p><p> Review changes and either confirm or discard them. If discarded, revert any
  changes in 'init.lua' as well or you will be prompted again next time you
  run <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/pack.html#vim.pack.update()">vim.pack.update()</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div><p>
Freeze plugin from being updated:
</p><p> Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have <code>version</code> set to current commit hash.
  You can get it by running <code>vim.pack.update({ 'plugin-name' })</code> and yanking
  the word describing current state (looks like <code>abc12345</code>).
</p>
</div>
<div><p>
Unfreeze plugin to start receiving updates:
</p><p> Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have <code>version</code> set to whichever version you
  want it to be updated.
</p>
</div>
<div><p>
Remove plugins from disk:
</p><p> Use <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/pack.html#vim.pack.del()">vim.pack.del()</a> with a list of plugin names to remove. Make sure their
  specs are not included in <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/pack.html#vim.pack.add()">vim.pack.add()</a> call in 'init.lua' or they will
  be reinstalled.

</p><p> If exists, do nothing in this step.
</p><p> If doesn't exist, install it by downloading from <code>src</code> into <code>name</code>
        subdirectory (via <code>git clone</code>) and update state to match <code>version</code>
        (via <code>git checkout</code>).
</p><p> For each plugin execute <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html#%3Apackadd">:packadd</a> (or customizable <code>load</code> function)
      making it reachable by Nvim.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>    Notes:</b></p><p> Installation is done in parallel, but waits for all to finish before

Let’s review: </span></p><ol><li><p><strong>Possibly! </strong><span>In April, I </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/04/job-market-youth/682641/" rel="">published</a><span> an essay in </span><em>The Atlantic</em><span> that raised the possibility that weak hiring among young college graduates might indicate an AI disruption. My observation started with an objective fact: The New York Federal Reserve found that work opportunities for recent college graduates had </span><a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:overview" rel="">“deteriorated noticeably”</a><span> in the previous few months. Among several explanations, including tight monetary policy and general Trumpy chaos, I considered the explanation that companies might be using ChatGPT to do the work they’d historically relied on from young college grads. As David Deming, an economist and the dean of undergraduate studies at Harvard University, told me: “When you think from first principles about what generative AI can do, and what jobs it can replace, it’s the kind of things that young college grads have done” in white-collar firms.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Definitely yes! </strong><span>Soon after my essay went up, several other major news organizations and AI luminaries endorsed even stronger versions of my hedged claim. </span><em>The New York Times</em><span> </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/ai-jobs-college-graduates.html" rel="">said</a><span> that for some recent graduates “the A.I. job apocalypse may already be here.” </span><em>Axios</em><span> </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/29/ai-college-grads-work-jobs" rel="">reported</a><span> that “AI is keeping recent college grads out of work.” In a much-discussed interview </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic" rel="">predicting a labor “bloodbath,”</a><span> Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made the audacious forecast that AI could wipe out</span><em> </em><span>half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years. By June, the narrative that AI was on the verge of obliterating the college-grad workforce was in full bloom. Until … </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Almost certainly no!: </strong><span>As AI panic reached its fever pitch, several whip-smart analysts called the whole premise into question. A report from the Economic Innovation Group </span><a href="https://eig.org/ai-and-jobs-the-final-word/" rel="">took several cuts</a><span> of government data and found “little evidence of AI’s impact on unemployment,” and even less evidence that “AI-exposed workers [were] retreating to occupations with less exposure.” In fact, they pointed out that “the vast majority of firms report that AI had no net impact on their employment.” John Burn-Murdoch at the </span><em>Financial Times</em><span> </span><a href="https://x.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1946220407725384136" rel="">pointed out</a><span> that “the much-discussed contraction in entry-level tech hiring appears to have reversed in recent months.”  The economic commentator Noah Smith </span><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/stop-pretending-you-know-what-ai?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=35345&amp;post_id=168759178&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=6g77v&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" rel="">synthesized</a><span> even more research on this question to reach the conclusion that “the preponderance of evidence seems to be very strongly against the notion that AI is killing jobs for new college graduates, or for tech workers, or for…well, anyone, really.”</span></p></li></ol><p><span>To be honest with you, I considered this debate well and truly settled. </span><em>No</em><span>, I’d come to think, </span><em>AI is probably not wrecking employment for young people</em><span>. But now, I’m thinking about changing my mind again. </span></p><p><span>Last week, I got an email from Stanford University alerting me to yet another crack at this question. In a </span><a href="https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/publications/canaries-in-the-coal-mine/" rel="">new paper</a><span>, several Stanford economists studied payroll data from the private company ADP, which covers millions of workers, through mid-2025. They found that young workers aged 22–25 in “highly AI-exposed” jobs, such as software developers and customer service agents, experienced a 13 percent decline in employment since the advent of ChatGPT. Notably, the economists found that older workers and less-exposed jobs, such as home health aides, saw steady or rising employment. “There’s a clear, evident change when you specifically look at young workers who are highly exposed to AI,” Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson, who wrote the paper with Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/ai-entry-level-job-impact-5c687c84?mod=hp_lead_pos10" rel="">told</a><span> the </span><em>Wall Street Journal</em><span>. </span></p><p><span>In five months, the question of  “Is AI reducing work for young Americans?” has its fourth answer: from </span><em>possibly</em><span>, to </span><em>definitely</em><span>, to </span><em>almost certainly no</em><span>, to</span><em> plausibly yes</em><span>. You might find this back-and-forth annoying. I think it’s fantastic. This is a model for what I want from public commentary on social and economic trends: Smart, quantitatively rich, and good-faith debate of issues of seismic consequence to American society.</span></p><p>To more deeply understand the new Stanford paper, I reached out and scheduled an interview with two co-authors, Erik Brynjolfsson and Bharat Chandar. A condensed and edited version of our interview is below, along with careful analysis of the most important graphs.</p><p><strong>Thompson: </strong><span>What’s the most important thing this paper is trying to do, and what’s the most important thing it finds?</span></p><p><strong>Erik Brynjolfsson</strong><span>: There has been a lot of debate out there about AI and jobs for young people. I was hearing companies telling me one thing while studies were telling me another. I honestly didn't know the answer. We went at this with no agenda.</span></p><p>When we were able to slice the data, lo and behold, subcategories of high-exposed jobs like software developers and customer service agents for people aged 22 to 25 saw a very striking decline in employment in the last few years.</p><p><span>Then we asked, what </span><em>else</em><span> could this be? We brainstormed alternative hypotheses—COVID and remote work, tech over-hiring and pullback, interest rates—and we put in efforts to address and control for all of those, and the results still showed through clearly.</span></p><p>This is not a causal test, to be clear. We didn’t assign the technology to some firms and not others. But it’s a comprehensive observational analysis that controls for all the obvious alternatives we could think of. We’re happy to add more if people suggest them. Right now, there’s a clear correlation between the most-exposed categories and falling employment for young people.</p><p><strong>Thompson: </strong><span>People like to look at graphs, and this will be published as a Q&amp;A on Substack, so why don’t you tell me the key graphs from your paper that make the strongest case for your finding?</span></p><p><strong>Bharat Chandar</strong><span>: I think Figure 1 has drawn a lot of interest, which considers the employment effects among young software engineers/software developers and customer service. We clearly saw hiring decline for young workers specifically, in these occupations.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

This is an occupation you wouldn’t think is very exposed to AI, because a lot of the work is in person and physical. And, indeed, you see the opposite pattern. For entry-level worker, there is faster employment growth. So that suggests this isn’t an economy-wide trend.

Different jobs can have very different AI effects. Early career opportunities in entry-level marketing jobs (which are considered “exposed” to AI) have declined most for young people, while health aides (a job that is not exposed to AI) has seen employment for young workers rise more than old workers.</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Thompson: </strong><span>Other research failed to find any effect of AI on employment for young people. Why is your paper different?</span></p><p><strong>Chandar</strong><span>: The main advantage we have is this data from ADP, which tracks millions of workers every single month. That allows us to dig into what’s happening with much more precision.</span></p><p>I actually wrote a paper a couple of months ago using data from the Current Population Survey [CPS], which is a kind of workforce survey for real-time economic outcomes that researchers rely on a lot. My conclusion was similar to pieces by John Burn-Murdoch and others: Across the entire economy, we weren’t seeing major disruptions in the jobs most exposed to AI. But the tricky thing [with CPS] is that when you narrow your analysis to, say, software engineers aged 22 to 25, the sample sizes get very small. You don’t have the precision to say much that’s definitive.</p><p>That’s where the ADP data comes in. With millions of observations every month, we can cut the data by age and occupation and get reliable estimates even for small groups like 22–25 year-old software engineers.</p><p><strong>Thompson: </strong><span>One piece of the paper that I love is that you specify the effect of AI in occupations where AI is more likely to </span><em>automate</em><span> vs. </span><em>augment</em><span> human work. So, "translate this essay into Spanish" or "format this technical document" is a task that can be automated by existing AI. But drafting a marketing strategy for a company is something where a human worker is necessary and might collaborate with AI. How did this distinction between automation versus augmentation play out in the paper?</span></p><p><strong>Chandar</strong><span>: We have different measures of AI exposure. One we use is from Claude, via the Anthropic Economic Index. They analyze conversations that come into Claude and associate them with tasks and occupations. For each occupation, they give a sense of whether usage is more automative or augmentative. </span><em>Automative</em><span> means my conversation with AI is completely replacing some work I’d have to do. </span><em>Augmentative</em><span> is more like I’m learning by using Claude, asking questions, gaining knowledge, getting validation and feedback. We got an interesting result. For occupations where usage is more automative, we see substantial declines in employment for young people, whereas for augmentative occupations, that’s not true. You can see this in Figures 6 and 7 in the paper. It’s compelling because it shows not all LLM usage results in the same trend. The effect shows up more in the automative uses than the augmentative uses.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

The top graph is telling us that employment is FALLING among jobs where AI can easily automate work done by young people but employment is RISING in occupations where AI complements young workers.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Thompson</strong><span>: What kind of jobs are most automative versus augmentative?</span></p><p><strong>Chandar</strong><span>: For automative occupations, a lot of it is software engineering, auditing, and accounting, where there are well-defined workflows and LLMs are good at doing one-off tasks without a lot of feedback. For augmentative cases, you’re looking at more complex or managerial roles. It’s not, “I’m just offloading my task and I’m set.” There’s more back-and-forth, more strategic thinking on top of using the LLM. For those applications, we don’t see the same patterns.</span></p><p><strong>Thompson</strong><span>: Would it be fair to say that within the same company, access to generative AI tools could reduce employment among young workers in one department—say, the legal department, where young hires just read, and look up stuff, and synthesize what they find, and write up reports—but also increase employment in another department, where the technology is more augmentative? So “AI is killing jobs at Company X” is less accurate than “AI is reducing headcount in Department A and increasing it in Department B.” Is that the story?</span></p><p><strong>Chandar:</strong><span> Exactly. We actually have an analysis that confirms almost exactly that. It’s a little technical, but it’s basically what you just said. In one part of the analysis, we control for the firm and find that even within the same company, the more-exposed jobs are declining relative to the less-exposed jobs. In particular, for the most-exposed jobs, there’s a 13% relative decline in employment compared to the least-exposed jobs. That’s compelling because these aren’t trends driven by firm-level, aggregate economic shocks, like interest-rate changes. You’d expect those to apply at the firm level, but even within the firm you see differences between the more-exposed jobs and the less-exposed jobs.</span></p><p><strong>Thompson: </strong><span>What does this suggest about what AI is good at versus what workers are good at?</span></p><p><strong>Brynjolfsson:</strong><span> This is a little speculative, but important. LLMs learn from what’s written down and codified, like books, articles, Reddit, the internet. There’s overlap between what young workers learn in classrooms, like at Stanford, and what LLMs can replicate. Senior workers rely more on tacit knowledge, which is the tips and tricks of the trade that aren’t written down. It appears what younger workers know overlaps more with what LLMs can replace.</span></p><p><strong>Chandar:</strong><span> One thing I’d add is short-time-horizon tasks vs. long-time-horizon tasks. The strategic thinking that goes into longer-horizon tasks may be something LLMs aren’t as good at, which aligns with why entry-level workers are more affected than experienced workers. Another factor is observable outcomes. Tasks where it’s easy to see whether you did a good job may be more substitutable. tThe nature of the training process means AI should, in general, be better at those.</span></p><p><strong>Thompson: </strong><span>Does this paper have any bearing on the question of how colleges should respond to AI or what should students should study?</span></p><p><strong>Brynjolfsson:</strong><span> One obvious category is: learn how to use AI. Paradoxically, I’ve found that senior coders are more familiar with AI than juniors. Universities haven’t updated their curricula. Maybe universities need to explicitly teach not just the principles of coding but also how to use these tools the way people do on the job. Also, there are many things LLMs aren’t very good at. Many jobs have a physical component that may be increasingly important.</span></p><p><span>So, what did we learn today? I think Noah Smith’s basic approach </span><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/stop-pretending-you-know-what-ai" rel="">here</a><span> is correct. Understanding real-time changes to the economy is hard work, and overconfidence in any direction is unadvisable. But I’m updating in the direction of trusting my initial gut instinct. I think we’re looking at the single most compelling evidence that AI is already affecting the labor force for young people.</span></p><p><span>This fits into a broader theme that I’m trying to bang on about in my work on AI. All this talk about AI as the technology of the future—will it cure cancer in 2030? or, destroy the world in 2027? or accomplish both, maybe within the same month?—can evade the question of what AI is doing to the economy right now. AI infrastructure spending growth is </span><em>already</em><span> keeping annual GDP growth above water. AI is </span><em>already</em><span> creating a cheating crisis in high schools and colleges. AI is having interactions with young and anxious people that are </span><em>already</em><span> having real-world effects. And, just maybe, AI is </span><em>already</em><span> warping the labor market for young people. </span></p><p><span>Someone once asked me recently if I had any advice on how to predict the future when I wrote about social and technological trends. </span><em>Sure</em><span>, I said. </span><em>My advice is that predicting the future is impossible, so the best thing you can do is try to describe the present accurately</em><span>. Since most people live in the past, hanging onto stale narratives and outdated models, people who pay attention to what’s happening as it happens will appear to others like they’re predicting the future when all they’re doing is describing the present.  When it comes to the AI-employment debate, I expect we’ll see many more turns of this wheel. I cannot promise you that I’ll be able to predict the future of artificial intellignece. But I can promise you that I’ll do my best to describe the wheel as it turns.</span></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

Yes, I’m old. I’m a middle-aged programming nerd. My entire life and personal identity are wrapped up in this programming thing for better or worse. I thrive off the dopamine hits from shipping cool things.</span></p><p><span>I was an early adopter of AI coding and a fan until maybe two months ago, when I read the </span><a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">METR study</a><span> and suddenly got serious doubts. In that study, the authors discovered that developers were unreliable narrators of their own productivity. They thought AI was making them 20% faster, but it was actually making them 19% slower. This shocked me because I had just told someone the week before that I thought AI was only making me about 25% faster, and I was bummed it wasn’t a higher number. I was only off by 5% from the developer’s own incorrect estimates.</span></p><p>This was unsettling. It was impossible not to question if I too were an unreliable narrator of my own experience. Was I hoodwinked by the screens of code flying by and had no way of quantifying whether all that reading and reviewing of code actually took more time in the first place than just doing the thing myself?</p><p>So, I started testing my own productivity using a modified methodology from that study. I’d take a task and I’d estimate how long it would take to code if I were doing it by hand, and then I’d flip a coin, heads I’d use AI, and tails I’d just do it myself. Then I’d record when I started and when I ended. That would give me the delta, and I could use the delta to build AI vs no AI charts, and I’d see some trends. I ran that for six weeks, recording all that data, and do you know what I discovered?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png" width="600" height="371" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:371,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:39808,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/i/172538377?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I discovered that the data isn’t statistically significant at any meaningful level.

They’re not showing a sudden spike or hockey-stick line of growth. They’re flat at best. There’s no shovelware surge. There’s no sudden indie boom occurring post-2022/2023. You could not tell looking at these charts when AI-assisted coding became widely adopted. The core premise is flawed. Nobody is shipping more than before.</p><p><span>The impact on human lives is incredible. People are being fired because they’re not adopting these tools fast enough</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-172538377" href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding#footnote-6-172538377" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">6</a></span><span>. People are sitting in jobs they don’t like because they’re afraid if they go somewhere else it’ll be worse. People are spending all this time trying to get good at prompting and feeling bad because they’re failing.</span></p><p>This whole thing is bullshit.</p><p>So if you're a developer feeling pressured to adopt these tools — by your manager, your peers, or the general industry hysteria — trust your gut. If these tools feel clunky, if they're slowing you down, if you're confused how other people can be so productive, you're not broken. The data backs up what you're experiencing. You're not falling behind by sticking with what you know works. If you’re feeling brave, show your manager these charts and ask them what they think about it.</p><p>If you take away anything from this it should be that (A) developers aren't shipping anything more than they were before (that’s the only metric that matters), and (B) if someone — whether it's your CEO, your tech lead, or some Reddit dork — claims they're now a 10xer because of AI, that’s almost assuredly untrue, demand they show receipts or shut the fuck up.</p><p>Now, I know the internet. I know what many of you chumps are going to say before you even say it, so let’s just get into it:</p><ol><li><p><em>“Well, if you just learned how to prompt properly, then you would be a 10x engineer like me.”</em><br><span>Look at the data. There are no new 10xers. If there were — if the 14% of self-proclaimed AI 10xers were actually 10xers — that would more than double the worldwide output of new software. That didn’t happen. And as for you, personally, show me the 30 apps you created this year. I’m not entertaining this without receipts.</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>“Well, it’s a new technology and so much is invested, and it takes time…”</span><br></em><span>Yes, billions of dollars have been invested in these tools. Billions of dollars will continue to be invested in these tools. The problem is that they’re being sold and decisions are being made about them — which affect real people’s lives — as if they work today. Don’t parrot that nonsense to me that it’s a work in progress. It’s September 2025, and we’ve had these tools for years now, and they still suck. Someday, maybe they won’t suck, but we'd better see objective proof of them having an impact on actually shipping things on the large.</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>“Well, maybe it kind of sucks now, but if you don’t adopt it early, you’ll be left behind.”</span><br></em><span>There are no indicators that prompting is hard to learn. Github Copilot themselves say that </span><a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">initially, users only accept 29% of prompted coding suggestions</a><span> (which itself is a wild claim to inefficiency, why would you publicize that?), but with six months of experience, users naturally get better at prompting and that grows to a whopping 34% acceptance rate. Apparently, 6 months of experience only makes you 5% better at prompting.</span></p></li><li><p><em>“Well, maybe quality is going up and things aren’t necessarily shipping faster…”</em><br><span>That doesn’t make any sense. We all know that the industry has taken a step back in terms of code quality by at least a decade. Hardly anyone tests anymore. The last time I heard the phrase “continuous improvement” or “test-driven development” was before COVID. You know as well as I do that if there’s a tool that can make people 10x coders, we’d be drowning in shovelware.</span></p></li><li><p><em>“Well, it’s all website-driven, and people don’t really care about domain names these days; it’s all subdomains on sites like Vercel.”</em><br><span>Shut up. People love their ego domains.</span></p></li><li><p><em>“Well, .ai domain names are up 47% this year…”</em><br><span>Yeah, that’s cause all the startups pivoted to AI. It’s the only way to get money out of investor FOMO. Has the overall amount of domain names gone up at an unprecedented rate, though? No, it hasn’t. Look at the new domains chart.</span></p></li><li><p><em>“Well, if you were a real engineer, you’d know that most of software development is not writing code.”</em><br><span>That’s only true when you’re in a large corporation. When you’re by yourself, when you’re the stakeholder as well as the developer, you’re not in meetings. You're telling me that people aren’t shipping anything solo anymore? That people aren’t shipping new GitHub projects that scratch a personal itch? How does software creation not involve code?</span></p></li></ol></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>The worst possible antitrust outcome (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/03/unpunishing-process/#fucking-shit-goddammit-fuck">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>Well, <em>fuck</em>.</p>
<p>Last year, Google lost an antitrust case to Biden's DoJ. The DoJ lawyers beat Google <em>like a drum</em>, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that Google had deliberately sought to create and maintain a monopoly over search, and that they'd used that monopoly to make search materially worse, while locking competitors out of the market.</p>
<p>In other words, the company that controls 90% of search attained that control by illegal means, and, having thus illegitimately become the first port of call for the information-seeking world, had deliberately worsened its product to make more money:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan">https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan</a></p>
<p>That Google lost that case was a minor miracle. First, because for 40 years, the richest, most terrible people in the world have been running a literal <em>re-education camp for judges</em> where they get luxe rooms and fancy meals and lectures about how monopolies are good, actually:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down">https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down</a></p>
<p>But second, because Judge Amit Mehta decided that the Google case should be shrouded in mystery, suppressing the publication of key exhibits and banning phones, cameras and laptops from the courtroom, with the effect that virtually no one even <em>noticed</em> that the most important antitrust case in tech history, a genuine trial of the century, was underway:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.promarket.org/2023/10/27/google-monopolizes-judicial-system-information-with-trial-secrecy/">https://www.promarket.org/2023/10/27/google-monopolizes-judicial-system-information-with-trial-secrecy/</a></p>
<p>This is really important. The government doesn't have to win an antitrust trial in order to create competition. As the saying goes, "the process is the punishment." Bill Gates was so personally humiliated by his catastrophic performance at his deposition for the Microsoft antitrust trial that he elected not to force-choke the nascent Google, lest he be put back in the deposition chair:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/12/whats-a-murder/#miros-tilde-1">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/12/whats-a-murder/#miros-tilde-1</a><br>
a<br>
But Judge Mehta turned his courtroom into a Star Chamber, a black hole whence no embarrassing information about Google's wicked deeds could emerge. That meant that the only punishment Google would have to bear from this trial would come after the government won its case, when the judge decided on a punishment (the term of art is "remedy") for Google.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he handed down that remedy and it is as bad as it could be. In fact, it is likely the <em>worst</em> possible remedy for this case:</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-browser-after-all-but-theres-a-catch-2000652304">https://gizmodo.com/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-browser-after-all-but-theres-a-catch-2000652304</a></p>
<p>Let's start with what's <em>not</em> in this remedy. Google will not be forced to sell off any of its divisions – not Chrome, not Android. Despite the fact that the judge found that Google's vertical integration with the world's dominant mobile operating system and browser were a key factor in its monopolization, Mehta decided to leave the Google octopus with all its limbs intact:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/19/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/#shiny-and-chrome">https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/19/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/#shiny-and-chrome</a></p>
<p>Google won't be forced to offer users a "choice screen" when they set up their Android accounts, to give browsers other than Chrome a fair shake:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/12/defaults-matter/#make-up-your-mind-already">https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/12/defaults-matter/#make-up-your-mind-already</a></p>
<p>Nor will Google be prevented from bribing competitors to stay out of the search market. One of the facts established in the verdict was that Google had been slipping Apple more than $20b/year in exchange for which, Apple forbore from making a competing search engine. This exposed every Safari and iOS user to Google surveillance, while insulating Google from the threat of an Apple competitor.</p>
<p>And then there's Google's <em>data</em>. Google is the world's most prolific surveiller, and the company boasts to investors about the advantage that its 24/7 spying confers on it in the search market, because Google knows so much about us and can therefore tailor our results. Even if this is true – a big if – it's nevertheless a fucking <em>nightmare</em>. Google has stolen every fact about our lives, in service to propping up a monopoly that lets it steal our <em>money</em>, too. Any remedy worth the name would have required Google to delete ("disgorge," in law-speak) all that data:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/07/revealed-preferences/#extinguish-v-improve">https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/07/revealed-preferences/#extinguish-v-improve</a></p>
<p>Some people in the antitrust world didn't see it that way. Out of a misguided kind of privacy nihilism, they called for Google to be forced to <em>share</em> the data it stole from us, so that potential competitors could tune their search tools on the monopolist's population-scale privacy violations.</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> is what the court has ordered.</p>
<p>As punishment for being convinced of obtaining and maintaining a monopoly, Google will be forced to share sensitive data with <em>lots</em> of other search engines. This will not secure competition for search, but it will certainly democratize human rights violations at scale.</p>
<p>Doubtless there will be loopholes in this data-sharing order. Google will have the right to hold back some of its data (that is, <em>our</em> data) if it is deemed "sensitive." This isn't so much a loop<em>hole</em> as is a loop<em>chasm</em>. I'll bet you a testicle⹋ that Google will slap a "sensitive" label on any data that might be the least bit useful to its competitors.</p>
<p>⹋not one of mine</p>
<p>This means that even if you like data-sharing <em>as</em> a remedy, you won't actually get the benefit you were hoping for. Instead, Google competitors will spend the next decade in court, fighting to get Google to comply with this order.</p>
<p>That's the main reason that we force monopolists to break up after they lose antitrust cases. We <em>could</em> put a bunch of conditions on how they operate, but figuring out whether they're adhering to those conditions and punishing them when they don't is expensive, labor-intensive and time consuming. This data-sharing wheeze is easy to do malicious compliance for, and hard to enforce. It is not an "administrable" policy:</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2022/03/cory-doctorow-vertically-challenged/">https://locusmag.com/2022/03/cory-doctorow-vertically-challenged/</a></p>
<p>This is <em>all</em> downside. If Google complies with the order, it will constitute a privacy breach on a scale never before seen. If they don't comply with the order, it will starve competitors of the one tiny drop of hope that Judge Mehta squeezed out of his pen. It's a catastrophe. An utter, total catastrophe. It has zero redeeming qualities. Hope you like enshittification, folks, because Judge Mehta just handed Google an eternal licence to enshittify the entire fucking internet.</p>
<p>It's impossible to overstate how fucking <em>terrible</em> Mehta's reasoning in this decision is. The Economic Liberties project calls it "judicial cowardice" and compared the ruling to "finding someone guilty for bank robbery and then sentencing him to write a thank you note":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/doj-states-must-appeal-judge-mehtas-act-of-judicial-cowardice-letting-google-keep-its-monopoly-power/">https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/doj-states-must-appeal-judge-mehtas-act-of-judicial-cowardice-letting-google-keep-its-monopoly-power/</a></p>
<p>Matt Stoller says it's typical of today's "lawlessness, incoherence and deference to big business":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/a-judge-lets-google-get-away-with">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/a-judge-lets-google-get-away-with</a></p>
<p>David Dayen's scorching analysis in <em>The American Prospect</em> calls it "embarassing":</p>
<p><a href="https://prospect.org/justice/2025-09-03-embarrassing-ruling-allows-google-search-monopoly/">https://prospect.org/justice/2025-09-03-embarrassing-ruling-allows-google-search-monopoly/</a></p>
<p>Dayen points out the many ways in which Mehta ignored his own findings, ignored the Supreme Court. Mehta wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This court, however, need not decide this issue, because there are independent reasons that remedies designed to eliminate the defendant’s monopoly—i.e., structural remedies—are inappropriate in this case.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, as Dayen points out is literally a federal judge deciding to ignore the law "because reasons."</p>
<p>Dayen says that he doesn't see why Google would even bother appealing this ruling: "since it won on almost every point." But the DoJ <em>could</em> appeal. If MAGA's promises about holding Big Tech to account mean anything at all, the DoJ would appeal.</p>
<p>I'll bet you a testicle⹋ that the DoJ will not appeal. After all, Trump's DoJ now has a cash register at the reception desk, and if you write a check for a million bucks to some random MAGA influencer, they can make all charges disappear:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/02/act-locally/#local-hero">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/02/act-locally/#local-hero</a></p>
<p>⹋again, not one of mine</p>
<p>And if you're waiting for Europe to jump in and act where America won't, don't hold your breath. EU Commission sources leaked to Reuters that the EU is going to drop its multi-billion euro fine against Google because they don't want to make Trump angry:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-adtech-fine-hold-eu-awaits-lower-us-car-duties-sources-say-2025-09-02/">https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-adtech-fine-hold-eu-awaits-lower-us-car-duties-sources-say-2025-09-02/</a></p>
<p>Sundar Pichai gave $1m to Donald Trump and got a seat on the dais at the inaguration. Trump just paid him back, 40,000 times over. Trump is a sadist, a facist, and a rapist – and he's also a remarkably cheap date.</p>
