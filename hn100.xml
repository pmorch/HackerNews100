      <h2>Rails for everything</h2>

      <p><em>Published: 2025-01-01</em></p>

      <p>
        After spending part of my holiday building and deploying a new Rails 8
        application, It's clearer than ever that Rails is awesome, and it's
        especially great for small projects with a single developer.
      </p>

      <h3>Guide is good</h3>

      <p>
        The latest
        <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#Rails-philosophy">Getting Started with Rails</a>
        guide is really excellent. There's a bit of hand waving around
        installing Ruby (which is still more difficult than it needs to be). But
        if you follow it start to finish, you'll have a Rails app
        <strong>in production</strong>. And it isn't just
        <code>hello world</code>. Your app will have authentication, caching,
        rich text, continuous integration, and a database. That's a real
        application.
      </p>

      <p>If you're brand new to Rails, the guide is the best place to start.</p>

      <h3>SQLite is all you need</h3>

      <p>
        SQlite is a great tool, but its focus on backwards compatibility means
        that it wasn't ideal for a production database out of the box. You
        <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/04/15/sqlite-on-Rails-the-how-and-why-of-optimal-performance/">had to add some gems</a>
        to get it ready to perform. However
        <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/10/16/sqlite-supercharges-Rails/">Rails 8</a>
        deals with that for you, and SQLite is ready for production.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that you SQLite is a more robust choice, you don't have to worry
        about spinning up a PostgreSQL server. On top of that, with tools like
        <a href="https://dev.37signals.com/solid-cache/">solid cache</a> you
        don't need to stand up redis either.
      </p>

      <p>Everything is running under Rails and within SQLite. Superb.</p>

      <h3>Easy CI</h3>

      <p>
        After I pushed my initial Rails commit, I got an unexpected email:
        <code>Run failed: CI - main</code>. My first thought was actually a
        malicious actor, but I was wrong.
        <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#continuous-integration-with-github-actions">Rails 8 comes with basic CI config</a>
        and
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions">Github comes with 2000 free minutes per month</a>
        of actions usage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from it being really cool to have CI with no effort, 2000 minutes
        of run time is a lot for solo developer!
      </p>

      <h3>Authentication generator</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise</a> is the
        canonical authentication gem. But it hides a lot of complexity and it's
        not exactly easy to configure correctly, especially for a beginner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rails 8 adds a new authentication generator. It add a simple sign in
        flow for existing users. All you need to do is add a user via the Rails
        console and boom. You can log in.
      </p>

      <p>The generated code is pretty minimal and easy to read about.</p>

      <h3>Easy and fast deploys with Kamal</h3>

      <p>
        I am more than happy to leave deploys to my very smart friends in the
        ops team. To deploy a new Rails 8 app, I just needed to update a few
        items in <code>deploy.yml</code>, follow a few directions, and I had an
        app live! With SSL!
      </p>

      <p>
        Honestly it took less time to get a web app up than it took me to get
        SSL on a Github page.
      </p>

      <p>
        CI + easy deploys might be the best part about Rails 8. Even just using
        the getting started guide, it encourages best practices.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://israilsdead.com/">Rails is not dead</a>; It's better
        than ever. Try using it to make something new this year.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i><a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/">Jacob Vosmaer's blog</a></i></p>

<p>2024-12-31</p>

<p>In this post I will talk about my favourite computer ergonomics hack, a DIY device I call "The Beeper".</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I built the Beeper almost 8 years ago but I have never written a blog post about it and I thought it might be interesting. I do computer work sitting down at a desk at home. When I get focused on my work then I sit still for too long and my body starts hurting. The Beeper solves the sitting still problem.</p>

<p>The Beeper consitst of three parts: the hardware, the firmware runnning on the hardware, and software running on my work computer. If my computer screen is unlocked for too long, the Beeper starts beeping and because it is situated away from my desk I must get up to silence it. Mission accomplished: I stopped sitting still.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>The Beeper is built into a small ABS Hammond <a href="https://www.hammfg.com/electronics/small-case/plastic/1551">1551KTBU</a> enclosure.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/0036-beeper/assets/beeper-outside.jpeg" alt="Exterior of the Beeper"></p>

<p>Inside the enclosure are an Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 development board, a momentary switch and a piezo buzzer. The buzzer is glued to the case.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/0036-beeper/assets/beeper-inside.jpeg" alt="Interior components of the Beeper"></p>

<p>The switch connects to the RST and GND pins of the Huzzah. Pushing the switch resets the microcontroller. The buzzer is connected to a PWM pin and GND.</p>

<p>The Huzzah is powered over its Micro-USB port. I cut a hole in the case that lets the USB plug come through. ABS plastic is easy to drill, cut and file.</p>

<h2>Firmware</h2>

<p>I'm a little fuzzy on how I got the firmware working because it's so long ago and I don't work with ESP8266 or Lua often. I had to upload a <a href="https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html">NodeMCU</a> binary blob to the development board.  I then somehow configured the ESP8266 to connect to our home WiFi network and when it starts up it runs the following Lua script.</p>

<pre><code>
-- init.lua: Beeper firmare

pin0 = 3
pin2 = 4
pin5 = 1

-- Periodically blink the LED connected to pin0
function blink()
  gpio.mode(pin0, gpio.OUTPUT)
  gpio.write(pin0, gpio.HIGH)
  tmr.create():alarm(10000, tmr.ALARM_AUTO, function() 
    gpio.write(pin0, gpio.LOW)
    tmr.create():alarm(100, tmr.ALARM_SINGLE, function()
      gpio.write(pin0, gpio.HIGH)
    end)
  end)
end

-- TCP server that lets us remote-control the device over WiFi
function startserver()
  sv = net.createServer(net.TCP, 30)
  gpio.mode(pin2, gpio.OUTPUT)
  gpio.write(pin2, gpio.HIGH)
  gpio.mode(pin5, gpio.OUTPUT)
  if sv then
    sv:listen(5678, function(conn)
      conn:on("receive", function(sock)
        sock:close()
        gpio.write(pin2, gpio.LOW)
        beep()
      end)
    end)
  end
end

-- The beeping magic
function beep()
  freq = node.random(500) + 500
  delay = node.random(1000) + 1000
  pwm.setup(pin5, freq, 500)
  pwm.stop(pin5)
  tmr.create():alarm(delay/2, tmr.ALARM_SINGLE, function()
    pwm.start(pin5)
    tmr.create():alarm(delay, tmr.ALARM_SINGLE, beep)
  end)
end

blink()
startserver()
</code></pre>

<p>The high level description is that this script blinks an LED every 10s to show that the microcontroller hasn't halted and it starts a TCP server on port 5678. If anything connects to that port the connection handler calls a function called <code>beep()</code> which effectively loops forever because it keeps rescheduling itself with a timer. Every <code>beep()</code> invocation produces a shrill, annoying beep of random pitch and duration. I added the randomness because it makes it harder to mentally tune out the noise.</p>

<p>The only way to get this annoying beeping to stop is to reset the microcontroller with the switch.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>The software running on my laptop is the part I have had to tweak the most over the years. It has the biggest impact on the user experience and it is important to get this right, because if the Beeper is too annoying I will unplug it and then I no longer get the health benefits.</p>

<p>The current iteration of the laptop software is the following script.</p>

<pre><code>
#!/bin/sh
set -e

screen_locked() {
  ioreg -n Root -d1 -a | grep -q CGSSessionScreenIsLocked
}

external_monitor() {
  # The model identifier of my external monitor is EV2785
  system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep -q EV2785
}

do_sleep() {
  sleep_time=1200
  expect_done=$(($(date +%s) + $sleep_time))
  sleep $sleep_time
  delta=$(($(date +%s) - $expect_done))
  if [ $(($delta * $delta)) -gt 100 ]
  then
    echo 'clock skew'
    exit 0
  fi
}

main() {
  do_sleep

  if ! screen_locked &amp;&amp; external_monitor &amp;&amp; ! pgrep -q zoom.us
  then
    echo hello | nc $IP $PORT
  fi
}

main
</code></pre>

<p>This script is started automatically by a macOS LaunchAgent. It sleeps for 20 minutes (which is the time I'm allowing myself not to move), checks if it is appropriate to beep and if so it activates the Beeper. If not then the script exits, macOS restarts it and we wait another 20 minutes.</p>

<p>If my screen is locked then I'm probably not sitting at my desk so we should not beep then. If I'm using my laptop somewhere else in the house away from my desk then the beeping would also be too annoying so we check if the external monitor that sits on my desk is connected to the computer. Finally, after many Zoom calls where I had to ask people to wait while I got up and turned off the beeper, I decided it would be better to not beep while I'm in a meeting.</p>

<p>It's certainly less awkward to not have the Beeper do its magic during a video call but in my experience video calls can be even worse than focused programming when it comes to sitting still too long. Arguably, I should not be suppressing the Beeper then. But I just got fed up with having to explain to the other participants in Zoom calls why I have to get up all the time.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and acknowledgments</h2>

<p>It's a silly device but it works. I am happy about how simple it is. It appears that the 10 seconds it takes for me to get up and push the button are enough to counteract the discomfort caused by sitting still too long.</p>

<p>As a closing thought I want to acknowledge and thank my wife for pointing out to me that I sit still too much and for putting up with the horrible screeching noises from the Beeper for the past 8 years and counting.</p>

<h2>Celebrate the public domain with the Internet Archive in the following ways:</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Register</strong> for our Public Domain Day celebrations on January 22 – both <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/singin-in-the-public-domain-public-domain-day-2025-tickets-1104135491979">virtual</a> and <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/celebrate-public-domain-day-2025-at-the-internet-archive-tickets-1117297439719">in-person</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Submit</strong> a short film to our Public Domain Film Remix <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/12/16/2025-public-domain-day-remix-contest-the-internet-archive-is-looking-for-creative-short-films-made-by-you/">contest</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Explore</strong> the works that have entered the public domain in 2025, below.</li>
</ul>



<p>On January 1, 2025, we celebrate published works from 1929 and published sound recordings from 1924 entering the public domain! The passage of these works into the public domain celebrates our shared cultural heritage. The ability to breathe new life into long forgotten works, remix the most popular and enduring works of the time, and to better circulate the oddities we find in thrift stores, attics, and on random pockets of the internet are now freely available for us all.</p>



<p>While not at the same blockbuster level as 2024 with <a href="https://archive.org/details/steamboat-willie_1928"><em>Steamboat Willie</em>’s</a> passage into the public domain, works from 1929 still inhabit strong cultural significance today. The works of 1929 continue to capture the Lost Generation’s voice, the rise of sound film, and the emerging modern moment of the 1920s.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Musical Compositions</strong></p>



<p>Show tunes and Jazz dominated the year with many standards that we remember today first being published. While best known for the 1952 film of the same name, <a href="https://archive.org/details/singin-in-the-rain-01">Singin’ in the Rain</a> was first published in 1929 and serves as the inspiration for our <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/12/16/2025-public-domain-day-remix-contest-the-internet-archive-is-looking-for-creative-short-films-made-by-you/">remix contest</a> this year. George Gershwin also officially published (and copyrighted) his suite <em>An American in Paris</em> following a premiere in late 1928.</p>



<p>Below is sheet music for some popular compositions of the time.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/singin-in-the-rain-01">Singin’ in the Rain</a></li>

<p>While not a towering work of literature, the first set of comic strips featuring Popeye also are joining the public domain. Popeye first made an appearance in <em>Thimble Theatre</em> on <a href="https://archive.org/details/popeyes-first-appearance-in-thimble-theatre-january-17-1929">January 17, 1929</a>. Initially just a side character for an adventure arc featuring gambling and sailing, Popeye rose quickly to fame. By February 4, 1931 the <em>Thimble Theatre</em> would feature a subtitle, <em>Starring Popeye</em>, before being renamed just Popeye later on.</p>

        <p>Like a shot to your <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pMoBAk-HFIg">dome piece</a>, I'm back to hit you with my annual roundup of what happened in the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/WkVohPC_YpU?t=37">rumble-tumble</a> game of databases. Yes, I used to write this article on the <a target="_blank" href="https://ottertune.com/">OtterTune</a> blog, but the company is dead (RIP). I'm doing this joint on my professor blog.</p>
<p>There is much to cover from the past year, from 10-figure acquisitions, vendors running wild in the streets with license changes, and the most famous database octogenarian splashing cash to recruit a college quarterback to impress his new dimepiece.</p>
<p>I promised my first wife that I would write more professionally this year. I have also been informed that some universities assign my annual blog articles as required reading in their database courses. Let's see how it goes.</p>

<!-- *************** #1: LICENSES *************** -->
<h2 id="licenses">It’s My Database and I’m Going to License it the Way I Want! </h2>
<p>We live in the golden era of databases. There are many excellent (<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/8Woy5I511L8">relational</a>) choices for all types of application domains. Many are open-source despite being built by for-profit companies backed by VC money.</p>
<p>But VCs want that money back and their <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/1Za8BtLgKv8?t=290">trap</a> full, so these companies turn out a hosted service for their DBMSs on the cloud. But the cloud makes open-source DBMSs a tricky business. If a system becomes too popular, then a cloud vendor (like Amazon) slaps it up as a service and makes more money than the company paying for the development of the software. This threat is why many database companies change to more restrictive source code licenses that protect against cloud vendors from reselling their products. MongoDB was among the first to do this <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/">in 2018</a> when they switched to their <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Public_License">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL).</p>
<p>This past year was a turbulent one for license changes, and the most prominent two were Redis™ and Elasticsearch.</p>
<h4 id="licenses-redis">Redis:</h4>
<p>Redis Ltd. (the company) is on an aggressive path towards its IPO. Originally starting as Redis Labs in 2011, they switched their name to <a target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/blog/becoming-one-redis/">Redis Ltd. in 2021</a> when they acquired the Redis trademark from its creator (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/antirez">Salvatore Sanfilippo</a>), who Redis Labs had bankrolled. Over the last few years, Redis Ltd. has attempted to consolidate control over the Redis landscape. The company has also tried to cast off the perception that the system is primarily used as an in-memory cache by adding support for vectors and other data models.</p>
<p>In March 2024, Redis Ltd. announced they were <a target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/">switching</a> from the system's original (very permissive) <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD-3</a> license to a dual license comprising the proprietary <a target="_blank" href="https://redis.com/legal/rsalv2-agreement/">Redis Source Available License</a> and MongoDB's SSPL. The company announced this change the same day they announced the acquisition of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.speedb.io/">Speedb</a>, an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/speedb-io/speedb">open-source fork</a> of RocksDB.</p>
<p>The backlash to the Redis license move was <a target="_blank" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966631/">quick</a>. The same week the license changed, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestack.technology/battle-of-the-redis-forks-begins/">two forks</a> were announced based on the original BSD-3 code line: <a target="_blank" href="https://valkey.io/">Valkey</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://redict.io/">Redict</a>. Valkey started at Amazon, but engineers at Google and Oracle quickly joined. In only one week, the Valkey project clapped back at Redis Ltd. when it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-open-source-valkey-community">became part of the Linux Foundation</a>, and several major companies shifted their development efforts to it. Redis Ltd. did not help their perception of being up to no good when they got frisky with their beloved trademark and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TomHacohen/status/1861137484249252093">started taking over open-source Redis extensions</a>.</p>
<p>In an obvious homage to when <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/9xqvqybGMHk">Bushwick Bill (RIP), Scarface, and Willie D got back together in 2015</a>, the Redis' creator <a target="_blank" href="https://antirez.com/news/144">announced in December 2024</a> that he is in touch with the Redis Ltd. management and is looking to make a comeback to reunite the Redis community.</p>
<h4 id="licenses-elasticsearch">Elasticsearch:</h4>
<p>Elastic N.V. is the for-profit company backing the development of the leading text-search Elasticsearch DBMS. In 2021, they announced their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-license-update">switch to a dual-license model</a> of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-license-v2">Elastic License</a> and MongoDB's SSPL. Again, this was in response to the rising prominence of Amazon's Elasticsearch offering, even though the service had been out <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-elasticsearch-service/">since 2015</a>. Amazon didn't take this switch kindly and announced their <a target="_blank" href="https://opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a> fork.</p>
<p>Three years later, Elastic N.V. announced in August 2024 that they <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-is-open-source-again">reverted their license change</a> and switched to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License">AGPL</a>. Their blog article announcing this change references Kendrick Lamar's songs (e.g., <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H58vbez_m4E">Not Like Us</a>). Amazon did not like being called the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rgl497k59o">Drake of Databases</a> and announced the following month that they were transferring ownership of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-opensearch-software-foundation-to-foster-open-collaboration-in-search-and-analytics">OpenSearch project to the Linux Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>This turmoil seems like a lot just over licenses, but remember, there is big money in databases. And this is just two systems! I didn't even discuss Greenplum <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40507691">quietly killing</a> off their open-source repository after nine years and going proprietary. But people did not notice because nobody willingly runs Greenplum anymore. The only DBMS I know of that made the same open-source reversal is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ALTIBASE/altibase/blob/main/README.md">Altibase in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be blunt: I don't care for Redis. It is slow, it has fake <a target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/transactions/">transactions</a>, and its query syntax is a freakshow. Our experiments at CMU found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dragonflydb.io/">Dragonfly</a> to have much more impressive performance numbers (even with a single CPU core). In my database course, I use the Redis query language as an example of <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/fZbwD1gzjLk?t=2018">what not to do</a>. Nevertheless, I am sympathetic to Redis Ltd.'s plight of being overrun by Amazon. However, the company is overestimating the barrier of entry to build a simplistic system like Redis; it is much lower than building a full-featured DBMS (e.g., Postgres), so there are several alternatives to the OG Redis. They are not in position of strength where such posturing will be tolerated by the community.</p>
<p>The Elasticsearch saga is the same story as Redis, except they are further along in the plot: the company announces license change, competitors create an open-source fork, and the company reverts to an open-source license to muted fanfare.</p>
<p>Notice that Redis and Elasticsearch are receiving more backlash compared to other systems that made similar moves. There was no major effort to fork off MongoDB, <a target="_blank" href="https://neo4j.com/open-core-and-neo4j/">Neo4j</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/12/confluent-license-changes/">Kafka</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240703021228/https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a> when they announced their license changes. CockroachDB even <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/15/cockroach-labs-shakes-up-its-licensing-to-force-bigger-companies-to-pay/">changed its license again in 2024</a> to make larger enterprises start paying up. It cannot be because the Redis and Elasticsearch install base is so much larger than these other systems, and therefore, there were more people upset by the change since the number of MongoDB and Kafka installations was equally as large when they switched their licenses. In the case of Redis, I can only think that people perceive Redis Ltd. as unfairly profiting off others' work since the company's founders were not the system's original creators. An analysis of Redis' source code repository also shows that a <a target="_blank" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966631/">sizable percentage of contributions</a> to the DBMS comes from outside the company (e.g., Tencent, Alibaba). This "stolen valor" was the reason for the ire HashiCorp received when they <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/20/terraform-fork-gets-a-new-name-opentofu-and-joins-linux-foundation/">changed Terraform's license</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>The overarching issue in these license shuffles is the <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/26/the-eternal-struggle-between-open-source-and-proprietary-software/">long-term viability of open-source independent software vendors</a> (ISVs) in the database market. The cloud vendors are behemoths with infinite money. If an open-source DBMS takes off, they will start hosting it and make more money than the ISV. Or they will add your DBMS's wire protocol as a front-end to an existing DBMS, like when AWS added <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/03/amazon-timestream-influxdb-available/">InfluxDB v2 protocol support</a> for their Timestream DBMS in March 2024. They can then be the girlfriend of the aforementioned Bushwick Bill and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3M41aqHyfQ">shoot you in the eye</a>, like when AWS announced that their new Valkey-compatible services are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/aws-valkey-play-when-a-fork-becomes-a-price-cut/">30% cheaper</a> than their Redis-compatible services.</p>

<!-- *************** #2: GANGWAR *************** -->
<h2 id="gangwar">The Databricks vs. Snowflake Gangwar Continues </h2>
<p>There continues to be no love lost between Databricks and Snowflake. This fight is a classic database war that has spilled out into the streets. The two companies’ previous <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2021/12/2021-databases-retrospective.html#benchmark-violence">feud over query performance</a> has expanded to other areas of data management and become much more expensive.</p>
<p>Databricks took the first shot in March 2024 when they announced they spent $10 million to build their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm">DBRX open-source LLM</a> with 132 billion parameters. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.databricks.com/research/mosaic">Mosaic</a> team led the development of the DBRX model, which Databricks <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/databricks-picks-up-mosaicml-an-openai-competitor-for-1-3b/">acquired in 2023 for $1.3 billion</a>. One month later, Snowflake rolled up to the same corner and lit it up using their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/arctic-open-efficient-foundation-language-models-snowflake/">Arctic open-source LLM</a> with 480 billion parameters. Snowflake boasted they only spent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chaosgenius.io/blog/snowflake-arctic-vs-dbrx/#top-10-key-differences%E2%80%94snowflake-arctic-vs-dbrx">$2 million to train their model</a> while outperforming DBRX for “enterprise” tasks like SQL generation. You can tell that Snowflake cares most about taking a shot at Databricks because their announcement shows other LLMs doing better than them (e.g., Llama3), but they highlight how they are better than DBRX. One AI researcher was confused about why <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@mario.defelipe/my-deception-with-databricks-dbrx-and-snowflake-arctic-enterprise-llms-b4fd4faf752a#c0e4">Snowflake focused so much on DBRX</a> in their analysis and not the other models; this person does not know how much blood these two database rivals have spilled.</p>
<p>While the public LLM battle raged, another front in the war between Databricks and Snowflake opened up behind the scenes over catalogs. For most of the 2010s, Hive’s <a target="_blank" href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/hive/hcatalog+usinghcat">HCatalog</a> has been the de facto catalog system on data lakes. <a target="_blank" href="https://iceberg.apache.org/">Iceberg</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://hudi.apache.org/">Hudi</a> emerged as replacements in the late 2010s from Netflix and Uber, respectively, and both became top-level Apache projects backed by VC-funded startups. These systems provide a meta-data service to track files and support transactional ingestion of new data on an object store (e.g., S3). Databricks has a proprietary catalog service called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog">Unity</a>, which works with its <a target="_blank" href="https://delta.io/">DeltaLake</a> platform. Snowflake announced their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/expanding-the-data-cloud-with-apache-iceberg/">initial integration with Iceberg-backed tables</a> in 2022. They then <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/snowflake/an-overview-of-snowflake-apache-iceberg-tables-d5e85864ac99">expanded their support</a> for Iceberg over the next few years. Then, they looked into acquiring <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tabular.io/">Tabular</a>, the main company behind Iceberg, to compete against Databricks with Unity and DeltaLake. The story goes that Snowflake was about to <a target="_blank" href="https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/inside-the-snowflake-databricks-rivalry-and-why-both-fear-microsoft">close the deal for $600 million</a>. But then Databricks crashed the party and splashed <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/14/databricks-reportedly-paid-2-billion-in-tabular-acquisition/">$2 billion to acquire Tabular</a>. Databricks announced the acquisition the same day as the Snowflake CEO’s conference keynote address, where he was announcing their new <a target="_blank" href="https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/snowflake-unveils-polaris-a-vendor-neutral-open-catalog-implementation-of-apache-iceberg/">open-source Polaris catalog service</a> in June 2024. Databricks continued to kick Snowflake in the teeth when they announced they were <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/databricks/status/1801293028612837877">open-sourcing their Unity catalog</a> the following week.

<p>What is interesting about this database battle is that it is not just about raw performance numbers. It isn’t like the old Oracle versus Informix shootout of the 1990s, where they were mostly boasting about faster query latencies. It is true that the battle also went beyond just benchmark shots when <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.is/JvvhM">Informix sued Oracle</a> (and later had to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/informix-withdraws-oracle-suit/">withdraw their suit</a>) because Oracle poached some top Informix executives. Later, the world found out that the Informix CEO had cooked the company’s books to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/ex-ceo-at-informix-indicted-in-fraud-case-2751792.php">inflate revenue numbers</a> to look better against Oracle and had to do a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eweek.com/database/ex-informix-ceo-gets-jail/">two-month bid</a> in the federal clink.</p>
<p>Instead, the Snowflake versus Databricks battle has expanded to be about the ecosystem around the database. That is, it is about the infrastructure people use to get their data into a database and then the tools they use on that data. Vectorized execution engines for analytical queries are a  <a target="_blank" href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/seminar2024/">commodity</a> now. Databricks and every other OLAP vendor follow Snowflake’s architecture design from 2013, originally based on one of the Snowflake co-founders’ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moQY_eiHCTs">Ph.D. thesis</a>. What matters now are quality-of-life facets (which are hard to monetize and compare with competitors), compatibility with other tools, and AI/LLM magic.</p>
<p>At least the competition between Snowflake and Databricks has an upside for consumers. Such ferocity means better products and technology for data (e.g., Snowflake’s Polaris is now an  <a target="_blank" href="https://polaris.apache.org/">Apache project</a>) and eventually (hopefully) lower prices. It’s not like the previous pissing match between Oracle and SalesForce CEOs, where it was two rich guys taking pop shots at each other during their <a target="_blank" href="https://phys.org/news/2011-10-ellison-benioff-billionaire.html">expensive conferences</a>.</p>

<!-- *************** #3: DUCKDB *************** -->
<h2 id="duckdb">Shoving Ducks Into Everything </h2>
<p>In the same way that Postgres is the default choice for anyone starting a new operational database, DuckDB has entered the zeitgeist as the default choice for someone wanting to run analytical queries on their data. Pandas previously held DuckDB's crowned position. Given DuckDB's insane portability, there are several efforts to stick it inside existing DBMSs that do not have great support for OLAP workloads. This year, we saw the release of four different extensions to stick DuckDB up inside Postgres.</p>
<p>The first announcement came in May 2024 when <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchydata.com/">Crunchy Data</a> revealed their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/how-we-fused-duckdb-into-postgres-with-crunchy-bridge-for-analytics">proprietary bridge</a> for rewiring Postgres to route OLAP queries to DuckDB. They later announced an expanded version of their extension to leverage DuckDB's <a target="_blank" href="https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/spatial/overview.html">geospatial capabilities</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgis-meets-duckdb-crunchy-bridge-for-analytics-goes-spatial">accelerate PostGIS queries</a>.</p>
<p>In June 2024, ParadeDB <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/philippemnoel_im-incredibly-excited-to-announce-duckdb-activity-7212107481123020800-UUg6/">announced</a> their open-source extension (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/paradedb/pg_analytics">pg_analytics</a>) that uses Postgres' foreign data wrapper API to call into DuckDB; they previously were using DataFusion in an earlier version (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_lakehouse">pg_lakehouse</a>) but switched to the Duck.</p>
<p>Then, in August 2024, the next DuckDB-for-Postgres extension (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb">pg_duck</a>) came out. The source code for this extension is hosted under the <a target="_blank" href="https://duckdblabs.com/">DuckDB Labs</a> GitHub organization. As such, this is the officially sanctioned DuckDB extension for Postgres. The original <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/20/postgresql_duckdb_extension/">announcement</a> touted this project as being a collaboration between <a target="_blank" href="https://motherduck.com/">MotherDuck</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hydra.so/">Hydra</a>, Microsoft, and <a target="_blank" href="https://neon.tech/">Neon</a>. The latter two were (allegedly) kicked out of the mix over a dispute on development controls, similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ECAfnZIN1-A">Arabian Prince</a> leaving NWA. The repository now only lists it as a joint effort between MotherDuck and Hydra.</p>
<p>The latest DuckDB extension <a target="_blank" href="https://mooncake.dev/blog/how-we-built-pgmooncake">dropped</a> in November 2024 with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Mooncake-Labs/pg_mooncake">pg_mooncake</a>. Mooncake differs from the other three because it supports writing data through Postgres into Iceberg tables with full transaction support.</p>

<h3><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/images/blog/017/pavlo-head-sideview-lomo.png" alt="Andy's Head" width="32" height="41">Andy’s Take:</h3>
<p>Most OLAP queries do not access that much data. Fivetran analyzed traces from Snowflake and Redshift and showed that the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fivetran.com/blog/how-do-people-use-snowflake-and-redshift">median amount of data scanned by queries is only 100 MB</a>. Such a small amount of data means a single DuckDB instance is enough for most to handle most queries.</p>
<p>DuckDB's convenience and portability are the reasons for its proliferation in the Postgres community. Although ClickHouse has existed since 2016, it was not as easy to run as DuckDB until recently (see this <a target="_blank" href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-over-the-years-with-benchmarks">blog article</a> that discusses the steps to deploy ClickHouse in 2018). These DuckDB extensions are a single entry point to the broader data ecosystem. Users no longer need to install separate extensions to access data in Iceberg and separately for S3. DuckDB can handle all of that for you. It allows organizations to gain high-performance analytics without needing an expensive data warehouse.</p>
<p>Postgres' support for extensions and plugins is impressive. One of the <a target="_blank" href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/papers/ERL-M85-95.pdf">original design goals</a> of Postgres from the 1980s was to be extensible. The intention was to easily support new access methods and new data types and operations on those data types (i.e., object-relational). Since 2006, Postgres' "hook" API. Our <a target="_blank" href="http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2023/abstracts/23-144.html">research</a> shows that Postgres has the most expansive and diverse extension ecosystem compared to every other DBMS. We also found that the DBMS's lack of guard rails means that extensions can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v0fubktoY">interfere with each other and cause incorrect behavior</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier projects that added columnar storage to Postgres (e.g., Citus, Timescale) only solved part of the problem. Columnar data formats improve retrieving data from storage. However, a DBMS cannot fully exploit those formats if it still uses a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsbbwiWw9VE&amp;list=PLSE8ODhjZXjYa_zX-KeMJui7pcN1rIaIJ&amp;index=5">row-oriented query processing model</a> (e.g., Postgres). Using DuckDB provides both columnar storage and vectorized query processing.</p>
<p>There is likely a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turducken">turducken</a> joke here involving an elephant, but I will not make it because I do not want to get <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/appointment-and-tenure-policy.html#dismissal">fired</a> or put on probation by the university (again).</p>

<h2 id="random">Random Happenings </h2>
<p>Many one-off events happened with databases last year that you might have overlooked. Here is a quick summary of them:</p>
<h4>Releases:</h4>
<ul>
    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/introducing-amazon-aurora-dsql/">Amazon Aurora DSQL</a>
    <p>There isn't much public information yet about how AWS implemented their new "Spanner-like" DBMS (see <a target="_blank" href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/12/03/aurora-dsql">Mark Brooker's discussion</a> about the DBMS architecture). The key ideas are a distributed log service (rumors were it was going to be based on now-defunct QLDB) and timestamp ordering via <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/its-about-time-microsecond-accurate-clocks-on-amazon-ec2-instances/">Time Sync</a>. But this announcement shows you how much brand recognition the name "Aurora" carries in the database world because AWS used it for this new DBMS that seemingly shares no code with their flagship Aurora Postgres RDS offering.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://cedardb.com/blog/ode_to_postgres/">CedarDB</a>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://umbra-db.com/">Umbra</a> is one of the most state-of-the-art DBMSs written by the world's <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/twitter.com');" href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo/status/1221464821717258242">greatest database systems researcher</a> (<a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org');" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Neumann">Thomas Neumann</a>). But Thomas is content with staying at his university to work on Umbra, remaining comfortably on top of the <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/benchmark.clickhouse.com');" href="https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/">Clickbench</a> leaderboard, and not worrying about pesky customers. That's why his top Ph.D. students forked his code and are commercializing it as CedarDB.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/announcing-sql-support-for-bigtable">Google Bigtable</a>
    <p>The only interesting part of this announcement is that the former vanguard of the NoSQL movement in the late 2000s now supports SQL in 2024.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://turso.tech/blog/introducing-limbo-a-complete-rewrite-of-sqlite-in-rust">Limbo</a>
    <p>Turso has been working on the  <a target="_blank" href="https://libsql.org/">libSQL</a> fork of SQLite for a while, but they went all out in 2024 by announcing a complete rewrite of SQLite in Rust. In their announcement, they correctly point out that the value of SQLite is not just from its code, but also from the <a target="_blank" href="https://sqlite.org/th3.html">insane test engineering</a> that ensures it runs correctly everywhere. That is why the Limbo developers are working with a <a target="_blank" href="https://antithesis.com/">deterministic testing startup</a> by ex-FoundationDB people. See FoundationDB's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJb8A6h9jQQ&amp;list=PLSE8ODhjZXjagqlf1NxuBQwaMkrHXi-iz&amp;index=22">2020 CMU-DB talk</a> for more information on what this testing means.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-garnet-an-open-source-next-generation-faster-cache-store-for-accelerating-applications-and-services/">Microsoft Garnet</a>
    <p>This key-value store is the successor to the impressive <a target="_blank" href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/">FASTER</a> system from Microsoft Research. It is compatible with Redis and supports inter-query parallelism, larger-than-memory databases, and real transactions. Redis should <u>not</u> be anybody's first choice these days.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/9.0/en/news-9-0-0.html">MySQL v9</a>
    <p>Six years after MySQL v8 went GA, the team turned v9 out on the streets. But people quickly found that it crashed if your database had <a target="_blank" href="https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9306">more than 8000 tables</a>. I am underwhelmed with the <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/9.0/en/mysql-nutshell.html">feature list</a> in this new major version. Oracle is putting all its time and energy into its proprietary <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/mysql/">MySQL Heatwave</a> service. MySQL is still widely used, but the excitement is not there anymore. Everyone has moved on to Postgres.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/11/14/prometheus-3-0/">Prometheus v3</a>
    <p>It has been seven years since the latest major version of Prometheus. There are so many <a target="_blank" href="https://dbdb.io/browse?compatible=prometheus">compatible alternatives</a> now that the OG Prometheus may not be the best option for some organizations.
    </p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Acquisitions:</h4>
<ul>
    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ALTERYX-INC-34336524/news/Clearlake-Capital-Group-and-Insight-Partners-Complete-Acquisition-of-Alteryx-46231296/">Alteryx → Private Equity</a>
    <p>I've never met anybody who uses Alteryx, and I don't have an opinion about them.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/k1-acquires-mariadb-a-leading-database-software-company-and-appoints-new-ceo-302243508.html">MariaDB → Private Equity</a>
    <p>Hopefully the PE people buying the MariaDB Corporation can clean up the mess. See my analysis from last year about the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2024/01/2023-databases-retrospective.html#mariadb">MariaDB dumpster fire</a>.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-aquires-oriole">OrioleDB → Supabase</a>
    <p>This purchase makes sense if you are one of the leading Postgres ISVs. Postgres has a great front-end but an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2023/04/the-part-of-postgresql-we-hate-the-most.html">outdated storage architecture</a>. OrioleDB fixes that problem.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/306944/20240731/database-startup-clickhouse-announces-peerdb-acquistion.htm">PeerDB → ClickHouse</a>
    <p>Better ETL tooling to get data out of Postgres and into ClickHouse. This is a smart move by ClickHouse, Inc.</p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/best-postgresql-gui-popsql-joins-timescale/">PopSQL → Timescale</a>
    <p>They bought themselves a fancy SQL editor UI. It is a quality-of-life improvement.</p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/redis-switches-licenses-acquires-speedb-to-go-beyond-its-core-in-memory-database/">Speedb → Redis Ltd.</a>
    <p>See the <a href="#licenses-redis">discussion</a> above. They are likely going to use Speedb to allow Redis to spill data to disk. Speedb's developers never explained what changes and improvements they made in their RocksDB fork (or I could not find it?). See Mark Callaghan's recent comparison of <a target="_blank" href="http://smalldatum.blogspot.com/2024/12/speedb-vs-rocksdb-on-large-server.html">Speedb vs. RocksDB</a>.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/openai-acquires-database-analytics-firm-rockset-2024-06-21/">Rockset → OpenAI</a>
    <p>This is big news for the company, but unfortunately they had to shutdown the DBaaS in September 2024. Rockset had a great engineering team with some of the best database engineers from Facebook. I just never liked how their DBMS stored three copies of your data in its indexes.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/databricks-is-buying-data-optimization-startup-tabular.html">Tabular → Databricks</a>
    <p>Again, see the <a href="#gangwar">discussion above</a>. Iceberg is the standard (sorry Hudi); even <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-s3-tables-apache-iceberg-tables-analytics-workloads/">Amazon S3 now supports it</a>. It remains to be seen how the adoption of Polaris will evolve and whether they will be able to maintain compatibility in the long term.
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.verta.ai/blog/cloudera-acquires-verta-operational-ai-platform-to-bring-trusted-hybrid-ai-to-the-enterprise">Verta.ai → Cloudera</a>
    <p>I guess Cloudera is still alive?
    </p></li>

    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warpstream.com/blog/warpstream-is-dead-long-live-warpstream">Warpstream → Confluent</a>
    <p>Rewriting Kafka in golang but then making it spill to S3. I'm happy for the Warpstream team, but Confluent could have done this themselves.
    </p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Funding:</h4>
<ul>

And now it is dead. I am disappointed at how a particular company treated us at the end, so they are forever banned from recruiting CMU-DB students. They know who they are and what they did.
    </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I want to also give special props to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-freund">Andres Freund</a> for discovering the <a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/">xz backdoor</a> in 2024 while working on Postgres at Microsoft. This attack was a <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/1774392858101039419">two-year campaign</a> to inject malicious code into an important compression library widely used in computing. Although the backdoor targeted SSH and not Postgres directly, it is another example of why database engineers are some of the best programmers in the world.</p>

<p>Databricks has blown away all other fundraising in the world of databases for the second year in a row with a disgustingly brash <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/databricks-is-raising-10b-series-j-investment-at-62b-valuation-302333822.html">$10 billion Series J round</a>.

CMU-DB has several alumni at Databricks, including a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasmenon/">former #1 ranked Ph.D. student</a>.

<p>The upcoming year is going to be the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/UgpzENzpXUs">test of strength</a> for many database startups.

<!-- I only know two people over the age of 80: Mike Stonebraker and my father. Stonebraker is an intellectual powerhouse and is still crushing it. My father regrettably told me at Christmas last year that <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci">Anthony Fauci</a> should be in jail. -->

<p>Do you know who had their 80th birthday this year? The legendary Larry Ellison! Once again, we see that he is a man who refuses to settle down or <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/hMX7bPGRw_E">be put into a box</a>. First, Larry propelled himself up Forbes' Billionaires List to become the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/10/larry-ellison-becomes-richer-than-zuckerberg-arnault-as-oracle-stock-rallies-to-record-high/">third richest person in the world</a>. In March 2024, the Oracle stock rose so much that he made <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/12/larry-ellison-makes-15-billion-from-oracle-best-day-since-2021.html">$15 billion in a single day</a>. Flush with cash, Larry went shopping in July 2024 and signed a deal to purchase <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-larry-ellison-david-ellison-1236006769/">Paramount Studios at $6 billion</a> for his only son (third wife). He then decided to relax by buying a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/story/business/real-estate/2024/08/08/billionaire-ellison-buys-eau-palm-beach-resort-spa-near-palm-beach/74723944007/">Palm Beach resort for only $277 million</a>. These moves happened in just one year, and databases paid for all of it. But these are mere trifles compared to Larry's most significant accomplishment in 2024.</p>
<p>Everyone I know was surprised when our Larry Ellison news alerts woke us up in the middle of the night in November 2024. The headlines were touting how Larry helped the University of Michigan football program <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.today/2024.11.24-013436/https://frontofficesports.com/larry-ellison-michigan-nil-bryce-underwood/">recruit the premiere college quarterback</a>. The university had previously announced that this player was transferring from Louisiana State to Michigan. Their press release included a curious acknowledgement to "Larry and his wife Jolin" for helping with the recruiting effort. Reporters soon <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/billionaire-larry-ellison-helped-give-a-high-school-student-10-million-to-play-football-for-michigan-and-gave-us-a-glimpse-behind-the-nil-curtain-6bf5d87f">confirmed</a> that this "Larry" was the one and only Larry Ellison! Larry contributed $12 million to the booster campaign to bankroll the best quarterback's move to Michigan.</p>
<p>The bigger mystery in this story was the identity of this "Jolin" person. Investigators found older photos of Larry watching a tennis match with a <a target="_blank" href="https://mgoblog.com/mgoboard/tennis-fans-who%27s-woman-michigan-hat-next-larry-ellison">woman wearing a Michigan hat</a>. Then, two weeks later, a major news organization broke the story at 5:30 am (my alerts woke me up again) that the <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.today/2024.12.07-023939/https://www.wsj.com/sports/football/michigan-recruiting-larry-ellison-bryce-underwood-842d2c9a">woman's identity was Jolin (Keren) Zhu</a> and they confirmed that she was Larry's new wife.</p>

<p>I am beaming with pride over what Larry accomplished in the past year. He famously did not graduate from any university and had no prior connection to the University of Michigan. And yet, because the love of his life went to Michigan about a decade ago, Larry made magic happen by writing a check for a measly $12 million (about 0.0055% of his net worth). I told Larry this especially means a lot to me because my <a target="_blank" href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~linmacse/">former #1 ranked Ph.D. student</a> is now a professor in Michigan's Computer Science department with their famous <a target="_blank" href="https://dbgroup.eecs.umich.edu/">Database Group</a>.</p>
<p>What is even more fantastic about this story is that Larry is again in love! Too many people struggle in today's world to find that special somebody. Dating apps are a mess, speed dating events are awkward, and it is now considered uncouth to hang around a playground to meet single parents when you do not have kids of your own. Then, just when you think you finally found the right person, it all falls apart when you learn they do not wash their socks regularly or like to put hot sauce on cold cereal. That is why everyone was telling me that Larry would never get married again after his <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101102010955/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/tag/melanie-craft/">2010 divorce</a> from romance novelist Melanie Craft (fourth wife). Those people were telling me the same thing after his <a target="_blank" href="https://marketrealist.com/p/larry-ellison-girlfriend/">2020 divorce</a> from Nikita Kahn (fifth wife). But I knew better, and Larry proved me right with his surreptitious marriage to Keren Zhu (sixth wife)!</p>

<!-- *************** CONCLUSION *************** -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I was planning on starting this article boasting how this is the first time in three years where I was celebrating NYE not sick. But then my biological daughter gave me COVID so I'm laid up with that. I got boosted back in September and they gave me Paxlovid, so I'll survive this.</p>
<p>I am disappointed that OtterTune is dead. But I learned a lot and got to work with many brilliant people. I am a big fan of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intelcapital.com/">Intel Capital</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://race.capital/">Race Capital</a> for sticking with us to the end. I hope to announce our next start-up soon (hint: it’s about databases).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I am happy to be back full-time at Carnegie Mellon University. <a target="_blank" href="https://jigneshpatel.org/">Jignesh Patel</a> and I have some baller research projects that we hope to turn out this upcoming year. I am also looking forward to teaching a new course on <a target="_blank" href="https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2025/">query optimization</a> this semester. I need to figure out to juice my stats because in September 2024, Wikipedia <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Andy_Pavlo">removed the article about me</a> over not having enough citations.</p>
<p>We are staying true to <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/APqWIjtzNGE?t=4941">DJ Mooshoo</a> while he is locked up in Cook County. We hope to free him in 2025.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to give a shout-out to ByteBase for their article <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bytebase.com/blog/database-tool-review-2024/">Database Tools in 2024: A Year in Review</a>. In previous years, they emailed me asking for permission to translate my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bytebase.com/blog/database-review-2021-andy-pavlo-chinese/">end-of-year database articles into Chinese</a> for their blog. This year, they could not wait for me to finish writing this one, so they jocked my flow and wrote their own off-brand article with the same title and premise.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  

  <article>
    <p>Alright, you know the drill. The Ruby team do the hard work of putting together a new version packed with features and I pick my favourites and write about them.</p>

<p>If you’d like to read the full set of changes, they’re <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/12/25/ruby-3-4-0-released/">over on the Ruby project website</a>. There’s plenty more good stuff in there—these were just the changes that stood out to me.</p>

<h3 id="default-block-parameter-name">Default block parameter name</h3>

<p>In many situations where we pass a block in Ruby, that block receives a single argument (<code>each</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, etc). A lot of the time, we end up giving that argument a fairly generic name like <code>item</code> because we know that we’re working through items in a list.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[</span>
  <span>"beige chinos"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"blue jorts"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"rainbow jorts"</span><span>,</span>
<span>].</span><span>filter</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>item</span><span>|</span> <span>item</span> <span>=~</span> <span>/jorts/</span> <span>}</span>
<span># =&gt; ["blue jorts", "rainbow jorts"]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In Ruby&nbsp;3.4, <code>it</code> has been <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18980">added as a default name</a> for the first parameter passed to a block. Rather than specifying a name in trivial cases like the one above, you can now write:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[</span>
  <span>"beige chinos"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"blue jorts"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"rainbow jorts"</span><span>,</span>
<span>].</span><span>filter</span> <span>{</span> <span>it</span> <span>=~</span> <span>/jorts/</span> <span>}</span>
<span># =&gt; ["blue jorts", "rainbow jorts"]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="better-connection-handling-happy-eyeballs-version-2">Better connection handling: “Happy Eyeballs Version 2”</h3>

<p>I’ll be honest: the reason this made my list this year is that seeing it in the changelog pointed me to an interesting RFC that I hadn’t heard of before! I spent a couple of hours down a rabbit hole reading RFCs and a few snippets of source code and I thought it was worth talking about.</p>

<p>Ruby&nbsp;3.4 adds an implementation of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8305">RFC8305</a> (<em>Happy Eyeballs Version 2: Better Connectivity Using Concurrency</em>) to its TCP socket implementation.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the RFC is an attempt at describing a way for clients to handle multiple IP addresses being returned by DNS queries, particularly in the context of a dual-stack (IPv4 and IPV6) network. It describes how to make the DNS requests<sup id="fnref:a-vs-aaaa" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:a-vs-aaaa" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, how to order the addresses returned by them, and how to kick off concurrent connection attempts to those addresses in a way that balances giving the user a response quickly with not creating pointless load on servers<sup id="fnref:avoiding-overload" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:avoiding-overload" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>RFC8305 builds on the earlier <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6555">RFC6555</a>. RFC6555 talked in relatively high-level terms about what’s needed in an algorithm that uses a hostname to establish a connection in a dual-stack environment and made reference to an approach shared by Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome at the time. RFC8305 goes beyond that and provides much more concrete descriptions of what should be done at each stage.</p>

<p>One thing I really like about their approach is that they provide <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8305#section-8">sensible default values</a> for each of the tunable parameters of their algorithm, which were reached through empirical measurement of connection timings across a wide range of devices. A company with the reach of Apple, where this RFC originated, is well-placed to take measurements at the scale needed to find widely applicable defaults. It’s great to see the effort put into making the output of their work useful beyond the walls of their company.</p>

<p>I’m less bullish about the IPv6 transition than some of my friends. If that transition is going to be successful, it involves an unavoidable period of running dual-stack networks<sup id="fnref:maybe-avoidable" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:maybe-avoidable" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. When doing so caused trouble on my home network, I switched IPv6 off rather than trying to debug it<sup id="fnref:on-my-todo-list" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:on-my-todo-list" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. If we want people to embrace dual-stack networks—and ultimately IPv6—we need socket libraries that do the right thing by default.</p>

<h3 id="clearer-exception-backtraces">Clearer exception backtraces</h3>

<p>Okay, we’re done with the rabbit hole and we’ve got a simple one to round things off.</p>

<p>In Ruby&nbsp;3.4, exception backtraces <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19117">include the method owner</a> (class or module) as well as the name of the method that an exception was raised from.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some code that raises an exception:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>class</span> <span>Bar</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>inspect</span>
      <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>'1'</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>p</span> <span>Foo</span><span>::</span><span>Bar</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In Ruby&nbsp;3.3 and earlier, this would print a backtrace like:</p>

<div><pre><code>/tmp/foo.rb:4:in `+': String can't be coerced into Integer (TypeError)
	from /tmp/foo.rb:4:in `inspect'
	from /tmp/foo.rb:9:in `p'
	from /tmp/foo.rb:9:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre></div>

<p>Ruby&nbsp;3.4 prints out the name of the module/class that contains each of the methods in the stack track, like:</p>

<div><pre><code>/tmp/foo.rb:4:in `Integer#+': String can't be coerced into Integer (TypeError)
	from /tmp/foo.rb:4:in `Foo::Bar#inspect'
	from /tmp/foo.rb:9:in `Kernel#p'
	from /tmp/foo.rb:9:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s a small change, but I’m a big believer in anything that makes it quicker to understand what a piece of code is doing. I’m glad to see that the Ruby team still values developer experience so highly. It’s one of the best parts of writing the language.</p>

<p>That’s all from me. If you enjoyed this post, do get in touch with your own favourite feature from Ruby&nbsp;3.4 and the best cheese you’ve eaten this Christmas<sup id="fnref:cheese" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cheese" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="modal">
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      A CAPTCHA that lets you play DOOM® to prove you're human (for
      educational and entertainment purposes)
    </p>
    <p>
      The project works by leveraging <code>Emscripten</code> to compile a
      minimal port of Doom to <code>WebAssembly</code> and enable
      intercommunication between the <code>C</code>-based game runloop (<a href="https://github.com/rauchg/doom-captcha/tree/main/sdldoom-1.10/g_game.c"><code>g_game.c</code></a>) and the
      <code>JavaScript</code>-based CAPTCHA UI.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some extensions were made to the game to introduce relevant events
      needed for its usage in the context of a CAPTCHA.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Started out with a minimal, <code>SDL</code>-based port of Doom that
        can be efficiently compiled to <code>WebAssembly</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Tweaked the build to make it compatible with the shareware version of
        <code>wad</code> (<code>doom1.wad</code>) for legal use
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduced new unofficial process flags:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>-nomenu</code> (<a href="https://github.com/rauchg/doom-captcha/tree/main/sdldoom-1.10/m_menu.c"><code>m_menu.c</code></a>)
            to skip the main menu and jump straight into the game
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>-autoreborn</code> (<a href="https://github.com/rauchg/doom-captcha/tree/main/sdldoom-1.10/p_mobj.c"><code>p_mobj.c</code></a>)
            to automatically rebirth the player after a 2s delay
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduced callbacks into <code>JS</code> land to be used by the
        CAPTCHA UI:
        <ul>
          <li><code>onPlayerBorn</code> when the player is born or reborn</li>
          <li><code>onPlayerKilled</code> when the player is killed</li>
          <li>
            <code>onEnemyKilled</code> when the main player kills an enemy
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Tweaked the default process flags in
        <a href="https://github.com/rauchg/doom-captcha/tree/main/sdldoom-1.10/d_main.c"><code>d_main.c</code></a>
        to make the game more challenging:
        <ul>
          <li><code>-skill 5</code> sets the difficulty to "Nightmare!"</li>
          <li><code>-fast</code> makes it even harder</li>
          <li>
            <code>-warp e1m1</code> jumpstarts the game to where the action is
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>-nomenu</code> doesn't let the player trigger the main menu
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

Therefore, we present the Putnam-AXIOM Original benchmark consisting of 236 mathematical problems from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, along with detailed step-by-step solutions. To preserve the Putnam-AXIOM benchmark's validity and mitigate potential data contamination, we created the Putnam-AXIOM Variation benchmark with functional variations of 52 problems. By programmatically altering problem elements like variables and constants, we can generate unlimited novel, equally challenging problems not found online. We see that almost all models have significantly lower accuracy in the variations than the original problems. Our results reveal that OpenAI's o1-preview, the best performing model, achieves merely 41.95\% accuracy on the Putnam-AXIOM Original but experiences around a 30\% reduction in accuracy on the variations' dataset when compared to corresponding original problems.</span></p><p><strong>Concurrent Submissions<!-- -->:</strong> <span>ICLR 2025</span></p><p><strong>Submission Number<!-- -->:</strong> <span>86</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

There are few individuals in history who have written prose more beautiful than his. In fact, he wrote such exquisite Latin that, at one time, education literally meant reading Cicero, Cicero, and some more Cicero.</p><p>This book is a collection of letters, translated from Latin to English, that he wrote to friends, family members, and colleagues. Sometimes, he wrote letters because he was concerned about a friend’s health; other times, he wrote to his family because he was worried about their well-being or needed to give them directions. Occasionally, he wrote to friends and colleagues to curry favor for people he knew.</p><p>Let me share a few excerpts. Sometimes he would talk about books, as in:</p><blockquote><p><br><span>In my command here I have put into practice the whole </span><em>Education of Cyrus,</em><span> a work which I read so often that I wore out the book.</span><br></p></blockquote><p>What follows is Cicero asking a friend for a favor for another friend:</p><blockquote><p>Now, my dear Paetus, be a friend, and take the whole affair upon yourself, and relieve Fabius of the worry. We need your name and sound judgment, and your personal influence too. Don’t let the brothers get into litigation and become embroiled in discreditable lawsuits. Mato and Pollio are Fabius’ enemies. Briefly, I assure you that I cannot write down in full how much you will oblige me if you put Fabius’ mind at ease. He thinks, and persuades me, that it all depends on you.</p></blockquote><p>Even though I was reading English translations of his letters, his prose remained captivating, even in translation. There are two reasons I like this book. First, it offers insight into the old times, life back then, and how things were. Second, he wrote engaging prose, sometimes even lyrical. Among countless examples, here are a few phrases I enjoyed:</p><blockquote><p>Please rest assured that my solicitude for your credit increases every day, though your own integrity and clemency have so enhanced it that any addition seems impossible.</p></blockquote><p>Another one: </p><blockquote><p>If he proves himself worthy of his forbears, as I expect and hope he will, some part of the credit will go to you. If he stumbles, the damage will be entirely his, not yours at all.</p></blockquote><p>And this one has a nice ring to it: </p><blockquote><p>If you do what is best for your health, you will best comply with my wishes. So think it over in that clever head of yours. I miss you, but I love you. Loving you, I want to see you fit and well; missing you, I want to see you as soon as possible. The former, there, must come first. So make it your chief concern to get well. Of your countless services to me this will be the one I shall most appreciate.</p></blockquote><p>How beautifully he weaves simple words to convey emotion.</p><p>In the truest sense of the word, he was a man of letters. Writing prose like his isn’t something an ordinary individual can easily emulate.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Logic-Computer-Science-Third/dp/1447141288" rel="">Mathematical Logic for Computer Science by Ben-Ari</a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg" width="300" height="455.2325581395349" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:522,&quot;width&quot;:344,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:300,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Mathematical Logic for Computer Science&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Mathematical Logic for Computer Science" title="Mathematical Logic for Computer Science" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F062df67b-bf6a-4aa0-80a5-e23156cb60ee_344x522.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I wanted to brush up on logic for computer science, and this book came highly recommended by someone I trust. It did not disappoint. It’s a technical book, heavy on theory, so I had to read it slowly, ensuring I absorbed everything as I went along.</p><p>Some books aren’t easy to read and aren’t rewarding either, while others aren’t easy to read yet are rewarding. This one wasn’t easy, but it was certainly a rewarding experience for me. The best part of the book was its use of a first-principles approach.</p><p><span>The book covers propositional logic, deductive systems such as Gentzen (I even </span><a href="https://wyounas.github.io/cs/2024/10/29/gentzen-system/" rel="">blogged about it</a><span>) and Hilbert, Binary Decision Diagrams, SAT solvers, First-Order Logic, Temporal Logic, verification of sequential programs, and verification of concurrent programs. The last three topics intrigued me the most, and I liked the way the content was presented so much that I bought another book by the same author and read it.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Way-Life-Spiritual-Exercises/dp/0631180338" rel="">Philosophy as a Way of Life by Pierre Hadot</a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png" width="304" height="426.97734627831716" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:868,&quot;width&quot;:618,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:304,&quot;bytes&quot;:268299,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c44f10-a528-4216-9806-36fee5e33657_618x868.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I came across this book accidentally, but I’m so glad I did. Pierre Hadot was a French philosopher who could not only philosophize but also write simply—an ability not common among top-tier philosophers, if I may say so with respect.</p><p>This work explores themes on how to use philosophy to live better lives. What better purpose could philosophy serve than this?</p><p>Hadot believed that the purpose of ancient philosophy was to transform souls, which is why philosophical teaching was primarily given in oral form. Nothing stirs the soul like a good spoken word, and the written part was, for the most part, a complement to this oral teaching. The oral tradition and dialogue were at the center of philosophy. While it was important to present the solution, it was even more important to show the “path traversed together in arriving at this solution.”</p><p><span>This book offered insights that were outside my sphere of knowledge. For one, if you want to truly understand why Marcus Aurelius wrote his </span><em>Meditations</em><span> the way he did, then this book is for you. You learn why he sought to reform rather than inform. You also discover the framework he used to write down his meditations. Further, you learn about Epictetus and his philosophy. For instance, one should not content oneself with philosophical discourses or texts, but strive to live a good life. As Epictetus once said, “our only occupation should be the cure of ourselves.” The essence of philosophy, then, is to produce good actions, to live virtuously and not viciously, to pursue truth and not ignorance.</span></p><p>He also talks about spiritual exercises in this book, which is both interesting and worth a post in its own right.</p><p><span>Philosophy shouldn’t be confined to specific institutions or individuals. Instead, we all should be able to use it to refine ourselves, to dialogue with others and with oneself, to examine our conscience, and to be masters of ourselves. The idea is not for anyone to “satisfy himself with discourse, with the conceptual architecture that he has constructed, without putting into question his own life.” Hadot calls this a </span><em>perpetual danger of philosophy,</em><span> where a philosopher takes refuge in the “reassuring universe of concepts and of discourse instead of going beyond discourse in order to take upon himself the risk of the radical transformation of himself.”</span></p><p>I feel Pierre Hadot’s aim in writing this book was to make philosophy accessible to common men and women, to help us use philosophy to live better lives. I believe he succeeded. There is much in this book that can serve us well.</p><p><a href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL146/2009/volume.xml" rel="">Asechylus’s Oresteia</a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png" width="200" height="314" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:314,&quot;width&quot;:200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Book cover image.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Book cover image." title="Book cover image." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6f7f1c9-9db6-42c8-ac4b-39c48ffd3cc0_200x314.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Aeschylus was not just a soldier but also the father of Greek tragedy and a figure whose influence still echoes through his works. He won first prizes often at the Dionysia (an ancient Greek festival that included theatrical performances of tragedies and comedies). </span><em>Oresteia</em><span>, a winner at the Dionysia, was a trilogy that explored the themes of justice, vengeance, and the evolution of societal order. </span></p><p>There is much wisdom in the trilogy. This following famous quote about “learning by suffering” is in the first play:</p><blockquote><p><span>Zeus, who set mortals on the road</span><br><span>to understanding, who made</span><br><span>“learning by suffering” into an effective law.</span><br><span>There drips before the heart, instead of sleep,</span><br><span>The misery of pain recalled: good sense comes to men.</span></p></blockquote><p>His thoughts on human psychology and the way he crafted his stories are why I liked this book. I have to admit, there is a lot in it that I need to absorb. I’ll surely be re-reading this one sometime soon. It’s one of those books that one ought to read multiple times in life because I’m certain that every time we read it, it will offer something new.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Model-Checker-Mordechai-Ben-Ari/dp/1846287693/" rel="">Principles of the SPIN Model Checker by Ben-Ari</a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg" width="305" height="464.16909620991254" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:522,&quot;width&quot;:343,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:305,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Principles of the Spin Model Checker&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Principles of the Spin Model Checker" title="Principles of the Spin Model Checker" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e3f4be-ea50-4d70-bb4c-37cdc528e46a_343x522.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>There are technical books that are thick and heavy yet offer little, and then there are books that are short yet offer insight and ignite your interest and curiosity even further.

The book details his early working days at shops and clubs, his relationships, and eventually his rise to fame. He shared his struggles, his failures, long hours of practice, his reflections to refine his craft, and his efforts to find his own unique voice as a comedian. Any memoir that only talks about successes and never discusses struggles, rejections, or weaknesses is suspect. This one is not. What I like about his writing is that it feels candid and, at times, funny.</p><p>From reading the book, it’s clear that recognition for one’s work takes time. What you can’t control is how and when you get recognition. What you can control is how hard you work and persevere. He firmly understood what he could control and focused on that. His was a long journey, full of obstacles, but he never gave up. He kept refining his craft, kept working, kept improving, and finally, he earned the recognition he much deserved.</p><p>Reading this book reinforces the idea that success is nine times patience times effort times reflection times some luck.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Less-Than-One-Selected-Classics/dp/0374539057" rel="">Less Than One by Joseph Brodsky</a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png" width="304" height="417.74149659863946" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:808,&quot;width&quot;:588,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:304,&quot;bytes&quot;:296661,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc686e998-8352-461a-b886-331b931f1a00_588x808.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Joseph Brodsky was a poet, an essayist, and a Nobel Prize winner. This book is a collection of essays, and some of them are quite profound. One of his essays on Dostoevsky is particularly insightful; it left such an impression on me that I reflected on it and </span><a href="https://thoughts.wyounas.com/p/what-made-dostoevsky-immortal" rel="">wrote an essay of my own</a><span>.</span></p><p>He is one of those writers who frequently shares wisdom about literature or the human condition in his writing. You don’t stop reading him because he keeps you so engaged by offering insights on the topic at hand.</p><p>He’s also one of those writers who gives you unexpected angles on familiar things. For instance, his essay on Dostoevsky offers subtle insights into why Dostoevsky’s work is immortal. </p><p>One difference between masters and beginners is that masters have explored and mastered details that beginners may not even notice. Similarly, another takeaway from this book is understanding how experienced literary connoisseurs interpret and analyze literary works. The way he untangles and interprets some literary pieces, and the depth and detail he explores, isn’t just insightful—it’s something that someone like me couldn’t even notice at first. He has a whole essay on W.H. Auden’s poem, and the way he delves into it is simply fascinating.</p><p>All in all, it’s a good book with some thought-provoking writing.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Earthsea-Cycle/dp/0547773749" rel="">A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin</a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png" width="300" height="474.91525423728814" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:934,&quot;width&quot;:590,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:300,&quot;bytes&quot;:1057724,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bc6a68-9aa8-473f-9af5-593eafcd619a_590x934.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I had never read anything by Ursula Le Guin, but then I came across some excerpts of her work online, and I thought I should give her a try.

I admire philosophers who not only talk but also put their words into action to better the world. Tagore not only left behind a remarkable body of work but also tried to make the world a better place through his actions—such as opening a school, which now boasts a list of distinguished alumni.</p><p>This book contains his essays and plays. It’s a big volume, and I bought it because it includes his most notable works, although, for now, I was mainly interested in his essays. Some of his essays are thought-provoking. His reflections on education, nationalism, and other topics are not only stirring but also showcase literary brilliance.

Paul Dirac was a man of very few words, hardworking, and a brilliant scientist who took pride in the beauty of mathematics.</p><p>Sometimes I believe an appalling childhood is a precondition for genius; Dirac had one. He once said, “I never had a childhood.” But thankfully, he received a superb education. He was not known to talk much, even during his childhood. The only time he spoke was when he politely corrected the errors of his teachers. Dirac believed he was a geometrical thinker, probably due to his excellent technical drawing skills learned at school. Eventually, he earned a PhD at Cambridge, and as a scientist, he never looked back. There is so much in this book that I should probably write about in a separate review sometime.</p><p>Dirac was also quite a character, and making small talk with him wasn’t easy. He once responded to the comment, “It’s a bit rainy, isn’t it?” by walking to the window, returning to his seat, and stating, “It is not now raining.” He was very careful with his speech; he once said, “I was always taught not to start a sentence until I knew how to finish it.”</p><p>His contributions to the field of physics are seminal. He definitely led a life worth living. I found this an engaging biography and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Argumentative-Indian-Amartya-Sen/dp/0141012110" rel="">The argumentative Indian by Amartya Sen</a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png" width="300" height="431.8032786885246" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:878,&quot;width&quot;:610,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:300,&quot;bytes&quot;:1043718,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e93be41-25de-492b-9036-201ac7856cfe_610x878.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I had not read any of Amartya Sen’s work before this book. Mr. Sen is a notable scholar and a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics. It’s stimulating work as well as easy to read.</p><p>Although parts of South Asia are not commonly known to have an argumentative gene, Amartya Sen convincingly shows that Indian history is deeply rooted in an argumentative tradition. He masterfully weaves evidence and tales to make his point. There is much I learned that I didn’t know, even though I’m from South Asia (which was a bit embarrassing). For instance, I learned how poets from the working classes questioned social divisions and the barriers of disparate religions. He also cites historical evidence showing how the argumentative tradition was firmly rooted in India’s history. For example, Ashoka’s remarkable interest in the rules of discussion in the third century BC is evident in one of his edicts: “A person must not do reverence to his own sect or disparage the beliefs of another without reason.” In parts of South Asia today, different sects still find it difficult to sit and settle their differences even when the state intervenes, yet a few centuries ago, the king Akbar arranged interfaith dialogues.</p><p>Sen also thoroughly presents a convincing case for how India’s intellectual accomplishments were marred by biases associated with its colonial past. His critique of James Mill’s (father of John Stuart Mill) work on Indian history is particularly insightful.</p><p>This book also introduced me to Tagore and his ideas, such as his views on education and his critique of patriotism and nationalism.</p><p>Additionally, the book discusses the accomplished Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray (who was awarded an Oscar for lifetime of cinematic excellence). After reading about him, I watched some of his movies, which are not only fascinating but also thought-provoking. Simple storytelling, yet stories that make you think.</p><p>Overall, this book illuminated some corners of my brain—it was educational.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nietzsche-Spirits-Cambridge-History-Philosophy/dp/0521567041" rel="">Human, All Too Human by Nietzsche</a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png" width="306" height="384.5131578947368" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:764,&quot;width&quot;:608,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:306,&quot;bytes&quot;:234442,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d11094b-ae20-48c0-8351-f4066bafebae_608x764.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Nietzsche wasn’t trained as a philosopher; he was trained as a philologist, and he had a way with words. He wrote penetrating thoughts about culture, society, morals, arts, and politics in this multifaceted work. You may disagree with Nietzsche on ideas he considers first-rate, but you cannot disregard him as a second-rate writer.</p><p>Nietzsche uses an aphoristic style, which Wikipedia defines as: “An aphorism is a concise, terse, laconic, or memorable expression of a general truth or principle.” Why did he use that style? Perhaps because of his severe and disabling health problems. Or maybe he prized the aphoristic style because he believed “brevity is the soul of wit.” Some of the aphorisms in the book indeed show sharp wit.</p><p><span>One might speculate that his aphoristic style could lead to incoherence of thought in this work. I don’t find that to be the case. In several places, I found him laying the foundations for some of his notable ideas, such as </span><em>will to power</em><span>. One cannot be incoherent and simultaneously lay out influential ideas in philosophy.</span></p><p><span>One major theme I took away from this book is to bring anything I believe under much stronger scrutiny; only such scrutiny can bring us closer to the truth. The subtitle of the book is </span><em>A Book for Free Spirits</em><span>. What does he mean by a free spirit? It’s someone able to liberate themselves from the chains that hinder them, to scrupulously scrutinize ideas, and to show determination to undertake tasks requiring excellence, strength, and courage to break away from conventional values, traditions, and societal expectations.</span></p><p>In Nietzsche’s own words, a free spirit feels like a wanderer, rejects dependence on things like honors, money, or official positions, and is thankful for the struggles and uncertainties of life. A free spirit is curious and daring, works tirelessly, uses resources carefully, is inventive and flexible, and has a love of solitude.</p><p>On being bound by tradition, in one of his aphorisms he says:</p><blockquote><p><br><span>The less men are bound by tradition, the greater is the fermentation of motivations within them, and the greater, in consequence, their outward restlessness, their mingling together with one another, their polyphony of endeavors.</span></p></blockquote><p>On habits in drawing conclusions, he observes:</p><blockquote><p><br><span>The commonest erroneous conclusions drawn by mankind are these: a thing exists, therefore it has a right to. Here the conclusion is from the capacity to live to the fitness to live, from the fitness to live to the right to live. Then: an opinion makes happy, therefore it is a true opinion, its effect is good, therefore it itself is good and true.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In the book, one can also see Nietzsche developing and laying the foundations for his ideas, such as </span><em>will to power</em><span>. For example:</span></p><blockquote><p><br><span>The reason the man of power is grateful is this. His benefactor has, through the help he has given him, as it were, laid hands on the sphere of the man of power and intruded into it: now, by way of requital, the man of power in turn lays hands on the sphere of his benefactor through the act of gratitude. It is a milder form of revenge. If he did not have the compensation of gratitude, the man of power would have appeared unpowerful and thenceforth counted as such. That is why every community of the good, that is to say originally the powerful, places gratitude among its first duties. Swift suggested that men are grateful in the same degree as they are revengeful.</span></p></blockquote><p>On intellect and morality, he writes:</p><blockquote><p><br><span>One has to have a good memory if one is to keep a promise. One has to have a powerful imagination if one is to feel sympathy. So closely is morality tied to the quality of the intellect.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>There is an interesting chapter titled </span><em>From the Souls of Artists and Writers</em><span>—interesting because art and writing interest me. On the sudden occurrence of inspiration versus gradual work leading to excellence, he states:</span></p><blockquote><p><br><span>Artists have an interest in the existence of a belief in the sudden occurrence of ideas, in so-called inspirations; as though the idea of a work of art, a poem, the basic proposition of a philosophy flashed down from heaven like a ray of divine grace. In reality, the imagination of a good artist or thinker is productive continually, of good, mediocre and bad things, but this power of judgement, sharpened and practised to the highest degree, rejects, selects, knots together; as we can now see from Beethoven’s notebooks how the most glorious melodies were put together gradually and as it were culled out of many beginnings.</span></p></blockquote><p>Nietzsche also shares a recipe for becoming a good novelist:</p><blockquote><p><br><span>The recipe for becoming a good novelist, for example, is easy to give, but to carry it out presupposes qualities one is accustomed to overlook when one says, ‘I do not have enough talent.’ One has only to make a hundred or so sketches for novels, none longer than two pages but of such distinctness that every word in them is necessary; one should write down anecdotes each day until one has learned how to give them the most pregnant and effective form; one should be tireless in collecting and describing human types and characters; one should above all relate things to others and listen to others relate, keeping one’s eyes and ears open for the effect produced on those present; one should travel like a landscape painter or costume designer; one should excerpt for oneself out of the individual sciences everything that will produce an artistic effect when it is well described; one should, finally, reflect on the motives of human actions, disdain no signpost to instruction about them, and be a collector of these things by day and night. One should continue in this many-sided exercise some ten years: what is then created in the workshop, however, will be fit to go out into the world. What, however, do most people do? They begin, not with the parts, but with the whole. Perhaps they chance to strike a right note, excite attention and from then on strike worse and worse notes, for good, natural reasons.</span></p></blockquote><p>On why thinkers write badly, Nietzsche remarks:</p><blockquote><p><br><span>Most thinkers write badly because they communicate to us not only their thoughts but also the thinking of their thoughts.</span></p></blockquote><p>And on who is the best author, he states:</p><blockquote><p><br><span>The best author will be he who is ashamed to become a writer.</span></p></blockquote><p>Nietzsche also has interesting thoughts favoring idleness:</p><blockquote><p><br><span>Scholars are ashamed of </span><em>otium</em><span> (leisure). But there is something noble about leisure and idleness. If idleness really is the beginning of all vice, then it is at any rate in the closest proximity to all virtue; the idle man is always a better man than the active. But when I speak of leisure and idleness, you do not think I am alluding to you, do you, you sluggers?</span></p></blockquote><p>And in another aphorism about leisure, he notes:</p><blockquote><p><br><span>The man who lies ill in bed sometimes discovers that what he is ill from is usually his office, his business, or his society, and that through them he has lost all circumspection with regard to himself: he acquires this wisdom from the leisure to which his illness has compelled him.</span></p></blockquote><p>This is the only book from which I want to share the most. Right now, as I write this, just like a child who wants to show all his favorite toys to his friends, I want to share all my favorite thoughts from this book. I have to admit, I have never read a philosopher who had more penetrating thoughts in a book. Some of his ideas hit you like a thunderbolt. His writing is penetrating, and he makes his point in as few words as possible. He means business. He should be read.</p><p><em>If you enjoyed this essay, or if it struck a chord with you, I would be honored if you shared it with someone who might appreciate it. Writing gives my life meaning—it’s a pursuit I hold close—and your support, whether through a subscription, a one-time donation, or a recommendation, motivates me to keep going. For this, I am deeply grateful. Thank you for being part of this journey.</em></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>
