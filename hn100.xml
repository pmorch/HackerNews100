            <span>Abstract:</span>The capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models have been sketched out in great detail in recent years, providing an intriguing yet conflicting picture. On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems. On the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans, casting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies. The sheer volume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded us from applying the method traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation. To overcome this, we study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ when performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely on. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their pretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for three simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that are influential for answering factual questions. We find that, while the models rely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document often has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the same task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. We further find that the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential data. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as highly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps. When we characterise the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions qualitatively, we confirm that the influential documents often contain procedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using formulae or code. Our findings indicate that the approach to reasoning the models use is unlike retrieval, and more like a generalisable strategy that synthesises procedural knowledge from documents doing a similar form of reasoning.

<article>
<p>Hi!  I'm <a href="https://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>. I make Advent of Code.  I hope you like it!  I also make <a href="https://was.tl/projects/">lots of other things</a>.  I'm on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/was.tl" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ericwastl" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://github.com/topaz" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><em>Advent of Code</em> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar">Advent calendar</a> of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code">any</a> programming language you like. People use them as <a href="https://twitter.com/dznqbit/status/1037607793144938497">interview prep</a>, company training, <a href="https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home">university</a> <a href="https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html">coursework</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584">practice</a> <a href="https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/">problems</a>, a <a href="https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard">speed contest</a>, or to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&amp;restrict_sr=on">challenge each other</a>.</p>
<p>You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/">problem solving skills</a> will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.</p>
<p>If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to  it with others or directly via <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/support">AoC++</a>.</p>
<h2>--- General Tips ---</h2>
<p>If you get stuck, try your solution against the <em>examples</em> given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers.  If not, re-read the description.  Did you misunderstand something?  Is your program doing something you don't expect?  After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, <em>build some test cases</em> for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program.  Make sure you have the entire puzzle input.  If you're still stuck, maybe <em>ask a friend</em> for help, or come back to the puzzle later.  You can also ask for hints in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<h2>--- Frequently Asked Questions ---</h2>
<p id="faq_codeselect"><em>Is there an easy way to select entire code blocks?</em> You should be able to triple-click code blocks to select them. You'll need JavaScript enabled.</p><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print "You can test it out by ";
print "triple-clicking this code.\n";
</code></pre>
<p id="faq_auth"><em>How does authentication work?</em> Advent of Code uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" target="_blank">OAuth</a> to confirm your identity through other services.  When you log in, you only ever give your credentials to that service - never to Advent of Code.  Then, the service you use tells the Advent of Code servers that you're really you.  In general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public; here are examples from <a href="https://api.reddit.com/user/reddit/about" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://api.github.com/users/octocat" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Advent of Code will remember your unique ID, names, URL, and image from the service you use to authenticate.</p>
<p id="faq_compete"><em>Should I compete on the global leaderboard?</em> Maybe. Solving puzzles is hard enough on its own, but competing for a spot on the global leaderboard also requires <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard">many</a> <a href="https://kevinyap.ca/2019/12/going-fast-in-advent-of-code/">additional</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/mcpower/87427528b9ba5cac6f0c679370789661">skills</a> and a lot of practice. Depending on the puzzle, that day's leaderboard usually fills up anywhere between two minutes and an hour. If that sounds interesting, go for it! However, you should do Advent of Code in a way that is useful to you, and so it is completely fine to choose <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e2wjhf/comment/f90ksek/">an approach that meets your goals</a> and ignore the leaderboard entirely.</p>
<p id="faq_difficulty"><em>Why was this puzzle so easy / hard?</em> The difficulty and subject matter varies throughout each event. Very generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time, but your specific skillset will make each puzzle significantly easier or harder for you than someone else. Making puzzles is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/question_why_does_the_difficulty_vary_so_much/dqy08tk/">tricky</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_unlocktime"><em>Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5?</em> Because that's when I can consistently be available to make sure everything is working. I also have a family, a day job, and even need sleep occasionally. If you can't participate at midnight, that's not a problem; many people use <a href="https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard/private">private leaderboards</a> to compete with people in their area.</p>
<p id="faq_highcontrast"><em>I find the text on the site hard to read. Is there a high contrast mode?</em> There is a high contrast alternate stylesheet. Firefox supports these by default (View -&gt; Page Style -&gt; High Contrast).</p>
<p id="faq_puzzleideas"><em>I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you?</em> Please don't. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don't accept puzzle ideas, and I won't even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.</p>
<p id="faq_puzzlebugs"><em>Did I find a bug with a puzzle?</em> Once a puzzle has been out for even an hour, many people have already solved it; after that point, bugs are very unlikely. Start by asking on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_streaming"><em>Can I stream my solution?</em> Please try to avoid giving away the solution while people are competing. If a puzzle's global daily leaderboard isn't full yet and you're likely to get points, please wait to stream/post your solution until after that leaderboard is full. If you are unlikely to get points or the daily leaderboard is already full for the puzzle you're working on, streaming is fine.</p>
<p id="faq_ai_leaderboard"><em>Can I use AI to get on the global leaderboard?</em> Please don't use AI / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">LLMs</a> (like GPT) to automatically solve a day's puzzles until that day's global leaderboards are full. By "automatically", I mean using AI to do most or all of the puzzle solving, like handing the puzzle text directly to an LLM. The leaderboards are for human competitors; if you want to compare the speed of your AI solver with others, please do so elsewhere. (If you want to use AI to <em>help</em> you solve puzzles, I can't really stop you, but I feel like it's harder to get better at programming if you ask an AI to do the programming for you.)</p>
<p id="faq_copying"><em>Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?</em> Please don't. Advent of Code is free to <em>use</em>, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly-scoped environments, we argue that it presents two major challenges when deploying LLM agents in real-world scenarios: (1) selecting from a fixed set of actions significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) this approach requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which becomes impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. In this work, we propose an LLM agent framework that enables the dynamic creation and composition of actions in an online manner. In this framework, the agent interacts with the environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language at each step. Furthermore, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that this framework offers significantly greater flexibility and outperforms previous methods. Notably, it allows an LLM agent to recover in scenarios where no relevant action exists in the predefined set or when existing actions fail due to unforeseen edge cases. At the time of writing, we hold the top position on the GAIA public leaderboard.

  <h3>The New OpenWrt One on sale now for $89  — Ultimate Gift for Right-To-Repair Enthusiasts</h3>


<p>November 29, 2024</p>


  
    <p>Today, we at SFC, along with our OpenWrt member project, announce the production release of the OpenWrt One.  This is the first wireless Internet router designed and built with your software freedom and right to repair in mind.  The OpenWrt One will never be locked down and is forever unbrickable.  This device services <strong>your</strong> needs as its owner and user.  Everyone deserves control of their computing.  The OpenWrt One takes a great first step toward bringing software rights to your home: you can control your own network with the software of your choice, and ensure your right to change, modify, and repair it as you like.</p>

<p>The OpenWrt One demonstrates what's possible when hardware designers and manufacturers prioritize your software right to repair; OpenWrt One exuberantly follows these requirements of the copyleft licenses of Linux and other GPL'd programs.  This device provides the fully copyleft-compliant source code release from the start.  Device owners have all the rights as intended on Day 1; device owners are encouraged to take full advantage of these rights to improve and repair the software on their OpenWrt One.</p>
  

  
    
      <p>Priced at <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007795779282.html">US$89 for a complete OpenWrt One with case</a> (or <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008143000598.html">US$68.42  for a caseless One's logic board</a>), it's ready for a wide variety of use cases.  Manufactured in collaboration with Banana Pi, the OpenWrt One uses the MediaTek MT7981B SoC, with MT7976C wifi, 1 GiB DDR4 RAM, 128 MiB SPI NAND + 4 MiB SPI NOR flash, two Ethernet ports (2.5 GbE and 1 GbE), a USB host port, M.2 2042 for NVMe SSD or similar devices, and mikroBUS expansion header.  The OpenWrt offers both PoE (Power over Ethernet) via the 2.5 GbE port , or direct power via the USB-C power port with 12V USB-PD.  A convenient USB serial interface is built into the other USB-C port: expert users won't miss any boot messages!  This hacker-friendly device is unbrickable, providing a switch to separately flash the NOR and NAND portions of the flash memory.</p>

<p>This new product has completed full FCC compliance tests; it's confirmed that OpenWrt met all of the FCC compliance requirements.  Industry “conventional wisdom” often argues that FCC requirements somehow conflict with the software right to repair.  SFC has long argued that's pure <acronym title="Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt">FUD</acronym>.  We at SFC and OpenWrt have now proved copyleft compliance, the software right to repair, and FCC requirements are all attainable  in one product!</p>

<p>You can order an OpenWrt One now!  Since today is the traditional day in the USA when folks buy gifts for love ones, we urge you to invest in a wireless router that can last!  We do expect that for orders placed today, sellers will deliver by December 22 in most countries.</p>

<p>Everyone can purchase <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007795779282.html">a complete OpenWrt One with case</a> or <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008143000598.html">just the board</a> via those links and other sale outlets, too.  Regardless of where you buy from, for every purchase of a new OpenWrt One, a US$10 donation will go to the OpenWrt earmarked fund at Software Freedom Conservancy.  Your purchase not only improves your software right to repair, but also helps OpenWrt and SFC continue to improve the important software and software freedom on which we all rely!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/privastead/images/blob/main/banner.svg"><img src="https://github.com/privastead/images/raw/main/banner.svg" alt="Privastead"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Privastead</h2><a id="user-content-privastead" aria-label="Permalink: Privastead" href="#privastead"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Privastead is a privacy-preserving home security camera solution that uses end-to-end encryption.
It has three key benefits:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>End-to-end encryption using the OpenMLS implementation of the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol.</li>
<li>Software-only solution that works with existing IP cameras with minimal trust assumptions about the IP camera.</li>
<li>Rust implementation (camera hub, MLS code for the mobile app, and untrusted server).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Components</h2><a id="user-content-components" aria-label="Permalink: Components" href="#components"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Privastead camera solution has three components:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A camera hub, which runs on a local machine and directly interacts with IP camera(s).</li>
<li>A mobile app that allows one to receive event notifications (e.g., motion) as well as livestream the camera remotely.</li>
<li>An untrusted server that relays (encrypted) messages between the hub and the app. In addition, Privastead uses the Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for notifications. Similar to the server, FCM is untrusted.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Threat Model and Guarantees</h2><a id="user-content-threat-model-and-guarantees" aria-label="Permalink: Threat Model and Guarantees" href="#threat-model-and-guarantees"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The key advantage of the Privastead camera solution over existing home security camera solutions is that it provides strong privacy assurance using end-to-end encryption.
More specifically, it makes the following assumptions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It assumes that the local machine running the hub and the smartphone running the mobile app are secure and not compromised.</li>
<li>It assumes that the server is fully untrusted and under the control of the adversary.</li>
<li>It makes minimal trust assumptions about the IP camera. That is, it assumes that the camera does not have a covert, undisclosed network interface card (e.g., cellular) to connect to the Internet on its own (therefore, it's best that this is explicitly checked and verified by user). Other than that, the IP camera is untrusted and hence Privastead does not directly connect the camera to the Internet; rather, the camera is connected to the hub directly.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It then provides the following guarantees:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It guarantees that only the hub and the mobile app have access to unecrypted videos.</li>
<li>It guarantees that the server cannot decrypt the videos.</li>
<li>It provides forward secrecy and post-comproise security through MLS (see definitions below).</li>
<li>It does NOT currently hide the timing of events and livestreams from the adversary (who we assume is in control of the server and/or FCM channel).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Definitions: According to MLS: ``Forward secrecy means that messages sent at a certain point in time are secure in the face of later compromise of a group member. Post-compromise security means that messages are secure even if a group member was compromised at some point in the past.''
What do these mean in Privastead?
In Privastead, the camera hub and the mobile app are the only members in an MLS group used for transfer of videos.
They mean that if the key used to encrypt a video between the hub and the app is compromised, that key cannot be used to decrypt any of the videos sent before and after the compromised video.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported Cameras</h2><a id="user-content-supported-cameras" aria-label="Permalink: Supported Cameras" href="#supported-cameras"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Privastead camera can theoretically support any IP camera (or any other camera that has an open interface).
The current prototype relies on RTSP and ONVIF support by the camera.
The former is used for streaming videos from the camera and the latter is used for querying events.
So far, the following cameras have been tested:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Amcrest, model: IP4M-1041W (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-UltraHD-Security-4-Megapixel-IP4M-1041W/dp/B095XD17K5/" rel="nofollow">Link</a> on Amazon)
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Software Version: V2.800.00AC006.0.R, Build Date: 2023-10-27</li>
<li>WEB Version: V3.2.1.18144</li>
<li>ONVIF Version: 21.12(V3.1.0.1207744)</li>

<p dir="auto">Ntfs2btrfs is a tool which does in-place conversion of Microsoft's NTFS
filesystem to the open-source filesystem Btrfs, much as <code>btrfs-convert</code>
does for ext2. The original image is saved as a reflink copy at
<code>image/ntfs.img</code>, and if you want to keep the conversion you can delete
this to free up space.</p>
<p dir="auto">Although I believe this tool to be stable, please note that I take no
responsibility if something goes awry!</p>
<p dir="auto">You're probably also interested in <a href="https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs">WinBtrfs</a>,
which is a Btrfs filesystem driver for Windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ebiggers">Eric Biggers</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/ebiggers/ntfs-3g-system-compression/">successfully reverse-engineered</a> Windows 10's
"WOF compressed data", and whose code I've used here.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, from an Administrator command prompt:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>ntfs2btrfs.exe D:\</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Bear in mind that it won't work with your boot drive or a drive containing a
pagefile that's currently in use.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are using WinBtrfs, you will need to clear the readonly flag on the
<code>image</code> subvolume before you can delete it.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Linux, as root:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>ntfs2btrfs /dev/sda1</code></p>
