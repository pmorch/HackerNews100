Always be collecting evidence that you’re wrong, always be trying new things in case you’ve been blind. Never pass up an opportunity to change, learn, grow.</p><p>So… how are you supposed to explore other ideas if you’re also supposed to be saying “no” to anything that diverges from The Plan?</p><p><strong>Here’s what I do: I never say “no.” But I carefully qualify “yes.”</strong></p><p>I learned this trick in high school. In the mid ’90s it was clear that Apple had lost the personal computer battle and all their developers were fleeing like rats off a sinking ship into the ocean of opportunity that was Windows 95. As a maven of the Macintosh API and still willing to admit it, I landed small contracting jobs fixing up code that other developers wouldn’t touch.</p><p>My typical rate was $25 per hour, which feels like a lot of money when you’re 17 in the ’90s.</p><p>One day I got a call from some poor schleps I didn’t want to help. They had just completed a new product written in Java and it was broken on a Mac, and could I help? None of their customers used Macs, so they didn’t think Macs were important, but then it turns out the main investor is keen on seeing the demo on a Mac, and when they tried it, it didn’t work. (Yay investors! Yay supposedly-cross-platform-platforms-that-aren’t-really!)</p><p>I wanted no part of this. Java was brand new and known to be full of bugs, and anyway I was a C/C++ kind of guy, and I didn’t want to get involved in an academic fad language like Java<sup>1</sup>.</p><blockquote>
<sup>1</sup>
<span> So yeah, I simultaneously decided that (1) Java is a fad and (2) I’m sticking with the Macintosh Toolkit; five years later one those platforms had zero developers and the other had one million, and I picked exactly wrong. <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/" data-title="Navigating the unpredictability of everything" data-desc="We dramatically, repeatedly fail to predict the future. Does that mean “strategy” is senseless? No, it means you need these techniques to navigate a volatile world." data-image-src1="https://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/thumbnail-352w.webp" data-image-src2="https://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/thumbnail-704w.webp">Predicting the future</a> is hard.</span></blockquote><p>I could have said “no.” Given my specialty and my goals, traditional career (or startup) theory says I should have said “no.”</p><p>But instead, on the advice of an older, wiser friend, I showed up at their office and said I’d do it for $100 per hour.</p><p>I fully expected them to laugh in my face. Maybe I would receive a condescending talking-to about the audacity—nay, the <em>impudence!—</em> of someone of my tender age and meager experience walking in here and demanding such outrageous compensation, someone who, let’s be clear, is technically too young to even enter into a legal consulting agreement in the first place.</p><p>And then I would have slinked out of there, embarrassed but ultimately no worse for wear.</p><p>But that’s not what happened. They looked me up and down, their faces painted with both incredulity and surrender. They said OK.&nbsp;An hour and a half later, everything was working. The difference between saying “no” and getting $150 for about two hours of my life was all in how I phrased “yes.”</p><p><strong>And I have stories that went the other way, which are just as important.</strong></p><p>At <a href="http://wpengine.com/?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_medium=post" target="_blank">WP Engine</a>, for example, we’re constantly talking to large bloggers who want to move to our system. These are folks with big requirements—tens of millions of monthly page-views, traffic spikes, custom code, perfect up-time, and 24/7 support.</p><p>Should we take on those clients? Maybe not—after all the stated goal of WP Engine is to serve the “middle market”—the folks who have outgrown free blogs, don’t like maintaining their own servers, but aren’t so large that they have extreme hosting demands. That’s our profitable niche<sup>2</sup>.</p><blockquote>
<sup>2</sup>
<span> Editor’s note: This was written about 1 year into WP Engine’s life; in 2023 WP Engine is 13 years old with 200,000 customers, and powers more large WordPress sites than anyone on Earth. This <em>was</em> a great segment to start off with, but we evolved as we scaled.</span></blockquote><p>Or so we think. But if we just say “no” to these big bloggers, maybe we’re closing the door on big, important orders. Perhaps the entire company should pivot—maybe it’s easier or more profitable to serve 100 large blogs than 1000 medium ones. But how do we know if we say “no?”</p><p>Then again, if we say “yes” we might really be screwed. If we can’t provide them the human and technical service they expect, now we’ve hurt a blogger, we get bad press, and we’ve wasted a bunch of time.&nbsp;Or even worse, we hold on for dear life but it’s extremely unprofitable, and now we have this expensive, time-consuming albatross around our necks.</p><p>So we’ve said “yes” by quoting high enough that we know for certain we will make good money on the deal, so much so that it will partially fund something else we want to do. Maybe that means a big new advertising campaign, or hiring another WordPress expert for our staff.</p><p>There was one especially large customer where we literally thought of it like this: This deal needs to be big enough to not only make a reasonable profit on the operating expenses, but pay for an entire developer’s salary (assuming bootstrapped, put-in-elbow-grease-for-stock low salary), because we know this new customer will occupy a lot of that person’s time, but all the remaining time we get “for free.”</p><p>So we’ve given a lot of qualified yeses, and many were rejected. (P.S. Now we’re able to say “yes” to those same bloggers, but that’s because over time we’ve taken on bigger and bigger customers, and now a blogger with 30 million month page-views is something we know we can handle.)</p><p>At <a href="http://smartbear.com/?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_medium=post" target="_blank">Smart Bear</a> I used this principle yet again. Companies would fly me out to help them implement a peer code review process, which half the time actually meant that “management” wanted me to convince everyone else that code review was a good idea, and invent a process painless enough that they might actually do it.</p><p>From a business perspective, this was a poor use of my time. These folks had already bought our software, so it didn’t sell more seats. When you counted a travel day on either side of the engagement, the time I lost could have been spent landing just one additional customer or make some important changes to the code, either of which almost certainly makes us more money.</p><p>Therefore, initially I just said “no.” But again that’s wrong. Eventually I said “yes,” but the price was $2500/day <em>including travel days</em>, which for these sorts of engagements is unheard of. (Typically you get reimbursed for travel expenses but not paid for that time.)</p><p>This immediately cut out most trips, but some remained. On those trips I’d haul in $10,000 for a week of easy work, which I’d often combine with a long weekend with my wife. And anyway those people <em>really wanted me there</em>, which made the work that much more enjoyable.</p><p><strong>So the principle is straightforward:</strong> Set the conditions of “yes” such that:</p><ol>
<li><strong>If they say “yes,” you’re happy</strong> because the terms or money are <em>so good</em>, it more than compensates for the distraction, perhaps funding the thing you really want to do.</li><li><strong>If they say “no,” you’re happy</strong> because it wasn’t a great fit anyway; it’s not a worthwhile return on your time and effort.</li></ol><p>So that’s the punch-line, but before you leave I’d like to <strong>over-emphasize the idea of “funding the thing you really want to do.”</strong></p><p>This can take many forms, but it’s the single best way of figuring out <em>how</em> to qualify your “yes.” Examples:</p><ul>
<li>“Yes” if it pays for an entire additional person.</li><li>“Yes” if this extends the runway of our startup by at least three months.</li><li>“Yes” if it completely funds development we’d like to do anyway.</li><li>“Yes” if it means one of the co-founders can quit her day-job.</li><li>“Yes” if it will completely pay for three new marketing efforts.</li></ul><p>Think of it like another form of funding. <strong>Funding is always a distraction from actually running your business, so the amount of money you get must be transformative to the business.</strong> Each of those bullet points <em>are</em> transformative, in that each has the potential to move your company from “hobby” to “real business.”</p><p>And if they say “no,” you’re fine with that, because it would have been a distraction which wouldn’t have moved the needle.</p><div><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Comment</span> Mozilla seems to be asleep at the wheel, when it once drove online activity and communications. We have some suggestions where it could go.</p>
<p>Mozilla is the <a target="_blank" href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2021/mozilla-fdn-2021-fs-final-1010.pdf" rel="nofollow">wealthy</a> [PDF] independent organization behind the only all-FOSS browser engine that's independent of commercial vendors. It also does important security research – its recent <a target="_blank" href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/" rel="nofollow">report</a> on the abysmal privacy of in-car software is a good example.</p>
<p>Firefox remains a powerful, capable, fast, and resource-efficient browser. For instance, it doesn't just render PDFs in-browser, without plugins or helpers, it lets you <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/18/firefox_106_arrives/">amend or annotate them</a> too. The latest <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/118.0/releasenotes/" rel="nofollow">Firefox 118</a> has privacy-centric, local, in-browser language translation. Some of its shorcuts and <a target="_blank" href="https://exple.tive.org/blarg/2020/10/25/navigational-instruments/" rel="nofollow">navigational features</a> will probably surprise you.</p>
<h3>Mozilla's programming languages (yes, plural)</h3>
<p>Mozilla also invented not one but two of the hottest programming languages around. This century, it invented the Rust programming language, as we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2011/06/17/mozilla_multithreaded_firsfox_dom_project/">reported back in 2011</a>. In recent years that seems to be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/26/rust_column/">eating&nbsp;into every major OS</a>… but six months into the pandemic, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/14/mozilla_google_search/">Mozilla laid off the entire team</a>, killing its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/04/03/samsung_helps_mozilla_with_servo/">next-gen rendering engine</a>, Servo.</p>
<p>(Much of Mozilla's revenue comes from Google, of course. This couldn't be because Rust was, and is, outshining Google's GoLang? Surely not?)</p>

    

<p>Back in 1995, before even <em>The Register</em>, Mozilla's commercial forerunner Netscape <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_history.asp" rel="nofollow">invented</a> JavaScript, which it introduced with Netscape 2.0; as this fossilized announcement <a target="_blank" href="https://tidbits.com/1995/11/27/netscape-2-0b3-sneaks-out/" rel="nofollow">notes</a>, "of possible interest to developers." Yeah, just a tad.</p>
<h3>Mozilla's messaging client</h3>
<p>Mozilla also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/01/30/mozilla_thunderbird_has_a_new_nest/">backs the development</a> of the leading cross-platform messaging client, Thunderbird. This was sadly neglected for years, but even so, its developers kept working on it. A few highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>2015: <a target="_blank" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-38" rel="nofollow">Thunderbird 38</a> gets <a target="_blank" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/calendar-integration-thunderbird" rel="nofollow">integrated</a> calendar handling, derived from the Lightning addon.</li>

<li>2017: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/51.0beta/releasenotes/" rel="nofollow">Thunderbird 51</a> gained chat support over IRC and XMPP (alongside XMPP-based services such as Google Talk), derived from <a target="_blank" href="http://instantbird.com/" rel="nofollow">Instantbird</a>.</li>

<li>2020: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/78.0/releasenotes/" rel="nofollow">Thunderbird 78</a> gets integrated PGP email encryption support, replacing the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/" rel="nofollow">EnigMail</a> add-on.</li>

<li>2022: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/30/thunderbird_102/">Thunderbird 102</a> gets Matrix chat support (even if that protocol <a target="_blank" href="https://telegra.ph/why-not-matrix-08-07" rel="nofollow">remains controversial</a> in some quarters).</li>

<li>2023: Thunderbird 115 gets a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/new_betas_of_firefox_and_tbird/">revamped UI</a>, formerly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/14/thunderbird_115_supernova_complete_overhaul/">codenamed Supernova</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/15/thunderbird_is_coming_to_android/">at some point soon</a>, an Android version is <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/08/thunderbird-for-android-k-9-mail-june-2023-progress-report/" rel="nofollow">coming</a>.</p>
<h3>Mozilla's mobile OS</h3>
<p>Mozilla also had a mobile OS, which a decade ago <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/07/01/firefox_os_race_for_third_place/">we called the third-place contender</a> and which it officially <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/02/04/mozilla_kills_firefox_os_in_favour_of_connected_devices/">killed off in 2016</a>. Boot2Gecko, marketed as FirefoxOS, was rebooted under the name KaiOS. It won some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/28/kaios_google_investment/">Google investment in 2018</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/03/04/energizer_hard_case_h280s/">we even reviewed a KaiOS phone</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>KaiOS is still around, and still in third place, which in such a huge market isn't a bad place to be; it implies substantial growth. Its owner <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaiostech.com/company/our-story/" rel="nofollow">claims</a> 160 million devices, which is no minor rounding error. The Finnish Fund For Industrial Cooperation recently bunged KaiosTech a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.finnfund.fi/en/news/finnfunds-3-4-million-us-dollar-investment-in-kaios-helps-bring-affordable-mobile-connections-to-sub-saharan-africa/" rel="nofollow">few million</a> to help them expand into the new growth market of sub-Saharan Africa. The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kaiostech/gecko-b2g" rel="nofollow">code</a> on GitHub still has Mozilla trademarks all over it. Why isn't this a famous FOSS project to rival, or merge with, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/15/postmarketos_2206/">postmarketOS</a>? Why doesn't Mozilla talk about it, or better still, reclaim it?</p>
<h3>Mozilla's… web editor and music player</h3>
<p>It also formerly had some other gems. The original "Mozilla" was an all-in-one suite of internet tools, derived from Netscape Communicator: a browser, plus an messaging client – then meaning email <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/30/usenet_revival/">plus USENET</a> – plus calendar, address book, workflow it acquired with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/22/business/company-news-netscape-agrees-to-buy-collabra-software.html" rel="nofollow">Collabra</a>, and an HTML editor. A combined suite is still around, in the guise of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seamonkey-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Seamonkey Project</a>.</p>
<p>Although HTML is everywhere, you don't hear much about HTML editors any more – largely because the static stuff has been rendered almost obsolete by dynamically generated web content, much of it generated by code in Mozilla languages, of course. Even decades after Mozilla dropped it, the leading FOSS HTML editor remains Mozilla code; it's just about hanging on in the form of <a target="_blank" href="http://bluegriffon.org/" rel="nofollow">BlueGriffon</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>To be honest, we're not sure that it really needed its own music player, but <a target="_blank" href="https://getsongbird.net/" rel="nofollow">Songbird</a> was a thing for a while. With many companies, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/10/01/bbc_tunein_radio_streams_pulled/">including the BBC</a>, making it harder to stream without their own clients, there might be an opening there.</p>
<h3>Mozilla's server software</h3>
<p>LDAP is not trendy and never really has been, but it's still useful. Red Hat sells an LDAP server as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/directory-server" rel="nofollow">Red Hat Directory Server</a>. The code <a target="_blank" href="https://www.port389.org/docs/389ds/FAQ/history.html" rel="nofollow">originated</a> as the Netscape Directory Server, and the community-supported FOSS version is now called the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.port389.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">389 Directory Server</a>, after the TCP port that LDAP <a target="_blank" href="https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=389" rel="nofollow">uses</a> .</p>

<h3>An impressive history</h3>
<p>Netscape was the original open source web browser. We've been covering it from the start; in 1998, owner AOL <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/1998/11/25/aol_netscape_deal_questions_open/">promised to open source it</a> – before Google was even founded (25 years ago on Monday, as it happens). Four years later, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2002/06/06/mozilla_1_0_released_after/">the open source version shipped</a>. Twenty years ago, <em>The Reg</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2003/04/03/cleaner_lighter_mozilla_vowed/">covered its rebirth as Phoenix</a> (and when it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2004/02/09/public_offering_for_opera_mozilla/">became Firefox the next year</a>).</p>
<p>So how, and why, has this vastly innovative, pioneering company become a straggler among followers?</p>
<p>It's let many of its jewels go. Some canceled, some sold off, some given away. Many have found new homes, from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/08/rust_language_foundation/">Rust's foundation</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/servo_returns/">the Servo engine</a>.</p>

        

<p>And yet it still has some powerful, valuable tech.</p>
<h3>Whither the bird?</h3>
<p>Browsers are hard, <em>really</em> hard. The days when the web was just HTML are long gone. There are very few web <em>pages</em> any more; instead, they are programs, and worse still, they're client-server programs, with one end running on the device in front of you, talking to a different program running somewhere else.</p>
<p>Much of the modern computing world runs over this stuff. Ostensibly local applications, from Slack to Teams, are just JavaScript applets running inside their own private single-site browser – and those all use Google's browser engine. Web engines and web apps are a core part of the digital world – arguably, <em>the</em> core part.</p>
<p>As, of course, is open source: most web servers run on Linux, and on the client end, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.demandsage.com/android-statistics/" rel="nofollow">over 70 per cent</a> of smartphones run Android, which is also Linux underneath.</p>
<p>Just as over 70 percent of smartphones run Linux, over 70 per cent of browsers are based on Google's code. At the time of writing, <a target="_blank" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" rel="nofollow">some 64 per cent is Chrome</a>, plus 5.4 per cent Edge. Opera and the Samsung browser make up about another 5 per cent. As they all run on the same engine, Chromium – as does Vivaldi and Brave – that's perilously close to three quarters.</p>

        

<p>Safari, whose rendering engine WebKit is the origin of Chromium's Blink engine, is a little under 20 per cent, making it by far the leading non-Chromium browser – but almost exclusively on Apple OSes. <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web" rel="nofollow">GNOME Web</a>, codenamed Epiphany, is as far as we know the only WebKit browser on Linux (and, it should be noted, on Haiku as well). The Windows port of WebKit is still maintained — for instance, iTunes uses it – but the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oldversion.com/windows/safari/" rel="nofollow">Windows version</a> of Safari was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/07/25/safari_6_ships/">discontinued back in 2012</a>.</p>
<p>So how come the original open source web browser is now, Statcounter <a target="_blank" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" rel="nofollow">estimates</a>, under <em>3 percent</em>? Mozilla, it seems to us, has missed a lot of opportunities, and continues to do so.</p>
<p>There is still a niche for power user browsers, and for powerful integration tools to bring together disparate comms channels that force users into web apps and Electron clients. Despite the sales of ChromeBooks and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/16/google_chrome_os/">the free ChromeOS Flex</a>, despite the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/16/steam_deck_portable_gaming_pc/">Steam Deck</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/osseu_steam_os_3/">Steam OS</a>, Linux still isn't a mainstream end-user OS. If you run Linux, you're probably a power user. Firefox is <em>the</em> dominant Linux browser. By default, it's the <em>only</em> standalone app <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/beta_ubuntu_fedora/">in next month's Ubuntu Mantic Minotaur</a>.</p>
<p>Mozilla, please stop aping Chrome. Copying is rarely the way to win big. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/11/20/firefox_reveals_new_look_rounded_rectangles/">Australis Chrome-like theme</a> in Firefox 29 annoyed users and was a driving force behind <a target="_blank" href="https://www.palemoon.org/" rel="nofollow">Pale Moon</a>. Firefox Quantum killed XUL addons, and drove <em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk to <a target="_blank" href="https://classic.waterfox.net/" rel="nofollow">Waterfox Classic</a>. Others went to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basilisk-browser.org/" rel="nofollow">Basilisk</a> instead, while XP users have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mypal-browser.org/" rel="nofollow">MyPal</a>.</p>
<p>Even Microsoft's Chrome-based Edge has vertical tabs. Firefox doesn't, and to make them well, you must mess around with config files, although <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/26/firefox_power_user_guide/">we still feel it's worth it</a>. The Vivaldi browser shows that there is still plenty of room to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/02/vivaldi_5_7/">outdo Chrome on features</a>, and a market of people who want for them.</p>
<p>Can we please have a Firefox that leans into being the browser for power users? Bundle some of the more powerful extensions that survived your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/04/waterfox_firefox_fork/">self-inflicted extension extinction event</a>. Vertical or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab" rel="nofollow">tree-structured</a> tabs, on any edge. Menu bars and hotkeys. <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multithreaded-download-manager/" rel="nofollow">Multithreaded downloads</a>, even integrated <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/08/transmission_bittorrent_v4/">BitTorrent support</a>. Perhaps experiment with this stuff in the Firefox <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/" rel="nofollow">developer edition</a>. Bring back the customizability it once had, which you've been steadily removing for years.</p>
<p>Thunderbird is also a powerful asset. Although it too is sadly neglected, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pidgin.im/" rel="nofollow">Pidgin</a> is still around and still works, and <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhatIsLibpurple" rel="nofollow">libPurple</a> remains uniquely powerful. There are plugins that get it talking to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dylex/slack-libpurple" rel="nofollow">Slack</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hoehermann/purple-gowhatsapp" rel="nofollow">WhatsApp</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BenWiederhake/tdlib-purple/" rel="nofollow">Telegram</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-rocketchat" rel="nofollow">RocketChat</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hoehermann/purple-signal" rel="nofollow">Signal</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-mattermost" rel="nofollow">Mattermost</a>, you name it. Adopt it, update it, add it to <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.thunderbird.net/thunderbird-development/codebase-overview/chat" rel="nofollow">Chat Core</a>.</p>
<p>Thunderbird could be the universal client that talks to dozens of services in one place. There is room here for significant improvement over the existing multiprotocol messaging clients <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/19/friday_foss_fest/">we've described before</a>.</p>
<p>Leave Chrome and its offspring to the technophobic, and make some cross-platform tools for the keyboard merchants who know <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/23/email_like_a_pro/">how to email like a pro</a>. ®</p>

            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 07:44:29 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://diziet.dreamwidth.org/16025.html">https://diziet.dreamwidth.org/16025.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37723688">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you are an email system administrator, you are probably using DKIM to sign your outgoing emails. You should be rotating the key regularly and automatically, and publishing old private keys. I have just released <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/sgo-software-announce/2023/000086.html">dkim-rotate 1.0</a>; dkim-rotate is a tool to do this key rotation and publication.</p>
<p>If you are an email user, your email provider ought to be doing this. If this is not done, your emails are “non-repudiable”, meaning that if they are leaked, anyone (eg, journalists, haters) can verify that they are authentic, and prove that to others. This is not desirable (for you).</p>

<h3>Non-repudiation of emails is undesirable</h3>
<p>This problem was described at some length in Matthew Green’s article <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/11/16/ok-google-please-publish-your-dkim-secret-keys/">Ok Google: please publish your DKIM secret keys</a>.</p>
<p>Avoiding non-repudiation sounds a bit like lying. After all, I’m advising creating a situation where some people can’t verify that something is true, even though it is. So I’m advocating casting doubt. Crucially, though, it’s doubt about facts that ought to be private. When you send an email, that’s between you and the recipient. Normally you don’t intend for anyone, anywhere, who happens to get a copy, to be able to verify that it was really you that sent it.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this verifiability has already been used by journalists to verify stolen emails. Associated Press provide <a href="https://github.com/associatedpress/verify-dkim">a verification tool</a>.</p>
<h3>Advice for all email users</h3>
<p>As a user, you probably don’t want your emails to be non-repudiable. (Other people might want to be able to prove you sent some email, but your email system ought to serve your interests, not theirs.)</p>
<p>So, your email provider ought to be rotating their DKIM keys, and publishing their old ones. At a rough guess, your provider probably isn’t :-(.</p>
<h4>How to tell by looking at email headers</h4>
<p>A quick and dirty way to guess is to have a friend look at the email headers of a message you sent. (It is important that the friend uses a different email provider, since often DKIM signatures are not applied within a single email system.)</p>
<p>If your friend sees a <code>DKIM-Signature</code> header then the message is DKIM signed. If they don’t, then it wasn’t. Most email traversing the public internet is DKIM signed nowadays; so if they don’t see the header probably they’re not looking using the right tools, or they’re actually on the same email system as you.</p>
<p>In messages signed by a system running dkim-rotate, there will <em>also</em> be a header about the key rotation, to notify potential verifiers of the situation. Other systems that avoid non-repudiation-through-DKIM might do something similar. dkim-rotate’s header looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>DKIM-Signature-Warning: NOTE REGARDING DKIM KEY COMPROMISE
 https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/dkim-rotate/README.txt
 https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/dkim-rotate/ae/aeb689c2066c5b3fee673355309fe1c7.pem</code></pre>
<p>But an email system might do half of the job of dkim-rotate: regularly rotating the key would cause the signatures of old emails to fail to verify, which is a good start. In that case there probably won’t be such a header.</p>
<h4>Testing verification of new and old messages</h4>
<p>You can also try verifying the signatures. This isn’t entirely straightforward, especially if you don’t have access to low-level mail tooling. Your friend will need to be able to save emails as <em>raw whole headers and body</em>, un-decoded, un-rendered.</p>
<p>If your friend is using a traditional Unix mail program, they should save the message as an mbox file. Otherwise, ProPublica have <a href="https://www.propublica.org/nerds/authenticating-email-using-dkim-and-arc-or-how-we-analyzed-the-kasowitz-emails">instructions for attaching and transferring and obtaining the raw email</a>. (Scroll down to “How to Check DKIM and ARC”.)</p>
<h5>Checking that recent emails <em>are</em> verifiable</h5>
<p>Firstly, have your friend test that they can in fact verify a DKIM signature. This will demonstrate that the next test, where the verification is supposed to fail, is working properly and fails for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Send your friend a test email now, and have them do this on a Linux system:</p>
<pre><code>    # save the message as test-email.mbox
    apt install libmail-dkim-perl # or equivalent on another distro
    dkimproxy-verify &lt;test-email.mbox</code></pre>
<p>You should see output containing something like this:</p>
<pre><code>    originator address: ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk
    signature identity: @chiark.greenend.org.uk
    verify result: pass
    ...</code></pre>
<p>If the output ontains <code>verify result: fail (body has been altered)</code> then probably your friend didn’t manage to faithfully save the unalterered raw message.</p>
<h5>Checking <em>old</em> emails <em>cannot</em> be verified</h5>
<p>When you both have that working, have your friend find an older email of yours, from (say) month ago. Perform the same steps.</p>
<p>Hopefully they will see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>    originator address: ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk
    signature identity: @chiark.greenend.org.uk
    verify result: fail (bad RSA signature)</code></pre>
<p>or maybe</p>
<pre><code>    verify result: invalid (public key: not available)</code></pre>
<p>This indicates that this old email can no longer be verified. That’s good: it means that anyone who steals a copy, can’t verify it either. If it’s leaked, the journalist who receives it won’t know it’s genuine and unmodified; they should then be suspicious.</p>
<p>If your friend sees <code>verify result: pass</code>, then they have verified that that old email of yours is genuine. Anyone who had a copy of the mail can do that. This is good for email thieves, but not for you.</p>
<h3>For email admins: announcing dkim-rotate 1.0</h3>
<p>I have been running dkim-rotate 0.4 on my infrastructure, since last August. and I had entirely forgotten about it: it has run flawlessly for a year. I was reminded of the topic by seeing DKIM in other blog posts. Obviously, it is time to decreee that <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/sgo-software-announce/2023/000086.html">dkim-rotate is 1.0</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re a mail system administrator, your users are best served if you use something like dkim-rotate. The package is available in Debian stable, and supports Exim out of the box, but other MTAs should be easy to support too, via some simple ad-hoc scripting.</p>
<h3>Limitation of this approach</h3>
<p>Even with this key rotation approach, emails remain nonrepudiable for a short period after they’re sent - typically, a few days.</p>
<p>Someone who obtains a leaked email very promptly, and shows it to the journalist (for example) right away, can still convince the journalist. This is not great, but at least it doesn’t apply to the vast bulk of your email archive.</p>
<p>There are possible email protocol improvements which might help, but they’re quite out of scope for this article.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p>“My 30-year-old lemon pickle is salty. How can I fix it?” Renu Jain asked on a Facebook food group, bringing my scrolling to a grinding halt.</p>
<p>A 30-year-old pickle.</p>
<p>A pickle fiend myself, I was intrigued and browsed more than 300 comments on Renu’s post. Half were people as amazed as I was while the other half offered tips on fixing the pickle’s salt levels, saying they were common in their households.</p>
<p>“My 86-year-old father remembers having pickles that were 15-20 years old,” one said.</p>
<p>“I have a 20-year-old lemon pickle my mother-in-law gave me,” another said. So many pickles, 10 to 50 years old, eaten sparingly to conserve them for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>These aged pickles can accompany meals, be eaten on their own or with a little sugar to cut the saltiness, mixed into breads like parathas or diluted with buttermilk.</p>
<p>Pickles, in general, are an integral part of the Indian culinary landscape. Each community (and there are many) in the 28 states and eight union territories pickles local, seasonal produce.</p>
<p>Spices and techniques vary. Some use simple saltwater brine. Others marinate, sun-dry, and/or immerse in lots of oil – sesame or mustard oils being most common. Bottles of homemade pickles are packed in suitcases for travelling family members, as a spicy condiment when travelling or as gifts from the family pickle-maker to whomever.</p>

<p>For most Indians, buying commercially produced pickles is frowned upon. A lack of time to make pickles from scratch and a lack of space to sun-dry or store them have led to the rise of commercial pickle-making, but there are always a couple of bottles of homemade pickles in most homes.</p>
<p>And, as I was finding out, some are decades old.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-they-last-so-long">How do they last so long?</h2>
<p>“For a pickle to last years, it has to be dry,” said Krish Ashok, author of Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking.</p>
<p>“People figured out that to preserve anything, first, all water needs to be removed. Here’s where sun-drying or dehydration comes in. They also found salty environments to be hostile to bacteria and fungi, and acids help kill microbes. Vinegar is an example. … Similar is citric acid, naturally occurring in citrus fruits like lemon,” he added.</p>
<p>The last technique, he explained, is reducing oxygen to prevent oxidation, and that is where oil comes in. Pickled raw mango submerged in oil lasts a few years, although not decades, because the oil will go rancid.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2368712" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2368712"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_8905-1695312620.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C544" alt="Vernika Awal 22 year lemon pickle" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2368712">Vernika Awal’s 22-year-old lemon pickle [Courtesy of Vernika Awal]</figcaption></figure>
<p>The lemon lends itself to long-term ageing more than any other. The simplest way to make a lemon pickle is to wash, dry, slice and toss the fruit with salt in proportion to its weight followed by sun-drying and mixing with additional ingredients before being bottled. Those ingredients, which vary from recipe to recipe, can include sugar, powdered jaggery, chili powder, asafoetida, carom, turmeric, cloves and more.</p>
<p>Aged lemon pickles are often hailed for their healing powers and are strongly believed to have probiotic properties. Fifty-one-year-old Rummy Nagpal says these start to develop after three to four years of maturing, making the pickle an age-old remedy for a bad stomach, coughs, colds, fevers and other ailments.</p>
<p>The ingredients in lemon pickles have their own healing properties. Citrus has vitamin C. Carom (also known as omum) is taken for diarrhoea and acidity. Rock salt eases constipation and bloating. In some regions, cloves or asafoetida are added, both remedies for vomiting and other stomach upsets.</p>
<p>Probiotic pickles are a common myth, Krish said. “Probiotic means the presence of microbes. For a pickle to survive decades, it has to have zero microbes. When you pickle in salt or acids, all bacteria is killed,” he explained, adding that such pickles can be called postbiotic.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2368721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2368721"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rummy-15-1695312641.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C492" alt="Pickle" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2368721">Rummy Nagpal’s 15-year-old pickle [Courtesy of Rummy Nagpal]</figcaption></figure>
<p>“In the early days of the pickling process, the fruit releases water. Some bacteria would have colonised, broken down naturally and produced some beneficial probiotic compounds. Once the water is gone and added salt has killed all the bacteria, some of the useful things produced remain, though with time, this postbiotic value would decrease,” he said.</p>
<h2 id="heirloom-recipe">Heirloom recipe</h2>
<p>“I was inspired to make lemon pickle and preserve it as an heirloom, thanks to a classmate who would bring a 50-year-old pickle in her lunch box when I was in school in the late 1970s,” said Renu Jain, who I connected with on social media after her intriguing post.</p>
<p>“[Her] grandmother even had a 100-year-old pickle she kept under lock and key in a special pickle room,” she continued.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old teacher and entrepreneur used a recipe from her paternal aunt to make 20kg (44lb) of her 30-year-old pickle, and now has only about 5kg (11lb) in glass bottles in the kitchen attic.</p>
<p>Jayalakshmi Gopalakrishnan, 80, has a narthangai (Tamil for citron) pickle in her refrigerator that she got from her mother when she left her hometown of Chennai to move to Mumbai in 1970 as a young bride. To this day, she said, she can still see the family lemon tree behind their house.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2368714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2368714"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_20230329_103254_781-1695312627.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C562" alt="Jayalakshmi Gopalakrishnan 70 year citron pickle" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2368714">Jayalakshmi Gopalakrishnan’s 70-year-old citron pickle [Courtesy of Jayalakshmi Gopalakrishnan]</figcaption></figure>
<p>“It was most likely around 20 years old by the time I was given it, making the 150 grammes [5.3oz] that remain today over 70 years old,” Jayalakshmi said.</p>
<p>The pickle is completely black, as aged lemon pickles tend to become, and was made by simply sun-drying salted sliced lemons.</p>
<h2 id="creating-your-own-heirloom">Creating your own heirloom</h2>
<p>In Rummy’s home in Mumbai, another lemon pickle is ageing away, waiting for a chance to be served at her daughter’s future wedding celebration.</p>
<p>Rummy has been making and selling heritage and new-age pickles under her brand name Herbs n Spices for 20 years, but this pickle, she said, has a story behind it.</p>
<p>Before their daughter was born, her husband shared a childhood memory with her of going to a wedding in Jalandar, Punjab, where the guests were served a traditional kala nimbu achar (black lemon pickle) that had been in the family for years.</p>
<p>It came with the family from what is now Pakistan during the 1947 partition, carried the whole way in a bharani (ceramic pickle pot). The guests loved it.</p>
<p>Wanting something similar, Rummy’s husband asked her to make and store such a pickle. It sits today in a jar on a corner shelf in her kitchen, neatly labelled “27 years”. Inside is a dark, slightly glazed black pickle, the lemon halves looking a bit grainy.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2368710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2368710"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230422_111756-1695312613.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C505" alt="Three jars with pickles of varying ages, 10, 15 and 27 years" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2368710">Rummy’s pickle experiments, marked with how long they have been ageing [Courtesy of Rummy Nagpal]</figcaption></figure>
<p>Rummy also has a 10-year-old lemon pickle, immersed in its own juices, on its way to blackening. She makes black lemon pickle for a wider audience too, ageing it at least four years before she packages it for sale.</p>
<p>“No one makes aged pickles any more. Around 35 years ago, they were common, but now, the lack of time, space and several other factors have led to a decline in their making. Customers who buy my black lemon pickle speak of their childhood memories of it and how its taste transports them back in time,” Rummy said.</p>
<h2 id="black-magic">Black magic</h2>
<p>But why do pickles turn black? Salt and dehydration prevent oxidation and denaturation, among other reactions. “However, some compounds are going to break down with time no matter what. This happens to a category of antioxidants or phenolic molecules that lend colour to food,” explained Krish, referring to anthocyanins that make fruits and vegetables red, blue or purple; carotenoids that give us red, yellow and orange; and chlorophyll, which produces green.</p>
<p>“In any pickling process, these colour molecules will break down over time, and everything will turn a uniform colour of dark brown, then black, because oxidation is impossible to avoid. This is similar to sliced potatoes turning black. … It’s the same process, just over years,” he said.</p>
<p>With each passing year, these aged pickles also gather nostalgia.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2368706" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2368706"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230422_105813-1695312600.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C516" alt="Rummy Nagpal 27 year old lemon pickle" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2368706">Rummy Nagpal’s 27-year-old lemon pickle looks grainy as it ages [Courtesy of Rummy Nagpal]</figcaption></figure>
<p>“My paternal grandmother’s legacy lives on in the khatta-meeta nimbu achar [salty-sweet lemon pickle] she made a month before she passed away in September 2001,” said Vernika Awal, a food writer based in the Delhi National Capital Region who has only 250 grammes (8.8oz) left in a 1kg (2.2lb) bottle that is now 22 years old.</p>
<p>From what Vernika recalls of the process, her Punjabi family uses lemons with a slightly hard peel. They are mixed with ajwain, khand (powdered jaggery), black salt and table salt. Mustard oil, heated to smoking point, is added. The mix is then put out in the sun.</p>
<p>“We eat this sparingly … and through it recall the memory my grandmother, feeling her presence even after two decades. … It’s a physical form of memory, savouring something made so long ago,” she added.</p>
<p>In his summer home in the southern hill station of Kodaikanal, Rakesh Raghunathan, food historian, celebrity chef and television host, has a 33-year-old bottle of narthangai pickle the family fondly calls thatha oorga (Tamil for grandfather pickle).</p>
<p>“My paternal grandmother made this around 1989-1990 in Chennai and the bottle was taken to Kodaikanal. Since we only stayed for a short time there each year, it was used sparingly. My grandfather … loved to have his thayir sadam [curd rice] with a bit of this pickle; that’s how the name came about,” Rakesh said.</p>
<p>In India, pickles are more than just a condiment.</p>
<p>They are unique, flavourful heirlooms, and the art of making them needs to be kept alive.</p>
<p>They are a sign of love when served, a soothing balm for the homesick, a burst of flavour for those unwell and a memory of someone long gone.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>The scientific community may have <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/science-journal-says-lk-99-superconductor-dream-is-over">largely settled</a> on the matter of copper-doped lead apatite (LK-99) not being the room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor we need, but research groups are still finding reasons to look further. A new <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2309/2309.07928.pdf" data-url="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2309/2309.07928.pdf">pre-print paper</a> published by Arxiv reports on a quantum mechanics simulation exploring LK-99's possible superconductivity pathways. Like <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/lk-99-might-need-doping">most theoretical papers</a> on this side of the LK-99 announcement, the conclusion it draws is that it <em>should</em> be possible for LK-99 to be a room-temperature superconductor. Being a pre-print, the results have not yet been peer-reviewed.</p><p>Authored by Jun Li and Qi An with the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Iowa State University, the research paper reports on how current experimental LK-99 synthesis can theoretically lead to two final end-products.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the cooking process for LK-99 still being a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/engineer-details-messy-lk-99-superconductor-fabrication-process">relative mess</a> (a result of the poor original documentation), LK-99 synthesis may result in two different arrangements of properties, mainly relating to how copper and oxygen atoms <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/lk-99-patent-update-suggest-it-could-work">substitute</a> the "base" lead atoms within lead apatite. In certain samples, high-symmetry arrangements of fundamental particles can leave open the space through which electrons can zip through unimpeded and without resistance (usually by bonding together in what are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair" data-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair">Cooper pairs</a>). However, due to a measure of uncertainty in how and where these symmetrical regions surface, they're usually interspersed within non-superconducting, low-symmetry zones. These low-symmetry zones create blockades to how freely electrons can move. Because they can't move without hitting other fundamental particles, electrons moving in low-symmetry zones tend to lose energy in the form of heat - leading to the usual semiconductivity we're already used to within materials such as silicon.</p><p>This particular behavior present in LK-99 synthesis shows how part of the issue in experimentally creating superconducting samples can be a result of extremely low yields of these superconductive symmetries. Too few of them, and the superconducting behavior doesn't emerge at all. This leads the study authors to posit that "the synthesis of LK-99 samples predominantly in the high-symmetry phase could pave the way to realizing room-temperature superconductors at ambient pressure."</p><p>The study's results - piled on with other theoretical studies that conclude in the same general direction - showcase just how difficult it sometimes is to cross the bridge between theory and practice. Theoretically, it seems LK-99 being a room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor is achievable. But practically, the current synthesis process (and superconductivity itself) could simply be still too poorly understood for us to be able to devise ways of improving yield - increasing the amount of useful, high-symmetry CU-doped lead apatite.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether or not there's a <em>practical</em> way to get to superconductivity within LK-99, it seems certain that a lot of human and computing power is still needed before we can actually achieve it.</p>

  <p>

  </p>

  <p>My last article had <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/09/27/">tips for for arena allocation</a>. This next
article demonstrates a technique for building bespoke hash maps that
compose nicely with arena allocation. In addition, they’re fast, simple,
and automatically scale to any problem that could reasonably be solved
with an in-memory hash map. To avoid resizing — both to better support
arenas and to simplify implementation — they have slightly above average
memory requirements. The design, which we’re calling a <em>hash-trie</em>, is the
result of <a href="https://nrk.neocities.org/articles/hash-trees-and-tries">fruitful collaboration with NRK</a>, whose sibling article
includes benchmarks. It’s my new favorite data structure, and has proven
incredibly useful. With a couple well-placed acquire/release atomics, we
can even turn it into a <em>lock-free concurrent hash map</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve written before about <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2022/08/08/">MSI hash tables</a>, a simple, <em>very</em> fast
map that can be quickly implemented from scratch as needed, tailored to
the problem at hand. The trade off is that one must know the upper bound
<em>a priori</em> in order to size the base array. Scaling up requires resizing
the array — an impedance mismatch with arena allocation. Search trees
scale better, as there’s no underlying array, but tree balancing tends to
be finicky and complex, unsuitable to rapid, on-demand implementation.
<strong>We want the ease of an MSI hash table with the scaling of a tree.</strong></p>

<p>I’ll motivate the discussion with example usage. Suppose we have an array
of pointer+length strings, as defined last time:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>uint8_t</span>  <span>*</span><span>data</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ptrdiff_t</span> <span>len</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>str</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And we need a function that removes duplicates in place, but (for the
moment) we’re not worried about preserving order. This could be done
naively in quadratic time. Smarter is to sort, then look for runs.
Instead, I’ve used a hash map to track seen strings. It maps <code>str</code> to
<code>bool</code>, and it is represented as type <code>strmap</code> and one insert+lookup
function, <code>upsert</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Insert/get bool value for given str key.</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>*</span><span>upsert</span><span>(</span><span>strmap</span> <span>**</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>arena</span> <span>*</span><span>);</span>

<span>ptrdiff_t</span> <span>unique</span><span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>*</span><span>strings</span><span>,</span> <span>ptrdiff_t</span> <span>len</span><span>,</span> <span>arena</span> <span>scratch</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>ptrdiff_t</span> <span>count</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>strmap</span> <span>*</span><span>seen</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>count</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>len</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>bool</span> <span>*</span><span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>upsert</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>seen</span><span>,</span> <span>strings</span><span>[</span><span>count</span><span>],</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>scratch</span><span>);</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>// previously seen (discard)</span>
            <span>strings</span><span>[</span><span>count</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>strings</span><span>[</span><span>--</span><span>len</span><span>];</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>// newly-seen (keep)</span>
            <span>count</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
            <span>*</span><span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>count</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In particular, note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A null pointer is an empty hash map and initialization is trivial. As
discussed in the last article, one of my arena allocation principles is
default zero-initializion. Put together, that means any data structure
containing a map comes with a ready-to-use, empty map.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The map is allocated out of the scratch arena so it’s automatically
freed upon any return. It’s as care-free as garbage collection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The map directly uses strings in the input array as keys, without making
copies nor worrying about ownership. Arenas own objects, not references.
If I wanted to carve out some fixed keys ahead of time, I could even
insert static strings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>upsert</code> returns a pointer to a value. That is, a pointer into the map.
This is not strictly required, but usually makes for a simple interface.
When an entry is new, this value will be false (zero-initialized).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, what is this wonderful data structure? Here’s the basic shape:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>hashmap</span> <span>*</span><span>child</span><span>[</span><span>4</span><span>];</span>
    <span>keytype</span>  <span>key</span><span>;</span>
    <span>valtype</span>  <span>value</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>hashmap</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>They <code>child</code> and <code>key</code> fields are essential to the map. Adding a <code>child</code>
to any data structure turns it into a hash map over whatever field you
choose as the key. In other words, a hash-trie can serve as an <em>intrusive
hash map</em>. In several programs I’ve combined intrusive lists and hash maps
to create an insert-ordered hash map. Going the other direction, omitting
<code>value</code> turns it into a hash set. (Which is what <code>unique</code> <em>really</em> needs!)</p>

<p>As you probably guessed, this hash-trie is a 4-ary tree. It can easily be
2-ary (leaner but slower) or 8-ary (bigger and usually no faster), but
4-ary strikes a good balance, if a bit bulky. In the example above,
<code>keytype</code> would be <code>str</code> and <code>valtype</code> would be <code>bool</code>. The most general
form of <code>upsert</code> looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>valtype</span> <span>*</span><span>upsert</span><span>(</span><span>hashmap</span> <span>**</span><span>m</span><span>,</span> <span>keytype</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>arena</span> <span>*</span><span>perm</span><span>)</span>

<p>This will take some unpacking. The first argument is a pointer to a
pointer. That’s the destination for any newly-allocated element. As it
travels down the tree, this points into the parent’s <code>child</code> array. If
it points to null, then it’s an empty tree which, by definition, does not
contain the key.</p>

<p>We need two “methods” for keys: <code>hash</code> and <code>equals</code>. The hash function
should return a uniformly distributed integer. As is usually the case,
less uniform fast hashes generally do better than highly-uniform slow
hashes. For hash maps under ~100K elements a 32-bit hash is fine, but
larger maps should use a 64-bit hash state and result. Hash collisions
revert to linear, linked list performance and, per the birthday paradox,
that will happen often with 32-bit hashes on large hash maps.</p>

<p>If you’re worried about pathological inputs, add a seed parameter to
<code>upsert</code> and <code>hash</code>. Or maybe even use the address <code>m</code> as a seed. The
specifics depend on your security model. It’s not an issue for most hash
maps, so I don’t demonstrate it here.</p>

<p>The top two bits of the hash are used to select a branch. These tend to be
higher quality for <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/07/31/">multiplicative hash functions</a>. At each level
two bits are shifted out. This is what gives it its name: a <em>trie</em> of the
<em>hash bits</em>. Though it’s un-trie-like in the way it deposits elements at
the first empty spot. To make it 2-ary or 8-ary, use 1 or 3 bits at a
time.</p>

<p>I initially tried a <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/11/19/">Multiplicative Congruential Generator</a> (MCG) to
select the next branch at each trie level, instead of bit shifting, but
NRK noticed it was consistently slower than shifting.</p>

<p>While “delete” could be handled using gravestones, many deletes would not
work well. After all, the underlying allocator is an arena. A combination
of uniformly distributed branching and no deletion means that rebalancing
is unnecessary. This is what grants it its simplicity!</p>

<p>If no arena is provided, it reverts to a lookup and returns null when the
key is not found. It allows one function to flexibly serve both modes. In
<code>unique</code>, pure lookups are unneeded, so this condition could be skipped in
its <code>strmap</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s useful to return the entire <code>hashmap</code> object itself rather
than an internal pointer, particularly when it’s intrusive. Use whichever
works best for the situation. Regardless, exploit zero-initialization to
detect newly-allocated elements when possible.</p>

<p>In some cases we may deep copy the key in its arena before inserting it
into the map. The provided key may be a temporary (e.g. <code>sprintf</code>) which
the map outlives, and the caller doesn’t want to allocate a longer-lived
key unless it’s needed. It’s all part of tailoring the map to the problem,
which we can do because it’s so short and simple!</p>

<p>The FNV hash multiplier is 19 ones, my favorite prime. I don’t bother with
an xorshift finalizer because the bits are used most-significant first.
Exercise for the reader: Support retaining the original input order using
an intrusive linked list on <code>strset</code>.</p>

<h3 id="relative-pointers">Relative pointers?</h3>

<p>As mentioned, four pointers per entry — 32 bytes on 64-bit hosts — makes
these hash-tries a bit heavier than average. It’s not an issue for smaller
hash maps, but has practical consequences for huge hash maps.</p>

<p>In attempt to address this, I experimented with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0tsNFZLxSU">relative pointers</a>
(example: <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/scratch/blob/master/misc/markov.c"><code>markov.c</code></a>). That is, instead of pointers I use signed
integers whose value indicates an offset <em>relative to itself</em>. Because
relative pointers can only refer to nearby memory, a custom allocator is
imperative, and arenas fit the bill perfectly. Range can be extended by
exploiting memory alignment. In particular, 32-bit relative pointers can
reference up to 8GiB in either direction. Zero is reserved to represent a
null pointer, and relative pointers cannot refer to themselves.</p>

<p>As a bonus, data structures built out of relative pointers are <em>position
independent</em>. A collection of them — perhaps even a whole arena — can be
dumped out to, say, a file, loaded back at a different position, then
continue to operate as-is. Very cool stuff.</p>

<p>Using 32-bit relative pointers on 64-bit hosts cuts the hash-trie overhead
in half, to 16 bytes. With an arena no larger than 8GiB, such pointers are
guaranteed to work. No object is ever too far away. It’s a compounding
effect, too. Smaller map nodes means a larger number of them are in reach
of a relative pointer. Also very cool.</p>

<p>However, as far as I know, no generally available programming language
implementation supports this concept well enough to put into practice. You
could implement relative pointers with language extension facilities, such
as C++ operator overloads, but <em>no tools will understand them</em> — a major
bummer. You can no longer use a debugger to examine such structures, and
it’s just not worth that cost. If only arena allocation was more popular…</p>

<h3 id="as-a-concurrent-hash-map">As a concurrent hash map</h3>

<p>For the finale, let’s convert <code>upsert</code> into a concurrent, lock-free hash
map. That is, multiple threads can call upsert concurrently on the same
map. Each must still have its own arena, probably per-thread arenas, and
so no implicit locking for allocation.</p>

<p>The structure itself requires no changes! Instead we need two atomic
operations: atomic load (acquire), and atomic compare-and-exchange
(acquire/release). They operate only on <code>child</code> array elements and the
tree root. To illustrate I will use <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fatomic-Builtins.html">GCC atomics</a>, also supported by
Clang.</p>

<p>First an atomic load retrieves the current node. If there is no such node,
then attempt to insert one using atomic compare-and-exchange. The <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/09/02/">ABA
problem</a> is not an issue thanks again to lack of deletion: Once set,
a pointer never changes. Before allocating a node, take a snapshot of the
arena so that the allocation can be reverted on failure. If another thread
got there first, continue tumbling down the tree <em>as though a null was
never observed</em>.</p>

<p>On compare-and-swap failure, it turns into an acquire load, just as it
began. On success, it’s a release store, synchronizing with acquire loads
on other threads.</p>

<p>The <code>key</code> field does not require atomics because it’s synchronized by the
compare-and-swap. That is, the assignment will happen before the node is
inserted, and keys do not change after insertion. The same goes for any
zeroing done by the arena.</p>

<p><strong>Loads and stores through the returned pointer are the caller’s
responsibility.</strong> These likely require further synchronization. If
<code>valtype</code> is a shared counter then an atomic increment is sufficient. In
other cases, <code>upsert</code> should probably be modified to accept an initial
value to be assigned alongside the key so that the entire key/value pair
inserted atomically. Alternatively, <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2022/05/14/">break it into two steps</a>. The
details depend on the needs of the program.</p>

<p>On small trees there will much contention near the root of the tree during
inserts. Fortunately, a contentious tree will not stay small for long! The
hash function will spread threads around a large tree, generally keeping
them off each other’s toes.</p>

<p>A complete demo you can try yourself: <strong><a href="https://github.com/skeeto/scratch/blob/master/misc/concurrent-hash-trie.c"><code>concurrent-hash-trie.c</code></a></strong>.
It returns a value pointer like above, and store/load is synchronized by
the thread join. Each thread is given a per-thread subarena allocated out
of the main arena, and the final tree is built from these subarenas.</p>

<p>A complete fast, concurrent, lock-free hash map in under 30 lines of C
sounds like a sweet deal to me!</p>

	<div>
		<p><a href="https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2017/05/22/">22 May 2017</a>  • Last updated 8 September 2023</p><p>I want to make a few points up front to short-circuit common misunderstandings with this article:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a zero warning policy on my projects.</li>
<li>I turn on <em>a lot</em> of warnings. <code>-Wall</code>, <code>-Wextra</code>, and <a href="https://github.com/embeddedartistry/meson-buildsystem/blob/ec64fe6061e052c29d2cb7903f973e25d699cb0c/compiler/meson.build#L9">a whole host of specific warning flags</a>.</li>
<li>I supplement the compiler warnings with analysis from a suite of static analysis tools, including <code>cppcheck</code>, <code>clang-tidy</code>, and clang <code>scan-build</code>.</li>
<li>Zero-warning enforcement happens on the build server. Pull requests will be rejected and builds will be marked as failures if warnings are present.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to state all of this because many people think that my dislike of <code>-Werror</code> means that I am lax on warnings. That’s simply not the case.</p>
<h2 id="So,-then,-what's-wrong-with--Werror?">So, then, what’s wrong with -Werror?</h2>
<p><code>-Werror</code>&nbsp;is a compiler flag that causes all compiler warnings to be treated as errors. Developers who enable&nbsp;<code>-Werror</code>&nbsp;are making a statement: we care about our code base, and we won’t accept warnings here. I understand the motivation for enabling the&nbsp;<code>-Werror</code>&nbsp;flag: I also have a zero-warning policy, and I hate when developers ignore warnings.</p>
<p>My opinion on <code>-Werror</code> is based on my experiences as an open-source maintainer, a consumer of other people’s code, and a consultant who is constantly jumping into new proprietary code bases. I almost always find myself frustrated by the presence&nbsp;of <code>-Werror</code>. Most commonly, I check out the project, attempt to build it, and see that it fails to compile because there is a warning. Why is my build failing if I made no changes and your code base allows zero warnings?</p>

<p>The reason: <code>-Werror</code>&nbsp;creates a project dependency on specific toolchain vendors and versions.</p>
<p>Different vendors have different warning sets and warning detection logic. Code that compiles with one toolchain warning-free may not do so with another toolchain. We often see this with our open-source projects. We primarily use Clang, and it is a common occurrence that our <a aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="<div class=glossaryItemTitle>Continuous Integration [CI]</div><div class=glossaryItemBody>Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where members of a team integrate work frequently. Each integration is automatically verified by an automated build and test process, which detects integration errors as(...)</div>" href="https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldmanual-terms/continuous-integration/" data-mobile-support="0" data-gt-translate-attributes="[{&quot;attribute&quot;:&quot;data-cmtooltip&quot;, &quot;format&quot;:&quot;html&quot;}]">CI</a> server will report a warning when compiling our “warning-free” code with GCC.</p>
<p>Whenever a new compiler version is released, new warnings are added, detection for existing warnings is improved, and experimental warnings may be promoted. Less commonly, new versions include other changes that can impact warning generation. One example that comes to mind is when GCC 5.1.0 changed the default <a aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="<div class=glossaryItemTitle>C</div><div class=glossaryItemBody>A general-purpose imperative programming language widely used for embedded systems development.</div>" href="https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldmanual-terms/c/" data-mobile-support="0" data-gt-translate-attributes="[{&quot;attribute&quot;:&quot;data-cmtooltip&quot;, &quot;format&quot;:&quot;html&quot;}]">C</a> language standard from <code>gnu90</code> to <code>gnu11</code>.  Some warnings are only enabled when targeting C99 or later, so anyone relying on the default (which we don’t recommend) would have seen new warnings after updating.</p>
<p>Sometimes warnings are not even consistently generated with the same toolchain vendor and version. One example that comes to mind is <code>-Wunknown-pragmas</code>. I am in the habit of using&nbsp;<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Darwin-Pragmas.html#Darwin-Pragmas"><code>#pragma mark</code></a> to provide nicer IDE interactions (e.g., sectioning code and adding “jump-to” points). Clang accepts this pragma without any problem. GCC will generate a warning when this is used. But the real problem is that <code>gcc</code> will recognize&nbsp;<code>#pragma mark</code> on MacOS, so you won’t see the warning until you build on another <a aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="<div class=glossaryItemTitle>Operating System [OS]</div><div class=glossaryItemBody>System software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.</div>" href="https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldmanual-terms/operating-system/" data-mobile-support="0" data-gt-translate-attributes="[{&quot;attribute&quot;:&quot;data-cmtooltip&quot;, &quot;format&quot;:&quot;html&quot;}]">OS</a>.</p>
<p>In other cases, hard-coded warning flags themselves are the source of trouble. Someone using an older/different compiler may find that a particular warning flag is not supported. In many cases, this generates a warning (e.g., <code>-Wunknown-warning</code>).  With <code>-Werror</code>, this build will fail for the user.</p>

Many <a aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="<div class=glossaryItemTitle>Build System</div><div class=glossaryItemBody>A build system is a tool that provides a consistent and reusable framework for defining and automating software construction, quality enforcement, and delivery processes.</div>" href="https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldmanual-terms/build-system/" data-mobile-support="0" data-gt-translate-attributes="[{&quot;attribute&quot;:&quot;data-cmtooltip&quot;, &quot;format&quot;:&quot;html&quot;}]">build systems</a> provide capabilities for checking whether given compiler flags are supported. We recommend using these approaches over hard-coding flags.
</p>
</div>
<p>This toolchain dependency must be handled in one of a few ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Documenting the supported toolchain(s)</li>
<li>Capturing the build environment</li>
<li>Ongoing maintenance to ensure that warnings are addressed for new compiler versions</li>
</ol>
<p>Yet, the most common experience we have is that the dependency is not documented and a captured build environment is not provided. With open-source projects, this can lead to a build failure. Within companies, a more common scenario is that a new hire follows the setup guide but can’t get the project to compile. Only after talking to the team do they learn that a specific compiler version has to be used to build the project.</p>
<h2 id="Enforce-Zero-Warnings-at-the-DevOps-Level">Enforce Zero Warnings at the DevOps Level</h2>
<p>I have zero-warning policy (and I try to get my clients to adopt one as well). This policy is enforced by our CI server. To ensure we have a decent level of coverage, we build our software with a minimum of Clang, GCC, and at least one cross-compiler.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the DevOps enforcement approach is that you can expand warning coverage beyond just compiler warnings. For example, we also include warnings from static analysis tools in our zero-warning policy. We can also use our CI tools to generate warnings when FIXME and TODO comments are found in code.</p>
<p>Regardless of the source, if warnings are detected, the server will block pull requests and fail builds. This all happens without requiring <code>-Werror</code>.</p>
<p>This is a pragmatic solution: we have a zero-warning policy, have it enforced automatically, but still enable someone to successfully compile our projects if they are using a newer/different toolchain that reveals new warnings.</p>
<p>Certainly, <code>-Werror</code> can be used as part of the DevOps enforcement method. The only downside to using <code>-Werror</code> as the enforcement mechanism is that you will not be able to get a complete picture of the warnings present in a given build. Allowing compilation to succeed enables you to generate a complete report for the developer.</p>
<h2 id="Refined-Warning-As-Error-Control">Refined Warning-As-Error Control</h2>
<p>Even without the blanket use of&nbsp;<code>-Werror</code>, there are still a number of warnings that should&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;trigger an error. You can do this by specifying&nbsp;<code>Werror=warning-name</code>, which will cause that specific warning&nbsp;to generate an error.</p>
<p>For example, a warning that I promote to an error is&nbsp;<code>-Wreturn-type</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Missing return statement in function with return expected
aws.c:158:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]
</code></pre>
<p>If your function <em>should</em> return a value but does not actually do so, your function is going to be returning unexpected data, leading to weird behavior. This type of warning is definitely worth promoting to an error in any case!</p>
<h2 id="Make--Werror-Optional">Make -Werror Optional</h2>
<p>When <code>-Werror</code> is used, I like to see it done as a configurable build option. This option can be used by the build server to enforce zero warnings. It can also be disabled if necessary, such as when a user can’t get a project to compile out-of-the-box due to a warning, or when you want to see the full set of warnings while migrating to a new toolchain version.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ make all WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=n
</code></pre>
<p>Some build systems, Meson, provide built-in options for this purpose. These should be preferred manually adding the <code>-Werror</code> flag in your build rules.</p>
<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>
<p>My objective was to communicate the more subtle implications of using <code>-Werror</code>. This flag adds a toolchain dependency to your project. Newer compiler versions (or alternative compiler vendors) are likely to generate new warnings, making the build fail.</p>
<p>If you’re going to use this flag, make sure you clearly note the version(s) your project is expected to work with (or completely capture your build environment). Ideally, the use of <code>-Werror</code> will be a configurable option in your <a aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="<div class=glossaryItemTitle>Build System</div><div class=glossaryItemBody>A build system is a tool that provides a consistent and reusable framework for defining and automating software construction, quality enforcement, and delivery processes.</div>" href="https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldmanual-terms/build-system/" data-mobile-support="0" data-gt-translate-attributes="[{&quot;attribute&quot;:&quot;data-cmtooltip&quot;, &quot;format&quot;:&quot;html&quot;}]">build system</a>, regardless of whether or not is enabled by default.</p>
<p>You can achieve zero-warning policies through other means, and I prefer to do so with our DevOps pipeline.</p>
<p>Of course, everything has its tradeoffs. You might decide that <code>-Werror</code> really is the right tool for your team. Keep on, but take a moment to document or capture the build dependencies if you haven’t done so already.</p>

</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/6337">Allow not setting -Werror conveniently · Issue #6337 · google/flatbuffers</a>
<blockquote><p>
there can be many situations why we want to compile old software with newer compilers and&nbsp;<code>-Werror</code>&nbsp;can break that easily although it seems an easily avoidable…
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
The point is that old software should continue to compile with newer compilers&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;manual intervention, at least where this is possible to achieve basically for free.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-2992356968395588542" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
At a winter day in 1989 the Japanese sent chills down the spine of the world of tech. They presented a house, located in one of Tokyo’s most fashionable neighbourhood, which was able to think, sense and act on its own. It linked millions of microprocessors in consumer appliances, business machines and telecommunication networks into a giant cooperative web. </p><p>The house would know when to open the windows, air-condition the room and water the plants. It would flush the toilet, flip the faucet and air-dry your hands. When the phone rang, it muted the stereo. If the homeowner wanted to cook a fancy meal, it would present a recipe and instruction on a kitchen monitor while setting the correct oven temperature. All without manual human interaction.<span><a name="more"></a></span><span></span><br>The Japanese did it again. With this first “smart house”, the Japanese called it the Tron House, they put the Rest of the World in their place when it comes to creativity and innovation in the field of tech. </p><p>Although, some less visionary tech consultants, like Gib Hoxie, weren’t impressed at all, commenting that: “The TRON house looks to me like an electronic whiz kid’s dream. (…) consumers are already disgruntled with digital videocassette recorders and microwave ovens. They find dials easier to use and are moving toward them again. (…) TRON isn’t addressing that at all. They say, ‘Let’s pull all of this together in a universal digital interface.’ That’s a nightmare to me. It means I can’t run anything in my house (…). Tron will be of no lasting significance” </p><p>More visionary tech gurus, like Bill Gates, certainly did not subscribe to Hoxies’ analysis. They had been following the “Tron Project” vigilantly for some time. And what they saw was not to their liking. </p><p>Tron stands for “The Real-time Operating system Nucleus”. It was developed in the early 1980s by Ken Sakamura, a visionary associate professor of information science at the Tokyo University. Basically, Tron was a Japanese computing standard (operating system) for almost anything. From personal computers, to robots and mainframes. </p><p>In the sphere of personal computers, the Tron Project already stunned experts in the mid-1980s, when the Japanese electronics giant <a href="http://panasonic.net/">Matsushita</a> introduced a BTRON PC. A personal computer with unprecedented capabilities. Although running on an Intel 80286 chip with a meagre 8 MHz and 2 MB of memory, it was able to display a moving video in colour on a separate window. </p><p>More importantly, and nerve wrecking for Bill Gates, BTRON was intended to be offered as an open architecture. All the hardware and software would have been publicly available at the cost of an annual membership fee to the TRON Association. Ranging from about $23,000 a year down to a modest $4,600. Microsoft feared that a TRON PC would end the dominant position of NEC Corp. within Japan, which was offering a highly popular computer that used Microsoft’s MS-Dos system. </p><p>The time Japan was pushing the “Tron Project” were marked by severe economic tension with the U.S. Overwhelmed by stunning innovations, superior quality, and low prices of a great many of imported Japanese products, U.S. companies were losing market share at home and globally at a frightening pace. U.S. foreign trade was essentially bankrupt. And the American workers were furious at Japan Inc., smashing publicly Japanese cars and stereo equipment. </p><p>To the Japanese, the BTRON PC and the Tron house offered an intriguing glimpse what the future might hold. To the Americans, under the climate of trade friction, it was considered an economic threat. </p><p>The straw that broke the camel’s back was the Japanese Education Ministry planning to introduce Tron computers to all of the country’s schools. Now Apple, who had the largest share of the school computer market in the U.S. was fuming. It feared being shut out of the highly profitable market for educational computer systems in Japan. It was high time for lobbying in Washington. </p><p>In 1989 the U.S. software industry group, ADAPSO, concluded in a report on Japanese software that TRON had “strong undertones of nationalism and will have the practical effect of impeding foreign penetration of the Japanese market.” </p><p>The U.S. government objected against the Japanese school project. It called the initiative “actual and potential market intervention”. U.S. trade officials feared that the Japanese mandate for Tron in the education system subsequently would lead to a de facto Tron standard in the business and other markets and threatened the move with sanctions. </p><p>Japan Inc. eagerly took to the message of the U.S administration, as Japanese broadcasters were incessantly airing furious American blue color workers sledgehammering Japanese TV sets and cars. It made the Japanese government and corporate leaders shake in their boots, fearing restricted access to their most important export market. </p><p>Finally, Japan offered U.S. officials the olive branch of Tron in order to calm things down. The government quickly abandoned the school plan, and nearly all Japanese companies involved in BTRON-related activities canceled their projects. The Tron project was history. </p><p>Today’s standard of computing systems in the world is Microsoft’s Windows, which has been enjoying a monopoly for over two decades by now. Although, Japan was literally 10 years ahead of Microsoft, developing a competitive OS already in the 1980s, BTRON never had a fighting chance. Not only was Tron barred from being promoted in the United States, but also dropped like a hot potato by Japan Inc. (with a little encouragement by Bill Gates). </p><p>It is hard to imagine Microsoft not having stifled TRON as an OS for general users anyway. Still it is a shame that the Japanese government had no strategy and corporate Japan was such a coward. If they had envisioned the future rise of information technology correctly, they would have known about the superiority and importance of their software. </p><p>They would have guarded the TRON project with all their might. With abandoning the Tron project Japan missed out on being a global authority in IT.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>ESET researchers have uncovered a Lazarus attack against an aerospace company in Spain, where the group deployed several tools, most notably a publicly undocumented backdoor we named LightlessCan. Lazarus operators obtained initial access to the company’s network last year after a successful spearphishing campaign, masquerading as a recruiter for Meta – the company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The fake recruiter contacted the victim via LinkedIn Messaging, a feature within the LinkedIn professional social networking platform, and sent two coding challenges required as part of a hiring process, which the victim downloaded and executed on a company device. The first challenge is a very basic project that displays the text “Hello, World!”, the second one prints a Fibonacci sequence – a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. ESET Research was able to reconstruct the initial access steps and analyze the toolset used by Lazarus thanks to cooperation with the affected aerospace company.</p>
<p>In this blogpost, we describe the method of infiltration and the tools deployed during this Lazarus attack. We will also present some of our findings about this attack at the <a href="https://www.virusbulletin.com/conference/vb2023/abstracts/lazarus-campaigns-and-backdoors-2022-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virus Bulletin conference</a> on October 4, 2023.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points of the blogpost:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Employees of the targeted company were contacted by a fake recruiter via LinkedIn and tricked into opening a malicious executable presenting itself as a coding challenge or quiz.</em></li>
<li><em>We identified four different execution chains, delivering three types of payloads via DLL side-loading .</em></li>
<li><em>The most notable payload is the LightlessCan backdoor, implementing techniques to hinder detection by real-time security monitoring software and analysis by cybersecurity professionals; this presents a major shift in comparison with its predecessor BlindingCan, a flagship HTTP(S) Lazarus RAT.</em></li>
<li><em>We attribute this activity with a high level of confidence to Lazarus, particularly to its campaigns related to Operation DreamJob.</em></li>
<li><em>The final goal of the attack was cyberespionage.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Lazarus delivered various payloads to the victims’ systems; the most notable is a publicly undocumented and sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) that we named LightlessCan, which represents a significant advancement compared to its predecessor, BlindingCan. LightlessCan mimics the functionalities of a wide range of native Windows commands, enabling discreet execution within the RAT itself instead of noisy console executions. This strategic shift enhances stealthiness, making detecting and analyzing the attacker’s activities more challenging.</p>
<p>Another mechanism used to minimize exposure is the employment of execution guardrails; Lazarus made sure the payload can only be decrypted on the intended victim’s machine. Execution guardrails are a set of protective protocols and mechanisms implemented to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of the payload during its deployment and execution, effectively preventing unauthorized decryption on unintended machines, such as those of security researchers. We describe the implementation of this mechanism in the <em><a href="#Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version)">Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version)</a> </em>section.</p>
<h2>Attribution to the Lazarus group</h2>
<p>The Lazarus group (also known as HIDDEN COBRA) is a cyberespionage group <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked to North Korea</a> that has been active since at least 2009. It is responsible for high-profile incidents such as both the <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/12/08/sony-pictures-hacking-traced-thai-hotel-north-korea-denies-involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony Pictures Entertainment hack</a> and tens-of-millions-of-dollar <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/03/15/bangladesh-central-bank-boss-quits-100m-cyberheist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberheists in 2016</a>, the <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/15/wannacryptor-key-questions-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WannaCryptor</a> (aka WannaCry) outbreak in 2017, the 3CX and X_TRADER <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/04/20/linux-malware-strengthens-links-lazarus-3cx-supply-chain-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supply-chain attacks</a>, and a long history of <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/16/lazarus-supply-chain-attack-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disruptive attacks against South Korean</a> public and critical infrastructure since at least 2011. The diversity, number, and eccentricity in implementation of Lazarus campaigns define this group, as well as that it performs all three pillars of cybercriminal activities: cyberespionage, cybersabotage, and pursuit of financial gain.</p>
<p>Aerospace companies are not an unusual target for North Korea-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. The country has conducted <a href="https://www.dia.mil/Portals/110/Documents/News/North_Korea_Military_Power.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple nuclear tests</a> and launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, which violate United Nations (UN) Security Council <a href="https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-documents/dprk-north-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolutions</a>. The UN monitors North Korea’s nuclear activities to prevent further development and proliferation of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction, and publishes <a href="https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1718/panel_experts/reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biannual reports</a> tracking such activities. According to these reports, North Korea-aligned APT groups attack aerospace companies in attempts to access sensitive technology and aerospace know-how, as intercontinental ballistic missiles spend their midcourse phase in the space outside of Earth’s atmosphere. These reports also claim that money gained from cyberattacks accounts for a portion of North Korea’s missile development costs.</p>
<p>We attribute the attack in Spain to the Lazarus group, specifically to Operation DreamJob, with a high level of confidence. The name for Operation DreamJob was coined in a <a href="https://www.clearskysec.com/operation-dream-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogpost</a> by ClearSky from August 2020, describing a Lazarus campaign targeting defense and aerospace companies, with the objective of cyberespionage. Since then, we have loosely used the term to denote various Lazarus operations leveraging job-offering lures but not deploying tools clearly similar to those involved in its other activities, such as <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/06/17/operation-interception-aerospace-military-companies-cyberspies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation In(ter)ception</a>. For example, the campaign involving tools signed with 2 TOY GUYS certificates (see <a href="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/en/papers/threat-reports/eset_threat_report_t12021.pdf#page=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESET Threat Report T1 2021, page 11</a>), and the case of <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/09/30/amazon-themed-campaigns-lazarus-netherlands-belgium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon-themed lures</a> in the Netherlands and Belgium published in September 2022.</p>
<p>Our attribution is based on the following factors, which show a relationship mostly with the previously mentioned Amazon-themed campaign:</p>
<p>1. Malware (the intrusion set):</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial access was obtained by making contact via LinkedIn and then convincing the target to execute malware, disguised as a test, in order to succeed in a hiring process. This is a known Lazarus tactic, used at least since Operation DreamJob.</li>
<li>We observed new variants of payloads that were previously identified in the Dutch case from last year, such as intermediate loaders and the BlindingCan backdoor <a href="https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.blindingcan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked with Lazarus</a>.</li>
<li>Multiple types of strong encryption were leveraged in the tools of this Lazarus campaign – AES-128 and RC6 with a 256-bit key – that were also used in the Amazon-themed campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first-level C&amp;C servers (listed in the Network section at the end of this blogpost), the attackers do not set up their own servers, but compromise existing ones, usually those having poor security and that host sites with neglected maintenance. This is a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/29/zinc-weaponizing-open-source-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typical</a>, yet weak-confidence behavior, of Lazarus.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cui_bono" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cui bono</a>:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Pilfering the know-how of an aerospace company is aligned with long-term goals manifested by Lazarus.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Initial access</h2>
<p>The group targeted multiple company employees via LinkedIn Messaging. Masquerading as a <a href="https://www.meta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a> recruiter, the attacker used a job offer lure to attract the target’s attention and trust; a screenshot of this conversation, which we obtained during our cooperation with the Spanish aerospace company, is depicted in Figure 1.</p>
<figure><img title="" src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2023/2023-09/lazarus-in-spain/figure-01-copy-2.png" alt="Figure_01 - Copy (2)" width="" height="">
<figcaption><em>Figure 1. The initial contact by the attacker impersonating a recruiter from Meta</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the beginning of Lazarus attacks, the unaware targets are usually convinced to recklessly self-compromise their systems. For this purpose, the attackers employ different strategies; for example, the target is lured to execute an attacker-provided (and trojanized) PDF viewer to see the full content of a job offer. Alternately, the target is encouraged to connect with a trojanized SSL/VPN client, being provided with an IP address and login details. Both scenarios are described in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/29/zinc-weaponizing-open-source-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft blogpost</a> published in September 2022. The narrative in this case was the scammer’s request to prove the victim’s proficiency in the C++ programming language.</p>
<p>Two malicious executables, <span>Quiz1.exe</span> and <span>Quiz2.exe</span>, were provided for that purpose and delivered via the <span>Quiz1.iso</span> and <span>Quiz2.iso</span> images hosted on a third-party cloud storage platform. Both executables are very simple command line applications asking for input.</p>
<p>The first one is a Hello World project, which is a very basic program, often consisting of just a single line of code, that displays the text “Hello, World!” when executed. The second prints a Fibonacci sequence up to the largest element smaller than the number entered as input. A Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1; however, in this malicious challenge, the sequence starts with 1 and 2. Figure 2 displays example output from the Fibonacci sequence challenge. After the output is printed, both executables trigger the malicious action of installing additional payloads from the ISO images onto the target’s system. The task for a targeted developer is to understand the logic of the program and rewrite it in the C++ programming language.</p>
<figure><img title="Figure 2. The output of the decoy program Quiz2.exe" src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2023/2023-09/lazarus-in-spain/figure-03.png" alt="Figure_03" width="" height="">
<figcaption><em>Figure 2. The output of the decoy program Quiz2.exe</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chain of events that led to the initial compromise is sketched in Figure 3. The first payload delivered to the target’s system is an HTTP(S) downloader that we have named NickelLoader. The tool allows the attackers to deploy any desired program into the memory of the victim’s computer.</p>
<figure><img title="Figure 3. The chain of events completing the initial access" src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2023/2023-09/lazarus-in-spain/figure-03-1.png" alt="Figure_03" width="" height="">
<figcaption><em>Figure 3. The chain of events completing the initial access</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Post-compromise toolset</h2>
<p>Once NickelLoader is running on the target’s system, the attackers use it to deliver two types of RATs. One of these RATs is already known to be part of the Lazarus toolkit, specifically a variant of the BlindingCan backdoor with limited functionality but identical command processing logic. To distinguish it, we put the prefix mini- in front of the variant’s name. Additionally, the attackers introduced a RAT not previously undocumented publicly, which we have named LightlessCan.</p>
<p>The RATs are deployed as the final step of chains of stages with varying levels of complexity and are preceded by helper executables, like droppers and loaders. We denote an executable as a dropper if it contains an embedded payload, even if it’s not dropped onto the file system but instead loaded directly into memory and executed. Malware that doesn’t have an encrypted embedded data array, but that loads a payload from the file system, we denote as a loader.</p>
<p>Besides the initial quiz-related lures, Table 1 summarizes the executable files (EXEs) and dynamic link libraries (DLLs) delivered to the victim’s system. All the malware samples in the third column are trojanized open-source applications (see the fourth column for the underlying project), with a legitimate executable side-loading a malicious DLL. For example, the malicious <span>mscoree.dll</span> is a trojanized version of the legitimate NppyPluginDll; the DLL contains an embedded NickelLoader and is loaded by a legitimate <span>PresentationHost.exe</span>, both located in the <span>C:\ProgramShared</span> directory.</p>

<h2>LightlessCan – new backdoor</h2>
<p>The most interesting payload used in this campaign is LightlessCan, a successor of the group’s flagship HTTP(S) Lazarus RAT named BlindingCan. LightlessCan is a new complex RAT that has support for up to 68 distinct commands, indexed in a custom function table, but in the current version, 1.0, only 43 of those commands are implemented with some functionality. The remaining commands are present but have a formal implementation in the form of placeholders, lacking actual functionality. The project behind the RAT is definitely based on the BlindingCan source code, as the order of the shared commands is preserved significantly, even though there may be differences in their indexing.</p>
<p>The most significant update is mimicked functionality of many native <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows commands</a> like <span>ping</span>, <span>ipconfig</span>, <span>systeminfo</span>, <span>sc</span>, <span>net</span>, etc. The hardcoded string “The operation completed successfully.”, the standard system message for the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes--0-499-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERROR_SUCCESS</a> result, brought us to that idea. Table 2 contains a list of those commands that are implemented in LightlessCan. In previously reported Lazarus attacks, as documented in blogposts by <a href="https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/lazarus-recruitment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Positive Technologies</a> in April 2021 and <a href="https://www.hvs-consulting.de/media/downloads/ThreatReport-Lazarus.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HvS Consulting</a> in December 2020, these native commands are often executed <a href="https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2016/01/windows-commands-abused-by-attackers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in many instances</a> after the attackers have gotten a foothold in the target’s system. However, in this case, these commands are executed discreetly within the RAT itself, rather than being executed visibly in the system console. This approach offers a significant advantage in terms of stealthiness, both in evading real-time monitoring solutions like EDRs, and postmortem digital forensic tools. The internal version number (1.0) indicates that this represents a new development effort by the attackers.</p>
<p>As the core utilities of Windows are proprietary and not open-source, the developers of LightlessCan faced a choice: either to reverse engineer the closed-source system binaries or to get inspired by the code available via the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wine</a> project, where many <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/tree/master/programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">programs</a> are rewritten in order to mimic their execution on other platforms like Linux, macOS, or ChromeOS. We are inclined to believe the developers chose the first option, as the corresponding Wine programs they mimicked in LightlessCan were implemented a little bit differently or not at all (e.g., <span>netsh</span>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, in one of the cases we analyzed, the LightlessCan payload is stored in an encrypted file on the compromised machine, which can only be decrypted using an environment-dependent key. More details about this can be found in the <em><a href="#Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version)">Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version)</a></em> section. This is to ensure that the payload can only be decrypted on the computer of the intended victim and not, for example, on a device of a security researcher.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an examination of the RAT’s internal configuration suggests that, in comparison to BlindingCan, Lazarus increased the code sophistication in LightlessCan.</p>
<h2>Technical analysis</h2>
<p>In this section, we provide technical details about the compromise chain that delivers the NickelLoader downloader, and the three execution chains Lazarus used to deliver its payloads on the compromised system.</p>
<h3>Compromise chain: NickelLoader</h3>
<p>NickelLoader is an HTTP(S) downloader executed on the compromised system via DLL side-loading, which is later used to deliver other Lazarus payloads.</p>
<p>The process of delivering NickelLoader unfolds in a series of stages, commencing with the execution of <span>PresentationHost.exe</span>, which is triggered automatically after the target manually executes the initial quiz challenges; the <span>Quiz1 </span>case is depicted in Figure 3. A malicious dynamically linked library, <span>mscoree.dll</span>, is then side-loaded by the legitimate <span>PresentationHost.exe</span> – both located in <span>C:\ProgramShared\</span>. This DLL is a trojanized <span>NppyPluginDll.dll</span>, from the inactive <a href="https://github.com/Ciantic/NppyPluginDll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Python Plugins DLL for Notepad++</a> project from 2011. It serves as a dropper and has various exports: all the exports copied from the original <span>NppyPluginDll.dll</span> plus all the exports from the legitimate <span>mscoree.dll</span>. One of these legitimate exports, <span>CorExitProcess</span>, contains the malicious code responsible for the decryption and execution of the next malware stage.</p>
<p>To successfully decrypt an encrypted data array embedded in the dropper, three 16-character-long keywords are required by the dropper. These keywords are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>the name of the parent process (<span>PresentationHost</span>),</li>
<li>the internal parameter hardcoded in the binary (<span>9zCnQP6o78753qg8</span>), and</li>
<li>the external parameter passed on the command line (<span>‑embeddingObject</span>), which is inherited from the parent process of <span>PresentationHost.exe</span>, being provided by <span>Quiz1.exe</span> or <span>Quiz2.exe</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte and the output forms the AES-128 decryption key.</p>
<p>The payload is an HTTP(S) downloader that recognizes four commands, all five letters long, shown in Table 3. Because of those five letter commands, we chose to name this payload “NickelLoader”, drawing inspiration from the colloquial term for the US five-cent coin – a nickel. The most important commands are <span>avdrq </span>and <span>gabnc</span>. When these commands are issued, each of them loads data received from the C&amp;C server as a DLL. For this purpose, the attackers probably used <a href="https://github.com/fancycode/MemoryModule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MemoryModule</a>, a library that can be used to load a DLL completely from memory.</p>

<h3>Execution chain 1: miniBlindingCan</h3>
<p>One of the payloads downloaded and executed by NickelLoader is miniBlindingCan, a simplified version of the group’s flagship BlindingCan RAT. It was reported for the first time by <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/dprk-whatsapp-phishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mandiant</a> in September 2022, under the name AIRDRY.V2.</p>
<p>To load miniBlindingCan, a 64-bit malicious dynamically linked library <span>colorui.dll </span>is side-loaded by a legitimate <span>colorcpl.exe</span> executed from <span>C:\ProgramData\Adobe\</span> and serves as a dropper. The DLL is obfuscated using VMProtect and contains thousands of exports from which <span>LaunchColorCpl</span> is the most important, as it handles the execution of the next stage. There’s an encrypted data array in the DLL’s dumped body, together with multiple debug symbols revealing the root directory and the project from which it was built:</p>
<p><span>W:\Develop\aTool\ShellCodeLoader\App\libressl-2.6.5\</span></p>
<p>As the name <span>ShellCodeLoader </span>suggests, the main purpose of this initial stage is to decrypt and load the data array from its body, which contains shellcode. At the beginning of its execution, <span>ShellCodeLoader </span>employs anti-debugging techniques by inspecting the <span>BeingDebugged </span>value within the Process Environment Block (PEB) structure to determine if it’s being scrutinized or analyzed by debugging tools, and utilizes anti-sandbox techniques to avoid detection within sandboxed environments designed for security analysis. The malware also explicitly checks whether its parent process is <span>colorcpl.exe</span>; if not, it exits immediately.</p>
<p>The decrypted data array is not a complete DLL, but forms an intermediate blob with two parts: shellcode followed by another encrypted data array, which represents the last step of the chain. The shellcode seems to be produced by an instance of the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/monoxgas/sRDI/tree/master/ShellcodeRDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShellcodeRDI</a> – in particular, the <span>ShellcodeRDI.c</span> code. It was probably produced by executing the Python script <span>ConvertToShellcode.py</span> from this project on a payload DLL acting as a source for <a href="https://disman.tl/2015/01/30/an-improved-reflective-dll-injection-technique.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflective DLL injection</a>.</p>
<p>The final payload is extracted and decrypted using XOR with a long key, which is a string built by concatenating the name of the parent process (<span>colorcpl.exe</span>), the filename of the dropper (<span>colorui.dll</span>), and the external command line parameter – in this case resulting in <span>COLORCPL.EXECOLORUI.DLL669498484488D3F22712CC5BACA6B7A7</span>. This process is akin to what we observed with BlindingCan backdoor in the Dutch case we previously described in <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/09/30/amazon-themed-campaigns-lazarus-netherlands-belgium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this WeLiveSecurity blogpost</a>. The decryption reveals an executable with download-and-execute functionality, whose internal logic of sending and parsing commands is strongly reminiscent of BlindingCan, a flagship HTTP(S) Lazarus RAT. Unlike the case in the Netherlands, it is not VMProtect-ed and it supports only a small subset of commands available previously: compare Table 4in this blogpost and Table 3 in the <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/09/30/amazon-themed-campaigns-lazarus-netherlands-belgium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogpost on the Dutch case</a> from September 2022. Because the features of this RAT are notably scaled down compared to those in BlindingCan, and yet they seem to share the same server-side infrastructure, we have chosen to distinguish it by appending the prefix “mini-“ to its name, highlighting its reduced functionality compared to its fully-featured RAT counterpart.</p>

<h3>Execution chain 2: LightlessCan (simple version)</h3>
<p>Another payload we have seen executed by NickelLoader is LightlessCan, a new Lazarus backdoor. We have observed two different chains loading this backdoor.</p>
<p>In the simple version of the chain, the dropper of this payload is the malicious dynamically linked library <span>mapistub.dll</span> that is side-loaded by the legitimate <span>fixmapi.exe</span> executed from <span>C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\</span>. The DLL is a trojanized Lua plugin, version 1.4, with all the exports copied from the legitimate Windows <span>mapi32.dll</span>. The export <span>FixMAPI</span> contains malicious code responsible for decrypting and loading the next stage; all the other exports contain benign code sourced from a publicly available <a href="https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Minesweeper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MineSweeper sample project</a>. This <span>mapistub.dll</span> dropper has persistence established via a scheduled task. Unfortunately, we lack additional details about this task, except that its parent process appears as <span>%WINDOWS%\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule</span>.</p>
<p>To successfully decrypt the embedded data array, the dropper needs three keywords to be provided correctly:</p>
<ol>
<li>the name of the parent process (<span>fixmapi.exe</span>),</li>
<li>the internal parameter hardcoded in the binary (<span>IP7pdINfE9uMz63n</span>), and</li>
<li>the external parameter passed in the command line (<span>AudioEndpointBuilder</span>).</li>
</ol>
<p>The keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte and the output forms a 128-bit AES key to be used for decryption. Note that the length of the keywords are not all exactly 16 bytes, but the decryption process will still work if the oversized string is truncated to a 16-byte length (for instance, <span>AudioEndpointBuilder </span>to <span>AudioEndpointBui</span>), and the undersized string, <span>fixmapi.exe</span>, is treated as <span>fixmapi.exe\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00</span>, because the string was initialized as 260 instances of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NUL</a> character.</p>
<h3>Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version)<a id="Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version)"></a></h3>
<p>The most complex chain we observed on the compromised system also delivers LightlessCan, with various components involved in the complete chain of installation stages: a legitimate application, an initial dropper, a complete dropper (which contains the configuration), an intermediate dropper, a configuration file, a file with system information (for the decryption of encrypted payloads on the file system), an intermediate loader and the final step, the LightlessCan RAT. The connections and relationships among these files are illustrated in Figure 12.</p>
<figure><img title="Figure 12. A complex chain of stages delivering the fourth payload" src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2023/2023-09/lazarus-in-spain/figure-12-chain.png" alt="Figure_12_chain" width="" height="">
<figcaption><em>Figure 12. A complex chain of stages delivering the fourth payload</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The initial dropper of the fourth chain is a malicious dynamically linked library <span>HID.dll</span> that is side-loaded by a legitimate executable, <span>tabcal.exe</span>, executed from <span>C:\ProgramData\Adobe\ARM\</span>. The DLL is a trojanized version of <span>MZC8051.dll</span>, a legitimate file from the <a href="https://github.com/Jiangshan00001/npp_MZC8051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8051 C compiler plugin</a> project for Notepad++. It contains all the exports from the original project, but also the necessary exports from the legitimate Hid User Library by Microsoft, so that the side-loading by <span>tabcal.exe</span> will be successful. The export <span>HidD_GetHidGuid</span> contains the malicious code responsible for dropping the next stage and, as in the case of the dropper of the previous chain (Execution chain 2), all the other exports contain the benign MineSweeper code.</p>
<p>As in the previous cases, three long keywords must be provided to decrypt the embedded payload:</p>
<ol>
<li>the name of the parent process (<span>tabcal.exe</span>),</li>
<li>the internal parameter hardcoded in the binary (<span>9zCnQP6o78753qg8</span>), and</li>
<li>the external parameter (<span>LocalServiceNetworkRestricted</span>) – this time not expressed as a command line parameter, but instead as the content of a file located at <span>%WINDOWS%\system32\thumbs.db</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, the keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte and the output forms a 128-bit AES key to be used for the decryption. As in the previous case, the lengths of the keywords are not all exactly 16 bytes, but the decryption will still work if the oversized string is truncated (for instance, to <span>LocalServiceNetw</span>) and the undersized string is extended with nulls (for instance, to <span>tabcal.exe\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00</span>).</p>
<p>The executable produced by the above recipe is the complete dropper from Figure 12 and has the InternalName resource <span>AppResolver.dll</span> (found in the VERSIONINFO resource). It contains two encrypted data arrays: a small one of 126 bytes, and a large one of 1,807,464 bytes (which contains three subparts). First, it decrypts the small array using the RC6 algorithm with the hardcoded 256-bit key <span>DA 48 A3 14 8D BF E2 D2 EF 91 12 11 FF 75 59 A3 E1 6E A0 64 B8 78 89 77 A0 37 91 58 5A FF FF 07</span>. The output represents paths to which the first two subparts of the large blob are dropped (i.e., LightlessCan and the intermediate dropper), and yields the strings <span>C:\windows\system32\oci.dll</span> and <span>C:\windows\system32\grpedit.dat</span>.</p>
<p>Next, it continues with decrypting the second data array – the large blob – using the same encryption key as before. The result is a decrypted blob containing three subparts: a DLL corresponding to <span>grpedit.dat</span> (LightlessCan), a DLL corresponding to <span>oci.dll</span> (the intermediate dropper), and a 14,948 byte encrypted file dropped to <span>%WINDOWS%\System32\wlansvc.cpl </span>(configuration); as depicted in Figure 13.</p>
<figure><img title="Figure 13. The decrypted configuration stored in wlansvc.cpl" src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2023/2023-09/lazarus-in-spain/figure-03-1-2-3-4-5-6-7.png" alt="Figure_03" width="" height="">
<figcaption><em>Figure 13. The decrypted configuration stored in wlansvc.cpl</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Moreover, the complete dropper also stores several characteristics identifying the compromised system in the file <span>%WINDOWS%\System32\4F59FB87DF2F</span>, whose name is hardcoded in the binary. These characteristics are primarily retrieved from the <span>Computer\HKLM\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\BIOS</span> registry path. Here are the specific values of these characteristics, along with a PowerShell command provided in brackets that can be used to display the corresponding value on any Windows machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>SystemBIOSDate (<span>Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\HARDWARE\Description\System\BIOS" -Name BIOSReleaseDate | Select-Object -Property BIOSReleaseDate</span>)</li>
<li>SystemBIOSVersion (<span>Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Bios | Select-Object -Property Version</span>)</li>
<li>SystemManufacturer (<span>Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem | Select-Object -Property Manufacturer</span>)</li>
<li>SystemProductName (<span>Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystemProduct | Select-Object -Property Name</span>)</li>
<li>Identifier in <span>Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\MultifunctionAdapter\0\DiskController\0\DiskPeripheral\0</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The concatenation of the values is required for decryption of the encrypted <span>grpedit.dat</span> from the file system. On a test machine running an image of Windows 10 on VMWare, the output can be:</p>
<p><span>11/12/20INTEL - 6040000VMware, Inc.VMware Virtual Platform656ba047-20b25a2a-A</span></p>
<p>The <span>oci.dll</span> file is another dropping layer – the intermediate dropper that drops the intermediate loader, which is a payload similar to the one described in the previously mentioned <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/09/30/amazon-themed-campaigns-lazarus-netherlands-belgium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dutch case</a>. Again, the attackers used an open-source project, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/0/https:/github.com/Nikipit/Flashing-tip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flashing Tip</a> plugin for Notepad++, which is no longer available online. Unlike the previous cases, only two long keywords must be provided in order to decrypt the embedded payload successfully using AES-128:</p>
<ol>
<li>the name of the parent process (<span>msdtc.exe</span>), and</li>
<li>the internal parameter hardcoded in the binary (<span>fb5XPNCr8v83Y85P</span>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Both keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte (the parent process name is truncated, or padded with NULLs, as necessary to fill 16 bytes). The product of the decryption is the intermediate loader (<span>LLTMapperAPI.dll</span>). It uses the system information (same as the values stored in <span>4F59FB87DF2F</span>) to decrypt the configuration file <span>wlansvc.cpl</span> and to locate, decrypt, and load the encrypted <span>grpedit.dat</span>, which is LightlessCan, the new full-featured RAT.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have described a new Lazarus attack that originated on LinkedIn where fake recruiters approached their potential victims, who were using corporate computers for personal purposes. Even though public awareness of these types of attacks should be high, the success rates of these campaigns have still not dropped to zero.</p>
<p>The most worrying aspect of the attack is the new type of payload, LightlessCan, a complex and possibly evolving tool that exhibits a high level of sophistication in its design and operation, representing a significant advancement in malicious capabilities compared to its predecessor, BlindingCan.</p>
<p>The attackers can now significantly limit the execution traces of their favorite Windows command line programs that are heavily used in their post-compromise activity. This maneuver has far-reaching implications, impacting the effectiveness of both real-time monitoring solutions and of post-mortem digital forensic tools.</p>

<h2>What is the Missing Middle?</h2>



<p>Other than he is my total hero, <a href="https://youtu.be/hJ5y1wHpHUM">and he was born and he was raised in my hometown</a>, I wanted to interview John Romero to try and solve the modern indie game development paradox.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paradox goes like this…</p>



<p>When John Romero was making games In the 1990s there was no digital distribution so you had to get a company like Softdisk to publish you and physically manufacture and distribute your games by mail! There was no Unity, Gamemaker, Godot, or Unreal so if you wanted to make a game you had to have a full-time person (in their case John Carmack) crafting your game engine from scratch (usually in C or machine code) every time. There was no widely accessible internet or cloud-based source-control or storage so you couldn’t work remotely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, despite all the limitations of the 1990s, the guys at id Software could make 13 games in 1 year.</p>



<p>How is it that we have better tools which should make us more productive, and better communications that should increase collaboration, and digital distribution which has, essentially, 0 marginal cost, and yet games take longer to make? Indie game developers were supposed to be small, nimble, and quicker than the hulking, slow moving AAA goliaths. What happened?</p>



<p><em>IMPORTANT: this is not a lazy devs argument! Everyone is working their ass off these days. My concern is that when I talk to first time game devs they almost always tell me they are 2 years deep into their 4 year project. That scares me!</em></p>



<p>In today’s post I want to explore why new indie game developers plunge themselves into much longer game development cycles. The industry has essentially stretched us to cut out one of the most important stepping stones between tiny games and multi-year projects. This has caused developers to have incorrect assumptions, wasted resources, and burnout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Also I wanted an excuse to write a post that included as many pictures of the Doom guys wearing jorts as possible)</p>

<h2>My theory: The missing middle</h2>



<p>The modern indie game business model and development process has a missing middle problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the last decade or so, the business model of first time indie studios goes something like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are a team of 3 developers and did a game jam, published it on itch.io, had fun, people seemed excited for our game, so we formed an LLC, signed with a publisher, and are planning to spend 3 years making our first game for which our goals are modest: we really only want to make $300,000.”</p>



<p>That mentality right there is the missing middle problem: These days, studios either make jam games that they hammer out in a weekend that they post to itch for free or they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_no_return">burn the ships</a>, quit their job, and make multi-year mega projects that can only be profitable if they earn multiple hundred thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is a middle game?</p>



<p>These are games that are bigger and more polished than a game jam game but are not huge, 30 hour epic triple-I indie game. A “middle game” should only take 1 to 9 months to create and can be profitable (or at least not a money sink) because it is expected to earn in the range of $10,000 to $40,000.</p>



<p>“Middle games” used to be the norm. The middle used to be the goal. The middle was how you built a career.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-51-1024x768.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-51-1024x768.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-51-300x225.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-51-768x576.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-51-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-51.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Unfortunately when games made by small teams started earning millions and people could buy as many jorts and race cars as they wanted. Everyone expected $300,000 payouts to be the baseline rather than the exception.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But now, to the modern indie dev business model, (especially the ones hanging out on r/gamedev): earning $40,000 or less is considered a complete failure and should be mocked publicly (this is them speaking, not me).</p>



<p>To the modern indie dev business model, dedicating just 3 months (or less) to your first project is shocking and when I say that they react as if I am asking someone to perform a backflip to the moon or to change their blood type using transcendental meditation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe the modern indie business model that skips over developing “middle games” is why 75% of studios on Steam have released 1 and only 1 game.</p>

<h2>Why did this happen?</h2>

(Also Jeans &amp; sandals was a thing we did in the 90s)</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Indies stopped developing “middle” games because the industry stopped directly paying for them.</p>



<p>Quick history lesson:</p>



<p>In John Romero’s book Doom Guy, the first time he was paid for making a game was an Apple II game he published called <em>Scout Search</em> for inCider Magazine. The magazine paid him $100 for it ($300 in 2023 dollars).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a picture of the magazine:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="739" height="1024" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-48-739x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-48-739x1024.png 739w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-48-217x300.png 217w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-48-768x1064.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-48.png 866w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px"></figure>



<p>(side note, get it? It is an Apple computer magazine called inCIDER? Get it?)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a picture of the game: </p>



<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="561" height="385" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KPX_2GEIRIJi7R2MSrTHs2A40bUzh4lMr5aN2Tj_UW9xnL8RrnSpSN_OT2nltwCt2i_ci_0FS5WjVu0IQSAijIJCgtib6NN2Qf1956ygOPrwzqdQgP5LlmaVGWz2g0ZA7O4dP_dol1D0Lal-sOg_FyE"></p>



<p>For early indie software distribution, magazines would literally reprint source code and people would retype that code into their computer to play the game. Obviously the games had to be tiny enough to be printed in a magazine and be manually retyped by a human. The payout was in the hundreds of dollars. But that was what the expectation was at the time.</p>



<p>Softdisk, the company John worked for before starting id Software, would pay developers a flat fee to the rights to ship their game on their monthly software disk. Softdisk negotiated a 6-game deal with John’s id Software for $5000 per game (about $11,000 per game in 2023 dollars). That was the expectation for games at that time.</p>



<p>In the days of flash games, flash portals like Kongregate, Armor Games, and Newgrounds paid indie game developers a flat fee to have their logo embedded in their game. For a decent game flash portals paid indies in the range of $10,000 to $30,000 ish dollars. That was the expectation for games at that time.</p>



<p>Back in the day, there was an income ceiling to indie game development. Publishers paid a small flat fee per game. Nobody was getting rich off one game, so developers were incentivized to make lots of games that were small, quick, and fun.</p>



<p>Back in the day, making a game and earning $15,000 from it was totally expected. Nobody said “FAILED GAME!” Nobody called it the indiepocalypse. That was just what games earned.</p>



<p>Here a quote from flash game developer who used these smaller games and eventually became a hit Steam developer of games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/914800/Coffee_Talk/">Coffee Talk</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would make the art and a friend would do the code. We could make a simple game in a week and that could sell for $500 in sponsorships. We made the first Infectonator game in a month and that game got $5000 in sponsorship + $20K in performance bonuses. Some sites would offer performance bonuses where they would reward based on how many times the game was played, more plays means more ads traffic for the sponsor. It’s basically revenue sharing from the ads that the game generated in the sponsor’s site. We learned a lot about game design from those Flash days</p>
<cite><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/togeproductions">Kris Antoni (Toge Productions</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/TogeProductions/infectonator">You can still play infectonator here.</a></p>



<p>Earning ONLY $25,000 for a game sounds terrible now, but when your game is made in a week, “middle games” were a great way to learn game development and build a career.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>“Middle-earning” games are still the norm people just don’t realize it</h2>



<p><a href="https://gamalytic.com/blog/steam-revenue-infographic">Gamalytic recently published a blog post</a> that did some filtering to see what the “true” median income for Steam is. They filtered out cheap asset flip games that cost less than $5 and found that the median revenue is about $4000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also filtered out games that cost less than $10 and found the median revenue is $17,000.</p>



<p>$17,000 in today’s dollars is basically what Softdisk was paying id Software per game back in 1990</p>



<p>And actually, the number of games that have earned $10,000 in the first 3 months is growing!</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="959" height="505" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-46.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-46.png 959w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-46-300x158.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-46-768x404.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px"></figure>



<p>Graph from <a href="https://gamalytic.com/blog/steam-revenue-infographic">Gamalytic</a></p>



<p>So why is it so bad now that games earned $10,000 when 30 years ago it was the norm? Because now there is a slim chance to become super rich because of the indie-utopia.</p>



<h2>The birth of the Indie-utopia</h2>



<p>Everyone complains about the indie-pocalypse but not enough people consider that we just lived through an indie-utopia in the form of digital distribution and mega-earning games.</p>



<p>In 2004, digital distribution arrived to consoles with the original XBOX’s Xbox Live Arcade. Games like Geometry Wars were HUGE and earned millions.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-45.png" alt="" width="489" height="366" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-45.png 365w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-45-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"></figure>



<p>For PCs, digital distribution always sort of existed but it kicked into high gear in 2005 when Steam opened up to 3rd party games. The first non-Valve game to appear on Steam was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1002/Rag_Doll_Kung_Fu/">Ragdoll Kung Fu</a> which you can still purchase today (it only has 53 reviews).</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="460" height="215" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-44.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-44.png 460w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-44-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure>



<p>With the birth of digital distribution, suddenly a game produced by indies COULD earn millions of dollars in sales (emphasis on “could”) instead of just earning $10,000 paid up front by some platform like Kongregate. That documentary <a href="https://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/">Indie Game The Movie</a> almost seems like Xbox Live propaganda telling developers that YOU WILL make millions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then in 2007 with the birth of the iPhone, and 2008 with the app store, and the Free To Play model, the flash game portals were dead. And without flash, nobody was paying developers a flat rate to make smaller games. Free To Play, and ad-supported games could also make MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/flappy-bird-is-doing-50000-in-revenue-per-day-2014-2">When Flappy Bird hit in 2014, everyone was whispering about how the developer was earning $50,000</a> per day in ad revenue. Numbers like that make the $10,000+ ceiling that flash portals paid out seem laughable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What developer would want to settle for $10,000 when they could earn 100 times that?</p>



<h2>AAA became huge</h2>



<p>At the same time that indies were getting million dollar payouts, AAA games flourished too. Games like Call of Duty, Bioshock, Grand Theft Auto, Skyrim, The Last of Us, and Dark Souls became mainstream. Games became more profitable than movies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People stopped going to arcades to play silly little action games. Instead, people could play beautiful AAA games at home on their consoles and PCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simultaneously, the Free to Play model changed game design so that retention was the most important metric. Free to Play would exploit quick hit arcade-style games like Bejeweled or Frogger and then bolted on a massive retention systems in the form of upgrades, powerups, and muli-currency schemes and birthed complex chimeras like Candy Crush and Subway Surfers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So quick hit arcade games (like John Romero published for inCider magazine) were no longer in vogue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2001 with the XBOX and PS2, AAA games have become so amazing and so beautiful and so ubiquitous that an entire generation of gamers have grown up assuming that a game = 10-15 hour linear, cinematic experience with amazing graphics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those young gamers who later became developers never had the chance to play silly little games that are worth about $10,000.</p>



<p>They never had a chance to experience what a “middle game” is.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Platforms, publishers, and investment firms grew up too</h2>



<p>When the rest of the industry started earning million dollar payouts, the 3rd-party businesses that funded the middle market grew up too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I keep my ear to the ground and most major indie game publishers and platforms (like XBOX Game Pass) won’t even consider funding games for less than $200,000. In fact I have heard about indies pitching the big publishers $250,000 budgeted games and the publisher coming back saying “Increase your budget and how much you are asking for and MAYBE we will publish your game.” So developers scaled their game up, doubled how much they were asking for and then they got funding. </p>



<p>Publishers want to see big payouts and they know that only comes from big budget games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original game that indie developer pitched was totally fine before that publisher asked the developer to bloat the budget. The game would have probably been even better if they just left it at the size it was originally. </p>



<p>Publishers don’t have time to fund and support a game that is expected to earn $17,000 revenue. If the publisher negotiated a 30% revenue split that means that after Steam’s cut, taxes, etc, they would be earning less than $3500. That just doesn’t scale for publishers so middle tier games are worthless for them.</p>



<h2>The exception became the rule</h2>



<p>When games had the possibility of earning developers millions, every developer mentally EXPECTED games to do that well. Our expectations became outsized and distorted.</p>



<p>I am guilty of distorting this expectation too. I mostly write about games that are top sellers such as <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2022/10/17/how-dome-keeper-achieved-a-million-dollar-launch/">Dome Keeper</a>, <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2022/05/04/how-peglin-made-1049413-in-1-week/">Peglin</a>, <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2023/01/18/how-a-pixel-art-shooter-achieved-a-million-dollar-launch-the-zero-sievert-story/">Zero Sievert</a>. To be fair, I do sometimes cover games that are medium hits. Such as <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2022/05/12/how-ravenous-devils-made-a-killing-and-earned-hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars/">Ravenous Devils</a>, and all these more <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2023/01/23/pay-attention-to-these-secretly-popular-sub-genres/">modestly selling opportunities.&nbsp;</a></p>



<h2>We forgot how to make small games</h2>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-43-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-43-1024x576.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-43-300x169.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-43-768x432.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-43-1536x864.png 1536w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-43.png 1566w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The burning of the Library at Alexandria</figcaption></figure>



<p>Basically when developers MIGHT earn millions of dollars from an indie game, everyone gets that number in their head as the EXPECTATION for releasing a game. Every game that doesn’t earn $1,000,000 must be a failure!</p>



<p>If you step back, the expectations that contemporary developers have for themselves is really is quite insane:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step 1: Try out a concept with a game jam game that you made in 2-5 days.</p>



<p>Step 2: Dedicate 3+ YEARS of your life to create a flawless masterpiece that will earn you $1,000,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you mess up Step 2, you wasted 3 years of your life and FAAAAAAAILED</p>



<p>This is crazy.</p>

<h2>What we can learn from our forerunners and the birth of id Software</h2>



<p>My favorite sci-fi trope is when scientists uncover an ancient alien civilization that was super advanced but somehow managed to implode and the scientists dig up their lost ancient machinery so that we can learn from their long lost genius (see the Alien franchise film Prometheus, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Halo etc).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to go back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Basically we need to dust off the id team’s jorts and figure out how to make smaller games in faster timelines (John Romero isn’t even that old so it shouldn’t be that hard to get back at it.)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-42.png" alt="" width="386" height="369" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-42.png 320w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-42-300x287.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px"><figcaption>DOUBLE JORTS!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here are some lessons I think we can learn from our game dev forerunners:</p>



<h4>Set expectations</h4>



<p>Build your game assuming you will earn $10,000 NOT $1,000,000. How long should you build it with that goal? How much should you spend on art? What creative compromises will you make?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limits create great art.</p>



<h4>Expect to release multiple games per year</h4>



<p>Yes, it can be done. <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2023/09/25/john-romero-on-his-book-doom-guy-and-developing-games-at-a-small-scale/">You don’t have to release 13 like id Software did in 1991</a> but you can release more than 1 game per year.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Be aware of the market</h4>



<p>I know it is uncool to make market-based-decisions that compromise YOUR TRUE ARTISTIC VISION (man) but successful developers have always done that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>John Romero worked for Infocom and had experience making huge RPGs. He also loved deep RPGs like Chrono Trigger and Ultima. The guys at id Software played a lot of Dungeons and Dragons (John Carmack was the DM). But when John Romero co-founded id Software, he knew his small team couldn’t create deep, story-rich RPGs, so they purposely chose not to.</p>



<p>Similarly, despite early success with 2D platformers like Keen and Dangerous Dave, by 1991, Romero knew that the industry was transitioning to 3d games. So id Software changed their strategy to keep up with the times.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Guys, we should not be doing this game. We have this cool technology that we’re not using, that we’re not taking advantage of to make a better version of that game going forward.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<cite>John Romero to his id Software team, trying to convince them to give up 2D platformers and transition to 3D games</cite></blockquote>



<p>id Software could have spent YEARS heads down working on their magnum-opus game DOOM with the most advanced tech. But they didn’t have the runway, or the capital, or the expertise, or the audience to do that yet. Instead, they released several smaller games each one built on the same engine but with a slight improvement over the previous one. This allowed them to earn money while they researched better tech.</p>



<h4>Spread research and development across several games&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Here is a brief history of games made by the id Software team that demonstrates how they used multiple releases to incrementally upgrade their research.</p>



<p><strong>Catacomb&nbsp; (</strong><a href="https://www.retrogames.cz/play_556-DOS.php?language=EN"><strong>Play it here in browser</strong></a><strong>)&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Released 1989. This was John Carmack’s early 2D game for Softdisk. Here the basic gameplay is established such as basic dungeon crawling (aka Gauntlet) and attacking enemies with a weapon where you hold down the fire button to charge up. There are also keys, potions, spells, etc.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-41.png" alt="" width="782" height="489" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-41.png 640w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-41-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px"></figure>







<p><strong>HoverTank 3D (</strong><a href="https://www.retrogames.cz/play_557-DOS.php?language=EN"><strong>Play it here in browser</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>



<p>Released 1991, this is the first real 3D engine id Software created. Notice that HoverTank’s walls are all solid colors? At the time they didn’t know you could scale bitmaps to create textured walls. But who needs textures!?! Also the controls kinda suck and don’t feel responsive. But the basic UI is innovative for the time: it includes a radar that shows you where the enemies are (which is still used to this day in FPSs)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-40.png" alt="" width="744" height="465" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-40.png 400w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-40-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px"></figure>







<p><strong>Catacomb 3-D (</strong><a href="https://www.retrogames.cz/play_555-DOS.php?language=EN"><strong>Play it here in browser</strong></a><strong>)&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Released in 1991. This game builds off the HoverTank engine and adds textured walls (look at that cool brick pattern). The game also has improved controls, multiple weapons, keys, healing potions, and a new compass which is still used in modern FPSs and games like Skyrim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But notice that Catacomb 3-D still has the same basic game design as Catacomb 2D. It is still dungeon crawling, there are Bolts, Nukes, Heals, Keys and is score based just like the 2D version.</p>



<p>Also notice how the team has basically the same red brute sprites between HoverTank and Catacomb; they just gave them yellow eyes and toenails.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-39.png" alt="" width="741" height="463" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-39.png 320w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-39-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px"></figure>



<p><strong>Wolfenstein 3D (</strong><a href="https://archive.org/details/Wolfenstein3d"><strong>Play in browser here</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>



<p>Released 1992. This is built on the same 3D engine as the previous games but now has VGA graphics instead of the smaller color palette of the EGA graphics that Catacomb 3-D used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wolfenstein also added other gameplay mechanics such as secret walls, better weapons, and the ability to add sound triggers to the map that can alert remote guards when you shoot.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-38.png" alt="" width="784" height="490" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-38.png 320w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-38-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px"></figure>



<p><strong>Doom (</strong><a href="http://browser-doom.io/?page=game&amp;game=doom&amp;profile=Doom%20(Shareware)"><strong>Play it in Browser here</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>



<p>Released in 1993 This game truly revolutionized the industry. It was built on an entirely new engine that incorporated everything John Carmack learned making HoverTank, Catacomb-3D, and Wolfenstein 3D. The game finally featured diminished lighting, sky textures, variable height floors, non-orthogonal walls and even a head bob when you run.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="469" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-37.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-37.png 750w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-37-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>Basically DOOM was not a game that came from thin air. It was built slowly over years through smaller releases, feedback from the marketplace, and constant iteration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If back then id Software used the modern indie all-or-nothing method of production they would have gone silent for 3 years with no market feedback, no funded R&amp;D on their engine, no practice in 3D level design, no building an audience. It would have been designed in the dark and may have never been discovered or even made it to release.</p>



<h4>Reuse tech infrastructure</h4>



<p>Throughout the development of their dozens of games, John Romero created <a href="https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/TED5">Tile Editor aka TED</a> which was id Software’s in-house editor to create levels for many of their games. The editor was flexible enough that it could be reused over and over despite each game having slightly different engines. Over the years the tool created levels for their 2D platformer Commander Keen or simple 3D games such as Wolfenstein 3D. <a href="https://twitter.com/dosnostalgic/status/1003821046624120832">John Romero commented in this tweet that over 33 games were made using his TED v5 tool</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TED was even used by other companies to make levels for their games. Here is a screenshot of TED being used to make levels for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1421490/Rise_of_the_Triad_Ludicrous_Edition/">Apogee’s Rise of the Triad</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Learn what a small game is</h2>



<p>Whenever I give a talk and say more indies should make a game in 6 months, people’s heads explode. They leave nasty comments on the Youtube video. IT’S IMPOSSIBLE!&nbsp;</p>



<p>AAA games have warped our brains as to what the scale of a game is. Blockbuster indie games like Hollow Knight and Factorio have warped our brains as to what the scale of a game is. You cannot make those games in the short runway needed for “middle” games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We don’t even remember what small fun games feel like anymore. So I am going to show you REAL WORLD examples of actual indies who have actually made good quality, moderately profitable, non-asset-flip, games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your homework assignment is to download these. You should play them. We need to relearn what “middle games” feel like.</p>



<p>Now you might look at these games and say “Chris this game FAAAAAILED it only earned 123 reviews!” Remember, we are living in the land of “Middle Games.” If you only spend 3 months on a game, 123 reviews can mean the game is quite profitable on a per-hour devtime.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Real world, middle sized games</h3>



<h4>Cozy Bee</h4>



<p>I am such a fanboy of Cozy Bee games. Most of the games by this 1-person team are developed in less than a year. Here are a few of them. They are in the right genre for Steam (management), they have the right graphical style (cozy), they are just so smart.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>20 Minutes Till Dawn</h4>



<p>I wrote about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966900/20_Minutes_Till_Dawn/">20 Minutes Till Dawn</a> in <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2022/06/14/20-minutes-till-dawn/">my blog post here</a>. Ignore the fact that it made millions of dollars, the interesting thing is that it was initially released after fewer than 3 months of development time. 20 MTD was a “middle” break from a game that the developer had been working on for YEARS. Middle games to the rescue to stop burnout.</p>

<h4>Sokpop</h4>



<p>The Sokpop collective releases a game a month. Behind the scenes they are really four developers who work alone releasing their games typically after a staggered 3-month dev cycle. They have their own way of doing things and I would say go a bit too crazy switching up genres too fast and not doubling down on proven genres which is why you see such variation in their sales numbers. But who cares? They seem to be having fun and they are still releasing interesting art, so good on them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you look at their titles, you will notice that their most successful games are the ones in Steam’s preferred genre: Crafty-buildy-strategy games. Those are</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1390010/pyramida/">Pyramida</a></p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948280/Stacklands">Stacklands</a></p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124770/Tuin">Tuin</a></p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2051440/Guardener">Guardener</a></p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1872790/Luckitown">Luckitown</a></p>



<p>The less popular ones are typically platformers, linear narrative games, and super experimental avant garde genres.</p>



<h4>Luck Be A Landlord</h4>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1404850/Luck_be_a_Landlord/">This anti-capitalist slot machine roguelike was a hit</a>! But it didn’t have to be be due to the short production time.</p>



<p>I asked developer DiIorio about the development process:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The first public build of Luck be a Landlord took about 2 months from its initial concept to the demo release in the Steam Game Festival: Autumn Edition.</p>



<p>I originally was working on it for this game jam: https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2020 before I expanded it into a bigger project. </p>

<h4>SNKRX</h4>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/915310/SNKRX/">SNKRX</a> was developed in months and you can actually follow along the<a href="https://github.com/a327ex/SNKRX/blob/master/devlog.md"> developers process with this day-by-day dev log</a> and more <a href="https://a327ex.com/">game marketing and making thoughts on their main blog</a>.</p>

<p>SNKRX, and Vampire-survivor likes are a great example of one way to make quick games that Steam actually pays attention to is to take a classic old arcade game or flash game and add a roguelike meta progression on top of it.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>City builders</h4>



<p>City builders and civilization style games are the biggest genres on Steam but developers always say “Well those take YEARS to make.” But they don’t have to take long if you focus on finding what the fun actually is behind them and stripping away everything else. A perfect example of this is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS/">Islanders</a> which is a minimalistic city builder that took the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islanders_(video_game)#:~:text=Islanders%20was%20developed%20over%20seven,working%20with%20a%20small%20team.">team only seven months to develop</a>.</p>

<h4>Horror games</h4>



<p>Horror games are a very very popular genre with gamers on Steam and this developer made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2234150/BACKROOMS_APPREHENSION/">Backrooms Apprehension </a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1557580/DONT_LOOK_AWAY/">Don’t Look Away</a> in 1.5 months each.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a quote from them on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11p9d1s/examples_of_games_made_in_a_few_months_that_sold/">this reddit thread</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve made two games so far (DON’T LOOK AWAY and BACKROOMS:APPREHENSION), they took me about one month and a half each, still updating them but I did release them in early access and they are doing pretty good, not millions but that wasn’t my goal, I just needed to make enough to quit my job and to allow me to keep making games and I’ve succeeded.“</p>
<cite>DMNT Interactive</cite></blockquote>

<h2>But Chris! You wrote earlier that Steam hates small games!</h2>



<p>That is correct! 2 Years ago I said that the <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2021/08/09/steam-hates-small-games/">Steam algorithm is built to hide smaller games</a> (See even Steam is built to suppress the “missing middle”)</p>



<p>It is true that you cannot rapidly release many small games and expect to make millions. But that is ok. Remember, our brains have been AAA and III warped. Indie Utopia warped our brains.</p>



<p>The whole point of middle games is to improve your tech, get your name out there a bit more, build a back catalog, practice launching, and just have some lower-stakes fun. If your game that took 3 months to build did fail, don’t worry, you only wasted 3 months. Move on to the next game. If you do meet the target of $10,000 revenue, that is awesome! If not, make another one.</p>



<p>You could go to game design school and pay them TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars per semester to learn how to make games, or you could just release a bunch of small “middle games” and EARN tens of thousands of dollars. When John Romero and id Software released HoverTank and Catacombs 3D they didn’t say “our games failed, we only made $5000!” Instead, they saw it as paid R&amp;D that was equity towards developing Wolfenstein 3D which earned id Software $50,000 per month a year later.</p>



<h2>Podcast</h2>



<p>Bonus: Designer Notes Podcast. While I was writing this, Soren Johnson published this great interview with Trent Kusters about how his early days working at a company that would churn out games and he talks about how much he learned from that experience</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idlethumbs.net/designernotes/episodes/trent-kusters-part-1">Listen to it here</a></p>



<h2>Failure is ok</h2>



<p>Even if the game does “fail,” you shouldn’t be ashamed. Watch this great segment from an interview with fine art critic David Sylvester saying artists “must be allowed to go through bad periods, they must be allowed to do bad work.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="artist must be allowed to go through bad periods" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0wRB2oEjwt4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Don’t worry, the rapid, quick, middle game period is just the middle. You will someday make your big grand masterpiece, you just can’t do it right away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stick with it and you can make your masterwork some day.</p>



<h2>Final Inspiration&nbsp;</h2>



<p>I want to leave you with one final picture of John Romero in jorts and long sleeve denim (long on the top, short on the bottom) and the most inspirational part of his book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Start small and get some practice. Try remaking a classic arcade game to get a feel for things before you attempt to make a giant RPG. Carmack, Tom, and I had each been making games for ten years before we started working together. It was another few years before we made DOOM, and that was my ninetieth game (not a typo). Give yourself time to get good, and don’t be dissuaded by setbacks. Game development is like gameplay. Load your save and try again.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">


<p>Until I was about 30, I could not see images in my head. When I closed my eyes, all I’d see was black nothingness. Due to random luck, that changed.</p>
<p>Before I learned the technique that I’m about to share with you, experimenting with photographic composition was a manual task. I had to physically stand in front of my subject and actually move things. That, or I would fetch a sketchbook &amp; pencils and begin drawing my ideas on paper.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, many people at college told me they could see and manipulate bright, clear images in their “Mind’s Eye”. They could preplan their photo-shoots and improve their compositions just by closing their eyes and imagining what the photo might look like.</p>
<p>This made absolutely no sense to me. I could not imagine what that would be like. When I closed my eyes, all I could see was a reddy/brown, fuzzy nothingness.</p>
<h2>Before I Was Taught This Technique</h2>
<p>If I closed my eyes and tried to visualize, say, an elephant, this is my best shot at showing you what it looked like:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://photographyinsider.info/media/uploads/2015/12/aphantasia-article-inside-of-eyelids.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://photographyinsider.info/media/uploads/2015/12/aphantasia-article-inside-of-eyelids.jpg 1200w, https://photographyinsider.info/media/uploads/2015/12/aphantasia-article-inside-of-eyelids-300x158.jpg 300w, https://photographyinsider.info/media/uploads/2015/12/aphantasia-article-inside-of-eyelids-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://photographyinsider.info/media/uploads/2015/12/aphantasia-article-inside-of-eyelids-768x403.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p>
<p>Can you see the elephant? No, nor could I.</p>
<p>All I could see was the back of my eyelids, with the reddy/brown color coming from what little light passed through them.</p>
<p>If I stood in front of a bright light with my eyes closed, I could see that the inside of my eyelids were a lighter brown/red. If I turned away, the inside of my eyelids would become darker. That’s as much as I can tell you about what I could see unless I had my eyes open and was actually looking at something real.</p>
<p>What I definitely could not see was any sort of shape, color or image.</p>
<h2>What Is Aphantasia?</h2>
<p>I’ve only recently heard the term ‘aphantasia.’ It is a neurological condition in which a person is unable to recall memories as pictures or create images in their imagination. I have no idea whether I would have been diagnosed with aphantasia, or whether what I went on to be taught is a cure.</p>
<p>All I know is that I was never able to see images in my mind’s eye. Now, after practicing the technique that I’m about to share with you, I can.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting that I was never able to recall dreams. I would tell people that I do not dream. Now, since practicing this technique, I regularly experience and recall strong, vivid dreams.</p>
<h2>My Trip to London</h2>
<p>Ten to fifteen years after leaving college I happened to attend an eight day training course in London, England. I didn’t go because I thought I had aphantasia (the term hadn’t even been invented then). The course was part of my regular personal development regimen.</p>
<p>Some of the techniques we were taught required us to close our eyes and make the images that we saw grow bigger or smaller, brighter or dimmer, and bring them closer to us or take them further away.</p>
<p>I couldn’t do this. It frustrated me. I mentioned to several of the assistant tutors that I couldn’t see images when I closed my eyes. They told me that I was wrong. ~They said that I could see images!</p>
<p>When I insisted, I was told that everyone sees pictures in their heads. One of them, trying to be helpful said, with a hypnotic tone in his voice, “Imagine what it would be like … if you could see images in your mind.” After a few minutes, he gave up. I had no comprehension of what it would be like.</p>
<p>Several days in to the course one of the Lead Tutors, a man named Michael Neill, asked whether there was anyone in the audience who couldn’t see images in their mind’s eye. Many hands when up—I wasn’t unusual after all!</p>
<h2>Image Streaming</h2>
<p>Mr Neill invited a member of the audience to go up to the stage and started to explain and demonstrate a technique he called ‘<strong>Image Streaming</strong>‘.</p>
<p>I couldn’t wait to try it. After a few months of <strong>daily practice</strong>, this technique affected me in two ways:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><i></i> First, if I was aphantasic, Image Streaming cured it. I could see bright, vivid images in my head. I haven’t practiced the technique in years—but I still see beautifully clear images in my mind’s eye.</li>
<li><i></i> Second, it improved my photography like nothing else I’d ever done. From that point on I didn’t need to construct a set, find models or leave the house to play with composition or photo ideas. I could just sit back, relax and close my eyes. Image Streaming helped me become a better photographer from the comfort of my armchair.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Today I can close my eyes and see detailed images that are pretty close to what I’d see if I had my eyes open and was looking at a TV or cinema screen. I can freeze motion, move props and models, add new items and change the lighting.</p>
<p>As someone who couldn’t ever do this before it still amazes me when I close my eyes and create something beautiful. This is something I’ve learned to do—I definitely wasn’t born with it.</p>
<p>And, as a bonus, a really useful side effect of Image Streaming is that it can help you fall asleep at night (more about that in the FAQ section below).</p>
<h2>How to Image Stream</h2>
<p>It’s easy to learn. Play this video to find out how.</p>
<p>One thing, before you do: I have found that many people give up. They try it once or twice and, when nothing happens, they decide it doesn’t work.</p>
<p>It took me about a month to get really good results (although I noticed changes earlier.) I would urge you to practice for <strong>10 continuous minutes, at least once a day, for at least a month</strong>. It doesn’t work with everyone. If you’re one of the luck ones, you could soon be seeing images in your mind’s eye.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>Many people have contacted me about this over the past few years. Here are answers to the most common questions:</p>
<div id="faq">
<h3><strong>Q. How long should I rub my eyes for and how hard?</strong></h3>
<p>Just a few seconds and not at all hard. Most people I’ve spoken to about this have experienced seeing ‘golden dots’ inside their eyelids after rubbing them for a few seconds. It’s something people sometimes do naturally after waking-up in the morning. The objective is to get you started—give you something to begin describing. If you don’t see the golden dots from gently rubbing your eyes, try one of the other 24 backup techniques mentioned in the link at the bottom of this page. You should NOT be rubbing your eyes for more than a few seconds.</p>
<h3><strong>Q. How long do I have to do Image Streaming for before I’ll see results?</strong></h3>
<p>Somebody on Reddit (link below) posted results saying that it worked for them within seven to nine days. If you read the comments (below) from readers of this page, you’ll see that some people see an improvement within 20 minutes. Others need a few weeks and, for some, it doesn’t work at all. I can’t promise a cure but I do feel that some people give-up too quickly. My suggestion is that you do it for at least 10 continuous minutes, at least once a day, for at least a month before deciding that it doesn’t work for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Q. Can I do Image Streaming without speaking the words out-loud?</strong></h3>
<p>Not if you want to be able to improve your ability to see images in your mind’s eye! As described further down this page, speaking inside your head while doing Image Streaming is likely to send you to sleep.</p>
<h3><strong>Q. All I see is black. How can I describe what I see when there’s nothing to see?</strong></h3>
<p>If you can’t see the ‘golden dots’ after rubbing your eyes gently for a couple of seconds, try some of the 24 backup techniques mentioned in the <a href="#further-reading">Further Reading</a> section at the bottom of this article.</p>
<h3><strong>Q. If I use a voice recorder, do I have to listen back to what I’ve said?</strong></h3>
<p>No. I’m not going to pretend that I understand why but it seems that your mind just needs to know what the words are being recorded. You can, of course, listen to the recordings if you want to. Personally, I didn’t bother.</p>
<h3><strong>Q. By the time I’ve begun describing something, it’s gone and something else is there instead.</strong></h3>
<p>Yep, that’s exactly what happened to me at first. For me, there came a time when I could concentrate on the things I was seeing and I could make them stay. Until then, just keep up as best you can.</p>
</div>
<h2>The Early Days</h2>
<p>The sound clip that I’ve included within that video is from a very early Image Streaming session. I have become much better with practice. Images now come easily, clearly and quickly. For me, at least, it really has been worth the effort of dedicating time every day to practicing streaming images in my mind. (I don’t know whether it’s improved my IQ though.)</p>
<h2>Do You Have Trouble Getting to Sleep?</h2>
<p>There’s a super useful bonus reason to learn how to image stream. Not only can it improve your photography and potentially improve your intelligence it can help you fall sleep more easily!</p>
<p>To quickly and easily fall asleep, perform the technique in the way described in the video with one exception—rather than speaking the detailed descriptions of what you see out loud—say the words inside your head while you lie in your bed.</p>
<p>There’s no need for a voice recorder or friend! Doing image streaming in this way will send you to sleep quickly.</p>
<h2>Can Image Streaming Cure Aphantasia?</h2>
<p>If I had known that there is a ‘condition’ called aphantasia while I was college I would have asked to be tested for it. Its description seems to fit my experience.</p>
<p>However, the fact that I do now have a functioning mind’s eye means that either Image Streaming cured my aphantasia or I was never truly aphantasic. All I know is that I was never conscious of being able to see images in my mind’s eye until I practiced Image Streaming. Related or not, I was never conscious of dreaming when I was asleep either. I am now.</p>
<p>I’d love for this article to reach some true aphantasics and for them to practice the technique to see if it offers them any solutions. The great thing is that you don’t need to be able to see images to practice Image Streaming!</p>

In this blog post, the author talks about how certain social groups have a person who before you talk with them, someone will pull you aside and say, “Hey, listen, be careful around John. He can be&nbsp;touchy, so you probably shouldn’t let yourself be alone around him.”</p><p>The author of the blog post points out that this is a lot like people who pull you aside right before you go down the stairs to the basement and say, “Hey, be careful on the third stair. It’s broken, and if you step on it, you’ll go right through to the concrete floor.” Somehow, these people find it easier and more logical to warn every single person before they go down the stairs than to just fix the broken stair (which, in the case of John, would probably involve just banning him from parties). As the author of the blog post points out, this is pretty illogical. We should just fix the problem.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg" width="263" height="467.1403197158082" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1000,&quot;width&quot;:563,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:263,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Broken Staircase causes Serious Injuries - Adverse Inference for Failure to  Preserve Evidence Relati&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Broken Staircase causes Serious Injuries - Adverse Inference for Failure to  Preserve Evidence Relati" title="Broken Staircase causes Serious Injuries - Adverse Inference for Failure to  Preserve Evidence Relati" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed06a6e-c236-4f3d-9f2e-845ef9b3e3aa_563x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Yeah, you’re just gonna have to jump the last few steps and do an action roll. Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. You’ve seen Jackie Chan movies, right? Just do that.</figcaption></figure></div><p>But, unfortunately, there’s a big gap between “should” and “will”. Fixing a broken stair well enough that people can reliably stand on it takes money, time, and effort. Warning people about it takes only a tiny bit of time and effort. And, to be cynical about it, forgetting to warn someone about the broken stair is going to get people a lot less mad than trying and failing to fix the stairs. It’s easier just to let it lie, but, ultimately, worse for everyone.</p><p>I was thinking about this blog post recently as I once again dug into the mysteries of pharmacokinetics while traveling up my own drug development staircase. The drug development staircase is always rickety and some steps will never be that sturdy, but the pharmacokinetic stair seems particularly broken, and it frustrates me that it is.</p><p>Before I start complaining about it though, I should probably explain what pharmacokinetics is. Pharmacokinetics is the study of everything that happens to a drug when you put it in your body. So, if you’ve ever asked questions like “Why does my Advil take a few hours to work?” or “Why do I have to take a Claritin every 12 hours?” or even “Why does asparagus make my pee smell funny?”, well, those are all pharmacokinetic questions.</p><p><span>If you look on the Wikipedia page for pharmacokinetics, they make it seem very straightforward. They explain that the traditional acronym for understanding pharmacokinetics is LADME: </span><strong>l</strong><span>iberation, </span><strong>a</strong><span>bsorption, </span><strong>d</strong><span>istribution, </span><strong>m</strong><span>etabolism, </span><strong>e</strong><span>xcretion </span></p><p><span>. So, you ingest a drug; the active ingredient is “liberated” from the capsule or however it’s been contained; the active ingredient is absorbed into your bloodstream; your bloodstream distributes it around your body until it eventually ends up at your liver/kidneys; your liver metabolizes it; and then you excrete it in either solid or liquid form.</span></p><p>Like all good acronyms, LADME transforms the amorphous into the straightforward. You no longer have to ask “how does oral amoxicillin know to go to my infected toenail” or “why does my Claritin wear off after a while”. Amoxicillin is simply distributed around the body by your bloodstream and, at some point, it will reach your toe. Claritin lasts as it does because, at some point, it gets metabolized and then excreted out, at which point it’s no longer effective.</p><p>Thinking about things in terms of LADME also allows us to start diving deeper into individual topics, and makes them quantifiable. So, distribution and metabolism becomes Cmax, the maximum blood concentration that a drug reaches. Or, metabolism and excretion become t1/2, the amount of time it takes for the concentration of the drug in the bloodstream to reach half its maximum value.</p><p>&nbsp;None of this stuff is wrong and all of it is useful. I’ve used it myself in thinking about my company’s lead drug and how often and what level we should dose it. But, as I alluded to before, there are some real issues that pop up if you start digging into it.</p><p><span>The first big problem is that the numbers that we get when we do the math for Cmax, or t1/2, or AUCinf </span></p><p><span> are all descriptive, not predictive. We get these numbers by giving a bunch of people (or, if you’re Highway Pharmaceuticals, cats) some dose of the drug. We try to match these people up and make sure they’re all roughly the same weight, have eaten roughly the same food, aren’t on any drugs, and don’t have any health problems that would impact their organs. Then we measure the concentration of the drug in their bloodstream over a set series of timepoints, and do statistics from there.</span></p><p>This definitely provides us with some knowledge. But it’s also a lot like understanding physics by shooting a thousand ping pong balls from a cannon and measuring their height at a bunch of different time points. Yes, that would be somewhat informative. You could say stuff like, “Here’s the maximum height that an average ping pong ball reaches” or “Here’s the average distance that a ping pong ball shot from a cannon travels”. You’d be able to predict pretty well what would happen to the next ping pong ball that was shot from a cannon, and have a rough idea of what would happen to a watermelon.</p><p>But it’d be a stretch to try to go from there to figure out what would happen to a bullet shot from a pistol, and it’d be impossible to figure out what would happen to an asteroid slingshotted by a planet. These aren’t just simple extrapolations from existing data. In order to make these predictions, we have to understand the underlying processes.</p><p><span>To drug developers and pharmacologists, this isn’t surprising. They already know this. This is why they embark on their expensive pharmacokinetic trials in animals and humans when they develop a drug. It costs a lot of money to do these, nobody knows what’s going to happen before they run the trial, and bad results can sink a drug or at least take it back to the design phase </span></p><p><span>. Companies and the FDA try to avoid drugs with bad pharmacokinetics, which are not just drugs with really short half-lives, but often just drugs with unpredictable pharmacokinetics, like a cannon that sometimes shoots ping pong balls 1 foot and other times 100 feet.</span></p><p>And, for drugs with unavoidably bad/unpredictable pharmacokinetics, like cyclosporine (nb: the bad pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine are exactly what my startup is trying to fix), there’s a whole subfield of medicine called therapeutic dose monitoring, which is devoted to how much different drugs’ pharmacokinetics need to be monitored, how best to do it, and how to use predictive statistics to extrapolate from the fewest number of time points.</p><p>But this feels less like addressing the problem and more like just avoiding it or working around it. It’s like the classic broken staircase metaphor: if you start drug development, everyone will warn you about pharmacokinetics, and then it’s up to you to figure out your way around it with the right combination of consultants, drug design, etc. to bridge the gap.</p><p>It just seems crazy, though, that nobody is putting serious money into actually putting a stair into that gap. I mean yes, there is a small “physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling” community, which tries to model the whole LADME process as a bunch of differential equations, but they are, to put it politely, struggling. Their differential equations are on shaky ground, especially as they don’t even have human values for a lot of their diffusion constants. They have to rely on rat values from old papers for information on how, say, molecules are transported across liver membranes. This is very far away from being able to capture even the mean human pharmacokinetic experience, nevermind the diversity of actual experiences.</p><div><p><span>We could fix this stair. It would just require the raw data from a variety of pharmacokinetic trials, some in-depth experiments on human liver and gastric membranes, and some simulation of the physics of how different drugs diffuse into the bloodstream and across membranes. This would be difficult, but not impossible, and would not require any huge scientific advances. If it were done, it would likely save hundreds of millions, if not billions of pharma dollars each year, improve or even save the lives of the thousands of people who depend on therapeutic dose monitoring (e.g. every organ transplant recipient), and get us way closer to obviating healthy human trials altogether.</span></p><p><span>But, you know, it would require coordination and money. So, for now, we’re just going to keep on watching out for that stair, and woe unto anyone who plunges through. Hope you have health insurance!</span></p></div><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/pharmacokinetics-drug-developments?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Like this post?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Since my last article regarding the successful harnessing of tidal power to generate electricity, I have been researching what progress Portugal has made towards renewable energy production, and it’s impressive. Some authorities claim that this has now risen to 60%</p><div><p><b>No nuclear, no coal</b></p><p>Portugal has made significant strides in integrating renewable energy sources into its electricity generation. The country has taken advantage of solar power, tidal power wind generation, and hydroelectric power plants. Portugal is becoming a World leader in developing every form of energy independence. At the end of 2021, Portugal became coal-free after shutting down its 628MW Pego coal-fired power plant, privately owned by utility Tejo Energia. Pego's closure came just ten months after the shutdown of the 1,250MW Sines coal plant, owned by national utility EDP. No nuclear, no coal-produced power. Sometimes the progress passes our attention, but we should be aware of the significant progress Portugal is making. </p><p>Sustainable energy practices have become a key focus for many countries worldwide. With the increasing awareness of climate change, countries are looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint and transition towards renewable energy sources. Portugal has been a leader in sustainable energy practices, setting ambitious targets and implementing policies to achieve them. I have looked at Portugal's approach to sustainable energy practices, compare it to other EU countries, and look at the challenges faced by these countries in transitioning to sustainable energy.</p><p><b>Significant progress</b></p><p>Portugal has made significant progress towards achieving its renewable energy targets, with renewable energy sources accounting for 54% of its energy consumption in 2019. This is higher than the EU average of 18%. Latest figures claim that the figure is now at 60%. Portugal has also invested more in renewable energy sources than many other EU countries, particularly in wind and solar power. However, Portugal faces challenges in transitioning to sustainable energy practices, including the high cost of renewable energy projects and the need for infrastructure upgrades. Other EU countries face similar challenges, with some countries lagging behind in achieving their renewable energy targets.</p><p><b>More than a trend</b></p><p>Portugal seems to understand that sustainability is more than a trend, it is a vision towards the future. In the last decade, investing in this strategic development path has been seen more like a moral obligation for both entities and companies, as well as a way of achieving a positive advancement for their economy. Portugal has carried out remarkable progress in this field until becoming a country leader in the renewable energy transition. Quite an achievement for a small country.</p><p>In January 2022, 4,085 GWh of electricity were generated in mainland Portugal, where 63.64% came from renewable sources being 31.27% wind, 17.78% hydro, 6.99% bioenergy, 3.80% solar and 3.80 pumping. However, Portugal still remains reliant on imported gas, as the remaining 36.36% came mainly from natural gas, which accounted a 31.27%. All of Portugal's natural gas is imported, mainly from Algeria (via a pipeline that transits through Spain) and from Nigeria (LNG). We are not reliant on President Putin!</p><p>Portugal has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, aiming to achieve 80% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2030. To achieve this, Portugal has implemented several policies, including feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and subsidies for renewable energy projects. Portugal has invested heavily in wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, and now tidal power. In addition, Portugal has implemented energy efficiency measures, such as building codes that require energy-efficient buildings and the use of smart grid technology to manage energy consumption. </p><p>Energy-efficient buildings are a major factor for people, many of whom seem to believe that all construction is seriously inadequate in this area. This is simply not true. Older buildings were, and still are, very basic and subject to damp, cold and excess heat in the summer. But go back 100 years or more and look at traditional buildings. These are frequently built with very thick walls, and a minimum of windows, and are quite effective at keeping both warm and cool at the appropriate times of the year. If you are looking at an old farmhouse or country building, then you will need to look very seriously at bringing insulation up to date. Older local buildings do suffer from dampness, not least as they have no efficient ventilation. I live in a property about 15 years old, it has cavity walls filled with foam. We don’t have damp, it has double glazing as standard, although we needed to upgrade this, and is warm in the winter and cold in the summer, aided with efficient air conditioning with heat pumps, which are widely available. The UK is still trying to legislate to get homeowners to install heat pumps, but here in Portugal, these are standard. </p><p>Over the last ten years, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal – have seen the highest rate of heat pump installations, with the number of annual installations per household more than doubling over a decade.</p><p><b>Still reliant on imported electricity</b></p><p>Portugal still needs to import electricity, mainly from Spain. However, Portugal also exports electricity. In 2021, Portugal imported $1.47B in electricity, becoming the 18th largest importer of electricity in the world. In the same year, Electricity was the 7th most imported product in Portugal. Portugal imports electricity primarily from Spain ($1.47B). In 2021, Portugal exported $561M in electricity, making it the 32nd largest exporter of electricity in the world. In the same year, electricity was the 26th most exported product in Portugal. The main destination of electricity exports from Portugal are Spain ($561M). At least we sell back almost 50% of what we import. </p><p>It is frequently claimed that EDP is owned by the Chinese. This is far from true. On February 4th, 2022, China Three Gorges (Europe), S.A. notified EDP that, in accordance with article 16 of the Portuguese Securities Code, it had reached a qualifying shareholding correspondent to 20.22% of EDP’s share capital and of the respective voting rights. The 20% threshold was crossed by China Three Gorges (Europe), S.A. on February 1st, 2022. </p><p><b>Why is electricity so expensive, blame the tax man</b></p><p>Unfortunately, Portugal has some of the highest prices for electricity in Europe thanks to taxes. According to Eurostat, we pay €0.2246 per kWh here which is 22% higher than in the UK. The “taxes and charges” component in Portugal is one of the highest in Europe and practically doubles the final price of electricity compared to the base value in Portugal according to <a href="https://www.edp.com/en/edp-stories/electricity-price-portugal-and-europe">EDP</a>. </p><p>The other question frequently asked is why isn’t power from renewables cheaper? The simple answer to that is that the businesses that install and maintain them are not charities. They survive by making a profit, which seems reasonable. Also consider the capital investment needed to construct and install the units, be they solar, wind or even tide power. The old expression goes that there is no such thing as a free lunch. The sun wind and tides are free, but the equipment needed to harness what they produce isn’t. You may feel that the government should subsidise the equipment, but that would come from our taxes. </p><p>Whichever way you look at it, renewables are saving our planet, not our pockets.</p><hr><p><img src="https://www.theportugalnews.com/img/icons/pen.svg" width="32" height="32" alt="Author"></p><div><div><p>Resident in Portugal for 50 years, publishing and writing about Portugal since 1977.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've had the experience of
using GitHub as a maintainer for very large open source projects (1000+
contributors), as an engineer for very large closed source corporate projects,
and everything smaller. Through those experiences up to today, GitHub pull
requests is where I spend almost all of my time while on GitHub, and to me its
also unfortunately the most frustrating part of GitHub.</p>
<p>There are a lot of improvements I would love to see with pull requests,
but a massive chunk of my problems would be solved through
one major feature: <strong>changesets</strong>. This blog post describes this suggestion
and what I would love to see.</p>
<div><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> My ideas here are not original! I do not claim to have

<hr>
<h2 id="the-problem-today">The Problem Today</h2>
<p>The lifecycle of a GitHub pull request today is effectively one giant
mutable changeset. This is a mess!</p>
<p>Here is a typical PR today:
A contributor pushes a set of commits to a branch, opens a PR, and the PR now
represents that branch. People discuss the PR through comments. When the contributor
pushes new changes, they show up directly on the same PR, updating it immediately.
Reviewers can leave comments and the contributor can push changes at the same
time, and it all updates the same PR.</p>
<p>This has many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A reviewer can leave a review for a previous state the PR was in and
it can become immediately outdated because while the review was happening
the contributor pushed changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Worse, a review can become <em>partially</em> outdated and the
other feedback may not make sense in the context of the changes a
contributor pushed. For example, a line comment may say "same feedback
as the previous comment" but the <em>previous comment is now gone/hidden</em> because
the contributor pushed a change that moved those lines.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviews don't contain any metadata about the commit they were attached to,
only a timestamp they were submitted. A user can roughly correlate timestamp
to commit but it isn't totally accurate because if a commit comes in during
a review, the timestamp will seem to imply it was after the most recent
commit but your review may have been against the prior commit. 😕</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work-in-progress commits towards addressing review feedback become visible
as soon as the branch is pushed. This forces contributors to address all
feedback in a single commit, or for reviewers to deal with partially-addressed
feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can't easily scrub to prior states of the PR. If you want to review
a set of earlier commits while ignoring later commits, you either have
to manually build a "compare" view or use a local checkout (I do the
latter). But through either approach you only get the code changes,
you don't also get the point-in-time reviewer feedback!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to the above, if a contributor pushes multiple new commits, you
can't easily compare <em>the new set of commits</em> to the old. You can only
really scrub one commit at a time. For this, you again have to fallback
to local <code>git</code> to build up a diff manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And more... I talk about some more later, but I think I've made my point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p>I'm sure I'm wrong about some detail about some of the points above.
Someone is likely to say "he could've just done <em>this</em> to solve problem
5(a)". That's helpful! But, the point I'm trying to make is that if you
step back the fundamentals <em>causing</em> these problems are the real issue.
Namely, a single mutable changeset tracking a branch on a per-commit basis.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="changesets">Changesets</h2>
<p><strong>The solution is changesets:</strong> A pull request is <em>versionable</em>
through a monotonic number (v1, v2, ...).  These versions are often called "changesets."</p>
<p>Each changeset points to the state of a branch <em>at a fixed time</em>. These
versions are <em>immutable</em>: when new commits are pushed, they become part
of a new changeset. If the contributor force pushes the branch, that also
becomes part of a new changeset. The previous changeset is saved forever.</p>
<p>A new changeset can be published immediately (per commit) or it can be deferred
until the contributor decides to propose a new version for review. The latter
allows a contributor to make multiple commits to address prior feedback and
only publish those changes when they feel ready.</p>
<p>In the world of changesets, feedback is attached to a changeset. If a reviewer
begins reviewing a changeset and a new changeset is published, that's okay
because the review as an atomic unit is attached to the prior changeset.</p>
<p>In future changesets, it is often useful to denote that a file or line has
unresolved comments in prior changesets. This ensures that feedback on
earlier changesets is not lost and must be addressed before any changeset
is accepted.</p>
<p>Typically, each changeset is represented by a different Git ref. For example,
GitHub pull requests today are usually <code>refs/pr/1234</code> and you can use <code>git</code>
locally to check out any pull request this way. A changeset would be something
like <code>refs/pr/1234/v2</code> (hypothetical) so you can also check out individual
changesets.</p>
<p>Instead of "approving" a PR and merging, reviewers approve a <em>changeset</em>. This
means that the contributor can also post multiple changesets with differing
approaches to a problem <em>in a single PR</em> and the maintainer can potentially
choose a non-latest changeset as the set of changes they want to merge.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="github-please">GitHub, Please!</h2>
<p>Changesets are a well-established pattern across many open source projects
and companies. They're already a well-explored user experience problem
in existing products like Gerrit and Phabricator. I also believe changesets
can be introduced in a non-breaking way (since current PRs are like
single-mutable-changeset mode).</p>
<p>Changesets would make pull requests so much more scalable for larger
projects and organizations. Besides the scalability, they make the review
process cleaner and safer for both parties involved in pull requests.</p>
<p>Of course, I can only speak for myself and my experience, but this single
major feature would dramatically improve my quality of life and capabilities
while using GitHub<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>"Just don't use GitHub!" I've heard this feedback before. There are many

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Future Motion, the maker of the Onewheel electric skateboard, is recalling every one of them, including 300,000 Onewheel self-balancing vehicles in the US. <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2023/Future-Motion-Recalls-Onewheel-Self-Balancing-Electric-Skateboards-Due-to-Crash-Hazard-Four-Deaths-Reported">Alongside the US Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> (CPSC), the company now seeks to remedy the products after four known death cases — three without a helmet — between 2019 and 2021.</p><p>The recall comes a year after Future Motion took issue with the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/cpsc-deadly-warning-electric-scooters-recall-ignored">CPSC’s calls for recall</a> and claimed that it tested and found nothing wrong with the Onewheels. At the time, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-motion-responds-to-the-cpscs-unjustified-and-alarmist-claims-regarding-onewheels-301680207.html">issued a press release in objection to the CPSC</a> and called the agency’s statements “unjustified and alarmist.” </p><p>Now Future Motion is moving forward with a <a href="https://recall.onewheel.com/safety">voluntary recall</a> it chose not to do almost a year earlier. The company is asking owners to stop using their Onewheels until they take appropriate action. For the newer Onewheel GT, Onewheel Pint X, Onewheel Pint, and Onewheel Plus XR, a software update with a new warning system is the remedy.</p><p>For early adopters, however, the CPSC and Future Motion are telling owners to stop using and discard the original Onewheel and Onewheel Plus. We asked Onewheel chief evangelist Jack Mudd in an email how many of the original units are affected, but Mudd refused to answer. Mudd also wouldn’t tell us why the company claimed there were no issues and publicly resisted issuing a recall back in 2022.</p><p>Mudd did say that the software update for the other models is rolling out worldwide, not just in the US.</p><p>Some crashes occurred due to Onewheel skateboards malfunctioning after being pushed to certain limits. The Onewheel GT, Onewheel Pint X, Onewheel Pint, and Onewheel Plus XR will receive a firmware update that will add a new warning “Haptic Buzz” feedback that riders can feel and hear when the vehicle enters an error state, is low on battery, or is nearing its limits and needs to slow down.</p><p>“This update is the culmination of months of work with the CPSC,” reads the company’s recall website. Last November, it called the CPSC’s warning about Onewheels “misleading” but stated it would “work to enhance the CPSC’s understanding of self-balancing vehicle technology and seek to collaborate with the agency to enhance rider safety.”</p><p>To install the update, owners must connect their Onewheels to the accompanying app and run a firmware update — the process is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4loCxNoM6Yw">fully explained in a new video</a>.</p><p>For early adopters, however, owners can receive a “pro-rated credit of $100 to the purchase of a new board,” according to Mudd. The credit will only be issued after owners confirm that they have disposed of the old model.</p><p>Alongside Future Motion’s blink on the decision to recall Onewheel, the company <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKVYxN5MR5CU">shared a new video</a> on YouTube highlighting the new Haptic Buzz feature as well as best practices when riding. “We’ve been working closely with the CPSC for over a year in order to develop this new safety feature,” Mudd says in the video. He adds that ignoring pushback or Haptic Buzz “can result in serious injury or death.” It took engineers a while to whip up Haptic Buzz; perhaps it’s something that would not have been ready in a timely fashion after CPSC’s first whistle last year.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4830316179108208609" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
A key concept for a processor is the management of "state", information that persists
over time.
Much of a computer is built from logic gates, such as NAND or NOR gates, but logic gates
have no notion of time.
Processors also need a way to hold values, along with a mechanism to move from
step to step in a controlled fashion.
This is the role of "sequential logic", where the output depends on what happened before.
Sequential logic usually operates off a clock signal,<span id="fnref:asynchronous"><a href="#fn:asynchronous">1</a></span>
a sequence of regular pulses that controls the timing of the computer.
(If you have a 3.2 GHz processor, for instance, that number is the clock frequency.)</p>
<p>A circuit called the flip-flop is a fundamental building block for sequential logic.
A flip-flop can hold one bit of state, a "0" or a "1", changing its value when the
clock changes.
Flip-flops are a key part of processors, with multiple roles.
Several flip-flops can be combined to form a register, holding a value.
Flip-flops are also used to build "state machines", circuits that move from step to step
in a controlled sequence.
A flip-flops can also delay a signal, holding it from from one clock cycle to the next.</p>
<p>Intel introduced the groundbreaking 8086 microprocessor in 1978, starting the x86 architecture
that is widely used today.
In this blog post, I take a close look at the flip-flops in the 8086: what they do and
how they are implemented.
In particular, I will focus on the dynamic flip-flop, which holds its
value using capacitance, much like DRAM.<span id="fnref:cross-coupled"><a href="#fn:cross-coupled">2</a></span>
Many of these flip-flops use a somewhat unusual "enable" input, which allows the flip-flop
to hold its value for multiple clock cycles.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-flipflop/die-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The 8086 die under the microscope, with the main functional blocks.

<p>The die photo above shows the silicon die of the 8086.
In this image, I have removed the metal and polysilicon layers to show the silicon transistors underneath.
The colored squares indicate the flip-flops: blue flip-flops have an <code>enable</code> input, while red lack <code>enable</code>.
Flip-flops are used throughout the processor for a variety of roles.
Around the edges, they hold the state for output pins.
The control circuitry makes heavy use of flip-flops for various state machines, such as
moving through the "T states" that control the bus cycle.
The "<a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/01/the-8086-processors-microcode-pipeline.html#:~:text=a%20memory%20access.-,The%20loader,-To%20decode%20and">loader</a>" uses a state machine to start each instruction.
The instruction register, along with some special-purpose registers (<a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/03/8086-register-codes.html">N, M</a>, and X) are built with
flip-flops.
Other flip-flops track the instructions in the prefetch queue.
The microcode engine uses flip-flops to hold the current microcode address as well as to
latch the 21-bit output from the microcode ROM.
The ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit) uses flip-flops to hold the status flags,
temporary input values, and information on the operation.</p>


<h2>The flip-flop circuit</h2>
<p>In this section, I'll explain how the flip-flop circuits work, starting with a basic D flip-flop.
The D flip-flop (below) takes a data input (D) and stores that value, 0 or 1.
The output is labeled <code>Q</code>, while the inverted output is called <code>Q</code> (Q-bar).
This flip-flop is "edge triggered", so the storage happens
on the edge when the clock changes from low to high.<span id="fnref:polarity"><a href="#fn:polarity">4</a></span>
Except at this transition, the input can change without affecting the output.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-flipflop/d-flip-flop2.png"><img alt="The symbol for a D flip-flop." height="108" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-flipflop/d-flip-flop2-w150.png" title="The symbol for a D flip-flop." width="150"></a></p><p>The symbol for a D flip-flop.</p>
<p>The 8086 implements most of its flip-flops dynamically, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#Edge-triggered_dynamic_D_storage_element">pass transistor logic</a>.
That is, the capacitance of the wiring holds the 0 or 1 state.
The dynamic implementation is more compact than the typical static flip-flop implementation,
so it is often used in processors.
However, the charge on the wire's capacitance will eventually leak away, just like DRAM (dynamic RAM).
Thus, the clock must keep going or the values will be lost.<span id="fnref:minimum-clock-speed"><a href="#fn:minimum-clock-speed">3</a></span>
This behavior is different from a typical flip-flop chip, which will hold its value until the
next clock, whether that is a microsecond later or a day later.</p>
<p>The D flip-flop is built from two latch<span id="fnref:latch"><a href="#fn:latch">5</a></span> stages, each consisting of a pass transistor and an inverter.<span id="fnref:intel"><a href="#fn:intel">6</a></span>
The first pass transistor passes the input value through while the clock is low. When the clock switches high,
the first pass transistor turns off and isolates the inverter from the input, but the value persists due to the wire's capacitance (blue arrow).
Meanwhile, the second pass transistor switches on, passing the value from the first inverter through the second
inverter to the output.
Similarly, when the clock switches low, the second transistor switches off but the value is held by wire capacitance
at the green arrow.
(The circuit does not need an explicit capacitor; the wiring has enough capacitance to hold
the value.)
Thus, the output holds the value of the <code>D</code> input that was present at the moment when the clock switched from low to high.
Any other changes to the <code>D</code> input do not affect the output.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-flipflop/d-flip-flop-schematic.png"><img alt="Schematic of a D flip-flop built from pass transistor logic." height="103" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-flipflop/d-flip-flop-schematic-w350.png" title="Schematic of a D flip-flop built from pass transistor logic." width="350"></a></p><p>Schematic of a D flip-flop built from pass transistor logic.</p>
<p>The basic flip-flop can be modified by adding an "enable" input that enables or blocks the clock.<span id="fnref:enable"><a href="#fn:enable">7</a></span>
When the <code>enable</code> input is high, the flip-flop records the <code>D</code> input on the clock edge as before, but when the <code>enable</code> input is low, the flip-flop holds its previous value.
The <code>enable</code> input allows the flip-flop to hold its value for an arbitrarily long period of time.</p>

<p>The enable flip-flop is constructed from a D flip-flop by feeding the flip-flop's output back to the input as shown below.
When the <code>enable</code> input is 0, the multiplexer selects the current <code>Q</code> output as the new flip-flop D input,
so the flip-flop retains its previous value.
But when the <code>enable</code> input is 1, the multiplexer selects the new <code>D</code> value.
(You can think of the <code>enable</code> input as selecting "hold" versus "load".)</p>

<p>The multiplexer is implemented with two more pass transistors, as shown on the left below.<span id="fnref:mux"><a href="#fn:mux">8</a></span>
When <code>enable</code> is low, the upper pass transistor
switches on, passing the current <code>Q</code> output back to the input. When <code>enable</code> is high, the lower pass transistor switches on,
passing the <code>D</code> input through to the flip-flop.
The schematic below also shows how the inverted <code>Q'</code> output is provided by the first inverter.
The circuit "cheats" a bit; since the inverted output bypasses the second transistor, this output can
change before the clock edge.</p>

<p>The flip-flops often have a <code>set</code> or <code>clear</code> input, setting the flip-flop high or low.
This input is typically connected to the processor's "reset" line, ensuring that the flip-flops are initialized
to the proper state when the processor is started.
The symbol below shows a flip-flop with a <code>clear</code> input.</p>

<p>To support the clear function, a NOR gate replaces the inverter as shown below (red).
When the <code>clear</code> input is high, it forces the output from the NOR gate to be low.
Note that the <code>clear</code> input is asynchronous, changing the <code>Q</code> output immediately. The inverted <code>Q</code> output, however,  doesn't change until
<code>clk</code> is high and the output cycles around.
A similar modification implements a <code>set</code> input that forces the flip-flop high: a NOR gate replaces the first inverter.</p>

<h2>Implementing a flip-flop in silicon</h2>
<p>The diagram below shows two flip-flops as they appear on the die.
The bright gray regions are doped silicon, the bottom layer of the chip
The brown lines are polysilicon, a layer on top of the silicon. When polysilicon crosses doped silicon, a transistor is formed with a polysilicon gate.
The black circles are vias (connections) to the metal layer.
The metal layer on top provides wiring between the transistors.
I removed the metal layer with acid to make the underlying circuitry visible.
Faint purple lines remain on the die, showing where the metal wiring was.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-flipflop/flip-flop-die.jpg"><img alt="Two flip-flops on the 8086 die." height="274" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-flipflop/flip-flop-die-w700.jpg" title="Two flip-flops on the 8086 die." width="700"></a></p><p>Two flip-flops on the 8086 die.</p>
<p>Although the two flip-flops have the same circuitry, their layouts on the die are completely different.
In the 8086, each transistor was carefully shaped and positioned to make the layout compact, so the layout depends on the surrounding
logic and the connections.
This is in contrast to modern standard-cell layout, which uses a standard layout for each block (logic gate,
flip-flop, etc.) and puts the cells in orderly rows.
(Intel moved to standard-cell wiring for much of the logic in the the 386 processor since it is much faster to create
a standard-cell design than to perform manual layout.)</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The flip-flop with <code>enable</code> input is a key part of the 8086, appearing throughout the processor.
However, the <code>enable</code> input is a fairly obscure feature for a flip-flop component;
most flip-flop chips have a clock input, but not an enable.<span id="fnref:chips"><a href="#fn:chips">9</a></span>
Many FPGA and ASIC synthesis libraries, though, provide it, under the name
"D flip-flop with enable" or "D flip-flop with clock enable".</p>
