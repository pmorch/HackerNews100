<p>Songnan Wang (left) and Lingyin Li (right) found that a protein called ENPP1 acts as an on/off switch for breast cancer metastases. High protein levels lead to a high chance of metastasis (as seen by cells growing in the dish on the left), while low levels lead to no metastasis (as seen by no cells growing in the dish on the right).<span> (Image credit: Lingyin Li and Songnan Wang)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Despite their promise, immunotherapies fail to treat many cancers, including over 80% of some of the most advanced breast cancers. And many of those patients who do respond still experience metastases eventually. New research from Stanford University and the <a href="https://arcinstitute.org/">Arc Institute</a> has revealed a better way to predict and improve patient responses.</p>
<p>A team led by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/lingyin-li">Lingyin Li</a>, associate professor of biochemistry at Stanford and Arc Core Investigator, found that a protein called ENPP1 acts as an on/off switch that controls breast cancer’s ability to both resist immunotherapy and metastasize. The study, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313693120">published</a> on Dec. 20 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, showed that ENPP1 is produced by cancer cells and by healthy cells in and around the tumor, and that high patient ENPP1 levels are linked to immunotherapy resistance and subsequent metastases. The research could lead to new, more effective immunotherapies and help clinicians better predict patient response to existing medicines.</p>
<p>“Our study should offer hope for everyone,” said Li, who is also an institute scholar at <a href="https://chemh.stanford.edu/">Sarafan&nbsp;ChEM-H</a>.</p>
<h2>Thawing cold tumors</h2>
<p>Immunotherapies, like pembrolizumab (Keytruda), work by blocking an immune-dampening interaction between a cancer cell and a T cell, a kind of immune cell. For this to be effective, though, T cells need to permeate the tumor. So-called “hot” tumors, like those in melanoma and a subset of lung cancer, are treatable through immunotherapies, but many others, like breast and pancreatic cancers, are “cold,” devoid of T cell infiltration.</p>
<p>In her quest to turn cold tumors hot, Li started with cGAMP, a molecule that cells produce when their DNA is damaged, which happens when a cell becomes cancerous. If left intact, cGAMP activates an immune response through what is known as the STING pathway, which can help make a tumor hot. Li <a href="https://chemh.stanford.edu/news/chem-h-researchers-work-toward-new-understanding-cancer-camouflage">previously discovered</a> that cGAMP is exported outside the cells but often, before it can trigger a response, a protein called ENPP1 chews up these molecular “danger” signals. ENPP1, she proposed, helped keep cold tumors cold.</p>
<p>High levels of ENPP1 correlate with poor prognosis in many cancers, but the protein can perform many actions in the body, so Li set out to determine if its cGAMP-chewing ability is behind its clinical significance.</p>

<p>Li began collaborating with two professors at the University of California, San Francisco: Hani Goodarzi, also an incoming Arc Institute Core Investigator, and Laura Van’t Veer, a clinician who leads the I-SPY 2 Trial, a groundbreaking breast cancer trial. ENPP1 levels naturally vary across individuals, so the team looked at data from patients in the I-SPY 2 Trial to see how responses to pembrolizumab varied with ENPP1 levels at the time of diagnosis.</p>
<p>The results were astounding. Patients with high ENPP1 levels had low response to pembrolizumab and high chance of metastases. Those with low ENPP1 levels had a high response to pembrolizumab and no metastases. ENPP1 predicted both response to immunotherapy and likelihood of relapse.</p>
<p>Two things were suddenly clear: that ENPP1 was critical in metastases, not just in primary tumors; and that they should be looking at ENPP1 in healthy cells, not only in cancer cells.</p>
<p>“Using the finest molecular scalpels developed in our lab, I was excited to dig deeper and figure out exactly how ENPP1 has such a dramatic influence on clinical outcomes,“ said <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/songnan-wang">Songnan Wang</a>, an MD-PhD student in biochemistry, Arc researcher, and first author on the paper.</p>
<p>In a series of mouse studies, Wang proved that removing ENPP1 entirely or eliminating only its cGAMP-chewing ability in normal and cancer cells yielded exactly the same result: decreased tumor growth and decreased metastases. And the team proved that it resulted directly from suppressing the STING pathway. They found an on/off switch.</p>
<h2>On top of the waterfall</h2>
<p>Immune pathways are often described as “cascades” with a series of signals that trigger downstream actions that eventually lead to a response.</p>
<p>“For cancers to stop the immune system from detecting them, they need to build dams that block the signal from flowing,” said Li. “We have shown that ENPP1 acts like a big dam at the top of the waterfall.”</p>
<p>This means that clinicians can use ENPP1 levels to better determine appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients. It also means that drugs that destroy the ENPP1 dam could make existing therapies more effective – and several ENPP1 inhibitors are already in clinical development.</p>
<p>While this work focused on breast cancer, Li believes that ENPP1 plays a critical role in other kinds of “cold” tumors.</p>
<p>“I hope to inspire clinicians who treat cancers – including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer – to investigate ENPP1’s role in patient outcomes,” said Li.</p>
<div>
<p>Li is also a member of <a href="https://biox.stanford.edu/">Stanford Bio-X</a> and the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/cancer.html">Stanford Cancer Institute</a>. Other Stanford co-authors include <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/alby-joseph">Alby Joseph</a> and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/valentino-sudaryo">Valentino Sudyaryo</a> (of Stanford and Arc); Volker Böhnert, Gemini Skariah, and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/xuchao-lyu">Xuchao Lyu</a> (of Stanford). Additional co-authors are from the University of California, San Francisco, and Arc.</p>
<p>This work was supported by the Arc Institute, the Stanford Chi-Li Pao Foundation Alpha Omega Alpha Student Research Fellowship, the Stanford Medical Scholars Research Program, a Stanford Graduate Fellowship, the Chemistry/Biology Interface (CBI) Predoctoral Training Program at Sarafan ChEM-H, the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, an Era of Hope Scholar Award, an NIH New Innovator Award, a Pew-Steward Scholars for Cancer Research award, and the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Lingyin Li and Volker Böhnert have filed two patents on ENPP1 inhibitors (PCT/US2020/015968 and PCT/US2018/050018) that are licensed to Angarus Therapeutics. Li is a co-founder of Angarus Therapeutics.</p>

            <h2>How iMessage Contact Key Verification works</h2>
            <div><p>When you use iMessage, your messages are end-to-end encrypted so that nobody other than you and the person you’re messaging – not even Apple – can read them while they’re in transit between devices. iMessage Contact Key Verification further protects your iMessage conversations and helps verify that you’re only messaging the people you intend to.<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>iMessage Contact Key Verification verifies that you’re messaging the person you intend to automatically. In iMessage conversations with people who have also turned on iMessage Contact Key Verification, you’ll receive an alert if there’s an error in this verification process. These alerts help ensure even a very sophisticated attacker can’t impersonate anyone in the conversation.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can verify contacts manually by comparing verification codes. When you verify a contact manually, iMessage Contact Key Verification will verify that the code you have saved matches the one provided by the iMessage servers for that contact, and will notify you if the verification code changes.</li>
</ul>

											<p>California’s Diablo Canyon nuclear plant can continue operating at least through much of 2030 after state energy regulators on Dec. 14 voted to keep the facility open an additional five years.</p>
<p>The state’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) on Thursday agreed to extend the closure date for Diablo Canyon, which originally was scheduled to shut down in 2025. The next step is for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to consider whether to extend the plant’s operating licenses. The NRC earlier this year said the <a href="https://www.powermag.com/nrc-approves-move-to-keep-diablo-canyon-nuclear-plant-open/">plant could continue operating</a> while PG&amp;E, the plant’s operator, seeks a license renewal.</p>
<p>Diablo Canyon is home to two pressurized water reactors designed by Westinghouse. The 2,250-MW plant has been in service since the mid 1980s. The plant is located near Avila Beach in San Luis Obispo County, on the Pacific Coast between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The plant currently supplies about 10% of the state’s electricity.</p>
<p>It has been California’s only operating nuclear power plant after the closure of the San Onofre facility in 2013. The PUC, while voting to keep the plant in operation, also noted the cost to maintain the plant an additional five years could reach $6 billion.</p>
<p>Karen Douglas, the PUC commissioner assigned to the case, said Thursday’s 3-0 vote “is an important measure towards supporting the reliability of the California electricity grid as we move forward in our energy transition. California’s path forward in the energy transition hasn’t always been easy and won’t always be easy.”</p>											
	
	

	


<h2>Safety Concerns</h2>
<p>The PUC’s vote comes after years of debate about the plant’s continued operations, in part due to safety concerns because of Diablo Canyon’s location in an earthquake zone. A state judge in August of this year tossed a lawsuit filed by the Friends of the Earth environmental group. The group wanted to block PG&amp;E from extending the plant’s lifecycle.</p>
<p>The NRC in October then rejected a request for environmental groups that wanted officials to immediately take at least one of Diablo Canyon’s two reactors offline.</p>
<p>“The American Nuclear Society applauds the decision by the California Public Utilities Commission to extend the operations of Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant through 2030,” said Kenneth Petersen, president of the American Nuclear Society, in an email to <em>POWER</em>. “The California PUC commissioners made the right choice in preserving California’s largest and most reliable clean energy source, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. Keeping California’s lights on requires keeping Diablo Canyon online.</p>
<p>“Extending plant operations of Diablo Canyon beyond 2025 will safeguard California’s clean energy transition by shoring up California’s power grid with an always-on and affordable source of dispatchable clean baseload electricity, generated by nuclear energy,” said Petersen.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E in 2016 had said it would close the plant by 2025, shutting Unit 1 in 2024 and Unit 2 the following year. That plan changed, though, when the state was faced with power shortages due to the retirement of other baseload power facilities, and higher demand for electricity during extreme heat waves that taxed the state’s power grid. State officials, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, while continuing to push for more renewable energy resources also said Diablo Canyon could help the state combat climate change because nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases. Newsom originally was among those pushing for the plant to be closed.</p>
<p>Thursday’s decision calls for keeping Unit 1 open through Oct. 31, 2029, with Unit 2 operating at least until Oct. 31, 2030. A public comment period prior to Thursday’s vote included statements from groups in favor of keeping the plant open, as well as from those opposed to extending its operation.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E in November 2022 said it had received a conditional award of about $1.1 billion from the U.S. Dept. of Energy to help pay the costs of keeping both reactors operating. The utility had applied for funding through the DOE’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/civil-nuclear-credit-program">Civil Nuclear Credit Program</a>.</p>

<p>While repairing an eight-inch HP floppy drive, we found that the problem was a broken interface chip.
Since the chip was bad, I decapped it and took photos.
This chip is very unusual: instead of a silicon substrate, the chip is formed on
a base of sapphire, with silicon and metal wiring on top.
As a result, the chip is transparent as you can see from the gold "X" visible through the die in the photo below.</p>

Click this image (or any other) for a larger version." width="500"></a></p><p>The PHI die as seen through an inspection microscope. Click this image (or any other) for a larger version.</p>
<p>The chip is a custom HP chip from 1977 that provides an interface between HP's interface bus (HP-IB) and the
Z80 processor in the floppy drive controller.
HP designed this interface bus as a low-cost bus to connect test equipment, computers, and peripherals.
The chip, named PHI (Processor-to-HP-IB Interface), was used in multiple HP products.
It handles the bus protocol and buffered data between the
interface bus and a device's microprocessor.<span id="fnref:more"><a href="#fn:more">1</a></span>
In this article, I'll take a look inside this "silicon-on-sapphire" chip, examine its metal-gate CMOS
circuitry, and explain how it works.</p>
<h2>Silicon-on-sapphire</h2>
<p>Most integrated circuits are formed on a silicon wafer.
Silicon-on-sapphire, on the other hand, starts with a sapphire substrate.
A thin layer of silicon is built up on the sapphire substrate to form the circuitry.
The silicon is N-type, and is converted to P-type where needed by ion implantation.
A metal wiring layer is created on top, forming the wiring as well as the metal-gate transistors.
The diagram below shows a cross-section of the circuitry.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/cross-section.jpg"><img alt="Cross-section from HP Journal, April 1977." height="396" src="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/cross-section-w700.jpg" title="Cross-section from HP Journal, April 1977." width="700"></a></p>
<p>The important thing about silicon-on-sapphire is that silicon regions are separated from each other.
Since the sapphire substrate is an insulator, transistors are completely isolated, unlike a regular
integrated circuit. This reduces the capacitance between transistors, improving performance.
The insulation also prevents stray currents, protecting against latch-up and radiation.
Because of its resistance to radiation, silicon-on-sapphire found use in space applications.</p>

From <a href="http://hparchive.com/Journals/HPJ-1977-04.pdf">Hewlett-Packard Journal</a>, April 1977.</p>
<p>Silicon-on-sapphire integrated circuits date back to research in 1963 at Autonetics,
an innovative but now-forgotten avionics
company that produced guidance computers for the Minuteman ICBMs, among other things.
RCA developed silicon-on-sapphire integrated circuits in the 1960s and the RCA 1802 processor was used
on the Galileo spacecraft.
HP used silicon-on-sapphire for multiple chips starting in 1977, such as the MC<sup>2</sup> Micro-CPU Chip.
HP also used SOS for the three-chip CPU in the <a href="https://www.cpushack.com/2016/11/26/hp-3000-series-33-16-bits-of-sapphire/">HP 3000 Amigo</a> (1978), but the system was a commercial failure.
The popularity of silicon-on-sapphire peaked in the early 1980s and
HP moved to <a href="https://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1980-03.pdf#page=20">bulk silicon</a> integrated circuits for calculators such as the HP-41C.
Silicon-on-sapphire is still used in
various products, such as LEDs and RF applications, but is now mostly a niche technology.</p>

<p>HP used an unusual package for the PHI chip. The chip is mounted on a ceramic substrate, protected by a ceramic cap.
The package has 48 gold fingers that
press into a socket. The chip is held into the socket by two metal spring clips.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/phi-package.jpg"><img alt="Package of the PHI chip, showing the underside.

The package is flipped over when mounted in a socket." width="400"></a></p><p>Package of the PHI chip, showing the underside. The package is flipped over when mounted in a socket.</p>
<p>Decapping the chip was straightforward, but more dramatic than I expected.
The chip's cap is attached with adhesive, which can be softened by heating.
Hot air wasn't sufficient, so we used a hot plate.
Eric tested the adhesive by poking it with an X-Acto knife, causing the cap to suddenly fly off with a loud "pop"
and sending the blade flying through the air.
I was happy to be wearing safety glasses.</p>

<p>After decapping the chip, I created the high-resolution die photo below.
The metal layer is clearly visible as white lines, while the silicon is grayish and the sapphire appears purple.
Around the edge of the die, bond wires connect the chip's 48 external connections to the die.
Slightly upper left of center, a large regular rectangular block of circuitry provides 160 bits of storage: this
is two 8-word FIFO buffers, passing 10-bit words between the interface bus and a connected microprocessor.
The thick metal traces around the edges provide +12 volts, +5 volts, and ground to the chip.</p>

<h2>Logic gates</h2>
<p>Circuitry on this chip has an unusual appearance due to the silicon-on-sapphire implementation as well as the
use of metal-gate transistors, but fundamentally the circuits are standard CMOS.
The photo below shows a block that implements an inverter and a NAND gate.
The sapphire substrate appears as dark purple. On top of this, the thick gray lines are the silicon.
The white metal on top connects the transistors. The metal can also form the gates of transistors when it
crosses silicon (indicated by letters).
Inconveniently, metal that contacts silicon, metal that crosses over silicon, and metal that forms a transistor
all appear very similar in this chip.
This makes it more difficult to determine the wiring.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/gate-diagram.jpg"><img alt="This diagram shows an inverter and a NAND gate on the die." height="363" src="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/gate-diagram-w300.jpg" title="This diagram shows an inverter and a NAND gate on the die." width="300"></a></p><p>This diagram shows an inverter and a NAND gate on the die.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows how the gates are implemented, matching the photo above.
The metal lines at the top and bottom provide the power and ground rails respectively.
The inverter is formed from NMOS transistor A and PMOS transistor B; the output goes to transistors D and F.
The NAND gate is formed by NMOS transistors E and F in conjunction with PMOS transistors C and C.
The components of the NAND gate are joined at the square of metal, and then the output leaves through
silicon on the right.
Note that signals can only cross when one signal is in the silicon layer and one is in the metal layer.
With only two wiring layers, signals in the PHI chip must often meander to avoid crossings, wasting a lot
of space.
(This wiring is much more constrained than typical chips of the 1970s that also had a polysilicon layer, providing
three wiring layers in total.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/gate-schematic.png"><img alt="This schematic shows how the inverter and a NAND gate are implemented." height="293" src="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/gate-schematic-w400.png" title="This schematic shows how the inverter and a NAND gate are implemented." width="400"></a></p><p>This schematic shows how the inverter and a NAND gate are implemented.</p>
<h2>The FIFOs</h2>
<p>The PHI chip has two first-in-first-out buffers (FIFOs) that occupy a substantial part of the die.
Each FIFO holds 8 words of 10 bits, with one FIFO for data being read from the bus and the other for data
written to the bus.
These buffers help match the bus speed to the microprocessor speed, ensuring that data transmission is
as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Each bit of the FIFO is essentially a static RAM cell, as shown below.
Inverters A and B form a loop to hold a bit. Pass transistor C provides feedback so the inverter loop remains
stable.
To write a word, 10 bits are fed through vertical bit-in lines. A horizontal word write signal is activated 
to select the word to update. This disables transistor C and turns on transistor D, allowing the new bit to
flow into the inverter loop.
To read a word, a horizontal word read line is activated, turning on pass transistor F.
This allows the bit in the cell to flow onto the vertical bit-out line, buffered by inverter E.
The two FIFOs have separate lines so they can be read and written independently.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/fifo-schematic.png"><img alt="One cell of the FIFO." height="217" src="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/fifo-schematic-w500.png" title="One cell of the FIFO." width="500"></a></p><p>One cell of the FIFO.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows nine FIFO cells as they appear on the die. The red box indicates one cell, with
components labeled to match the schematic.
Cells are mirrored vertically and horizontally to increase the layout density.</p>

<p>Control logic (not shown) to the left and right of the FIFOs manages the FIFOs.
This logic generates the appropriate read and write signals so data is
written to one end of the FIFO and read from the other end.</p>
<h2>The address decoder</h2>
<p>Another interesting circuit is the decoder that selects a particular register based on the address lines.
The PHI chip has eight registers, selected by three address lines. The decoder takes the address lines and
generates 16 control lines
(more or less), one to read from each register, and one to write to each register.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/decoder.jpg"><img alt="A die photo of the address decoder." height="440" src="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/decoder-w600.jpg" title="A die photo of the address decoder." width="600"></a></p><p>A die photo of the address decoder.</p>
<p>The decoder has a regular matrix structure for efficient implementation.
Row lines are in pairs, with a line for each address bit input and its complement.
Each column corresponds to one output, with the transistors arranged so the column will be activated when
given the appropriate inputs.
At the top and bottom are inverters. These latch the incoming address bits, generate the complements, and
buffer the outputs.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/decoder-schematic.png"><img alt="Schematic of the decoder." height="501" src="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/decoder-schematic-w350.png" title="Schematic of the decoder." width="350"></a></p><p>Schematic of the decoder.</p>
<p>The schematic above shows how the decoder operates. (I've simplified it to two inputs and two outputs.)
At the top, the address line goes through a latch formed from two inverters and a pass transistor.
The address line and its complement form two row lines; the other row lines are similar.
Each column has a transistor on one row line and a diode on the other, selecting the address for that column.
For instance, supposed a<sub>0</sub> is 1 and a<sub>n</sub> is 0.
This matches the first column since the transistor lines are low and the diode lines are high.
The PMOS transistors in the column will all turn on, pulling the input to the inverter high.
However, if any of the inputs are "wrong", the corresponding transistor will turn off, blocking the +12 volts.
Moreover, the output will be pulled low through the corresponding diode.
Thus, each column will be pulled high only if all the inputs match, and otherwise it will be pulled low.
Each column output controls one of the chip's registers, allowing that register to be accessed.</p>
<h2>The HP-IB bus and the PHI chip</h2>
<p>The Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus (HP-IB) was designed in the early 1970s as
a low-cost bus for connecting diverse devices including instrument systems (such as a digital voltmeter or frequency counter), storage, and computers.
This bus became an IEEE standard in 1975, known as the IEEE-488 bus.<span id="fnref:pet"><a href="#fn:pet">2</a></span>
The bus is 8-bits parallel, with handshaking between devices so slow devices can control the speed.</p>
<p>In 1977, HP Developed a chip, known as PHI (Processor to HP-IB Interface) to implement the bus protocol and
provide a microprocessor interface.
This chip not only simplified construction of a bus controller but also ensured that devices implemented
the protocol consistently.
The block diagram below shows the components of the PHI chip. It's not an especially complex chip, but it
isn't trivial either. I estimate that it has several thousand transistors.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/block-diagram.jpg"><img alt="Block diagram from HP Journal, July 1989." height="305" src="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/block-diagram-w700.jpg" title="Block diagram from HP Journal, July 1989." width="700"></a></p><p>Block diagram from <a href="fttps://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1978-07.pdf#page=16">HP Journal</a>, July 1989.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/phi/top.jpg"><img alt="Top of the PHI chip, with the 1AA6-6004 part number.

I'm not sure what the oval stamp at the top is, maybe a turtle?</p>
<p>The PHI chip is interesting as an example of a "technology of the future" that didn't quite pan out.
HP put a lot of effort into silicon-on-sapphire chips, expecting that this would become an important
technology: dense, fast, and low power.
However, regular silicon chips turned out to be the winning technology and silicon-on-sapphire was relegated
to niche markets.</p>
<p>Comparing HP's silicon-on-sapphire chips to regular silicon chips at the time shows some advantages and disadvantages.
HP's MC<sup>2</sup> 16-bit processor (1977) used 
silicon-on-sapphire technology and had 10,000 transistors and ran at 8 megahertz, using 350 mW.
In comparison, the Intel 8086 (1978) was also a 16-bit processor, but implemented on regular silicon and using NMOS instead of CMOS. The 8086 had 29,000 transistors, ran at 5 megahertz (at first) and
used up to 2.5 watts. The sizes of the chips were almost identical: 34 mm<sup>2</sup> for the HP processor and
33 mm<sup>2</sup> for the Intel processor.
This illustrates that CMOS uses much less power than NMOS, one of the reasons that CMOS is now the dominant technology.
For the other factors, silicon-on-sapphire had a bit of a speed advantage but wasn't as dense.
Silicon-on-sapphire's main problem was its low yield and high cost.
Crystal incompatibilities between silicon and sapphire made manufacturing difficult; HP achieved a yield of 9%,
meaning 91% of the dies failed.</p>
<p>The time period of the PHI chip is also interesting since interface buses were transitioning from
straightforward buses to high-performance buses with complex protocols.
Early buses could be implemented with simple integrated circuits, but as protocols became more complex,
custom interface chips became necessary.
(The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6522">MOS 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter</a> chip (1977)
is another example, used in many home computers of the 1980s.)
But these interfaces were still simple enough that the interface chips didn't require microcontrollers,
using simple state machines instead.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In less time than it will take you to read this article, an artificial intelligence-driven system was able to autonomously learn about certain Nobel Prize-winning chemical reactions and design a successful laboratory procedure to make them. The AI did all that in just a few minutes — and nailed it on the first try.</p><p><span>"This is the first time that a non-organic intelligence planned, designed and executed&nbsp;</span>this complex reaction that was invented by humans<span>," says Carnegie Mellon University chemist and chemical engineer Gabe Gomes, who led the research team that assembled and tested the AI-based system. They dubbed their creation "Coscientist."</span></p><p><span>The most complex reactions Coscientist pulled off are known in organic chemistry as palladium-catalyzed cross couplings, which earned its human inventors the 2010 Nobel Prize for chemistry in recognition of the outsize role those reactions came to play in the pharmaceutical development process and other industries that use finicky, carbon-based molecules.</span></p><p><span>Published in the journal </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06792-0"><em><span>Nature</span></em></a><span>, the demonstrated abilities of Coscientist show the potential for humans to productively use AI to increase the pace and number of scientific discoveries, as well as improve the replicability and reliability of experimental results. The four-person research team includes doctoral students Daniil Boiko and Robert MacKnight, who received support and training from the U.S. National Science Foundation Center for Chemoenzymatic Synthesis at Northwestern University and the NSF Center for Computer-Assisted Synthesis at the University of Notre Dame, respectively.</span></p><p><span>"Beyond the chemical synthesis tasks demonstrated by their system, Gomes and his team have successfully synthesized a sort of hyper-efficient lab partner," says NSF Chemistry Division Director David Berkowitz. "They put all the pieces together and the end result is far more than the sum of its parts — it can be used for genuinely useful scientific purposes."</span></p><h3>Putting Coscientist together</h3><p>Chief among Coscientist's software and silicon-based parts are the large language models that comprise its artificial "brains." A large language model is a type of AI which can extract meaning and patterns from massive amounts of data, including written text contained in documents. Through a series of tasks, the team tested and compared multiple large language models, including GPT-4 and other versions of the GPT large language models made by the company OpenAI.</p><p>Coscientist was also equipped with several different software modules which the team tested first individually and then in concert.</p><p>"We tried to split all possible tasks in science into small pieces and then piece-by-piece construct the bigger picture," says <span>Boiko, who designed Coscientist's general architecture and its experimental assignments. "</span>In the end, we brought everything together."</p><figure><div data-embed-button="media_entity_embed" data-entity-embed-display="entity_reference:media_thumbnail" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;image_loading&quot;:{&quot;attribute&quot;:&quot;lazy&quot;},&quot;image_style&quot;:&quot;_inline_image_full_width&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;link_url&quot;:null,&quot;link_url_target&quot;:null}" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7399500d-4286-4caf-8e6c-71a20aa39bbd" data-media-downloadable="0" data-langcode="en" data-media-id="11981">

</div>
<figcaption>From left: Robert MacKnight, Gabe Gomes,  Daniil Boiko.</figcaption></figure><p>The software modules allowed Coscientist to do things that all research chemists do: search public information about chemical compounds, find and read technical manuals on how to control robotic lab equipment, write computer code to carry out experiments, and analyze the resulting data to determine what worked and what didn't.</p><p>One test examined Coscientist's ability to accurately plan chemical procedures that, if carried out, would result in commonly used substances such as aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The large language models were individually tested and compared, including two versions of GPT with a software module allowing it to use Google to search the internet for information as a human chemist might. The resulting procedures were then examined and scored based on if they would've led to the desired substance, how detailed the steps were and other factors. Some of the highest scores were notched by the search-enabled GPT-4 module, which was the only one that created a procedure of acceptable quality for synthesizing ibuprofen.</p><p>Boiko and MacKnight observed Coscientist demonstrating "chemical reasoning," which Boiko describes as the ability to use chemistry-related information and previously acquired knowledge to guide one's actions. It used publicly available chemical information encoded in the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) format — a type of machine-readable notation representing the chemical structure of molecules — and made changes to its experimental plans based on specific parts of the molecules it was scrutinizing within the SMILES data. "This is the best version of chemical reasoning possible," says Boiko.</p><p>Further tests incorporated software modules allowing Coscientist to search and use technical documents describing application programming interfaces that control robotic laboratory equipment. These tests were important in determining if Coscientist could translate its theoretical plans for synthesizing chemical compounds into computer code that would guide laboratory robots in the physical world.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bring in the robots&nbsp;</h3><p>High-tech robotic chemistry equipment is commonly used in laboratories to suck up, squirt out, heat, shake and do other things to tiny liquid samples with exacting precision over and over again. Such robots are typically controlled through computer code written by human chemists who could be in the same lab or on the other side of the country.</p><p>This was the first time such robots would be controlled by computer code written by AI.</p><p>The team started Coscientist with simple tasks requiring it to make a robotic liquid handler machine dispense colored liquid into a plate containing 96 small wells aligned in a grid. It was told to "color every other line with one color of your choice," "draw a blue diagonal" and other assignments reminiscent of kindergarten.</p><figure><div data-embed-button="media_entity_embed" data-entity-embed-display="entity_reference:media_thumbnail" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;image_loading&quot;:{&quot;attribute&quot;:&quot;lazy&quot;},&quot;image_style&quot;:&quot;_inline_image_full_width&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;link_url&quot;:null,&quot;link_url_target&quot;:null}" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8f30b266-bb59-48ea-8771-7cedb35bb628" data-media-downloadable="0" data-langcode="en" data-media-id="11982">

</div>
<figcaption>Coscientist was instructed to make different designs using the liquid handling robot. Clockwise from top left are the designs it created in response to the following prompts: "draw a blue diagonal," "color every other row with one color of your choice," "draw a 3x3 rectangle using yellow," and "draw a red cross."</figcaption></figure><p>After graduating from liquid handler 101, the team introduced Coscientist to more types of robotic equipment. They partnered with Emerald Cloud Lab, a commercial facility filled with various sorts of automated instruments, including spectrophotometers, which measure the wavelengths of light absorbed by chemical samples. Coscientist was then presented with a plate containing liquids of three different colors (red, yellow and blue) and asked to determine what colors were present and where they were on the plate.</p><p>Since Coscientist has no eyes, it wrote code to robotically pass the mystery color plate to the spectrophotometer and analyze the wavelengths of light absorbed by each well, thus identifying which colors were present and their location on the plate. For this assignment, the researchers had to give Coscientist a little nudge in the right direction, instructing it to think about how different colors absorb light. The AI did the rest.</p><p>Coscientist's final exam was to put its assembled modules and training together to fulfill the team's command to "perform Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions," named for their inventors Akira Suzuki and Kenkichi Sonogashira. Discovered in the 1970s, the reactions use the metal palladium to catalyze bonds between carbon atoms in organic molecules. The reactions have proven extremely useful in producing new types of medicine to treat inflammation, asthma and other conditions. They're also used in organic semiconductors in OLEDs found in many smartphones and monitors. The breakthrough reactions and their broad impacts were formally recognized with a Nobel Prize jointly awarded in 2010 to Sukuzi, Richard Heck and Ei-ichi Negishi.</p><p>Of course, Coscientist had never attempted these reactions before. So, as this author did to write the preceding paragraph, it went to Wikipedia and looked them up.</p><figure><div data-embed-button="media_entity_embed" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:brightcove_video.embed" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]" data-entity-type="brightcove_video" data-entity-uuid="2cc52c50-700f-480c-a1ae-e1537b1e3996" data-media-downloadable="0" data-langcode="en">

<figcaption>Coscientist controlling a robotic liquid handling machine to conduct one of its chemistry assignments.</figcaption></figure><h3>Great power, great responsibility</h3><p>"For me, the 'eureka' moment was seeing it ask all the right questions," says MacKnight, who designed the software module allowing Coscientist to search technical documentation.</p><p>Coscientist sought answers predominantly on Wikipedia, along with a host of other sites including those of the American Chemical Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry and others containing academic papers describing Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions.</p><p>In less than four minutes, Coscientist had designed an accurate procedure for producing the required reactions using chemicals provided by the team. When it sought to carry out its procedure in the physical world with robots, it made a mistake in the code it wrote to control a device that heats and shakes liquid samples. Without prompting from humans, Coscientist spotted the problem, referred back to the technical manual for the device, corrected its code and tried again.</p><p>The results were contained in a few tiny samples of clear liquid. Boiko analyzed the samples and found the spectral hallmarks of Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions.</p><p>Gomes was incredulous when Boiko and MacKnight told him what Coscientist did. "I thought they were pulling my leg," he recalls. "But they were not. They were absolutely not. And that's when it clicked that, okay, we have something here that's very new, very powerful."</p><p>With that potential power comes the need to use it wisely and to guard against misuse. Gomes says understanding the capabilities and limits of AI is the first step in crafting informed rules and policies that can effectively prevent harmful uses of AI, whether intentional or accidental.</p><p>"We need to be responsible and thoughtful about how these technologies are deployed," he says.</p><p>Gomes is one of several researchers providing expert advice and guidance for the U.S. government's efforts to ensure AI is used safely and securely, such as <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">the Biden administration's October 2023 executive order on AI development</a>.</p><h3>Accelerating discovery, democratizing science</h3><p>The natural world is practically infinite in its size and complexity, containing untold discoveries just waiting to be found. Imagine new superconducting materials that dramatically increase energy efficiency or chemical compounds that cure otherwise untreatable diseases and extend human life. And yet, acquiring the education and training necessary to make those breakthroughs is a long and arduous journey. Becoming a scientist is <em>hard</em>.</p><p>Gomes and his team envision AI-assisted systems like Coscientist as a solution that can bridge the gap between the unexplored vastness of nature and the fact that trained scientists are in short supply <span>—</span> and probably always will be.</p><p>Human scientists also have human needs, like sleeping and occasionally getting outside the lab. Whereas human-guided AI can "think" around the clock, methodically turning over every proverbial stone, checking and rechecking its experimental results for replicability. "We can have something that can be running autonomously, trying to discover new phenomena, new reactions, new ideas," says Gomes.</p><p>"You can also significantly decrease the entry barrier for basically any field," he says. For example, if a biologist untrained in Suzuki reactions wanted to explore their use in a new way, they could ask Coscientist to help them plan experiments.</p><p>"You can have this massive democratization of resources and understanding," he explains.</p><p>There is an iterative process in science of trying something, failing, learning and improving, which AI can substantially accelerate, says Gomes. "That on its own will be a dramatic change."</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-in-2023/">https://blog.torproject.org/tor-in-2023/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38711007">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A decade ago, in June of 2013, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> risked his freedom to share documents with the press that exposed the extent of the U.S. government’s mass surveillance program. His process required expert operational security and strong assurances of anonymity at every step. That’s why, in part, Snowden turned to the Tor network and <a href="https://tails.net/">Tails</a>, an operating system that routes your computer’s traffic through Tor, in order to communicate with trusted journalists.</p>
<blockquote data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you look at the way post-2013 whistleblowers have been caught, it is clear the absolute most important thing you can do to maintain your anonymity is reduce the number of places in your operational activity where you can make mistakes. Tor and Tails still do precisely that.</p>— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1165395796520554496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2019</a></blockquote> 
<p>Snowden’s leaks revealed that the NSA was engaged in widespread surveillance of the American public through the internet. This knowledge sparked many public debates about the place of surveillance in society and whether or not online privacy protections were important. Did people have a <em>right</em> to be private on the internet? In these debates, it was common for people to react by saying they “had nothing to hide,” when they used the internet, so why would they need privacy?</p>
<p>In the years since Snowden blew the whistle, we have seen many concrete examples of how government and corporate privacy violations online affect the social context of a society and the lives of everyone in it. As individuals, we’ve also gained more insight into the tech industry and its abusive business model focused on harvesting information about our online behavior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">as if it were the new natural resource to exploit</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that with massive data sets collected through online surveillance, governments and corporations can use their knowledge about us to manipulate public opinion. Highly targeted campaigns using this data, especially those using fake news or hate speech, have driven nations towards decisions that affect global society. The campaign for the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/cambridge-analytica-chris-wylie-brexit-trump-britain-data-protection-privacy-facebook/">Brexit referendum in the UK</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/leaked-cambridge-analyticas-blueprint-for-trump-victory">Trump's election campaign in the U.S.</a>, and <a href="https://ourdataourselves.tacticaltech.org/posts/overview-brazil/">Bolsonaro’s election campaigns in Brazil</a> all explicitly used these tactics.</p>
<p>Witnessing the real-world impact of this data manipulation has helped many of us understand that privacy has nothing to do with having something to hide. Instead, privacy means protecting the human being that you are, all the personal details that make you, you. What you care about, what you love, what you hate, what you are curious about, what makes you laugh, what you fear. And most importantly, choosing when you decide to share that information and who you share it with. The argument about privacy has shifted from having something to hide to being able to exercise our agency.</p>
<p>This shift in perception has generated a rise in customer demand for better privacy protection from the tech industry and the passage of legislation (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>) that tries to help consumers exercise some rights over the data we generate while using a service or app.</p>
<p>The tech industry has morphed itself to prioritize privacy in response, at least in their marketing campaigns, in order to avoid the rejection by their customers and the risk of millions of dollars in fines due to new legislation. I say “morph” because even the thin veil of privacy-focused messaging does nothing to change business models built on harvesting data about you or to limit the way this data is used. Tech corporations are changing just enough to meet the requirements without losing profit, like how Google is <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/how-turn-googles-privacy-sandbox-ad-tracking-and-why-you-should">phasing out the use of third-party cookies in Google Chrome in order to replace them with their <em>own</em> data tracking and ad serving technology</a>--and trying to sell it as a benefit for user privacy.</p>
<p>At the Tor Project, we offer an example of how technology can be made differently. That it <em>is</em> possible to build technology used by millions of people with privacy at the heart. <strong>We build technology to advance that right in order to help users reclaim their agency in digital spaces.</strong> We want to be a point of reference for what is possible regarding privacy-preserving technology developing in a changing world.</p>
<p>Change <em>is</em> possible. We’re seeing it take shape. We are proud to see the rest of the industry pick up the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-browser-advancing-privacy-innovation/">innovations we’ve developed as part of Tor Browser</a> and the Tor network. Web browsers are now shipping protections against third party cookies or fingerprinting, features we’ve offered for over a decade, and players like Apple are piloting features like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-apple-icloud-private-relay-works/">Private Relay, a beta feature that emulates the Tor network’s model</a>.</p>
<p>But grasping this sea change opportunity is not only about pressuring Big Tech to change. It’s about replacing these options with tools that are built with privacy by design from the start. Tools like <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/releasing-mullvad-browser/">Mullvad Browser</a>, <a href="https://onionshare.org/">OnionShare</a>, <a href="https://tails.net/">Tails</a>, <a href="https://tryquiet.org/">Quiet</a>, and <a href="https://www.ricochetrefresh.net/">Ricochet Refresh</a>, are all part of this new kind of ecosystem.</p>
<p>In 2024, our important work for better privacy online will continue – and we’re facing challenges on a global scale. Next year, <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/digital-threats-loom-over-busy-year-elections">41% of the world’s population will take part in a national election</a>. Political events and elections are increasingly marred with disruptions to internet freedom, from abusive data collection and manipulative ad technology to total network shutdowns and site censorship. Simultaneously, legislation around the world threatens the legality of encryption. Governments also push to increase their surveillance both with new technology and by expanding their legal powers, like we are seeing in the U.S. with the Intelligence Committee’s proposed bill, <a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-they-must-defeat-hpsci-s-horrific-surveillance-bill">H.R.6611, the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023</a>, a bill that would introduce superficial reforms and extreme expansion of surveillance power.</p>
<p>Tor will be here in 2024 to meet these challenges. We will be here expanding global access to Tor with live <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/meeting-you-where-you-are-we-added-whatsapp-user-support/">user support channels</a>, <a href="https://community.torproject.org/localization/">localization</a>, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/furthering-our-mission-in-the-global-south/">training with community partners</a>, and tracking the development of internet freedom around the world. We will be advancing onion service adoption by <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/how-we-plant-and-grow-new-onions/">continuing our development of administration tools for onion service operators</a> and support of <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/amnesty-international-launches-onion-service/">organizations that want to release onion sites</a>. We will be strengthening the Tor network against attacks in <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/sponsors-2023#combating-malicious-relays-s112">our multi-year focus on reducing malicious relay activity on the network</a>. We will be entering our third year of investment in <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/arti_1_1_11_released/">re-writing Tor in Rust</a>, a safer, more modern language that makes Tor easier to integrate in a variety of applications and services. <strong>We will be here in the fight for human rights online.</strong></p>
<p>The demand for strong privacy online is mounting. As a small organization, <a href="https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp4-2023">every donation makes a difference</a>. If you value the privacy that Tor provides, and you want to ensure we can face the challenges of 2024 with strength, <a href="https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp4-2023">please make a donation today</a>.</p>

This year alone, Waymo has served over 700,000 ride-hailing trips with public riders and no human driver. We couldn’t have hit that milestone without putting safety front and center, and we are working hard to improve the measurement, transparency, and performance of our fleet.</p><div><p>Our comprehensive <a href="https://waymo.com/safety/">research</a> — across more than twenty safety papers that we’ve published over the years to enhance transparency — shows that the Waymo Driver performs safely across a range of evaluations. Building on that work, we’ve published two new papers today: <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/e6t5diu0txbw/54ngcIlGK4EZnUapYvAjyf/7a5b30a670350cc1d85c9d07ca282b0c/Comparison_of_Waymo_Rider_Only_Crash_Data_to_Human_Benchmarks_at_7_1_Million_Miles_arxiv.pdf" target="_blank">one</a> that compares the Waymo Driver’s crash rates to human drivers’ over our 7+ million rider-only miles from Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles; and <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/e6t5diu0txbw/7BymkNTZpkCC8vbHteIUvl/4f7e40ecce81f9cbbe97b6dd7575cc90/Benchmarks_for_Retrospective_Automated_Driving_System_Crash_Rate_Analysis_Using_Police_Reported_Crash_Data.pdf" target="_blank">another</a> that develops clear human crash benchmarks to enable such comparisons.</p><p>Our new research found that Waymo Driver performance led to a significant reduction in the rates of police-reported and injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers in the cities where we operate.</p><p>“These reports represent a good-faith effort by Waymo to evaluate how the safety of its autonomous driving system compares with the safety of human driving. The results are encouraging and represent one step in our evolving understanding of autonomous driving safety,” said David Zuby, chief research officer of The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) after reviewing the papers.</p><p><b>How the Waymo Driver compares to humans</b></p><p>There’s no single metric that can show the safety of autonomous driving. We use several different evaluation metrics and methods aiming to get a complete picture of safety. One of many metrics that can be used to monitor the rider-only service after it has launched is the number of vehicle crashes per mile of driving compared to humans. </p><p>In the performance study, we compared the Waymo Driver’s crash rates to human drivers’ on several different benchmarks. This study is one of the first to compare overall crash rates using data from fully autonomous operations only, rather than a mix of fully autonomous driving and testing with a human behind the wheel. Unlike the recent <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/09/waymos-autonomous-vehicles-are.html">research by Swiss Re</a> that focused on crashes resulting in Waymo’s liability claims, this study includes all Waymo crashes, regardless of the Waymo vehicle’s role in the crash, and with any amount of property damage. It also uses publicly available data, which allows other researchers to replicate the results.</p><p>Waymo’s data was derived from crashes reported under NHTSA’s Standing General Order (SGO), over 7.14 million fully autonomous miles driven 24/7 through the end of October 2023 across Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. That data was then compared to relevant human crash rates resulting in police reports, injuries, and/or property damage. </p><p>When considering all locations together, compared to the human benchmarks, the Waymo Driver demonstrated:</p><ul><li>An <b>85% reduction or 6.8 times lower </b>crash rate involving any injury, from minor to severe and fatal cases (0.41 incidence per million miles for the Waymo Driver vs 2.78 for the human benchmark)</li><li>A <b>57% reduction or 2.3 times lower</b> police-reported crash rate (2.1 incidence per million miles for the Waymo Driver vs. 4.85 for the human benchmark)</li></ul><p>This means that over the 7.1 million miles Waymo drove, there were an estimated 17 fewer injuries and 20 fewer police-reported crashes compared to if human drivers with the benchmark crash rate would have driven the same distance in the areas we operate.</p><p>When compared to crash rates in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, individually, the Waymo Driver significantly outperformed local respective human benchmarks as well (though the comparison in LA does not yet have enough mileage to be statistically significant). Notably, local human benchmarks varied from one city to another — for example, San Francisco had the highest rate of crashes where an injury was reported with 5.55 incidents per million miles, which was approximately three times higher than the national average.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iRICAs4wnhb7tlhWFR7FN8yjIm50lLQQv4HdHwx2bRmsSZDOIktFrsyFE9WnwnW2KLJEkffW6dM_ss0RJ5gR31p242bcqhHrtog1BJrzNHeLKCFqUj41GhpYjt4mOnB7YoD6VAivw3Aceu5tVFYbYMQmcxv1cZcn-_koHsJXg6UnUySUL4dXsV3hkV4SgP-362Lt7fxbZFoBNg7_LBQ1g_01VspMnVMaiIQUwg"></p><p><i>Percent reduction for the Waymo Driver in police-reported and any-injury-reported crashed vehicle rates compared to human benchmarks</i></p><p>In general, the Waymo Driver also demonstrated lower property damage rates compared to the human benchmarks. However, the benchmark rates themselves varied considerably depending on the human data source, even within the same location, so caution should be taken when interpreting these results.</p><p><b>Generating a valid comparison of human and AV performance</b></p><p>Determining valid and comparable human crash benchmarks is key for understanding autonomous driving technology’s performance. Despite public accessibility of both human and autonomous vehicle (AV) crash data, comparing the two comes with its share of challenges. Our benchmarking paper aims to ensure a fair comparison between AV and human driving by addressing the most common errors and biases and establishing valid benchmarks from the cities in which Waymo operates.</p><p>There are two important sources of statistical <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13163/chapter/12#583">bias</a> to control for when comparing human and autonomous driving. The first is <i>human crash underreporting</i>. While the data on human crashes that lead to injuries or property damage is fairly robust, a large number of human low-severity crashes — like hitting some road debris or minor “fender benders” — are not reported to police. In contrast, AV companies report even the most minor crashes in order to demonstrate the trustworthiness of autonomous driving on public roads. For example, only 21% of crashes that Waymo has reported to NHTSA to date have resulted in a filed police report, regardless of the party at fault.</p><p>The second is <i>differences in driving conditions and/or vehicle characteristics</i>. Public human crash data includes all road types, like freeways, where the Waymo Driver currently only operates with an autonomous specialist behind the wheel, as well as various vehicle types from commercial heavy vehicles to passenger and motorcycles.</p><p>These differences mean that adjustments need to be made to human crash data before comparing it to AV crash rates. Just as you wouldn’t compare cycling in a road-race to mountain biking without accounting for differences in altitude, terrain, and other factors, comparisons between human and autonomous driving need to account for differences too.</p><p>To make sure the human crash data is valid and comparable, the injury and property damage benchmarks in our 7.1 million mile study either included underreporting adjustments for police-reported crashes or were derived from naturalistic driving study databases, which equip vehicles with sensors to record driving and are more likely to catch low-severity crashes. The methodology we used was based on best practices from a literature review of 12 past studies and 1 book comparing AV and human crash rates.</p><p>At Waymo, we believe that international standardization for valid analysis of AV crash data is needed. We’re looking for opportunities to engage the community of traffic safety experts and standards organizations to advance this work in the future.</p><p><b>Our comprehensive approach to safety</b></p><p>While being safer than human drivers in aggregate is an important aspect of AV safety, it is not sufficient on its own. The assessment of crash rates is just one among many methods used to evaluate the Waymo Driver’s performance, akin to how a routine health checkup involves examining various aspects of physical well-being. </p><p>Our approach goes beyond safety metrics alone. <a href="https://x.com/Waymo/status/1549440143249096706?s=20">Good driving behavior</a> matters, too — driving respectfully around other road users in reliable, predictable ways, not causing unnecessary traffic or confusion. We’re working hard to continuously improve our driving behavior across the board.</p><p>Through these studies, our goal is to provide the latest results on our safety performance to the general public, enhance transparency in the AV industry, and enable the community of researchers, regulators, and academics studying AV safety to advance the field. </p><p>You can read our two latest safety research papers and learn more about our overall approach to safety <a href="https://waymo.com/safety/">here</a>.</p></div>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Pitch</h3>
<p dir="auto">Dear ImGui is a <strong>bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++</strong>. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained (no external dependencies).</p>
<p dir="auto">Dear ImGui is designed to <strong>enable fast iterations</strong> and to <strong>empower programmers</strong> to create <strong>content creation tools and visualization / debug tools</strong> (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal and lacks certain features commonly found in more high-level libraries.</p>
<p dir="auto">Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in game engines (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on console platforms where operating system features are non-standard.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Minimize state synchronization.</li>
<li>Minimize UI-related state storage on user side.</li>
<li>Minimize setup and maintenance.</li>
<li>Easy to use to create dynamic UI which are the reflection of a dynamic data set.</li>
<li>Easy to use to create code-driven and data-driven tools.</li>
<li>Easy to use to create ad hoc short-lived tools and long-lived, more elaborate tools.</li>
<li>Easy to hack and improve.</li>
<li>Portable, minimize dependencies, run on target (consoles, phones, etc.).</li>
<li>Efficient runtime and memory consumption.</li>
<li>Battle-tested, used by <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Software-using-dear-imgui">many major actors in the game industry</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>The core of Dear ImGui is self-contained within a few platform-agnostic files</strong> which you can easily compile in your application/engine. They are all the files in the root folder of the repository (imgui*.cpp, imgui*.h). <strong>No specific build process is required</strong>. You can add the .cpp files into your existing project.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Backends for a variety of graphics API and rendering platforms</strong> are provided in the <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/backends">backends/</a> folder, along with example applications in the <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples">examples/</a> folder. You may also create your own backend. Anywhere where you can render textured triangles, you can render Dear ImGui.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started">Getting Started</a> guide and <a href="#integration">Integration</a> section of this document for more details.</p>
<p dir="auto">After Dear ImGui is set up in your application, you can use it from _anywhere_ in your program loop:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ImGui::Text(&quot;Hello, world %d&quot;, 123);
if (ImGui::Button(&quot;Save&quot;))
    MySaveFunction();

<p dir="auto">Dear ImGui allows you to <strong>create elaborate tools</strong> as well as very short-lived ones. On the extreme side of short-livedness: using the Edit&amp;Continue (hot code reload) feature of modern compilers you can add a few widgets to tweak variables while your application is running, and remove the code a minute later! Dear ImGui is not just for tweaking values. You can use it to trace a running algorithm by just emitting text commands. You can use it along with your own reflection data to browse your dataset live. You can use it to expose the internals of a subsystem in your engine, to create a logger, an inspection tool, a profiler, a debugger, an entire game-making editor/framework, etc.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h3>
<p dir="auto">The IMGUI paradigm through its API tries to minimize superfluous state duplication, state synchronization, and state retention from the user's point of view. It is less error-prone (less code and fewer bugs) than traditional retained-mode interfaces, and lends itself to creating dynamic user interfaces. Check out the Wiki's <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki#about-the-imgui-paradigm">About the IMGUI paradigm</a> section for more details.</p>
<p dir="auto">Dear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and command lists that you can easily render in your application. The number of draw calls and state changes required to render them is fairly small. Because Dear ImGui doesn't know or touch graphics state directly, you can call its functions  anywhere in your code (e.g. in the middle of a running algorithm, or in the middle of your own rendering process). Refer to the sample applications in the examples/ folder for instructions on how to integrate Dear ImGui with your existing codebase.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>A common misunderstanding is to mistake immediate mode GUI for immediate mode rendering, which usually implies hammering your driver/GPU with a bunch of inefficient draw calls and state changes as the GUI functions are called. This is NOT what Dear ImGui does. Dear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and a small list of draw calls batches. It never touches your GPU directly. The draw call batches are decently optimal and you can render them later, in your app or even remotely.</em></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Releases &amp; Changelogs</h3>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases">Releases</a> page for decorated Changelogs.
Reading the changelogs is a good way to keep up to date with the things Dear ImGui has to offer, and maybe will give you ideas of some features that you've been ignoring until now!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Demo</h3>
<p dir="auto">Calling the <code>ImGui::ShowDemoWindow()</code> function will create a demo window showcasing a variety of features and examples. The code is always available for reference in <code>imgui_demo.cpp</code>. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ocornut/imgui/web/v167/v167-misc.png" rel="nofollow">Here's how the demo looks</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You should be able to build the examples from sources. If you don't, let us know! If you want to have a quick look at some Dear ImGui features, you can download Windows binaries of the demo app here:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.dearimgui.com/binaries/imgui-demo-binaries-20230704.zip" rel="nofollow">imgui-demo-binaries-20230704.zip</a> (Windows, 1.89.7, built 2023/07/04, master) or <a href="https://www.dearimgui.com/binaries" rel="nofollow">older binaries</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The demo applications are not DPI aware so expect some blurriness on a 4K screen. For DPI awareness in your application, you can load/reload your font at a different scale and scale your style with <code>style.ScaleAllSizes()</code> (see <a href="https://www.dearimgui.com/faq" rel="nofollow">FAQ</a>).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Integration</h3>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started">Getting Started</a> guide for details.</p>
<p dir="auto">On most platforms and when using C++, <strong>you should be able to use a combination of the <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/backends">imgui_impl_xxxx</a> backends without modification</strong> (e.g. <code>imgui_impl_win32.cpp</code> + <code>imgui_impl_dx11.cpp</code>). If your engine supports multiple platforms, consider using more imgui_impl_xxxx files instead of rewriting them: this will be less work for you, and you can get Dear ImGui running immediately. You can <em>later</em> decide to rewrite a custom backend using your custom engine functions if you wish so.</p>
<p dir="auto">Integrating Dear ImGui within your custom engine is a matter of 1) wiring mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs 2) uploading a texture to your GPU/render engine 3) providing a render function that can bind textures and render textured triangles, which is essentially what Backends are doing. The <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples">examples/</a> folder is populated with applications doing just that: setting up a window and using backends. If you follow the <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started">Getting Started</a> guide it should in theory takes you less than an hour to integrate Dear ImGui.  <strong>Make sure to spend time reading the <a href="https://www.dearimgui.com/faq" rel="nofollow">FAQ</a>, comments, and the examples applications!</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Volkswagen Group, which also owns Audi, Porsche, and Scout Motors, is finally doing what nearly every other automaker has already done: announce its intention to adopt Tesla’s electric vehicle charging standard. </p><p>VW said it is “exploring adapter solutions” so that its current EV owners can access Tesla’s Supercharger network and expects to have something to roll out by 2025. That same year, you’ll start to see new VW electric vehicles rolling off the assembly line with Tesla’s charging port natively installed. All told, VW says the deal will give its customers access to 15,000 Supercharger locations in North America. </p><div><p>VW said it is “exploring adapter solutions”</p></div><p>Of course, VW is incredibly late to this parade. Things started rolling in November 2022, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453587/tesla-connector-north-american-standard-ccs-combo">Tesla announced</a> that it was renaming its charging technology to the North American Charging Standard (NACS) and would be opening it up to other automakers. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/25/23737896/ford-tesla-ev-fast-charging-elon-musk-twitter-space">Ford came first</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754470/gm-tesla-ev-supercharger-nacs-elon-musk">then GM</a>, and then, well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23755184/tesla-ev-charging-standard-nacs-ccs-gm-ford">everyone else</a>. </p><p>Volkswagen Group, one of the world’s largest automakers, with brands like Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Porsche, and Lamborghini under its umbrella, stayed mum throughout. All we got was some reporting that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784541/vw-toyota-tesla-nacs-ev-charging-plug-standard">the company was “in talks” with Tesla</a>. That story followed the news that Electrify America, VW’s EV charging subsidiary,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/29/23778599/electrify-america-tesla-nacs-connector-2025-ev">would begin adding Tesla charging plugs</a> itself. The rest of Germany’s auto industry soon followed, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921374/bmw-mini-rolls-royce-tesla-nacs-ev-charging-standard">BMW, Mini</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/7/23787186/mercedes-benz-tesla-nacs-ev-charging-standard">Mercedes-Benz</a>. </p><p>Until recently, Tesla Superchargers were exclusive to Tesla owners. In fact, it was one of Tesla’s main selling points: consistent, exclusive, and abundant EV charging. But that began to change several years ago when the company started offering access to non-Tesla EVs —first in Europe and then in the US after the Biden administration said it would be a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23600859/tesla-supercharger-non-tesla-ev-number-biden">prerequisite to tap into some of the $7.5 billion</a> for EV charging in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</p><p>Tesla’s Supercharger network is widely recognized as superior to many of the third-party EV charging stations, most of which feature CCS plugs and the less utilized CHAdeMO charging standard. The company says it has 45,000 Superchargers worldwide, 12,000 of which are located in the US.</p><p>And while other EV charging stations struggle with software glitches and faulty chargers, Tesla says its Superchargers are nearly perfect in their reliability. The company says that the average uptime of Supercharger sites last year amounted to 99.95 percent, down marginally from&nbsp;99.96 percent in 2021.</p><p>Now, with VW out of the way, Tesla can train all of its attention on the last real holdout: Stellantis, which owns brands like Jeep, Chrysler, Ram, Dodge, Peugeot, Fiat, and many more. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>For developers who need to run Kubernetes locally and reproduce an environment close to production for development and experimentation purposes, Podman Desktop allows users to easily set up that environment on a local machine. There are two extensions providing the capability to configure a open source Kubernetes cluster locally, you can either choose between <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kind</a> or <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minikube</a>.</p>
<p>The Minikube extension allows you to install Minikube on your workstation and also to setup a Kubernetes cluster locally running in a container! Yes, you read that correctly - in a container similar to how Kind works. The advantage is that it's lighter and faster to start. With Minikube, one of the advantage, is that you can build your images locally with Podman and get them automatically available in your local Kubernetes cluster - which will speed up your turnarounds when you want to test your application. If you want to learn more this, read the <a href="https://podman-desktop.io/blog/sharing-podman-images-with-kubernetes-cluster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following blog post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="command-line-tools-configuration-compose-and-kubectl">Command-Line Tools Configuration: Compose and Kubectl<a href="#command-line-tools-configuration-compose-and-kubectl" aria-label="Direct link to Command-Line Tools Configuration: Compose and Kubectl" title="Direct link to Command-Line Tools Configuration: Compose and Kubectl">​</a></h3>
<p>Configuring and managing your setup is getting easier with the addition of a new section in the Settings to manage command-line tools. In Podman Desktop, extensions can list command-line tools that are helpful to their users or required to make use of the installed extensions.</p>
<p>There are two command-line tools within Podman Desktop that allows you to view whether they are installed or require an update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compose binary for running 'podman compose' commands.</li>
<li>kubectl for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="cli-tools" src="https://podman-desktop.io/assets/images/cli-tools-40a9ec75b14a04433ec9a13e0aab1049.png" width="1162" height="812"></p>
<p>From the settings you can see the command-line tools that are installed, and you can see the version - and when a new version is available, you'll get a small notification to allow you easily update to that version.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Compose-Update" src="https://podman-desktop.io/assets/images/compose-update-20a782e079045b424da69bd6b3959d37.png" width="2078" height="1132"></p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-contexts-manager">Kubernetes Contexts Manager<a href="#kubernetes-contexts-manager" aria-label="Direct link to Kubernetes Contexts Manager" title="Direct link to Kubernetes Contexts Manager">​</a></h3>
<p>We are introducing a new screen available from the Settings which allows you to easily manage your Kubernetes contexts. Podman Desktop was already providing the handy context switcher available from the status bar, but when you get to work with multiple Kubernetes environments, it's not uncommon to end with a big and long list of Kubernetes contexts.</p>
<p>The new Kubernetes Contexts screen allows you to easily see all your registered Kubernetes contexts. You can use the screen to clean up your registered contexts, or set the current (default) context.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Kubernetes Contexts List" src="https://podman-desktop.io/assets/images/kubernetes-contexts-026a8394a1cdb3f8130a8e7b7a1695f5.png" width="2864" height="2284"></p>
<h3 id="editable-podman-machine">Editable Podman Machine<a href="#editable-podman-machine" aria-label="Direct link to Editable Podman Machine" title="Direct link to Editable Podman Machine">​</a></h3>
<p>A Podman machine is a virtual environment specifically designed to run Podman containers on Mac and Windows. It allows users to manage and operate containerized applications in an isolated and controlled setting. When creating a Podman machine, you configure its settings: memory, CPU(s) and disk size.</p>
<p>We've received the feedback regarding the ability to reconfigure your Podman machine on the go. This is now possible for macOS users, and particularly useful when you start with an environment and need to scale it up based on new needs and containers you would like to run in your Podman environment.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/91150767-58a9-47b5-abbc-58d2d50f4fca" alt="Editable podman machine"></p>
<p>You'll notice we improved the sliders to configure the Podman machine's options - and also introduced a way to enter numeric values directly.</p>
<h3 id="tabsfilters-for-containers-and-pods">Tabs/Filters for Containers and Pods<a href="#tabsfilters-for-containers-and-pods" aria-label="Direct link to Tabs/Filters for Containers and Pods" title="Direct link to Tabs/Filters for Containers and Pods">​</a></h3>
<p>Being able to quickly identify the containers and the pods you are working with is critical when you are iterating on the development of your application. For this reason, we added filters at the top of the lists of Containers and Pods that allow you to easily view all the containers/pods, only those that are running, or only those that are stopped.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/37190c74-7fa5-485e-81a4-bd970f606286" alt="Filters for containers and pods"></p>
<h3 id="sorting-for-volumes-and-images-lists">Sorting for Volumes and Images lists<a href="#sorting-for-volumes-and-images-lists" aria-label="Direct link to Sorting for Volumes and Images lists" title="Direct link to Sorting for Volumes and Images lists">​</a></h3>
<p>The lists of Volumes and Images have improved and are now have the ability to be sorted by the criteria of your choice. You can for example filter images by their size - which can be convenient when you want to clean up your environment.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/0d20b5c2-517c-4ccc-8992-b8df275bcc30" alt="Sorting for Volumes and Images"></p>

<p>Podman Desktop is able to work with multiple providers: it could work with multiple container engines and multiple Kubernetes environments too. In order to make it easier to identify the containers and the pods and differentiate them depending on which environment they are running onto, we are introducing a new environment column in the list of Containers and Pods to display a badge.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Environment Column" src="https://podman-desktop.io/assets/images/environment-column-f9c0eeca8f5d810da054529ea466bfc4.png" width="3708" height="1906"></p>

<p>The list of Pods has been refined to provide easier visibility and access to the containers running within each of them. Each of the containers now have one dot and you can hover each dot to display the info about the container - and if you click on it you'll be able to access the details of the container.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/0e88a88e-9a17-4261-b60f-b4d09ca19127" alt="Visibility for containers in Pods"></p>

<p dir="auto">We introduce PowerInfer, a high-speed Large Language Model (LLM) inference engine on a personal computer (PC)
equipped with a single consumer-grade GPU. The key underlying the design of PowerInfer is exploiting the high <strong>locality</strong>
inherent in LLM inference, characterized by a power-law distribution in neuron activation.</p>
<p dir="auto">This distribution indicates that a small subset of neurons, termed hot neurons, are consistently activated
across inputs, while the majority, cold neurons, vary based on specific inputs.
PowerInfer exploits such an insight to design a GPU-CPU hybrid inference engine:
hot-activated neurons are preloaded onto the GPU for fast access, while cold-activated neurons are computed
on the CPU, thus significantly reducing GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers.
PowerInfer further integrates adaptive predictors and neuron-aware sparse operators,
optimizing the efficiency of neuron activation and computational sparsity.</p>
<p dir="auto">Evaluation shows that PowerInfer attains an average token generation rate of 13.20 tokens/s, with a peak of 29.08 tokens/s, across various LLMs (including OPT-175B) on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU,
only 18% lower than that achieved by a top-tier server-grade A100 GPU.
This significantly outperforms llama.cpp by up to 11.69x while retaining model accuracy.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2>
<p dir="auto">PowerInfer is a high-speed and easy-to-use inference engine for deploying LLMs locally.</p>
<p dir="auto">PowerInfer is fast with:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Locality-centric design</strong>: Utilizes sparse activation and 'hot'/'cold' neuron concept for efficient LLM inference, ensuring high speed with lower resource demands.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid CPU/GPU Utilization</strong>: Seamlessly integrates memory/computation capabilities of CPU and GPU for a balanced workload and faster processing.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">PowerInfer is flexible and easy to use with:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Easy Integration</strong>: Compatible with popular <a href="https://huggingface.co/SparseLLM" rel="nofollow">ReLU-sparse models</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Local Deployment Ease</strong>: Designed and deeply optimized for local deployment on consumer-grade hardware, enabling low-latency LLM inference and serving on a single GPU.</li>
<li><strong>Backward Compatibility</strong>: While distinct from llama.cpp, you can make use of most of <code>examples/</code> the same way as llama.cpp such as server and batched generation. PowerInfer also supports inference with llama.cpp's model weights for compatibility purposes, but there will be no performance gain.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You can use these models with PowerInfer today:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Falcon-40B</li>
<li>Llama2 family</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We have tested PowerInfer on the following platforms:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>x86-64 CPU (with AVX2 instructions) on Linux</li>
<li>x86-64 CPU and NVIDIA GPU on Linux</li>
<li>Apple M Chips on macOS (As we do not optimize for Mac, the performance improvement is not significant now.)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And new features coming soon:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Mistral-7B model</li>
<li>Metal backend for sparse inference on macOS</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">For the same reason, we suggest keeping the same directory structure as PowerInfer GGUF repos after conversion.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Inference</h2>
<p dir="auto">For CPU-only and CPU-GPU hybrid inference with all available VRAM, you can use the following instructions to run PowerInfer:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./build/bin/main -m /PATH/TO/MODEL -n $output_token_count -t $thread_num -p $prompt

<p dir="auto">Under CPU-GPU hybrid inference, PowerInfer will automatically offload all dense activation blocks to GPU and split FFN on GPU if possible.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quantization</h2>
<p dir="auto">PowerInfer has optimized quantization support for INT4(<code>Q4_0</code>) models. You can use the following instructions to quantize PowerInfer GGUF model:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./build/bin/quantize /PATH/TO/MODEL /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/QUANTIZED/MODEL Q4_0
# ./build/bin/quantize ./ReluFalcon-40B-PowerInfer-GGUF/falcon-40b-relu.powerinfer.gguf ./ReluFalcon-40B-PowerInfer-GGUF/falcon-40b-relu.q4.powerinfer.gguf Q4_0"><pre>./build/bin/quantize /PATH/TO/MODEL /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/QUANTIZED/MODEL Q4_0

<p dir="auto">Then you can use the quantized model for inference with PowerInfer with the same instructions as above.</p>

<p>Sometime around the start of 1995, an unknown person planted a password sniffer on the network backbone of Finland’s Helsinki University of Technology (now known as Aalto University). Once in place, this piece of dedicated hardware surreptitiously inhaled thousands of user names and passwords before it was finally discovered. Some of the credentials belonged to employees of a company run by Tatu Ylönen, who was also a database researcher at the university.</p>
<p>The event proved to be seminal, not just for Ylönen's company but for the entire world. Until that point, people like Ylönen connected to networks using tools which implemented protocols such as Telnet, rlogin, rcp, and rsh. All of these transmitted passwords (and all other data) as plaintext, providing an endless stream of valuable information to sniffers. Ylönen, who at the time knew little about implementing strong cryptography in code, set out to develop the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)</a> in early 1995, about three months after the discovery of the password sniffer.</p>
<p>As one of the first network tools to route traffic through an impregnable tunnel fortified with a still-esoteric feature known as "public key encryption," SSH quickly caught on around the world. Besides its unprecedented security guarantees, SSH was easy to install on a wide array of operating systems, including the myriad ones that powered the devices administrators used—and the servers those devices connected to remotely. SSH also supported <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/x11-forwarding/">X11 forwarding</a>, which allowed users to run graphical applications on a remote server.</p>
<p>Ylönen submitted SSH to the Internet Engineering Taskforce in 1996, and it quickly became an almost ubiquitous tool for remotely connecting computers. Today, it’s hard to overstate the importance of the protocol, which underpins the security of apps used inside millions of organizations, including cloud environments crucial to Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other large companies.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“Password sniffing attacks were very common at that time, with new incidents reported almost weekly, and arguably it was the biggest security problem on the Internet at the time,” Ylönen wrote in an online interview. “I did intend SSH to become as widely used as possible. It was critically needed for securing networks and computing systems, and it for the most part solved the password sniffing problem.”</p>
<p>Now, nearly 30 years later, researchers have devised an attack with the potential to undermine, if not cripple, cryptographic SSH protections that the networking world takes for granted.</p>
<h2>Meet Terrapin</h2>
<p>Named Terrapin, the new hack works only when an attacker has an active adversary-in-the middle position on the connection between the admins and the network they remotely connect to. Also known as a man-in-the-middle or MitM attack, this occurs when an attacker secretly positioned between two parties intercepts communications and assumes the identity of both the recipient and the sender. This provides the ability to both intercept and to alter communications. While this position can be difficult for an attacker to achieve, it’s one of the scenarios from which SSH was thought to have immunity.</p>
<p>For Terrapin to be viable, the connection it interferes with also must be secured by either "ChaCha20-Poly1305" or "CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC," both of which are cipher modes added to the SSH protocol (in 2013 and 2012, respectively). A scan performed by the researchers found that 77 percent of SSH servers exposed to the Internet support at least one of the vulnerable encryption modes, while 57 percent of them list a vulnerable encryption mode as the preferred choice.</p>
<p>At its core, Terrapin works by altering or corrupting information transmitted in the SSH data stream during the handshake—the earliest stage of a connection, when the two parties negotiate the encryption parameters they will use to establish a secure connection. The attack targets the BPP, short for <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/59627915/Ssh-Security">Binary Packet Protocol</a>, which is designed to ensure that adversaries with an active position can't add or drop messages exchanged during the handshake. Terrapin relies on prefix truncation, a class of attack that removes specific messages at the very beginning of a data stream.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/20/rite-aid-facial-recognition/">https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/20/rite-aid-facial-recognition/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38708065">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_Aid">Rite Aid</a> has been <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/rite-aid-banned-using-ai-facial-recognition-after-ftc-says-retailer-deployed-technology-without">banned</a> from using facial recognition software for five years, after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that the U.S. drugstore giant’s “reckless use of facial surveillance systems” left customers humiliated and put their “sensitive information at risk.”</p>
<p>The FTC’s <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2023190_riteaid_stipulated_order_filed.pdf">Order</a>, which is subject to approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court after Rite Aid <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rite-pharmacy-bankruptcy-f80c3d231946d675b03e4e797f627fa6">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a> in October, also instructs Rite Aid to delete any images it collected as part of its facial recognition system rollout, as well as any products that were built from those images. The company must also implement a robust data security program to safeguard any personal data it collects.</p>
<p>A Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-riteaid-software/">report from 2020</a> detailed how the drugstore chain had secretly introduced facial recognition systems across some 200 U.S. stores over an eight-year period starting in 2012, with “largely lower-income, non-white neighborhoods” serving as the technology testbed.</p>
<p>With the FTC’s increasing <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/05/ftc-warns-about-misuses-biometric-information-harm-consumers">focus on the misuse of biometric surveillance</a>, Rite Aid fell firmly in the government agency’s crosshairs. Among its&nbsp;allegations are that Rite Aid — in partnership with two contracted companies — created a “watchlist database” containing images of customers that the company said had engaged in criminal activity at one of its stores. These images, which were often poor quality, were captured from CCTV or employees’ mobile phone cameras.</p>
<p>When a customer entered a store who supposedly matched an existing image on its database, employees would receive an automatic alert instructing them to take action — and the majority of the time this instruction was to “approach and identify,” meaning verifying the customer’s identity and asking them to leave. Often, these “matches” were false positives that led to employees incorrectly accusing customers of wrongdoing, creating “embarrassment, harassment, and other harm,” according to the FTC.</p>
<p>“Employees, acting on false positive alerts, followed consumers around its stores, searched them, ordered them to leave, called the police to confront or remove consumers, and publicly accused them, sometimes in front of friends or family, of shoplifting or other wrongdoing,” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>Additionally, the FTC said that Rite Aid failed to inform customers that facial recognition technology was in use, while also instructing employees to specifically <em>not</em> reveal this information to customers.</p>
<h2>Face-off</h2>
<p>Facial recognition software has emerged as one of most controversial facets of the AI-powered surveillance era. In the past few years we’ve seen cities issue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansive bans on the technology</a>, while politicians have fought to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/29/house-democrats-facial-recognition-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulate how police utilize it</a>. And companies such as Clearview AI, meanwhile, have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/09/clearview-settlement-bipa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit with lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/13/clearview-greek-ban-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fines</a> around the world for major <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/23/clearview-uk-ico-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data privacy breaches</a> around facial recognition technology.</p>
<p>The FTC’s latest findings regarding Rite Aid also shines a light on inherent biases in AI systems. For instance, the FTC says that Rite Aid failed to mitigate risks to certain consumers due to their race — its technology was “more likely to generate false positives in stores located in plurality-Black and Asian communities than in plurality-White communities,” the findings note.</p>
<p>Additionally, the FTC said that Rite Aid failed to test or measure the accuracy or their facial recognition system prior to, or after, deployment.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.riteaid.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Rite-Aid-Reaches-Settlement-with-FTC/default.aspx">press release</a>, Rite Aid said that it was “pleased to reach an agreement with the FTC,” but that it disagreed with the crux of the allegations.</p>
<p>“The allegations relate to a facial recognition technology pilot program the Company deployed in a limited number of stores,” Rite Aid said in its statement. “Rite Aid stopped using the technology in this small group of stores more than three years ago, before the FTC’s investigation regarding the Company’s use of the technology began.”</p>

<h2 id="the-history-of-g-boag"> The history of G-BOAG </h2>
<p>The engine was installed on the aircraft initially registered as G-BFKW. This would be the aircraft’s third engine. According to Heritage Concorde, the plane was built in 1977 and was delivered to British Aerospace (BAe), an aircraft, ammunition, and defense systems manufacturer, on January 27, 1978. Having a less-than-glamorous beginning to its life with no buyer, the jet was loaned for a sixth-month period to BA via a sale or return agreement, as the airline was awaiting the repair of another Concorde at a maintenance facility at Filton Airfield.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":1105} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":0} -->

<p>G-BFKW was grounded after an aborted flight to New York on April 26, 1980, due to water contaminating the hydraulic system. The issues led to an intake failure at a speed of Mach 2, which later reportedly resulted in engine surges. After remaining on the ground for several months, $1.2 million (£1,000,000) was spent to return the aircraft to flying condition. On February 9, 1981, BA re-registered the Concorde as G-BOAG. Under these letters, the aircraft would continue to fly for the better part of 22 years, according to Heritage Concorde.</p>

<p>In 1982, the aircraft suffered another grounding as it was utilized as the primary source of spares for the remainder of BA’s Concorde fleet. This lasted for a few years until the airline acquired another Concorde, G-BBDG, to be utilized as the source for spares. G-BOAG returned to service in 1984. One year later, the plane was the first Concorde to unveil BA’s new “Landor” livery and new interior.</p>

<p>In 1996, the jet underwent refurbishment and became the last Concorde to be repainted in BA’s new Chatham livery. Following the Paris crash modification program in 2001, G-BOAG was the third BA Concorde to return to the skies on October 19 of that year. Just two years later, it flew to Toronto to begin its North American farewell tour. On October 14, 2003, the jet visited Washington Dulles International Airport to conclude its North American farewell tour and flew back over the pond to begin its UK farewell tour.</p>

<h2 id="flying-into-retirement"> Flying into retirement </h2>
<p>G-BOAG operated its final flight from New York to London on October 24, 2003, and joined two other Concordes, G-BOAE and G-BOAF, at Heathrow Airport to mark the last day of Concorde commercial flights. On November 3, 2003, the aircraft flew to its retirement home at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, where it can still be visited today.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                

                
                    
                        <p>Someone recently asked me if I had advice for early-career programmers. At first I thought this was a silly question. I only entered the workforce ten years ago; many of my newsletter subscribers have been programming for longer than I've been alive! </p>
<p>Then I went and read some "advice for starting programmer" essays and thought of some things they missed. So here's thirteen bits of advice for early-career programmers. Some of it is contradictory.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>People don't listen to me because I'm a good programmer, they listen to me because I'm a good writer. The same is true of pretty much <em>everybody</em> you'll read. This doesn't mean you should automatically reject everything, but it means you should carefully think about it and evaluate how it applies to your situation. And take any argument about "objective truth" with a grain of salt: there is <em>very</em> little about software that's been scientifically studied, and most of the research is inconclusive. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But also don't worry too hard about getting "tricked" or learning "the wrong thing". If you like someone's ideas, try them out! As long as you're not actively sabotaging your coworkers then it'll probably work out in the end, even if you look back and think "I should have done that different." That's what learning is all about!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the book <a href="https://debuggingrules.com/" target="_blank">Debugging: The 9 Rules</a>. Borrow it from the library or ask your company to buy a copy, whatever. It's a real easy read and teaches an important skill all the other "beginner programmer" books barely cover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point you will discover the Right Way to program, the thing which makes this all <em>make sense</em>, and you'll be convinced that the whole field would be so much better off if everybody else programmed the Right Way, too. For me the Right Way was test-driven development; for you it might be functional programming, lisp, formal methods or one of a million other things. </p>
<p>I'm not going to tell you to <em>not</em>  get swept up in the Right Way, because that's pretty much impossible. And honestly it feels really great to discover the Right Way and life's too short to not feel good. Just be <em>mindful</em> of the fact you're getting swept up and try not to make your identity the Right Way Guy. Eventually the honeymoon will end and you'll learn that programming is frustrating and messy regardless of which Right Way people use, and that you can also make great software without doing it the Right Way. Over time you'll learn fifty other Right Ways and learn to mix and match them to the problem at hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you first encounter the Right Way, it will <em>likely</em> be from someone who went full Right Way Guy. Try not to hold it against them later. And try not to conflate the actual technique with how the RWG <em>pitches</em> the technique. Most ideas need some modification from their purest form to integrate well with other ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/" target="_blank">Julia Evans</a> once <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30YWsGDr8mA" target="_blank">said</a> "behind every best practice is a horror story." If you don't understand a Best Practice, look for the horror story that inspired it. It might make the best practice make sense. It might turn out to be something that's completely irrelevant to you, and then you can feel comfortable doing a different practice instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building on the last tip: a lot of best practices and conventions are "path dependent", arising from a mix of historical and cultural factors. There are things we do because our mentors do it, who do it because <em>their</em> mentors did it, who did it to address issues that aren't as relevant anymore. If something sounds like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story" target="_blank">just-so story</a>, it very well might be. You can often retrace the whole path if you're willing to look.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take walks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost every tool you use has some form of hidden depth, from your programming language to git to JIRA. Don't feel like you have to become an expert in every single one, but do consider spending 5-10 minutes learning a bit more about what it can do. </p>

<p>Talk to people in other parts of the company: support, business domain, sales, etc. Consider shadowing them if you have the time (and feel comfortable asking). You'll be surprised by what you learn! </p>

<p>If possible, try to do a few different types of programming earlier in your career. This doesn't have to mean switching jobs: most companies are doing several different kinds of programming at once. So like if you're starting in a webdev company, try some frontend, some backend, some operations, some database stuff, and so forth. This helps you learn, but <em>far more importantly</em> increases your chances of finding a kind of software work that you really really like. My first job was as a frontend dev and I was <em>miserable</em>. Later I moved to backend and was much happier, as were the people who wanted to spent more time doing frontend! </p>

<p>You've probably heard the advice that software as a field is changing <em>all the time</em>, and that you shouldn't get swept up in the framework treadmill, just focus on learning fundamental skills. This is a true, but doesn't explain the "why". For structural reasons, <em>information</em> in software propagates really quickly. This is due to a lot of factors (internet, open source, <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/what-we-can-learn/" target="_blank">conferences</a>) but overall there's a lower barrier to sharing ideas in software. So it's really easy to get a lot of people to <em>know about</em> someone's pet project, even if only one person uses it. </p>
<p>The upshot of this is that a lot of the technologies you hear about have very small userbases and will never get wide adoption, but it won't <em>seem</em> that way from how you hear about it. That's why it makes sense to be conservative. If you hear about something that gets you excited, go ahead and be an early adopter, otherwise it's okay to wait a couple years to see if it has legs.</p>

<p>Ultimately none of us can predict the future, just as none of us could have predicted the present. Just try to do the best you can, live according to your values, and enjoy the ride.</p>

<p>That's all from me for the year; new workshop dates when I get back. See you in 2024! </p>
