                	<h2>In brief</h2>
                
                
                <ul> 
 <li><span>By making 3D printing suitable for slow-curing polymers, researchers have greatly expanded the possibilities of soft robotics. The new materials have advantages over the previous ones.</span></li> 
 <li><span>The advances were possible thanks to a new technology that combines 3D printing with a laser scanner and a feedback mechanism.</span></li> 
 <li><span>A spin-off in the US now offers this technology and prints complex objects on customer request.</span></li> 
</ul>

<div>
                
                
                <p>3D printing is advancing rapidly, and the range of materials that can be used has expanded considerably. While the technology was previously limited to fast-curing plastics, it has now been made suitable for slow-curing plastics as well. These have decisive advantages as they have enhanced elastic properties and are more durable and robust.</p>
<p>The use of such polymers is made possible by a new technology developed by researchers at ETH Zurich and a US start-up. As a result, researchers can now 3D print complex, more durable robots from a variety of high-quality materials in one go. This new technology also makes it easy to combine soft, elastic, and rigid materials. The researchers can also use it to create delicate structures and parts with cavities as desired.</p>
<h2><b>Materials that return to their original state</b></h2>
<p>Using the new technology, researchers at ETH Zurich have succeeded for the first time in printing a robotic hand with bones, ligaments and tendons made of different polymers in one go. “We wouldn’t have been able to make this hand with the fast-curing polyacrylates we’ve been using in 3D printing so far,” explains Thomas Buchner, a doctoral student in the group of ETH Zurich robotics professor Robert Katzschmann and first author of the study. “We’re now using slow-curing thiolene polymers. These have very good elastic properties and return to their original state much faster after bending than polyacrylates.” This makes thiolene polymers ideal for producing the elastic ligaments of the robotic hand.</p>

                <p>In addition, the stiffness of thiolenes can be fine-tuned very well to meet the requirements of soft robots. “Robots made of soft materials, such as the hand we developed, have advantages over conventional robots made of metal. Because they’re soft, there is less risk of injury when they work with humans, and they are better suited to handling fragile goods,” Katzschmann explains.</p>
<h2><b>Scanning instead of scraping</b></h2>
<p>3D printers typically produce objects layer by layer: nozzles deposit a given material in viscous form at each point; a UV lamp then cures each layer immediately. Previous methods involved a device that scraped off surface irregularities after each curing step. This works only with fast-curing polyacrylates. Slow-curing polymers such as thiolenes and epoxies would gum up the scraper.</p>

                    </div>
<div>
            <p>To accommodate the use of slow-curing polymers, the researchers developed 3D printing further by adding a 3D laser scanner that immediately checks each printed layer for any surface irregularities. “A feedback mechanism compensates for these irregularities when printing the next layer by calculating any necessary adjustments to the amount of material to be printed in real time and with pinpoint accuracy,” explains Wojciech Matusik, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US and co-author of the study. This means that instead of smoothing out uneven layers, the new technology simply takes the unevenness into account when printing the next layer.</p>

<p>At ETH Zurich, Katzschmann’s group will use the technology to explore further possibilities and to design even more sophisticated structures and develop additional applications. Inkbit is planning to use the new technology to offer a 3D printing service to its customers and to sell the new printers.<br>

          <h2>Unlocking the Gaming Past with DOS_deck</h2>
          <p>
            In the modern era of gaming, we're spoiled for choice with instant access to games, thanks to game consoles and streaming services, all seamlessly controlled with our trusty gamepads. But let's rewind the clock. Long before these conveniences, there was an era where the gaming world was defined by the MS-DOS operating system, and it laid the foundation for what we enjoy today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 1980 and 1995, MS-DOS reigned as the standard computer operating system. It was a period of innovation and creativity that introduced entirely new gaming genres. Wolfenstein pioneered the first-person shooter (FPS) genre, while Dune 2 set the stage for real-time strategy (RTS) games. Moreover, it was the birthplace of legendary franchises we adore today, including Grand Theft Auto, Fallout, Need for Speed and Warcraft.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as technology progressed, MS-DOS fell by the wayside, and in 2001, Microsoft ceased support for this iconic system. Many of these classic games became incompatible with modern versions of Windows, leaving a void in the hearts of gamers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter a dedicated group of enthusiasts who weren't ready to let the classics fade into obscurity. They developed a PC emulator aimed at preserving the MS-DOS experience, and thus, <a href="https://dosbox.com/" target="_blank">DOSBox</a> was born. This remarkable piece of software was the key to resurrecting the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOSBox allowed these classic games to run, but it required installation on a computer, limiting accessibility. Fortunately, the magic of modern web technology came to the rescue. Some ingenious individuals managed to make DOSBox run within a web browser, giving rise to the marvelous software package known as <a href="https://js-dos.com/" target="_blank">JS-DOS</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOS_deck is built upon the foundation of JS-DOS, which, in turn, relies on DOSBox. Together, they breathe new life into MS-DOS games by bringing them to your browser. However, there's a twist. Games from that era were designed for keyboard and mouse input, without established standards for interaction or control patterns. Here at DOS_deck, a tremendous effort was put into creating a seamless experience, enabling you to effortlessly navigate and play these games, ideally with the comfort of a controller in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rediscover a golden age of gaming with DOS_deck. It's the bridge between the past and the present, connecting you to a world of digital memories and timeless adventures.
          </p>
          <h2>A few tips</h2>
          <p>
            Playing these games in a browser is a blast. But browsers behave a certain way and it's good to know a few things:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Browsers only play sound effects and music after you've "interacted" with the page at least once. So click or press a key once to activate audio.</li>
            <li>In many games, Escape activates a menu. But Escape also exits full screen in a browser. Therefore, you can press the equals key ("=") to simulate Escape at all times.</li>
            <li>Some browsers require you to click on the game once before you can actually use the mouse or emulate the mouse with a controller.</li>

          <p>DOS_deck runs great on Chrome or Edge on a Steam Deck, but it needs a few steps to activate the controller properly. By default, browsers cannot detect the controller. Instead, controller input is received by Chrome and Edge as if you pressed a keyboard key. So follow these steps to install DOS_deck in Steam Deck game mode:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Press the Steam button, select Power &gt; Switch to Desktop.</li>
            <li>Open the Discover Software Center.</li>
            <li>Select Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Web Browsers.</li>
            <li>Find Chrome or Edge and select Install.</li>
            <li>Once it's installed, return to the Desktop. Select Application Launcher.</li>
            <li>Select Internet, right-click on Chrome or Edge and select Add to Steam.</li>
            <li>Check the box next to Chrome or Edge. Select Add Selected Programs.</li>
            <li>Back on the Desktop, open Application Launcher &gt; System &gt; Konsole (terminal window).</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to previous research, most university students <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/10/universities-do-more-tackle-smart-drugs-say-experts-uk-exams">think it’s normal</a> to use drugs prescribed for conditions such as ADHD and narcolepsy as ‘cognitive enhancers’. Many students have few qualms taking a dose with the aim of improving focus and academic performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those that use these medications to manage a condition, they can be life changing. However, a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.add4165">recent study</a> in <em>Science Advances</em> has found that for cognitively healthy people, several ‘smart drugs’ aren’t so smart after all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elizabeth Bowman at the University of Melbourne and colleagues studied 40 healthy people aged between 18 and 35. On four test days, held at least a week apart, these participants were presented with eight versions of a problem known as the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34851">knapsack optimisation problem</a>, or knapsack task, which is designed to mimic the kind of complex decision-making and problem-solving challenges that we face in daily life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The knapsack task involved presenting the participant with a virtual empty bag with a weight limit, along with 10 to 12 different items of different values and weights that could be placed inside. To succeed at the task, the participants had to pack the bag with the combination of items totalling the greatest possible value, while staying under the weight limit. While they worked on this, they were shown the cumulative weight and value of their selected items, but had to complete their packing within a four-minute time limit. By varying the values, weights and number of items, as well as the weight limit, the researchers were able to vary the difficulty level of each individual challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On each test day, the participants were also given a different identical-looking white pill. One contained a dose of methylphenidate (aka Ritalin, a stimulant used to treat ADHD), one a dose of modafinil (used to treat narcolepsy), and one a dose of dextroamphetamine (another stimulant used for ADHD). The final pill was a placebo. All of three drugs are known to increase levels of dopamine as well as noradrenaline. The team expected that the increased dopamine would boost the participants’ level of motivation to complete the task and, with the increased noradrenaline, raise their effort levels, leading to a better performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The results showed that on average, the drugs didn’t affect the chance of a participant finding the solution to a knapsack problem. Contrary to perhaps many students’ expectations, however, participants tended to perform worse after taking one of the drugs, packing a lower total value of items.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only that, but they spent substantially more time working on their solution while on the smart drugs than they did after taking the placebo. In fact, participants spent almost as much time on the easiest presentations of the knapsack task while on methylphenidate (Ritalin) as they did on the hardest instances of the task after taking the placebo, without any corresponding improvement in performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of the drugs also increased the number of times the participants moved items in and out of the knapsack. “Thus, if one measures motivation in terms of time spent or number of items moved, drugs clearly enhanced motivation,” the team writes. However, on average, the drugs did not increase ‘effort quality’ or productivity, measured as the average gain in knapsack value per move. Productivity was lower in all three drug conditions, compared with placebo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking at performances on a group level, though, masks what the team referred to as a “disturbing reversal” in individual performances. Those who’d scored above average after taking the placebo tended to fall below average while on one of the drugs. While on a drug, participants made a poorer, more random first attempt at filling a knapsack than they did after taking the placebo, and this had an especially negative impact on the subsequent performance of those who’d been above average in the placebo condition, explaining why they dropped below the mean. Overall, the results suggest that the participants’ approach to solving the knapsack task became less systematic while they were on each of the three drugs, the researchers write.</p>

<p>The results have clear implications: healthy people who take these drugs hoping for cognitive gains may work harder and longer at a problem, but without any benefit. For people who are already pretty good at solving complex problems that require systematic thought — likely many university students — these drugs could even be detrimental. More work will be needed to establish exactly why these drugs have these effects in those without a medical need for them, as well as to explore the potential impacts of other so-called smart drugs.&nbsp;</p>

It is (relatively) easy to add code to the kernel; it tends to be much
harder to remove that code later.  The most recent example of this dynamic
can be seen in the story of the ia64 ("Itanium") architecture, support for
which was removed during the 6.7 merge window.  That removal has left a
small group of dedicated ia64 users unhappy and clinging to a faint hope
that this support could return in a year's time.
</p><p>
At the end of the 1990s, it had become clear that 32-bit processors were
approaching the end of their useful life for many applications; in
particular, 32&nbsp;bits is not enough to address the memory sizes that
were beginning to show up on higher-end systems.  In response, Intel
launched into a program that it called "Merced" to create the successor to
the x86.  It was a RISC architecture, wholly incompatible with anything
that Intel had sold before.  But it was going to be the Next Big Thing
because that was what Intel was doing.
</p><p>
At the time, information about this new architecture was being held under
nondisclosure agreements, and it was far from clear when Linux developers
would be able to port the kernel to Merced, if ever.  This was before
Intel's <a href="https://lwn.net/1998/1001/">investment in Red Hat</a> that signaled the
beginning of the arrival of big money into Linux.  It seemed entirely
possible that Linux would be cut out of the processor that, we were all
reliably informed, would be the future of computing; choices would be
limited to Windows and proprietary Unix.
</p><p>
That, of course, is not how things worked out.  Intel became one of the
earliest corporate supporters of Linux and ensured, under a project known
as <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/35">Trillian</a>, that
Linux ran well on this new architecture, which was eventually named ia64
(or "Itanium" in the sales literature).  Initial Itanium support found its
way into the 2.3.43 development kernel release in early 2000.  The way was
clear for our bright Linux-on-Itanium future.
</p><p>
The only problem, of course, is that things didn't work out that way
either.  Early Itanium systems failed to perform at anything close to the
speeds that the hype had promised.  Meanwhile, AMD created the x86-64
architecture, adding 64-bit operation while maintaining as much
compatibility with the vast world of deployed 32-bit software as possible.
This new architecture quickly won over the market, forcing Intel to follow
in AMD's footsteps; Itanium ended up as a nearly forgotten footnote.  Some
systems were sold, and Intel continued manufacturing the CPUs for many
years, but their market was limited.  Red Hat dropped ia64 support in 2010.
</p><p>
Through all of this, the ia64 architecture code was maintained in the
kernel, but interest dropped rapidly.  In recent years, the ia64 code has
often been seen as a drag on kernel development in general.  After a bug
originating in the ia64 code was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/920259/">tracked
down</a> in January, kernel developers started talking more seriously about
just removing support for that architecture entirely.  There was some
discussion at the time, with a few hobbyist users complaining about the
idea, but no changes were made then.
</p><p>
The topic came back in May, though, When Ard Biesheuvel <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAMj1kXFCMh_578jniKpUtx_j8ByHnt=s7S+yQ+vGbKt9ud7+kQ@mail.gmail.com/">pushed
for the removal of ia64 support</a> from the kernel, saying that the
architecture was impeding his work in the EFI subsystem:
</p><blockquote>
	As a maintainer, I feel uncomfortable asking contributors to build
	test their changes for Itanium, and boot testing is infeasible for
	most, even if some people are volunteering access to infrastructure
	for this purpose. In general, hacking on kernels or bootloaders
	(which is where the EFI pieces live) is tricky using remote access.
<p>
	The bottom line is that, while I know of at least 2 people (on cc)
	that test stuff on itanium, and package software for it, I don't
	think there are any actual users remaining, and so it is doubtful
	whether it is justified to ask people to spend time and effort on
	this.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In that discussion, John Paul Adrian Glaubitz (who maintains the Debian
ia64 port) <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/ff58a3e76e5102c94bb5946d99187b358def688a.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/">suggested</a>
that ia64 support should be kept until after the next long-term-support
kernel release, after which it could be dropped.  That would, he said,
maximize the amount of time in which ia64 would be supported for any
remaining users out there.  That is how it appears to have played out:
during the 6.7 merge window, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/cf8e8658100d">ia64 support was
removed</a>.  The ia64 story is now done, as far as Linux is concerned.
</p><p>
Except that, seemingly, it is not.  Shortly after ia64 support disappeared
from the kernel, Frank Scheiner <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/8ff191a0-41fa-4f36-86e8-3d32ff3fe75c@web.de/">complained</a>
to the mailing list, saying that he and others had been working to resolve
the problems with this architecture and had been rewarded by seeing it
removed anyway.  Linus Torvalds <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whFLZ67ffzt1juryCYcYz6eL_XjQF8WucDzwUR5H65+rA@mail.gmail.com/">responded</a>
that he might be willing to see it come back — eventually:
</p><blockquote>
	So I'd be willing to come back to the "can we resurrect it"
	discussion, but not immediately - more along the lines of a "look,
	we've been maintaining it out of tree for a year, the other
	infrastructure is still alive, there is no impact on the rest of
	the kernel, can we please try again"?
</blockquote>
<p>
Scheiner was <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/6e745433-d7eb-45df-b607-5589f1e04e86@web.de/">not
entirely pleased</a> with the removal of ia64 support, but Glaubitz <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/396c3aebd6a382aa5a9cbf333f93d876467e12e9.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/">described</a>
the one-year plan as "<q>very reasonable</q>".
</p><p>
So the hobbyists who want to keep Linux support for this architecture
alive, and who faced a difficult task before, have now seen the challenge
become more severe.  Maintaining support for an architecture out of tree is
not a task for the faint of heart, especially as the mainline kernel goes
forward with changes that had been held back by the need to keep ia64
working until now.  To complicate the picture, as Tony Luck <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/SJ1PR11MB60833AF98E6E9D3CD89AB393FC439@SJ1PR11MB6083.namprd11.prod.outlook.com/">pointed
out</a> in May, it is entirely possible that future kernel changes may,
when backported to the stable kernel updates, break ia64 in those kernels.
Since nobody working on the stable updates is able to test ia64 systems
(even if they wanted to), such problems could go unnoticed for some time.
</p><p>
One should also not miss the other condition that Torvalds placed on a
return of ia64: that "<q>the other infrastructure is still alive</q>".  The
ia64 enthusiasts did not miss that, so it is unsurprising that they were
concerned when Adhemerval Zanella <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/445c5c7c-315f-495d-81ce-a5bdc30e2b8e@linaro.org/">proposed</a>
removing ia64 support from the GNU C Library (glibc) — one of the most
important pieces of other infrastructure.  Zanella pointed out that the
ia64 port is in poor shape, with a number of outstanding problems that seem
unlikely to be solved.  Scheiner <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/37fcf02a-6977-42ff-bed2-e1813f3f61ef@web.de/">answered</a>
that it might be possible to provide (limited) access to ia64 machines for
library testing, and asked for more time to address some of the problems.
</p><p>
Zanella, though, followed up with <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/20231104190225.2060378-1-adhemerval.zanella@linaro.org/">a
patch</a> to remove ia64 support.  Scheiner <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/fbdeb854-ca42-4835-8cdc-fb130ea2b747@web.de/">responded</a>:
"<q>The speed this happens really surprises me and I hope there is no need
to rush with this removal</q>".  Other developers, though, including <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/e5e9a6f8-f391-51f5-f4d9-384810c3c3aa@codesourcery.com/">Joseph
Myers</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/8734xiyhgu.fsf@mid.deneb.enyo.de/">Florian Weimer</a>,
and glibc maintainer <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/a53a3413-bb07-9d29-d692-777f54ad3065@redhat.com/">Carlos
O'Donell</a>, are all in favor of dropping ia64 support.  It would, thus,
not be surprising to see the removal happen as soon as the 2.39 release,
due in February, or at the latest in the release after that.
</p><p>
That, needless to say, raises the bar for ia64 supporters even further.
While one should never discount what a group of determined developers can
accomplish, it is probably safe to conclude that ia64 support is gone from
the kernel for good.  Some may see this as a disappointment, but it is also
a testament to how hard the community will work to keep an architecture
alive even though it never had a lot of users and has almost none now.
This support, arguably, could have been removed years ago without causing
any great discomfort, but taking code out of the kernel is hard.  As
has been seen here, though, it is occasionally possible.<br clear="all"></p><table>

Each participating artist has partnered with us and will have a hand in helping us test and learn to shape the future of AI in music.</p><p data-block-key="463ho">Dream Track users can simply enter a topic and choose an artist from the carousel to generate a 30 second soundtrack for their Short. Using our Lyria model, Dream Track simultaneously generates the lyrics, backing track, and AI-generated voice in the style of the participating artist selected.</p><p data-block-key="5p011">Here are a couple of samples generated in the styles of Charlie Puth or T-Pain:</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="v3onl">Exploring music AI tools with the industry</h2><p data-block-key="v6e8">Our researchers have been exploring with artists, songwriters, and producers in <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/partnering-with-the-music-industry-on-ai/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube’s Music AI Incubator</a> how generative AI can best support the creative process, and working together to responsibly design a suite of music AI tools.</p><p data-block-key="fuose">Imagine singing a melody to create a horn line, transforming chords from a MIDI keyboard into a realistic vocal choir, or adding an instrumental accompaniment to a vocal track.</p>
</div><p data-block-key="zt2dw">With our music AI tools, users can create new music or instrumental sections from scratch, transform audio from one music style or instrument to another, and create instrumental and vocal accompaniments. This work draws on our history of research and experimentation with AI and music, and we’ll continue testing our music AI tools with incubator participants throughout their development.</p><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="0b7d2">Watermarking AI-generated audio with SynthID</h2><p data-block-key="3fd2c">Our team is also pioneering responsible deployment of our technologies with best-in-class tools for watermarking and identifying synthetically generated content. Any content published by our Lyria model will be watermarked with <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/synthid" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SynthID</a>, the same technology toolkit we’re using for identifying images generated by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/overview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Imagen on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI</a>.</p>
</div><div>
  <p data-block-key="bbw1f">SynthID embeds a watermark into AI-generated audio content that’s inaudible to the human ear and doesn’t compromise the listening experience. It does this by converting the audio wave into a two-dimensional visualization that shows how the spectrum of frequencies in a sound evolves over time. This novel method is unlike anything that exists today, especially in the context of audio.</p><p data-block-key="708fm">The watermark is designed to maintain detectability even when the audio content undergoes many common modifications such as noise additions, MP3 compression, or speeding up and slowing down the track. SynthID can also detect the presence of a watermark throughout a track to help determine if parts of a song were generated by Lyria.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="k94yy">Developing and deploying our technologies responsibly</h2><p data-block-key="26j9i">To maximize the benefits of our generative music technologies, while mitigating potential risks, it’s critical these are developed with best-in-class protections. We’ve worked closely with artists and the music industry to ensure these technologies are widely beneficial.</p><p data-block-key="4pb1k">Our music AI experiments have been designed in line with <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/partnering-with-the-music-industry-on-ai/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube’s AI principles</a>, which aim to enable creative expression while protecting music artists and the integrity of their work.</p><p data-block-key="4b7ba">Going forward, we’ll continue engaging artists, the music industry, and wider creative community to set the standard for the responsible development and deployment of music generation tools.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="k94yy">The future of generative music tools</h2><p data-block-key="2abao">Generative music technologies could transform the future of music creation and use. Our cutting-edge work in this space will unlock an exciting new wave of artist tools that can inspire creativity for artists, songwriters, producers, and fans everywhere.</p><p data-block-key="emh35">We've only just begun to explore how AI can bolster people's musical creativity and we can't wait to see what we can accomplish next in partnership with artists, the music industry, and wider creative community.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Good morning. This is Zandar's Dad. I am sorry to tell you that he passed away over the weekend, peacefully in his sleep. Fortunately, his computer was on and open to this page but I don't know if I will be able to post again. This blog was Jon's passion. He was an ardent advocate for justice and for our Democracy. He was brilliant. He was funny. He never stopped believing in our country but he never stopped fighting the "stupid" and there was plenty of it for him to fight. He was thrilled with KY reelecting a Democratic governor, and he posted up until Friday, but he was feeling sick over the weekend and when he went to bed Saturday night, he thought that he would feel better when he woke up, but he never did.&nbsp;</p><p>I posted a few replies to his recent posts, hoping to get the word out, before I located this page. As I said, this blog is his pride and joy. In many ways, it is his legacy. He greatly appreciated all of you who read the blog, who posted, and who supported ZandarVTS financially. If you are inclined to make a financial donation in his memory, the chosen organization is the American Heart Association, but the BESTthing you can do to honor Jon's memory is to VOTE like your life and your Democracy depend on it, because they do.&nbsp;</p><p>Zandar's full name was Jonathan David Mott. He was born on 6/8/75 in Omaha, NE. His obituary should appear soon on the the Hickory Daily Record website, www.hickoryrecord.com.</p><p>Thanks and please VOTE.<br></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://becomingaleader.substack.com/p/how-to-build-trust">https://becomingaleader.substack.com/p/how-to-build-trust</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38285251">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><h5>Earning your team's trust can take time but the benefits are worth the effort.</h5><p>I once worked under a manager that I didn’t, or couldn’t, trust, and it was a disaster. Once that distrust set in, I began to second-guess everything they said, and my confidence and performance dropped as a result.</p><p>So when I started managing a team, I put a lot of energy into asking questions, reading, and taking courses related to building trust.</p><p><span>I learned that you earn somebody’s trust through your actions — this is true for any relationship, and it’s </span><em>essential</em><span> for new managers who want to lead a group of people.</span><br></p><p><span>In this blog, I’ll share what I’ve learned about earning and retaining trust so that you can </span><em>help your team be productive and deliver for your customers.</em></p><p><span>I came across Frei and Morriss’s ‘Trust Triangle’ </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2020/05/begin-with-trust" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">in the Harvard Business Review</a><span>, and it’s now the basis for my understanding and assessment of how well I’m promoting trust within my team.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I try to embody the triangle’s three points — authenticity, empathy, and logic —&nbsp;in everything I do as a manager. Doing so helps me establish a culture of trust and psychological safety day-to-day.</p><p>New managers often want to get everything right from the get-go. But, ironically, that would be their first mistake. In fact, I’d say one of the worst things you can do would be to pretend to have all the answers. Why? Because that’s the total opposite of authenticity.</p><p>I showed my real self and my vulnerability right from the first meeting I held as a manager. I said to the team, “Look, I’m new to this. I’m going to be learning as I go but I’m going to do my very best.” I explained how excited I was to be managing them and why, but I never claimed to be perfect (or anywhere close, actually).&nbsp;</p><p>This authenticity set the tone for our team as somewhere mistakes could be made and not vilified. And when I have constructive feedback to share, I try to avoid framing it in an “I’m right, you’re wrong” kind of way. Instead, I say, “I have an observation I’d like to share with you if that’s okay?”</p><p>I believe my team is more receptive to these observations when framed as something to discuss and either give merit to or discredit together.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s no secret that empathy and leadership go hand-in-hand.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news for new managers is that simply committing to get to know your team members is a great, and very easy, first step. Regular one-on-ones are a big part of how I spend my time as a manager — these sessions allow me to engage with people on a personal level and better empathize with their individual employee experience.&nbsp;</p><p>But getting to know the team as people isn’t enough. You have to also act on what you’re learning and take their insights on board.&nbsp;</p><p>One employee, for example, came to me a little concerned about a corporate restructuring that the team recently found out about. For many of us, the phrase ‘corporate restructure’ is enough to send shivers down the spine and it was hardly surprising that the team was feeling nervous. So being empathetic to their needs, I took the time to gather some intel, prepare a short announcement for our next team meeting, and dedicate time for a Q&amp;A.</p><p><span>I couldn’t stop the change but I did have the power to reassure and inspire my team — and that’s a power that </span><em>they</em><span> granted, through trusting in my approach.</span></p><p><span>It’s also important to remain empathetic when delivering feedback or, worse, disappointing news. If you know a team member was </span><em>really</em><span> gunning for promotion but now isn’t their time, or </span><em>really</em><span> put their all into a task but still missed the mark, come back to what your observations of the situation are and ask them about theirs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As a manager, you’re also the bearer of bad news. And as much as you might want to mute your emotions in order to protect yourself, you should put your employee’s need for empathy first because these conversations are actually </span><em>not</em><span> about you. More on this later.</span></p><p>Lastly, we come to logic. I’ve just explained how important it is to speak person-to-person, so being logical isn’t about being unemotional. It’s about ensuring you’ve got your facts straight, that your team is on track to achieve its goals, and that all your activities are underpinned by organizational strategy.</p><p><span>To me, logic also means acting quickly when you know someone needs support. New managers may be tempted to wait an employee's issue out, thinking, “Well, they said they were okay, so even though it looks like they are struggling, I’ll give them time.” What I’ve learned is that you </span><em>cannot</em><span> delay. One small struggle grows into a big disruption —&nbsp;and </span><em>fast</em><span>. If you fail to help when you should have, you risk losing the trust of that employee and the rest of the team.</span></p><p>There’s no such thing as the perfect manager and high-performing teams don’t actually benefit from having a manager who’s right 100% of the time. Managers who they can trust to have their back — managers who lead with authenticity, empathy, and logic —&nbsp;are far, far more valuable.</p><p>So my message for new managers is not to worry so much. If you’ve got the right values and you’re following the best practices, then you’re on the right track. And when you feel like you’re under pressure to succeed, remember that as a manager, you are not the star of the show — or you shouldn’t be, at least. It’s your job to make your team look good by helping them deliver results.&nbsp;</p><p>Can you win trust back once it’s been broken? I think you can. But you’ll need to appreciate that you have to rebuild their trust. Admit that you made a mistake, show that you understand why it was a mistake, and what you’ll do to make sure it doesn’t happen again. This will help you earn credibility from which trust can start to be rebuilt.</p><ul><li><p>Set the tone for your team as somewhere mistakes can be made (and will not be vilified). You can do this by being authentic, admitting your mistakes when you don’t know something, and by making feedback a team norm.</p></li><li><p>Get to know each person on your team by setting up a one-on-one. Focus on the Person, Position, and their Goals.</p></li><li><p><span>Prepare for your conversations and lead with empathy. Preparation will help you position yourself as someone people </span><em>want</em><span> to be led by and empathy will show that you care.</span></p></li><li><p>Adapt a servant leadership mindset. It’s no longer all about you, you have to focus on the team.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>With that said, find time to focus on your individual tasks too. Otherwise, you won’t be prepared to lead your team and you’ll likely lose their trust.</p></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<p><em>The Guardian</em> has removed a letter written by Osama Bin Laden, explaining his war against the United States is partly because of its support of Israel, after it had gone viral on TikTok.</p><p>“This page previously displayed a document containing, in translation, the full text of Osama bin Laden’s ‘letter to the American people,’ as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/alqaida.terrorism?ref=404media.co"><u>reported</u></a> in the Observer on Sunday 24 November 2002,” a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2023/nov/15/removed-document?ref=404media.co"><u>note</u></a> on the Guardian’s site where the letter previously appeared now reads. “The document, which was published here on the same day, was removed on 15 November 2023.”</p><p>“The transcript published on our website 20 years ago has been widely shared today on social media without its original context,” a spokesperson for <em>The Guardian</em> told 404 Media. “Therefore we have decided to take it down and direct readers to the news article that originally contextualized it instead.”&nbsp;</p><p>The letter was originally published alongside <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/alqaida.terrorism?ref=404media.co"><u>another article</u></a> that explained the letter “was originally posted in Arabic on a Saudi Arabian website previously used by al-Qaeda to disseminate messages” and “was sent to hundreds of subscribers to an email list run by Mohammed al-Massari, the UK-based Saudi Arabian dissident.” It added the UK and American governments’ response to it.&nbsp;</p><p>It is highly unusual for news sites to delete articles or primary source documents unless there is a major error in them or a direct and urgent threat to life through their publication.</p><p>Searching for “letter to America” on TikTok brings up a few dozen results, and some of the videos have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of views. In many of these videos TikTok users are expressing shock that they don’t entirely disagree with some of what Bin Laden’s letter said, namely that he is at war with the United States because the United States attacked the Muslim world first, that Jewish people have no claim to Israel, and that Israel has occupied Palestine for decades “overflowing with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation.”</p><p>Searching for “letter to America” on TikTok also shows that other users searched for terms like “letter to america read outloud,” “letter to America osama summary,” and “letter to america antisemitic.” An accompanying hashtag #LettertoAmerica is also being used on the platform.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/DBkhkPuAKTHGXsnMmqyKaTtatRU1iLtQuEG-8QPXqCYI38LC1JHPXwAzu9NVu16_U5J1XL8yoKvCrolhnzKZBl3d5o3OppiBpiKev6t7JVG8L_3LJ8Yqok81wDrQeJQKSyu3xsx-I12eshDjxsEZy7Y" alt="" loading="lazy" width="374" height="384"></figure><p>Many of the TikToks about #LettertoAmerica are not particularly viral by TikTok standards. The top liked TikTok about the letter, and one that started a moral panic on Twitter, was posted by a user named Lynette Atkins. It has 75,000 likes on a platform where truly viral videos and concepts are regularly viewed tens or hundreds of millions of times. Many of the videos are also simply explaining what the letter is, commenting on the fact that people are talking about the letter on TikTok, or explaining the 9/11 attacks more broadly to an audience of people who were born after 9/11.</p><p>Videos that use #LettertoAmerica have a total combined view count of 1.3 million views, according to TikTok’s hashtag search function.</p><p>Frederick Joseph, author of two <em>New York Times </em>bestselling books about racism and social justice, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8Dtyv8q/?ref=404media.co"><u>posted a video about the removal on TikTok</u></a>: “This is a really good example of narrative control and censorship,” he said. “It started going viral, not because people were necessarily agreeing with Osama Bin Laden’s actions or his moral clarity, but rather because the letter offered perspective into the hypocrisy of America, the hypocrisy of settler colonial nations, so on and so forth, and discussing the atrocities people in the Middle East have faced.”</p><p>“The Guardian decided to take it down. People on TikTok are talking about the letter, reading it, having this discourse about the issues, with, you know, places like the United States,” Joseph added. “They’re afraid of people having information so they decided to take it down.”<em> </em>&nbsp;</p><p>The popularity of the letter on TikTok and the Guardian’s decision to take it down comes in the middle of a raging debate about TikTok’s role during the Israel-Gaza war.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some Israelis and Jewish people, as well as prominent politicians and Silicon Valley venture capitalists, are saying that TikTok is promoting antisemitism. Senator Josh Hawley <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1722381329122181389?ref=404media.co"><u>said</u></a> that TikTok specifically is a “hotspot for antisemitic, pro-Hamas propaganda.” There is no evidence to support the claim that TikTok is exceptional in this regard, aside from the fact that, like every other social media platform, TikTok hosts a lot of bigoted and antisemitic content, and that many TikTok users are horrified by Israel’s relentless bombing of the densely populated Gaza Strip, which so far has killed more than 11,000 people, 4,500 of which were children, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/us/politics/gaza-hospitals-cancer-israel.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=LegacyCollection&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-israel-gaza&amp;variant=show&amp;region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>according to health officials in Gaza</u></a>. In fact, <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/07/2023/tiktok-tells-advertisers-israel-is-trending-but-not-palestine?ref=404media.co"><u>according to Semafor</u></a>, #Israel is trending on the platform despite the fact TikTok users have created twice the number of videos that are tagged #Palestine. </p>

    <a href="#Push-Ifs-Up-And-Fors-Down"><span>Push Ifs Up And Fors Down</span> <time datetime="2023-11-15">Nov 15, 2023</time></a>
    </h2>
<p><span>A short note on two related rules of thumb.</span></p>
<section id="Push-Ifs-Up">

    
<p><span>If there</span>’<span>s an </span><code>if</code><span> condition inside a function, consider if it could be moved to the caller instead:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>// GOOD</span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>frobnicate</span>(walrus: Walrus) {</span>
<span>    ...</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// BAD</span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>frobnicate</span>(walrus: <span>Option</span>&lt;Walrus&gt;) {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>walrus</span> = <span>match</span> walrus {</span>
<span>    <span>Some</span>(it) =&gt; it,</span>
<span>    <span>None</span> =&gt; <span>return</span>,</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>As in the example above, this often comes up with preconditions: a function might check precondition</span>
<span>inside and </span>“<span>do nothing</span>”<span> if it doesn</span>’<span>t hold, or it could push the task of precondition checking to</span>
<span>its caller, and enforce via types (or an assert) that the precondition holds. With preconditions</span>
<span>especially, </span>“<span>pushing up</span>”<span> can become viral, and result in fewer checks overall, which is one</span>
<span>motivation for this rule of thumb.</span></p>
<p><span>Another motivation is that control flow and </span><code>if</code><span>s are complicated, and are  a source of bugs. By</span>
<span>pushing </span><code>if</code><span>s up, you often end up centralizing control flow in a single function, which has a</span>
<span>complex branching logic, but all the actual work is delegated to straight line subroutines.</span></p>
<p><em><span>If</span></em><span> you have complex control flow, better to fit it on a screen in a single function, rather than</span>
<span>spread throughout the file. What</span>’<span>s more, with all the flow in one place it often is possible to</span>
<span>notice redundancies and dead conditions. Compare:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>f</span>() {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> foo &amp;&amp; bar {</span>
<span>    <span>if</span> foo {</span>
<span></span>
<span>    } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span></span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>g</span>() {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> foo &amp;&amp; bar {</span>
<span>    <span>h</span>()</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>h</span>() {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> foo {</span>
<span></span>
<span>  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span></span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>For </span><code>f</code><span>, it</span>’<span>s much easier to notice a dead branch than for a combination of </span><code>g</code><span> and </span><code>h</code><span>!</span></p>
<p><span>A related pattern here is what I call </span>“<span>dissolving enum</span>”<span> refactor. Sometimes, the code ends up</span>
<span>looking like this:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>enum</span> <span>E</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>Foo</span>(<span>i32</span>),</span>
<span>  <span>Bar</span>(<span>String</span>),</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>e</span> = <span>f</span>();</span>
<span>  <span>g</span>(e)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>f</span>() <span>-&gt;</span> E {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> condition {</span>
<span>    E::<span>Foo</span>(x)</span>
<span>  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span>    E::<span>Bar</span>(y)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>g</span>(e: E) {</span>
<span>  <span>match</span> e {</span>
<span>    E::<span>Foo</span>(x) =&gt; <span>foo</span>(x),</span>
<span>    E::<span>Bar</span>(y) =&gt; <span>bar</span>(y)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>There are two branching instructions here and, by pulling them up, it becomes apparent that it is</span>
<span>the exact same condition, triplicated (the third time reified as a data structure):</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> condition {</span>
<span>    <span>foo</span>(x)</span>
<span>  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span>    <span>bar</span>(y)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
</section>
<section id="Push-Fors-Down">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Push-Fors-Down"><span>Push Fors Down</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>This comes from data oriented school of thought. Few things are few, many things are many. Programs</span>
<span>usually operate with bunches of objects. Or at least the hot path usually involves handling many</span>
<span>entities. It is the volume of entities that makes the path hot in the first place. So it often is</span>
<span>prudent to introduce a concept of a </span>“<span>batch</span>”<span> of objects, and make operations on batches the base</span>
<span>case, with a scalar version being a special case of a batched ones:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>// GOOD</span></span>
<span><span>frobnicate_batch</span>(walruses)</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// BAD</span></span>
<span><span>for</span> <span>walrus</span> <span>in</span> walruses {</span>
<span>  <span>frobnicate</span>(walrus)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The primary benefit here is performance. Plenty of performance, </span><a href="http://venge.net/graydon/talks/VectorizedInterpretersTalk-2023-05-12.pdf"><span>in extreme</span>
<span>cases</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a whole batch of things to work with, you can amortize startup cost and be flexible</span>
<span>about the order you process things. In fact, you don</span>’<span>t even need to process entities in any</span>
<span>particular order, you can do vectorized/struct-of-array tricks to process one field of all entities</span>
<span>first, before continuing with other fields.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps the most fun example here is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhage%E2%80%93Strassen_algorithm"><span>FFT-based polynomial</span>
<span>multiplication</span></a><span>: turns out,</span>
<span>evaluating a polynomial at a bunch of points simultaneously could be done faster than a bunch of</span>
<span>individual point evaluations!</span></p>
<p><span>The two pieces of advice about </span><code>for</code><span>s and </span><code>if</code><span>s even compose!</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>// GOOD</span></span>
<span><span>if</span> condition {</span>
<span>  <span>for</span> <span>walrus</span> <span>in</span> walruses {</span>
<span>    walrus.<span>frobnicate</span>()</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>} <span>else</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>for</span> <span>walrus</span> <span>in</span> walruses {</span>
<span>    walrus.<span>transmogrify</span>()</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// BAD</span></span>
<span><span>for</span> <span>walrus</span> <span>in</span> walruses {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> condition {</span>
<span>    walrus.<span>frobnicate</span>()</span>
<span>  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span>    walrus.<span>transmogrify</span>()</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The </span><code>GOOD</code><span> version is good, because it avoid repeatedly re-evaluation </span><code>condition</code><span>, removes a branch</span>
<span>from the hot loop, and potentially unlocks vectorization. This pattern works on a micro level and on</span>
<span>a macro level </span>—<span> the good version is the architecture of TigerBeetle, where in the data plane we</span>
<span>operate on batches of objects at the same time, to amortize the cost of decision making in the</span>
<span>control plane.</span></p>
<p><span>While performance is perhaps the primary motivation for the </span><code>for</code><span> advice, sometimes it helps with</span>
<span>expressiveness as well. </span><code>jQuery</code><span> was quite successful back in the day, and it operates on</span>
<span>collections of elements. The language of abstract vector spaces is often a better tool for thought</span>
<span>than bunches of coordinate-wise equations.</span></p>
<p><span>To sum up, push the </span><code>if</code><span>s up and the </span><code>for</code><span>s down!</span></p>

Guardrails have been in place where the Firefox browser has enabled Wayland by default (when running on recent GTK versions) but as of today that code has been removed... Firefox will try to move forward with stable releases where Wayland will ship by default!
</p><p>
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1752398">Mozilla Bug 1752398</a> to "ship the Wayland backend to release" has been closed this evening! After the ticket was open for  the past two years, it's now deemed ready to hopefully ship enabled for Firefox 121!
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=firefox_wayland_default" alt="Firefox Wayland default!"></p>
<p><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/5ea5f3e31d58">This patch</a> drops the "early beta or earlier" check to let Wayland support be enabled by default when running on recent GTK versions (GTK 3.24.30 threshold).
</p><p>
Firefox 121 is due for release around 19 December and if all continues to hold, it will finally ship with the Wayland back-end enabled by default as another big step forward. With <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Plasma-6.0-Wayland-Default">KDE Plasma 6.0 using Wayland by default</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/XWayland-Rootful-HiDPI-Open">XWayland rootful mode improving</a>, and other (X)Wayland progress, 2024 could very well be the year of Wayland shining in the Linux desktop limelight.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/poettering/diskomator">https://github.com/poettering/diskomator</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38280472">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Diskomator</h2>
<p dir="auto"><em>🦠 NVMe-TCP at your fingertips 🦠</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Diskomator is an OS-in-an-EFI-binary whose only job is to expose all
local disks as NVMe-TCP network block devices, as they appear.</p>
<p dir="auto">When built, it results in a single UEFI binary, that embeds a full OS
root file system so that it does not need any further disk access
while it runs. The EFI binary can be invoked directly from the UEFI
firmware, for example by placing it an EFI System Partition (ESP). The
OS root file system contains:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">A Fedora Linux OS tree</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">A current version of systemd (v255-rc2),
including
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-storagetm.html" rel="nofollow">systemd-storagetm</a>
and
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-networkd.html" rel="nofollow">systemd-networkd</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">An SSH server (just to make things easy to debug)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The Plymouth boot splash tool to make things pretty at boot and during runtime.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The image is built via <a href="https://github.com/systemd/mkosi"><code>mkosi</code></a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">All this then does is boot up into a minimal mode where
<code>systemd-storagetm</code> and <code>systemd-networkd</code> are running. The former
exposes all local block devices via NVMe-TCP, the latter configures
all local network devices.</p>
<p dir="auto">The resulting EFI binary is relatively large (~300M), because it
embeds all kinds of network drivers and graphics devices, plus their
firmware. To keep things simply this stays close to upstream Fedora,
without any attempts to minimize footprint.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Even?</h2>
<p dir="auto">My personal usecase for this goes something like this: I build
immutable OS images for physical systems regularly and try them out. I
could always write them to an USB stick on my development machine and
then unplug it, and plug it into my testing machine. But that's
cumbersome. My way out: just have a way how the test machine's disk
can be written to directly from my development machine. And that's
what Diskomator is.</p>
<p dir="auto">Other usecases:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Remote installation of OSes</li>
<li>Turn your 2000 USD laptop into a very expensive USB stick</li>
<li>It's a fantastic show-case for UKIs, <code>mkosi</code>, Linux and <code>systemd</code> I think</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caveats</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> This currently does not enable NVME authentication nor
encryption. If you boot from this your disk will be readable and
writable to anyone with access to your local network!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> The <code>root</code> user is accessible via SSH with the password <em>test</em>,
again to anyone with access to your local network!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> A debug shell is always available on Alt-F9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">This requires an EFI system, with a bit of RAM. After all the OS
is entirely kept in memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The resulting EFI binary is not SecureBoot signed, you thus have to
disable SecureBoot if you want to use this. (You can easily add that
though, if you have a suitable key pair. <code>mkosi</code> will help with
that, see documentation.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h2>
<p dir="auto">You'll need:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">A build tree of a current systemd development version, to get the
newest version of <code>systemd-repart</code>. Once distributions started to
regularly ship v255, this manual step will go away. On a Fedora
system you'd do it like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo dnf builddep systemd
git clone https://github.com/systemd/systemd.git
cd systemd
meson build
ninja -C build"><pre><code>sudo dnf builddep systemd
git clone https://github.com/systemd/systemd.git
cd systemd
meson build
ninja -C build
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And with that you should have a version of systemd built in the
<code>build</code> sub-directory. No need to install this, BTW, just keep it
around, we can use the build tree directly in step 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">v19 of <a href="https://github.com/systemd/mkosi"><code>mkosi</code></a> or newer. If
your distribution doesn't have that yet, you can trivially check it
out too:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo dnf builddep mkosi
git clone https://github.com/systemd/mkosi.git"><pre><code>sudo dnf builddep mkosi
git clone https://github.com/systemd/mkosi.git
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">A checkout of <code>diskomator</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/poettering/diskomator.git
cd diskomator
git submodule update --init"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/poettering/diskomator.git
cd diskomator
git submodule update --init
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Now edit <code>mkosi.conf</code> in the diskomator directory locally on your
system, and adjust the (by default commented) <code>ExtraSearchPaths=</code>
line to point to the build tree from step 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You are now ready to build the image. In the <code>diskomator</code> git
checkout run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo ../mkosi/bin/mkosi -T -i -f build"><pre><code>sudo ../mkosi/bin/mkosi -T -i -f build
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">(The <code>-T -i -f</code> you can theoretically drop BTW, I only specify them
here since it improves rebuild times in case you hack on this.)</p>
<p dir="auto">Adjust the <code>mkosi</code> path to match where you placed the checkout tree
from step 3.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once this completes you'll have two things in the <code>mkosi.output/</code>
subdirectory: <code>diskomator.efi</code> and <code>diskomator.raw</code>. The former is
the EFI binary that we care about. The latter is a GPT disk image
with an ESP with that very EFI binary in it (and no other
partitions). The latter you can directly <code>dd</code> to an USB stick if
you like, to boot another system from.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can even let <code>mkosi</code> do the <code>dd</code>'ing for you. Which is actually
a good idea, since it will make sure the image is adapted to your
chosen target device's sector and disk size 🔥🔥🔥:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo ../mkosi/bin/mkosi burn /dev/disk/by-id/usb-SanDisk_Ultra_Fit_4C530000190505109123-0\:0"><pre><code>sudo ../mkosi/bin/mkosi burn /dev/disk/by-id/usb-SanDisk_Ultra_Fit_4C530000190505109123-0\:0
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Replace the last argument in that command line by the path to the
device node you want to write this to. As you can see I have a
SanDisk USB stick I am testing this with.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">And that's really all.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once systemd v255 and mkosi v19 entered the various distributions step
1, 2 and 4 will become unnecessary (and the git submodule thing from
step 3). Once that happened you only have to do 3 and 5.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Future</h2>
<p dir="auto">I'd like to live to see a future where people build appliances like
this for various purposes, not just this specific NVMe one. For
example, a nice thing to have would be an appliance whose only job is
to make all local displays available via Miracast. I hope this
repository is inspiration enough for an interested soul, to get this
off the ground.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ideally, distributions would build images like this on their
own. Specifically, I'd be delighted if Fedora (for example) would
build an image like this and SecureBoot sign it, within their own
build infrastructure and make that an offering to their users.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the meantime it might be nice to build diskomator on the usually
available Open Source build infrastructure somewhere, so that people
can just download a <code>.raw</code> or <code>.efi</code> file, instead of the cumbersome
build steps listed above. Anyone interested in setting this up?</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway, I hope this piqued your interest, now run and do with all this
whatever you want!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>
<b>In which we once more delve into the world of user interface design.</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Autumn 2023</i>
</p>

<p>
Three years ago, I wrote <a href="https://datagubbe.se/decusab/">a rant about the problems</a> of our current UI paradigm. The complaints I voiced were hardly new or unique, neither was the text what I'd consider my best writing. It was, honestly, mostly a way to blow off steam. It seems I struck a nerve, though, because it's proven to be one of the most popular texts I've published here. For some time, I've thought about writing a follow-up, and a recent resurgence in the text's popularity prompted me to finally do so.
</p>

<p>
I didn't (and still don't) have any delusions that my ramblings will somehow affect anything. And, in three years' time, nothing has indeed changed - at least not for the better. The most depressing part is perhaps that the debate around these issues hasn't changed one iota, either. The same non-arguments crop up all the time when discussing these issues:
</p>

<p>
"Well, gramps, maybe things weren't super duper great in the past, either?" "Where's the research, dude?" "It's progress, man. Progress! You can't stop progress!" "Uhhhhm, actually, compadre, we can do so much stuff with computers nowadays! That's usability, broseph!"
</p>

<p>
If I sound salty, it's because I am. Deal with it.
</p>

<h3>What were we talking about?</h3>

<p>
Usability, as defined by Wikipedia, is "the capacity of a system to provide a condition for its users to perform the tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience." Its relation to software is further specified: "In software engineering, usability is the degree to which a software can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use."
</p>

<p>
Let's go on with Wikipedia:
</p>

<p>
"The primary notion of usability is that an object designed with a generalized users' psychology and physiology in mind is, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
More efficient to use — takes less time to accomplish a particular task.
</li>
<li>
Easier to learn — operation can be learned by observing the object.
</li>
<li>
More satisfying to use."
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In short, <b>usability is the ease with which a predetermined task can be accomplished.</b> Consequently, "It looks fresh" isn't usability; it's aesthetics. Likewise, the lack of a specific program feature isn't the same as being able to use it as easily, efficiently and safely as possible. Looking for the power switch on a hand-cranked drill is silly, but maybe we should complain if we had to operate power tools with our pinky fingers. Similarly, a word processor without a mail merge function is perhaps intended for other types of word processing - such as writing novels. Hence, <i>being usable in many different situations</i> isn't automatically the same as <i>having a high level of usability</i>.
</p>

<h3>Conceptual consistency</h3>

<p>
In my original text, some arguments deal with static GUI design (such as low contrast or excessive use of screen real estate), but many do not. Some are about consistency: consistency over time, consistency across applications and consistency across platforms.
</p>

<p>
Pure, static GUI design is a <i>subset</i> of usability: poor design choices, such as low contrast and illegible fonts, will lead to worse usability. It is, however, not always clear where to draw the line between what we call GUI (toolkit) design, UI design, usability and UX. One affects the other, roughly in the order listed, from the ground up.
</p>

<p>
All three forms of consistency (across time, application and platform) were, until roughly the release of Windows 8, honoured by most major vendors. When I talk about consistency, it's not to be understood as the exact same look, widget for widget and icon for icon -  it means adhering to basic standard principles of operation. <i>One</i> such example are the "File, Edit, View, Help" dropdown menus, recognizable between different operating systems, programs and UI toolkits. Sure, Java Swing looked a bit different than Win32, but they were still based around the same basic notions and concepts as all the other toolkits on the market.
</p>

<p>
This is not to say that consistency always trumps everything else: sometimes, real improvement of usability <i>can</i> be obtained through a complete interface overhaul. Windows 95 is a good example of that.
</p>

<h3>Show us the research, dude!</h3>

<p>
In discussions like these, there's usually at least one person who shows up to demand data or research, but curiously never presents anything to back up their own claims about modern UI superiority. But, by all means. The concepts I champion have been around for decades. Many of them have been studied in detail, some of them even build on ideas as old as - or older than - computers themselves.
</p>

<p>
One such concept is that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordances</a>, meaning how the look and shape of certain objects communicate information about how the object can be operated. A push button that protrudes from the surrounding surface, for example. Some affordances come more or less naturally, such as the taper and curve of a knife blade indicating the location of the sharpened edge.
</p>

<p>
Affordances can be constructed in computer interfaces using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphism</a>, for example emulating a protruding button through the use of light and dark borders to indicate a 3D bevel around button borders.
</p>

<p>
These are fundamental concepts in all types of industrial design and have been for a long time. Another example is why the Mac, Atari and Amiga all put the menu bar at the top of the screen: it's an oft-used target and should be easy to move the pointer to. This is an adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law">Fitt's law</a>.
</p>

<h3>Industry Standards</h3>

<p>
The basic construction of this menu bar, starting with "File, Edit" was invented at Apple and introduced with the Lisa in 1983. It was then picked up in some similar fashion by nearly all desktops following it: Windows, Mac, GEM, Amiga, OS/2 - the list goes on - until it converged almost completely.
</p>

<p>
Another widespread source of influence was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access">IBM Common User Access</a> from 1987, which among other things introduced the kind of keyboard shortcuts we're still familiar with, and the ellipsis ("...") to indicate menu choices that opened a dialog window.
</p>

<p>
CDE - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Desktop_Environment">Common Desktop Environment</a> - was an effort of several major Unix vendors to standardize a graphical environment across platforms. This was adopted by <i>at least</i> Sun, Hewlett Packard, IBM, DEC (including in OpenVMS), Fujitsu, SCO and (for a short time) Silicon Graphics.
</p>

<p>
In short, anyone claiming that there weren't efforts in creating and maintaining an industry standard regarding UI design is either deeply ignorant or blatantly dishonest.
</p>

<h3>Further principles</h3>

<p>
A lot of my complaints can be described using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction#Thirteen_principles_of_display_design">Thirteen Principles of Display Design</a>, from the book "An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering" by <a href="https://fabbs.org/about/in-honor-of/christopher-wickens-phd/">Christopher D. Wickens</a>, Sallie E. Gordon and Yili Liu. I'll be using Wikipedia's summarized principles here:
</p>

<p>
<b>#2: Avoid absolute judgment limits.</b> Do not ask the user to determine the level of a variable based on a single sensory variable (e.g., color, size, loudness).
</p>
<p>
<b>#5: Similarity causes confusion:</b> Use distinguishable elements.
</p>
<p>
<b>#6: Principle of pictorial realism:</b> A display should look like the variable that it represents.
</p>

<p>
Both judgment limits and similarity apply to window focus indicators: A clearly visible title bar and border in a distinctly different colour from the surrounding windows is a dissimilarity that makes the active window stand out clearly, making it easy to identify.
</p>

<p>
All three principles apply to icons. They used to be colourful little works of art, using both shape and colour make them discernible. Even during the monochrome days, most of them were carefully drawn, pixel by pixel, to represent something clearly distinguishable and identifiable.
</p>

<p>
Today's icons are often extremely stylized to the point of being meaningless, at least without knowing what their predecessors once looked like. Coupled with designs that often make a point of using monochrome icons and low contrast colours, they blur together into an indistinguishable mass of similar-looking geometric primitives.
</p>

<p>
Consider the below icons from Microsoft Outlook, for example. What is the "Archive" icon even supposed to depict? The lower part of a printer, with a sheet of paper sticking out? "Sweep" is most likely a broom - but would you be able to determine that without the text? In the lower toolbar, what's probably a flag might also just be a sketch by Mondrian. I have honestly zero idea what the rightmost icon is supposed to resemble.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://datagubbe.se/usab2/pics/outlook_icons.png" alt="A screenshot of Outlook icons.">
<br>
<img src="https://datagubbe.se/usab2/pics/outlook_icons2.png" alt="Another screenshot of Outlook icons.">
</p>

<p>
<b>#8: Minimizing information access cost or interaction cost.</b> (...) A display design should minimize this cost by allowing frequently accessed sources to be located at the nearest possible position.
</p>
<p>
<b>#9: Proximity compatibility principle.</b> Divided attention between two information sources may be necessary for the completion of one task. These sources must be mentally integrated and are defined to have close mental proximity. Information access costs should be low.
</p>

<p>
The modern design paradigm is all about running applications in full screen mode, with large UI elements and ample white space. It's true that information density must be balanced. Interfaces that are too cramped will become illegible and distracting - but interfaces that rely on full screen hegemony don't work as well when a user needs to see two programs at once on one screen.
</p>

<p>
MDI:s (multiple document interfaces) do exist in modern apps, but they're often less flexible than in traditional programs, where free-floating sub-windows could be tiled, stacked, resized and placed according to the user's desire. Users of the old IRC client mIRC will perhaps remember its in-app window management facilities, sorely lacking from modern counterparts like Teams, Slack and Discord.
</p>

<p>
The hamburger menu also comes to mind. Compared to traditional menu bars, it counteracts Fitt's law, impedes discoverability and often increases the amount of clicks needed to navigate.
</p>

<p>
Hidden scroll bars not only hides information from the user - they also completely disregard Fitt's law: you cannot reliably aim your mouse at an invisible object.
</p>

<p>
<b>#13: Principle of consistency.</b> Old habits from other displays will easily transfer to support the processing of new displays if they are designed consistently.
</p>

<p>
I guess throwing out 30-40 years of design and interaction tenets basically overnight can be described as slightly counter to this principle.
</p>

<h3>Counterexample: Considering mIRC</h3>

<p>
The mIRC interface was in no way <i>perfect</i>, and yet it was so advanced we're apparently no longer able to recreate it:
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://datagubbe.se/usab2/pics/mirc1.png" alt="A screenshot of the mIRC IRC client.">
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A look and feel that corresponds exactly to a large number of
other Windows programs at the time.
</li>
<li>
Unambiguous demarcation of window focus.
</li>
<li>
Clear visual separation of content and program functionality.
</li>
<li>
A menu bar with categorized commands for fast discoverability.
</li>
<li>
Beveled separators indicating related functions.
</li>
<li>
Icons discernible through both shape and colour.
</li>
<li>
Always visible scroll bars, clearly indicating the current position in the chat backlog.
</li>
<li>
Complete user freedom of window - and thus information - positioning.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>How about showing me some research?</h3>

<p>
The above principles can be used to critique many other trends in contemporary UI crafting. The following examples have been reiterated ad nauseam, but let's do another round:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
Lack of affordances, E.G. buttons and other clickable elements that don't clearly and distinctly communicate their function.
</li>
<li>
Ambiguous state, E.G. highly stylized slide switches instead of checkboxes.
</li>
<li>
Flat design and low contrast in general. 3D bevels help with many different concepts including discoverability (what's clickable), distinction (raised above or sunk into the UI) and Fitt's law (clear demarcation of borders makes the size of a target easy to identify).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm deeply interested in seeing "data and research" from proponents of modern UI concepts. What kind of research was behind Microsoft's various changes in Windows 8, for example? I'm unsure, since they immediately backtracked plenty of them in version 8.1 and 10 - including reinstating the Start menu.
</p>

<p>
Putting UI elements in Window titlebars is often rationalized by "saving screen real estate". How, then, is Microsoft's gargauntan "ribbon"-style toolbars rationalized - and what type of research and data prompted their introduction? There are many more examples, but I'm specifically picking Microsoft here because if there's one company with enough cash to fund some science, it's got to be them.
</p>

<p>
Auto-hiding scroll bars, shrinking the draggable area of window titles and cramming the bulk of a program's functionality inside a cramped hamburger menu are, as discussed above, blatantly breaking a number of well known UI design principles. Surely - <i>surely</i> - that's because of the incredible amount of meticulous research underpinning those decisions. And surely - <i>surely</i> - considering how prevalent this paradigm is today, any UI designer worth their salt can recite the very good reasons for and many benefits of these concepts in their sleep?
</p>

<h3>Consistency over time</h3>

<p>
Plenty of programs change something about the UI in some way in almost every new version - and new versions are released very often these days. Firefox is a prime example of this, shuffling things around or changing the way they look and behave in nearly every update. A lot of Firefox users then get very angry and either 1) Find ways to patch away the new changes, or 2) Simply power through and get used to them, having to relearn workflows and recondition muscle memory. Then a new version comes along, and the cycle repeats.
</p>

<p>
<b>Is there any reflection here?</b> Do software vendors research how this affects usability? Do they actually learn something from these constant redesigns - as in, are new patterns and best practices formed and adhered to - or is it just, in fact, tweaking things randomly for the sake of tweaking? Are things genuinely getting gradually <i>better</i> or are they just getting gradually <i>different</i>? I'm genuinely curious about the processes and methods behind our new, supposedly superior UI paradigm, because <i>I can't seem to discern any</i>.
</p>

<p>
A perfect example of this Sudden Redesign Syndrome occurred very recently. Yes, it's Slack again, going about their usual crazy antics. This time it's not inconsistency over time or across platforms. No, I was recently blessed with <i>two completely different UI designs in the very same application, on the very same device</i>. One of the two "slacks" I'm a member of recently got a UI update - and the other didn't. The effect is that when I switch between the slacks, inside the same program instance, the whole UI changes. This has now been the case for several months, on both iOS and Linux, which leads me to believe it's intentional.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://datagubbe.se/usab2/pics/slack_ed.png" alt="A screenshot comparison of old and new Slack interfaces.">
<br>
<i>Yes, this is how two different "slacks" look in the same instance of the same program.</i>
</p>

<p>
Slack is not some backwater cottage industry. It's a big company with thousands of employees and millions of users - many of whom are paying good money for their software. It would be interesting indeed to see the research, data and rationale behind this particular decision. It would also be interesting to know what the new design offers in usability that the old one didn't, and if these improvements (if, indeed, there are any) are significant enough to force every single user to re-learn the application interface once more.
</p>

<p>
I'm not advocating for complete rigidity in all programs forever, but there's great value in consistency over time. As an end user, the constant redesigns I'm now subjected to makes me feel more like a lab rat than someone entrusted to use a tool. I'm running around in a maze built by a bunch of developers and designers, hunting for a piece of cheese that constantly teleports to a new location. All the while I'm thinking: If modern application design is so great, why does everyone feel the need to change it all the time?
</p>

<h3>Yes, it's usability</h3>

<p>
The above examples and counterexamples are all about usability, as in the ease with which a computer environment lets a user accomplish a specific, predefined task. Identifying basic UI components, pointing at and clicking on them, and being able to quickly locate program features are all crucial and fundamental activities when using software.
</p>

<p>
Most (though not all) programs with the modern design approach seem to focus on one or a few major functions and hide everything else. I don't know where this idea originates, but a quote from web usability bigwig Jakob Nielsen comes to mind: "There is no such thing as a training class or a manual for a website. People have to be able to grasp the functioning of the site immediately after scanning the home page for a few seconds."
</p>

<p>
Many contemporary application designers seem to have this quote as their sole tenet, and forget that it was uttered in the year 2000, about shopping sites, when the expression "home page" was still used unironically.
</p>

<p>
This approach may still be of value in phone apps with similar purposes, such as immediately letting the user get started with "creating" funny AI selfie edits while bombarding them with ads and siphoning off their location data. However, mobile apps designed for leisurely entertainment translate badly into complex desktop applications built for power user productivity. The old desktop design paradigm may not have been perfect, but it did at the very least offer basic, transferable patterns for finding and operating advanced features.
</p>

<p>
This translation of mobile paradigms to the desktop ends after the first few clicks for completing basic tasks. After that, designers/developers (and hence users) no longer have a clearly defined set of rules to adhere and adapt to. Instead, we're treated to various new inventions that differ not only between platforms and applications, but is also constantly and suddenly changing between versions of the same program.
</p>

<h3>Nonstandard and Poor</h3>

<p>
Consider <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/hig/principles.html">Gnome's human interface guidelines</a>. Their basic principles aren't all bad, but once a program grows more complex, they break down fast. The end result for both developers, designers and users is <b>conceptual poverty</b>. By that I mean that developers using only Gnome are likely to start <i>losing valuable concepts</i> when thinking about UI - and thus program - design.
</p>

<p>
Take Blender, for example. The below screenshot was kindly provided by a friend who is a professional graphics artist. Yes, it looks complex, but that's because modern graphics creation is a highly complex process. Blender has a massive feature set and a plethora of parameters that can (and must) be tweaked to create the kind of stunning 3D scenes we've come to expect today.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://datagubbe.se/usab2/pics/blender/image1.png" alt="A screenshot of a complex Blender session."><img src="https://datagubbe.se/usab2/pics/blender/image1_scaled.jpg"></a><br>
<i>Click to view full resolution.</i>
</p>

<p>
I honestly can't see how a program like Blender could possibly be created using Gnome's guidelines - or indeed toolkit: certain time-tested UI elements aren't even allowed in Gnome anymore, such as menu bars and hierarchical pull down menus. "Progressive disclosure" and the prevailing interpretation of "navigation structures" means completely replacing certain parts of the interface with others - instead of letting the user decide what's relevant for them to see at any given moment. "Frequently used actions should be close at hand" - but in a program like Blender, frequently used actions vary profoundly with what kind of project is being worked on and what stage that project is in. I find it unlikely that a developer can make such judgement calls better than a user spending tens of thousands of hours in the program during the span of a career. Then again, "Focus on one situation, one type of experience." is rather telling. Using software professionally isn't about having a chic, boutique <i>experience</i> - it's about getting the job done as quickly and efficiently as possible. <b>Sometimes, that means working with irreducible complexity.</b>
</p>

<p>
This applies to a multitude of other professional software titles used in actually productive work, whether it's photo editing, CAD, software development or corporate management. There have been some efforts to "modernize" the UI of, for example, Excel - but in contrast to Teams, the olden ways are still prevalent in Microsoft's spreadsheet offering. I dare say it's impossible to replace its pull down menus, floating settings windows and other time-tested concepts, because the program is too complex and too powerful to fit into any dumbed-down, modern paradigm. Incidentally, Outlook is perhaps now at a point where it combines the worst of both worlds.
</p>

<h3>Getting old</h3>

<p>
I have personally, in some capacity, used Amiga Workbench, Atari GEM/TOS, MacOS Classic (6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.x), MacOS X (various versions), Windows (3.1, 95, 98, NT4, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10), SGI's IndigoMagic, Sun's OpenLook, BeOS, CDE, OS/2 Warp, NeXTStep, RiscOS, Gnome (1, 2, 3), KDE (various versions), Plan 9 and probably a handful more. I've used computers for 35 years and worked as a software developer for a quarter century. I've used a wide variety of software packages for photo editing, image creation, 3D graphics, spreadsheets, word processing, text editing, composing music, sound editing, desktop publishing, online communication and software development - to name a few. In short, I think it's safe to say that I have some experience with user interfaces and experimenting my way around systems and programs.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of Plan 9 and RiscOS, all of those systems, and a majority of the applications running on them, were instantly recognizable and usable for me up until (roughly) the release of Gnome 3 and Windows 8. Of course they each had their own quirks and idiosyncrasies, but the mental model I had built when using one system was easily translatable to all the other ones.
</p>

<p>
I could swiftly accomplish basic tasks in programs on the various platforms, including management of the programs themselves, such as determining which window was focused, what was a button and not, how to find advanced features, how to learn keyboard shortcuts, etc. Fundamental functions had fixed homes (Save and Open under File, for example) and the way to access them was sufficiently similar. This was efficient (learn one concept, apply it everywhere), easy to use (observe one system/program, operate all of them) and thus satisfying: my skills are transferable!
</p>

<p>
Today, I struggle with a lot of applications in <i>very basic ways</i>. In some incarnation of Outlook for iOS, for example, I couldn't figure out how to <i>compose a new mail</i> without scrutinizing every single element on the screen meticulously. The similar basic task of creating a new ticket in Jira once had me taking a long, hard survey of the entire screen before I figured out where the relevant button was - and that it was, in fact, a button. These are core functions of both applications, and someone with my background struggling to find them isn't exactly a testament to an overall improvement in usability.
</p>

<p>
Being able to quickly discern window focus isn't a mere aesthetic preference. When I was running Windows 10 on a multi-screen setup, I often came back to my computer from lunch or a meeting and started typing - but no text appeared where I expected it to. I then had to hunt across screens to locate the window which did in fact have focus. This ventures way past "ease of task accomplishment" and well into "safety" territory: accidentally spreading sensitive information to the wrong audience, for example.
</p>

<p>
Yes, these are both anecdotal accounts - but the solutions to both of these problems have been known <i>and</i> implemented for a very long time. These existing solutions were then removed on mere whims, and replacements have yet to materialize. This is not progress - it is, at best, a regression to the early days of experimental GUI prototypes at Xerox PARC.
</p>

<h3>Finally</h3>
<p>
I understand it's tempting to dismiss my views as those of some old codger unable to get with the times. In some ways, I freely admit that's an accurate assessment - but is that really an argument <i>for</i> the current UI paradigm?
</p>

<p>
Surely - <i>surely</i> - the point of all the alleged usability research being carried out today isn't to make experienced power users feel downright stupid. Surely - <i>surely</i> - the goal of usability shouldn't be to rob such users of time-tested, well-researched, efficient, effective, safe and satisfying ways to do things.
</p>

<p>
And surely - <i>surely</i> - if the modern UI paradigm is in fact well-established, well-researched and efficient, UI:s wouldn't change so damn much all the time.

  <article>

    



    <p id="post-leadin-newsletter-signup">The Marshall Project is a nonprofit newsroom covering the U.S. criminal justice system. <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/newsletters?ref=post-leadin&amp;newsletters=ca,li,ex">Sign up for our newsletters</a> to receive all of our stories and analysis.</p>


  <p><span></span><span>T</span>he handwritten letter arrived days before Christmas 2022. “THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ISSUE!!!” it began. “PLEASE HELP.” Signed by 14 people incarcerated in one of the highest security federal prisons in the country, the letter was an urgent warning for prison officials: Several corrections officers were trying to bribe prisoners to attack the warden and one of his captains.</p>



<p>Three men said officers “offered to poorly tighten their hand restraints” during the warden’s walk-through “so that the inmate can easily slip his hand restraints and carry out a physical assault,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24129030-thomson-letter-bergami-threats">according to the letter.</a> Guards had offered the men extra food trays and other favors, and promised not to injure them after the attack. The men wrote that officers were angry about changes by the new warden.</p>

<p>Thomas Bergami had taken over the Thomson penitentiary in western Illinois nine months earlier — tasked with fixing a prison where <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/05/31/how-the-newest-federal-prison-became-one-of-the-deadliest">five prisoners were killed</a> in recent years and where <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/07/06/illinois-federal-prison-usp-thomson-abuse">more than 120 people</a> have reported serious abuse.</p>





<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24131890-threat-to-warden-follow-up-letter">A second letter</a> delivered soon after the first made similar claims, and said that officers suggested someone stab the officials. An investigator from the Bureau of Prisons interviewed some of the men who signed the letters and found the information they provided “fairly consistent,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24126709-bop-investigation-letter">according to his report</a>. But because “none provided specific dates or times of the allegation,” the agent wrote, he “could not confirm nor refute” their accounts. Bergami, who retired this summer, said in an interview that the officers on that unit, who had been taken off their posts, returned to work days later.</p>

<p>“When the regional director called me and said, ‘Well, they looked into it and put those guys back on their post,’ I'm like, ‘Are you freaking kidding me right now?’” Bergami said. “My staff were saying to stab me and the captain. I’ve got to worry about our safety.”</p>

<p>Bureau officials did not respond to questions about the letters and the investigation. The explosive allegation is among several incidents that Bergami and his former top deputy at Thomson recalled in recent interviews with The Marshall Project and NPR, detailing what they described as a culture of abuse and impunity at the prison.</p>

<p>Their accounts, together with interviews with other Thomson employees and dozens of internal bureau documents reviewed by the news organizations, depict a prison where officials were unable to fire guards they considered dangerous, the officers’ union resisted management’s efforts to hold staff accountable, and other managers at the agency undermined their efforts to make change.</p>



<p>Bergami said he realized from his first day at Thomson, where more than 1,400 men are held, that the prison had an “enormous problem with inmate abuse,” including falsifying charges against Black prisoners and keeping men in painful restraints for days. The attitude of staff there, he said, was <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24129013-concerns-memo">“the worst I’ve seen in 31 years</a>” working in corrections.</p>

<p>When Bergami arrived, Thomson was home to the “Special Management Unit,” a program meant for the most disruptive people in federal custody. But the unit was racked by violence: The Marshall Project and NPR <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/05/31/how-the-newest-federal-prison-became-one-of-the-deadliest">published an investigation</a> last year into multiple deaths at the prison and accounts of extreme mistreatment.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Prisons closed that <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/02/14/bureau-of-prisons-thomson-illinois">unit in February</a>, concerned over the misconduct there. The prison has since been converted to a <a href="https://www.bop.gov/resources/news/20230829_mission_change_for_usp_thomson_announced.jsp#:%7E:text=(BOP)%20%2D%20The%20Federal%20Bureau,to%20a%20Low%20security%20institution.">low-security institution</a>. But according to current staff and families of people incarcerated there, the <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/07/06/illinois-federal-prison-usp-thomson-abuse">abusive environment persists</a>.</p>

<p>In a statement, Randilee Giamusso, a spokesperson for the bureau, said the agency is working to address employee misconduct, and that “developing meaningful change throughout the agency is not something that happens in a moment.”</p>

<p>Jonathan Zumkehr, president of the union that represents officers at Thomson, rejected allegations of mistreatment there. “I will disagree 100%. That didn't happen,” he said. He criticized Bergami for “blaming staff” for incidents that happened under his leadership. “We have great staff at Thomson,” Zumkehr said. “If anybody committed any of those horrible acts, we want them held accountable.”</p>

<p>Damon Jackson was one of the men who signed the first letter warning Bergami. In a phone interview, Jackson recalled officers offering an MP3 player or extra food, telling his cellmate, “If something happened to the warden, they gonna take care of him.” After the letter, Jackson said the investigator spoke to a few people who signed it, but not to him. “We never heard nothing back after that,” Jackson said.</p>

<p>Jackson and the others were moved to other prisons after the Special Management Unit closed. He said officers “felt like the warden was too soft, was too pro-inmate. They wanted to get him out of the way so they could continue beating inmates and run the prison the way they wanted to run it.”</p>



<p><span></span><span>B</span>ergami was the warden of a medium-security federal prison in New Jersey when bureau officials asked him to run Thomson. He hired Denny Whitmore, another 30-year veteran of the federal prison system, as his associate warden. When they arrived at Thomson in Spring 2022, they were shocked by some of the staff’s practices.</p>

<p>Agency policy prevented Bergami and Whitmore, who also retired this summer, from speaking publicly about the prison without authorization while they worked there. They said they felt that reporting the abuse at Thomson to their superiors at the agency <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24136658-whitmore-downgrade-letter#document/p2/a2402821">blocked their own advancement opportunities</a>, so they chose to retire instead.</p>

<p>Both said when they arrived they were distressed to see officers walk people in shackles backward down the stairs, one officer on each arm, and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24130730-excerpt-from-bop-site-visit-april-2022#document/p1/a2402340">a third controlling the prisoner’s head</a>. Bergami <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24130731-bergami-email-about-enhanced-escort-technique#document/p1/a2402337">wrote to his superiors</a> that he had never seen that method in any operations manual and that he found it dangerous and unnecessary. Bergami and Whitmore said staff also would move prisoners across the yard in freezing winter weather with no shoes or coat on.</p>



<p>They also saw guards routinely use “black box” handcuffs, meant only for the most dangerous transfers, to move people in low-security custody. With this device, the chain connecting the cuffs is covered by a hard plastic box that further restricts movement.</p>

<p>Bergami said he ordered staff to stop using the black box handcuffs, and to change how they transferred people. But some officers pushed back. One officer “was talking about how he was going to use the black box anyways, even if not authorized by the administration,” a staff member wrote in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24137773-black-box-memo">a June memo</a> that Bergami provided to The Marshall Project and NPR. “I observed [the officer] to say, ‘that f—-- motherfucker in charge,’ when discussing Warden Bergami,” the memo continued, using a gay slur.</p>

<p>From the beginning, Bergami clashed with Zumkehr, the union president, who Bergami said encouraged staff to flout bureau policy. Multiple memos and emails detail their antagonistic relationship.</p>

<p>In interviews with local media, Zumkehr said that Bergami’s “ever-changing policies and procedures” put staff at risk, and <a href="https://www.wqad.com/article/news/local/usp-thomson-prison-staff-union-letter-warden-bergami-removal/526-a0268ec5-9d51-4ced-9a0e-1b6e1f0f57fa">called for his firing</a>. “In recent months we have had an abundance of serious incidents which took place under the Thomas Bergami leadership,” Zumkehr wrote in a July 2022 letter, saying that managers were “placing the hard-working staff in limbo.”</p>

<p>Bergami said staff also frequently <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/10/26/28-days-in-chains">used “four-point restraints,”</a> a tactic meant as a last resort. People in four-points are splayed spread-eagled, with each of their limbs shackled to a corner of a bed. People incarcerated at Thomson reported being held this way for hours — or days — at a time. Many said they weren’t fed or allowed to use the bathroom, forcing them to lay in their own waste. “It's really akin to a torture chamber,” one attorney <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/05/31/how-the-newest-federal-prison-became-one-of-the-deadliest">told The Marshall Project and NPR</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5566_006.pdf">Bureau policy</a> says four-points are meant as a rare and short-term intervention, when they are “the only means available to obtain and maintain control over an inmate.” The warden has to approve their continued use. Concerned the restraints were being overused, Bergami said he began requiring staff to videotape checks on people who were chained down. When he watched some of those recordings, the men in shackles were compliant — making the four-point restraint unnecessary, Bergami said.</p>

<p>“He was cool as a cucumber,” he said of a prisoner. “It didn’t add up.”</p>

<p>Zumkehr said that staff were following bureau rules when using four-points. “How can you say that my staff are torturing inmates when they're following the bureau policy?” he said.</p>

<p>Some restraints were applied so tightly they left scars, which prisoners called “The Thomson tattoo.” Bergami asked medical staff for a count of how many people there had this injury. They found over 90 people with the scars.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/09/13/2023/oversight-of-the-federal-bureau-of-prisons">a September congressional hearing</a>, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois called the conditions at Thomson “stunning” and “sickening.”</p>

<p>Bergami said he tried to fire at least three officers who were found by internal investigators to have abused people in their custody, but his superiors blocked him each time. One of the officers Bergami said he tried to fire was named in two separate lawsuits alleging he slammed two prisoners’ faces into the concrete floor, knocking one unconscious, according to court records. Neither person suing had an attorney, and both cases were dismissed. Efforts to reach the officer were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>That officer was “recommended for termination” by employment personnel at the bureau and by Bergami, according to the former warden and Whitmore. But they said other agency officials overruled the recommendation. The Bureau of Prisons confirmed that the officer is still working at Thomson but declined to answer other questions about the case. Another staffer who Bergami said he tried to terminate is now working at a different federal prison.</p>

<p>The bureau’s regional director for Thomson, Andre Matevousian, declined to comment. Giamusso, the bureau spokesperson, said, “the vast majority of our employees are hardworking, ethical, diligent corrections professionals, who act with integrity daily and want those engaging in misconduct to be held accountable.”</p>

<p>Bergami and Whitmore said they also tried to fire an officer who they saw on video throwing away prisoners’ mail, a possible felony. The agency also overruled them in that decision, they said. The bureau did not respond to allegations of staff destroying mail.</p>

<p>“How do you root out the bad apples if you're not allowed to terminate those who have been recommended for termination?” Whitmore said.</p>

<p>The two former Thomson officials and a current prison employee said the attitude among many guards was reflected by a group who refused to wear their issued uniforms. These officers opted instead for black T-shirts, many with the union logo or the skull logo of The Punisher — a vigilante comic book character popular with far-right groups. They called themselves “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24136625-bop-conflict-resolution-site-visit-jan-2023#document/p3/a2402811">The Black Shirt Mafia</a>.”</p>

<p>Zumkehr said he had never heard staff use that phrase, but that many staffers wore black union sweatshirts, which he said Bergami initially approved.</p>

<p>Thomson officials and the union also clashed about what staff referred to as “205s”: incarcerated men who masturbated in their cells in front of officers as a means of sexual harassment. Staff members told the union that prison officials were failing to protect them from such assaults, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24136625-bop-conflict-resolution-site-visit-jan-2023#document/p1/a2402807">according to a report</a> from a site visit by bureau employees and national union staff. Union officials told local media that there were <a href="https://www.afge.org/publication/union-representing-usp-thomson-staff-calls-for-action-to-address-rampant-sexual-assaults-by-inmates-against-employees">over 500</a> instances of this in 2021. This summer, the union successfully lobbied to pass <a href="https://www.wqad.com/article/news/local/as-seen-on-tv/illinois-prison-law-punish-sexual-attacks-assults-expose/526-c37b43e4-f605-46f6-8baf-e1b318f5f276">a state law</a> in Illinois that will make repeat “lewd exposures” in prison a felony offense.</p>

<p>Bergami and Whitmore said many of these reports were falsified as an excuse to punish Black prisoners and segregate them on a specific tier for men accused of such acts. Other Thomson employees, who spoke to The Marshall Project and NPR, also said some staffers made up incidents. The site visit report also noted that “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24136625-bop-conflict-resolution-site-visit-jan-2023#document/p3/a2402809">inmates of color are terrified of the correctional officers</a>.” Current and former Thomson employees said that racism was rampant at Thomson, directed toward both the incarcerated and staff members of color. According to the bureau, roughly 83% of Thomson staff are White.</p>

<p>In a statement, Giamusso, the bureau spokesperson, did not respond to specific questions about the sexual misconduct allegations or the claim that they were sometimes falsified. She said all staff receive mandatory diversity management training every year.</p>

<p>Zumkehr denied that staff members made up incidents, and said that if they did, Bergami should have referred those staffers for misconduct investigations. “When the warden is saying all staff are faking it, we're encouraging staff not to report this now,” he said.</p>

<p>At the Senate judiciary hearing in September, bureau Director Colette Peters spoke about the decision to close the Special Management Unit at Thomson, citing abuse and misconduct. “I too, hadn't seen anything like that in my 30-plus year career in corrections,” she said.</p>

<p>Peters also told senators that officers who engaged in abuse were facing administrative and criminal investigation. Giamusso, the bureau spokesperson, said the agency is “actively rooting out and addressing employee misconduct,” but did not provide details on the status of such investigations.</p>

<p>Staffers and families of people at Thomson said the mistreatment continues. Several said the facility still felt like a maximum security prison. They said their loved ones have been called racial slurs, denied visits or held in solitary confinement for months with little justification.</p>

<p>Bergami said there’s only one way forward: shutting Thomson down entirely.</p>

<p>“We don't want anyone to ever have to go through what we went through. More importantly, the inmates that are housed under our care are still being abused,” he said in a recent interview. “Where is the accountability?”</p>

<div>

<p>For those in the market for an AMD Ryzen 7040 series (Zen 4) laptop, the Framework 13 laptop is a great option for those wanting a Linux-friendly device and is a rare breed in being a completely upgradeable laptop similar to Framework's Intel laptop models. I've been testing out the Framework Laptop 13 the past month and after a BIOS update has been working out wonderfully on Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_1_med" alt="Framework 13 AMD laptop with Linux"></a></p>
<p>While there was <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/v">an initial BIOS issue affecting the integrated graphics</a> for the Framework 13 AMD, later in October <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Ryzen-Framework-Linux-BIOS">an updated BIOS was made available</a> and since then this AMD Zen 4 modular laptop has been working out great under Linux. While the initial BIOS regression causing graphics issues were frustrating, at least with Framework embracing Linux they make their system firmware/BIOS updates available via Fwupd/LVFS for easy firmware updates on Linux. Since that latest BIOS release I haven't been challenged by any Linux issues with this laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_2_med" alt="Framework 13 AMD laptop top"></a></p>
<p>The Framework Laptop 13 is just as upgradeable and modular as <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/framework-laptop">the original Framework laptop with Intel hardware</a>. Everything from the motherboard to battery are easily replaceable as well as the various ports of the laptop. There are four bays on the Framework laptop for choosing your combination of USB-C / USB-A / HDMI / DisplayPort / microSD / Ethernet / audio ports on the laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_3_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_3_med" alt="Framework ports"></a></p>
<p>It's refreshing how upgradeable the Framework Laptop is and now the company has proved itself across 11th Gen / 12th Gen / 13th Gen Intel Core processors with upgradeable motherboards and now their first product on the AMD side with this Ryzen 7040 series offering. Since looking at the original Framework laptop in 2021, there's been new customization options to come too such as different bezel options.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_4_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_4_med" alt="Framework 13 AMD laptop"></a></p>
<p>Another pleasant change since looking at the original Framework laptop in 2021 has been the company providing even better Linux support. Framework has improved their Linux documentation and making further inroads to ensure their Linux customers have a great experience. <a href="https://frame.work/linux">Frame.work/linux</a> outlines the compatibility items for their Intel and AMD based laptops. For their Ryzen 7040 series laptop they are recommending Fedora 39 or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, but of course newer distributions also work great like Ubuntu 23.10. The only notable Linux support caveat for the current hardware is possible fingerprint reader issues if not running on the latest firmware. The level of documentation around setting up Linux on the Framework laptop is among the best I've seen from any hardware vendor for helping out novice Linux users getting started or just trying to find out about any possible/necessary workarounds depending upon your distribution.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_5_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_5_med" alt="Framework 13 AMD side"></a></p>
<p>Another excellent aspect of the new Framework 13 (and 16) AMD laptops is that the EC firmware is open-source. The embedded controller is based on the Google Chromebook EC and making use of Zephyr. With most laptop vendors not providing open-source EC support while the EC is often the source of various quirky behavior and bugs faced by users, having Framework support an open-source EC is refreshing. One step further it would be great if the Framework 13 AMD laptop made use of Coreboot, but alas that's not the case. Hopefully though that will become more of a reality as AMD OpenSIL hits production in ~2026 and that we continue seeing more open-source firmware efforts invested by Framework.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_6_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-13-amd&amp;image=framework_13amd_6_med" alt="Framework 13 AMD laptop side profile"></a></p>
<p>With many Linux pre-loaded laptops still using AMD Zen 3 (or older) SoCs, it's great Framework is making use of Zen 4 as the performance and power benefits are very much worth it as I've shared across various other laptop benchmarking articles... Zen 4 with efficient AVX-512 and all of its other architectural improvements are great and having integrated RDNA3 graphics is wonderful. Let's move on to looking at some benchmarks of the Framework 13 AMD laptop and thanks to Framework for providing this laptop for review.</p>

Both custom silicon chips are designed to power its Azure data centers and ready the company and its enterprise customers for a future full of AI. </p><p>Microsoft’s Azure Maia AI chip and Arm-powered Azure Cobalt CPU are arriving in 2024, on the back of a surge in demand this year for Nvidia’s H100 GPUs that are widely used to train and operate generative image tools and large language models. There’s such high demand for these GPUs that some have even fetched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/14/nvidias-h100-ai-chips-selling-for-more-than-40000-on-ebay.html">more than $40,000 on eBay</a>.</p><p>“Microsoft actually has a long history in silicon development,” explains Rani Borkar, head of Azure hardware systems and infrastructure at Microsoft, in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. Microsoft collaborated on silicon for the Xbox more than 20 years ago and has even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20888999/microsoft-surface-pro-x-laptop-3-custom-processor-qualcomm-amd-specs">co-engineered chips for its Surface devices</a>. “These efforts are built on that experience,” says Borkar. “In 2017, we began architecting the cloud hardware stack and we began on that journey putting us on track to build our new custom chips.”</p><p>The new Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt CPU are both built in-house at Microsoft, combined with a deep overhaul of its entire cloud server stack to optimize performance, power, and cost. “We are rethinking the cloud infrastructure for the era of AI, and literally optimizing every layer of that infrastructure,” says Borkar.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="The first two custom silicon chips designed by Microsoft for its cloud infrastructure." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/376x251/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/384x256/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/415x277/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/480x320/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/540x360/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/640x427/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/750x500/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/828x552/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/1080x720/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/1200x800/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/1440x960/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/1920x1280/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/2048x1365/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/2400x1600/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/2400x1600/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083327/5._Azure_Maia_100_and_Azure_Cobalt_100.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>The first two custom silicon chips designed by Microsoft for its cloud infrastructure.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div></div><p>The Azure Cobalt CPU, named after the blue pigment, is a 128-core chip that’s built on an Arm Neoverse CSS design and customized for Microsoft. It’s designed to power general cloud services on Azure. “We’ve put a lot of thought into not just getting it to be highly performant, but also making sure we’re mindful of power management,” explains Borkar. “We made some very intentional design choices, including the ability to control performance and power consumption per core and on every single virtual machine.”</p><p>Microsoft is currently testing its Cobalt CPU on workloads like Microsoft Teams and SQL server, with plans to make virtual machines available to customers next year for a variety of workloads. While Borkar wouldn’t be drawn into direct comparisons with Amazon’s Graviton 3 servers that are available on AWS, there should be some noticeable performance gains over the Arm-based servers Microsoft is currently using for Azure. “Our initial testing shows that our performance is up to 40 percent better than what’s currently in our data centers that use commercial Arm servers,” says Borkar. Microsoft isn’t sharing full system specifications or benchmarks yet.</p><p>Microsoft’s Maia 100 AI accelerator, named after a bright blue star, is designed for running cloud AI workloads, like large language model training and inference. It will be used to power some of the company’s largest AI workloads on Azure, including parts of the multibillion-dollar <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567448/microsoft-openai-partnership-extension-ai">partnership with OpenAI</a> where Microsoft powers all of OpenAI’s workloads. The software giant has been collaborating with OpenAI on the design and testing phases of Maia. </p><p>“We were excited when Microsoft first shared their designs for the Maia chip, and we’ve worked together to refine and test it with our models,” says Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. “Azure’s end-to-end AI architecture, now optimized down to the silicon with Maia, paves the way for training more capable models and making those models cheaper for our customers.”</p><p>Manufactured on a 5-nanometer TSMC process, Maia has 105 billion transistors — around 30 percent fewer than the 153 billion found on AMD’s own Nvidia competitor, the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/partner/articles/ai-ready-solutions.html">MI300X AI GPU</a>. “Maia supports our first implementation of the sub 8-bit data types, MX data types, in order to co-design hardware and software,” says Borkar. “This helps us support faster model training and inference times.”</p><p>Microsoft is part of a group that includes AMD, Arm, Intel, Meta, Nvidia, and Qualcomm that are standardizing the next generation of data formats for AI models. Microsoft is building on the collaborative and open work of the <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/blog/amd-arm-intel-meta-microsoft-nvidia-and-qualcomm-standardize-next-generation-narrow-precision-data-formats-for-ai">Open Compute Project (OCP)</a> to adapt entire systems to the needs of AI.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A probe station used to test Microsoft’s Azure Cobalt system-on-chip." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/376x251/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/384x256/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/415x277/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/480x320/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/540x360/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/640x427/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/750x500/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/828x552/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/1080x720/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/1200x800/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/1440x960/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/1920x1280/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/2048x1365/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/2400x1600/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/2400x1600/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083329/10._Probe_station_close_up.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>A probe station used to test Microsoft’s Azure Cobalt system-on-chip.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div></div><p>“Maia is the first complete liquid cooled server processor built by Microsoft,” reveals Borkar. “The goal here was to enable higher density of servers at higher efficiencies. Because we’re reimagining the entire stack we purposely think through every layer, so these systems are actually going to fit in our current data center footprint.”</p><p>That’s key for Microsoft to spin these AI servers up more quickly without having to make room for them in data centers around the world. Microsoft built a unique rack to house Maia server boards in, complete with a “sidekick” liquid chiller that works like a radiator you’d find in your car or a fancy gaming PC to cool the surface of the Maia chips.</p><p>Along with sharing MX data types, Microsoft is also sharing its rack designs with its partners  so they can use them on systems with other silicon inside. But the Maia chip designs won’t be shared more broadly, Microsoft is keeping those in-house.</p><p>Maia 100 is currently being tested on GPT 3.5 Turbo, the same model that powers ChatGPT, Bing AI workloads, and GitHub Copilot. Microsoft is in the early phases of deployment and much like Cobalt it isn’t willing to release exact Maia specifications or performance benchmarks just yet.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="The Maia 100 server rack and “sidekick” cooling." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/376x251/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/384x256/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/415x277/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/480x320/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/540x360/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/640x427/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/750x500/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/828x552/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/1080x720/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/1200x800/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/1440x960/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/1920x1280/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/2048x1365/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/2400x1600/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1613x1075/2400x1600/filters:focal(807x538:808x539):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25083330/9.Server_Rack_and_Cooling_Sidekick.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>The Maia 100 server rack and “sidekick” cooling.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div></div><p>That makes it difficult to decipher exactly how Maia will compare to Nvidia’s popular <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22989182/nvidia-ai-hopper-architecture-h100-gpu-eos-supercomputer">H100 GPU</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/13/23958823/nvidia-h200-ai-gpu-announced-specs-release-date">recently announced H200</a>, or even AMD’s latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-instinct-mi300x-mi300a-ai-accelerators-detailed-cdna-3-zen-4-come-advanced-packaging-marvel/">MI300X</a>. Borkar didn’t want to discuss comparisons, instead reiterating that partnerships with Nvidia and AMD are still very key for the future of Azure’s AI cloud. “At the scale at which the cloud operates, it’s really important to optimize and integrate every layer of the stack, to maximize performance, to diversify the supply chain, and frankly to give our customers infrastructure choices,” says Borkar. </p><p>That diversification of supply chains is important to Microsoft, particularly when Nvidia is the key supplier of AI server chips right now and companies have been racing to buy up these chips. Estimates <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20230301-11584.html">have suggested</a> OpenAI needed more than 30,000 of Nvidia’s older A100 GPUs for the commercialization of ChatGPT, so Microsoft’s own chips could help lower the cost of AI for its customers. Microsoft has also developed these chips for its own Azure cloud workloads, not to sell to others like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm all do.</p><p>“I look at this more as&nbsp;complementary, not competing with them,” insists Borkar. “We have both Intel and AMD in our cloud compute today, and similarly on AI we are announcing AMD where we already have Nvidia today. These partners are very important to our infrastructure, and we really want to give our customers the choices.”</p><p>You may have noticed the Maia 100 and Cobalt 100 naming, which suggests that Microsoft is already designing second-generation versions of these chips. “This is a series, it’s not just 100 and done... but we’re not going to share our roadmaps,” says Borkar. It’s not clear how often Microsoft will deliver new versions of Maia and Cobalt just yet, but given the speed of AI I wouldn’t be surprised to see a Maia 100 successor arrive at a similar pace to Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/13/23958823/nvidia-h200-ai-gpu-announced-specs-release-date">H200 announcement</a> (around 20 months).</p><p>The key now will be just how fast Microsoft gets Maia into action to speed up the rollout of its broad AI ambitions, and how these chips will impact pricing for the use of AI cloud services. Microsoft isn’t ready to talk about this new server pricing just yet, but we’ve already seen the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23942155/microsoft-365-copilot-ai-office-documents-launch-business-enterprise-pricing-release-date">quietly launch its Copilot for Microsoft 365</a> for a $30-per-month premium per user. </p><p>Copilot for Microsoft 365 is limited to only Microsoft’s biggest customers right now, with enterprise users having to commit to at least 300 users to get on the list for its new AI-powered Office assistant. As Microsoft pushes ahead with even more Copilot features this week and a Bing Chat rebranding, Maia could soon help balance the demand for the AI chips that power these new experiences.</p></div></div>]]></description>
