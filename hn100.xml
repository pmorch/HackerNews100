<h2 id="high-level-thoughts">High level thoughts</h2>
<p>This game is tiny! It takes 45 seconds, has no ambitions to be longer, and is based on a joke. I love it.</p>

<p>After the UI complexity and lack of a theme in <a href="https://eieio.games/game-diary/game-5-reshape-td">ReShape</a> it was refreshing to make something so limited. The scope of the game was perfect for learning a bit about the PICO-8 (and the PICO-8 probably pushed me to make a game of this scope, which is also great).</p>

<p>I think the gameplay itself is…fine? It’s kinda hard, but not that hard, and the strong theme + short length means that you’re probably gonna finish the game if you start it. This is the most arcadey game that I’ve built and it’s been really fun to get messages from friends with their high scores. At the time of writing the high score from a friend is 21 (mine is 26 but that was a freak accident).</p>

<p>This is also my first <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a> game! I loved some parts of the PICO-8 experience and did not like some of the others. But on the whole I’m happy that I gave it a try and I’m excited to make some more PICO-8 games this year.</p>

<h2 id="wait-the-pico-what">Wait, the PICO-what?</h2>
<p>A tl;dr of the PICO-8: it’s a “fantasy console<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>” with restrictions on graphics, sound, code size, and processor speed that mimic the consoles of the 80s. You can create sprites/music/sound effects and write code straight from the console.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/dvdlogo/comfypico.png" alt=""></p><p> A comfy little PICO-8 terminal </p>
    
</div>

<p>The tools that the PICO-8 gives you are pleasantly simple but also primitive relative to modern game engines; if you want collision or particle effects you’re gonna have to manually handle collision on a pixel-by-pixel basis and <a href="https://trasevol.dog/2017/04/04/doodle-insights-11-particles/">draw your particles by hand</a>. This simplicity is the point - constraints breed creativity and all that. And a fun side effect of these limitations is that PICO-8 games have a distinct and relatively consistent feel.</p>

<p>The most well-known PICO-8 game is likely the original version of <a href="https://www.celestegame.com/">Celeste</a>, which was made in the PICO-8 for a gamejam. The PICO-8 version of Celeste is playable as an easter egg in the real game! Check it out if you haven’t.</p>


<p>The PICO-8 comes with some built in tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A sprite editor. I found myself missing Aseprite a bit, but being able to edit sprites directly from the PICO was great! I may try using Asperite with the PICO in the future but it’s not a sure thing.</li>
  <li>A sound effect editor. I found the editor wildly unintuitive until I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwFcitLtCsA">this Gruber video</a> and then got the hang of it pretty quickly. It’s neat and I’m excited to play with it again.</li>
  <li>A music editor. I am too used to playing the keyboard to find it super pleasant, but the editor is relatively intuitive (and would be hard to swap out with how the PICO does music).</li>
  <li>A code editor that I absolutely cannot stand oh my goodness<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/dvdlogo/pico-editor.png" alt=""></p><p> The lines don't get longer if you make the editor wider. The font just grows. </p>
    
</div>

<p>Fortunately to swap out the code editor I just:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PollywogGames.pico8-ls">pico8-ls</a> extension for vscode, which gave me nice syntax highlighting and an API reference.</li>
  <li>Changed the code in my main pico8 file to just be <code>include code.pb</code> and wrote all of my code in <code>code.pb</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Step 2 is necessary because the PICO-8 stores sprite / music data in the same file that it stores code - I didn’t want to be editing the same file from vscode and the PICO-8.</p>

<p>I ended up pretty happy with this setup. My only gripe is that I need an easier-to-search PICO-8 language reference; <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html">this manual</a> is hard to search because there’s no way to limit your search to, say, just function names.</p>

<h2 id="the-pico-8-environment-vibes">The PICO-8 environment: vibes</h2>
<p>It felt super natural to ship a game this small on the PICO-8. I loved that!</p>

<p>During development I considered all sorts of extensions - for example, maybe you could collect tokens that gave you more time, or you could upgrade your TV / your DVD logo to make it easier to score points, or maybe there could be enemies that were trying to bump the logo. Maybe this game was actually meant to be a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/">Vampire Survivors</a> clone!</p>

<p>And I think if I was writing in Godot I might have given into more of those impulses (or at least tried them out). This game is so simple! Games are meant to have decisions and complexity and choices! It’d be silly to put the game up on itch in this state!</p>

<p>But the PICO-8 is so simple that it felt totally natural to ship this game as-is; I felt as though the simplicity of the console gave me permission to do something simple. Of course I’ve always had that permission. But sometimes it’s nice to have a push.</p>

<p>I’m excited to revisit the PICO-8 and that push is a big reason why.</p>

<h2 id="its-great-to-have-a-theme-again">It’s great to have a theme again</h2>
<p>As a game <em>player</em> I sometimes skip through themes to get to mechanics. As a kid I’d skip cutscenes; I’ve played hundreds of hours of <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/">Path of Exile</a> but absolutely cannot explain the story. This isn’t always true - my favorite game is <em>easily</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a> and that’s as much due to the story as the mechanics - but it’s often true.</p>

<p>And so when <em>making</em> games I sometimes talk myself into thinking that a theme isn’t that important. This was certainly true with <a href="https://eieio.games/game-diary/game-5-reshape-td">ReShape TD</a> and probably also with <a href="https://eieio.games/game-diary/game-4-click-click-trick-ppjjgg">click, click, trick</a>. Both games have some neat mechanics but it’s hard to explain what the games are <em>about.</em></p>

<p>“Put the DVD Logo in the Corner” is the exact opposite and I think that’s <em>great</em>. There is a single mechanic in this game and it is “make a square land in the corner of a bigger rectangle.” Not a very exciting mechanic! But I’ve had more fun telling folks about this game than anything else I’ve made - and that’s all because of the theme.</p>

<p>I’ll do my best to keep that in mind for future games.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>That’s it! I had a lot of fun making this game and working with the PICO-8. I’m interested in building some more small arcade-feeling games and looking forward to returning to the PICO.</p>

<p>Right now I’m toying with a game that relies entirely on an (ab)use of the <a href="https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch">OpenSearch spec</a> to build something that runs entirely from the Firefox address bar. I’ll probably get back to something more, uh, traditional next.</p>

<p><em>An update from the future (2024-07-05):</em> I ended using OpenSearch to <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/implementing-wordle-in-the-firefox-address-bar/">run Wordle in the Firefox address bar</a>. And I can’t say I’ve made a lot of traditional stuff since then :)</p>

It took a movie about rock climbing, a historic run by the Golden State Warriors, a broken sewing machine, and a serendipitous Slack comment, but I finally put my finger on it. And it's probably not what you think. </p><p>I'm going to define "technical" skills and then make the case that they're everywhere and severely underrated. Handwaving over them allows us to dismiss the work of wide swaths of the population. And noticing them will light up your life and unlock new worlds. </p><p>❧</p><p>The specific moment that forever changed how I saw this came right at the end of the movie Free Solo. It's about the first person to climb up El Capitan without any kind of rope or safety device.  As the credits rolled, my friend Sam said something offhand like "it was so cool to see the technical details." </p><p>I must have looked blank, because they elaborated: "you usually never get to see behind the scenes and exactly what it takes to prepare to do something that hard—the mental prep, what he eats, even how he positions each finger." </p><p>This was a major 🤯 moment. Like the arrow in the Fedex logo, it's one of those things that you just can't unsee. </p><figure><img src="https://sashalaundy.com/content/images/2024/07/obi-pixel8propix-8LCZb66I4wg-unsplash--1-.jpg" alt="A FedEx truck in front of a brick building.

Or a sanitized "making of" montage. But you so rarely get to see <em>what goes into</em> the final work. That's discussed behind closed doors, between practitioners and their coaches, off the record. </p><p>Which is such a shame, because it's so darn <em>interesting</em>. </p><p>For instance, the Steph Curry mystery. He is electric: he's been league MVP twice, lead his team to <em>four</em> championships, and is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">so good at shooting</a> that he's changing the way modern basketball is played. </p><p>The mystery is that he didn't start out that way. Sure, he was good enough to get drafted into the NBA, but he was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-nba-draft?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">drafted seventh—after two other point guards!</a> Even his dad <a href="https://fadeawayworld.net/my-hat-would-say-i-had-no-idea-dell-curry-never-knew-stephen-curry-could-be-this-great?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">didn't see it coming</a>: </p><blockquote>“In Chicago the other day I saw LaMelo Ball's dad at the game wearing a hat that said: I Told You So,” said Dell [Curry], mentioning the bombastic father of LaMelo and Lonzo. </blockquote><blockquote>“Well, my hat would say: I Had No Idea.”</blockquote><p>So how did Steph Curry go from a decent NBA shooter to the best all time? Sure, his dad was a pro, he played from a young age, and he had access to coaches—but so do <em>lots</em> of other players who stayed average, including (sorry, Seth Curry!) his brother. What factors and tactics go into that kind of breakthrough?</p><p>Also consider that movie, Free Solo. I admit, I thought it was going to be a boring movie. It's about an incredibly risky climb, and I already know the ending: he did the climb and he did not die. But reader...I was riveted and my palms were sweaty. How on earth did the filmmakers do that? So many technical elements must have gone into it—pacing, music, graphics, etc—but I can't even point to them, let alone know how to do them myself. </p><p>❧</p><p>In software, we have this tempting verbal shorthand. We find ourselves saying things like "she is really technical" or "he is not a technical manager" or "they didn't pass the technical screen." But we only ever use these terms to refer to some underspecified cluster of computer programming or software engineering skills. And people without these skills are labeled "not technical." </p><p>But if "technical skills" are the skills we use to produce our work (good software) then by extension, <strong><em>every</em> field has "technical" skills. </strong></p><p><strong>They're simply <em>the skills used to produce the work</em>. </strong></p><p>Do you know how to frame the story of your product so it resonates, how to figure out what customers want, where and how to put something in a customer's path, and how to tell if it worked? Marketers do.</p><p>Do you know how to tell if someone is a good prospect, which people to call first, and what words to use when they're giving you the runaround? Sales people do. </p><p>Do you know how to defuse an entrenched argument between coworkers, help a burned out coworker get out of a rut, or tell someone they're not doing a great job without making them furious? Managers do.</p><p>Even something as squishy as <a href="https://hbr.org/2024/02/how-to-become-a-supercommunicator-at-work?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">"good conversationalist" can be broken down into component technical skills</a>, that can then be noticed, admired, emulated, and honed. For instance, great conversationalists know how to: </p><ul><li>prepare before conversations</li><li>ask really good questions</li><li>make others feel heard (note: this not the same thing as "listen accurately")</li><li>handle a conversation partner who doesn't ask you questions back</li></ul><p>Just like any other skill, it's one you can break down into pieces to learn and practice. </p><p>❧</p><p>There are a few major benefits to noticing and unpacking others' technical skill sets. </p><p><strong>It makes your world more colorful</strong></p><p>Seeing great work is nice, but seeing great work <em>and</em> understanding how hard it was to make is sublime. It lets you appreciate the excellent song, jump shot, or sales call at a new level. </p><p>Ignoring the technical skills all around you leads to a duller, more impoverished life. It's simply more interesting to look around with these glasses on. </p><p><strong>It helps you learn</strong></p><p>To learn a new thing you have to know there <em>is</em> something to learn. If you think that being a good conversationalist is something you just weren't born with, why would you ever try to improve? And if you can't see someone else's greatness, why would you ever think to learn it too? </p><p>Noticing new skills is a key component of a <a href="https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">growth mindset</a> and a prerequisite to learning.</p><p><strong>You won't unwittingly reinforce unpleasant power dynamics</strong></p><p>We often dismiss skills that are not societally valued by pretending they are not  skills. Or, sure, maybe they're skills, but they're mysterious and ineffable!</p><p>You reinforce this idea each time you say <strong>"soft skills"</strong> instead of working to enumerate them. Perhaps you mean "interpersonal skills," "leadership skills," or "communication skills." These are all technical skills, and they all have names. </p><p>You're part of this dynamic if you've ever used <strong>strategic incompetence</strong>, which is when you let yourself believe that doing laundry, taking meeting notes, or organizing a birthday card for a coworker are things that some people "are naturally good at" and you are "just not good at." Real talk: no one is born knowing how to do these things. They just figure it out and ship it, and you can too. </p><p>And consider the "maker movement," which, in my most frustrated moments, I call "arts and crafts, but for <em>boys</em>." The "movement" has been careful to highlight its technical skills to position itself apart from similarly technical fields, like sewing. </p><p>You can probably list the "maker" technical skills: electronics, power drilling, cool robots, etc. But can you list the technical skills for sewing? There are a <em>lot</em>. </p><p>Let's look at only structural choices, not even going into aesthetic and design skills. You need to pick the right pattern, then pick the fabric that will work structurally for your particular garment. You need to understand the body you are making it for, and the exact complex 3D shape that will fit and flatter them (which in turn requires a 4D understanding of how they'll move, the physics of gravity, and how all that interplays with your fabric selection). Then you need to set up your sewing machine, an inscrutable piece of technical machinery that comes with mineral oil, a screwdriver, a parts catalog for repairs, and a detailed technical manual with lots of component diagrams. When your thread gets tangled, you need to reason about how the machine works to debug it. Then you need to cut things to exactly the right size and assemble them in the right order, and do it skillfully so they hold together while being worn and washed and otherwise under duress. And there are advanced technical details that make the difference between "where did you get that?" and "oh, did you make that?" </p><p>And if you want to make something out of t-shirt fabric, that's an entirely different set of equipment and techniques—so much so that the majority of sewists avoid it entirely. </p><p>My point is: <strong>sewing is <em>very technical</em>. </strong></p><p>And we can ONLY write sewing off as "just arts and crafts" and unimpressive compared to the Maker movement <em>if we choose to ignore that sewing is very technical. </em></p><p>Likewise, we can ONLY write off marketing, sales, management, design, product, HR, etc etc etc etc as less important because "they're not technical" if we choose to ignore that they are <em>very technical. </em></p><p>This distinction isn't just about semantics. It's also about value. </p><p>Erasing technical skills lets you erase value. </p><h2 id="so-where-does-this-leave-us">So where does this leave us?</h2><p>Please let me know in the comments if you have ideas for terminology options to replace "he is not technical" or "technical skills" when we're really talking about software skills. I got feedback from a few readers that they like this argument, but it <em>was</em> useful shorthand, and now they're sad because they're not sure how to be more specific. Fair! Let's brainstorm some options. </p><p>❧</p><p><em>Thanks to early readers for their encouragement, feedback, and critique, including a Slack user named Angélique, Laura Duane, Nick Seguin, Laura Lindzey, Fabian Tamp, Zach Lipp, Mindy Preston, Adam Kelly, Alex Chen, Stephanie Losi, Aditya Athalye, Emily Vomacka, Erika Rowland, Marilyn Cole, and probably others that I am forgetting now three months after its original writing.

                  <p>Absolutely. Of late I have an iOS app to measure the grade of hills. Initially this was to avoid parking tickets in San Francisco which requires curbing your tires for a 3% grade. The reality is that this is basically no grade and you should just curb no matter what in SF. Still fun to know how steep the hills are when walking.
The other one is to set the exif data on photos to be taken in Pyongyang 100m underground tomorrow. This me is probably going to get me and my friends in trouble with the NSA for messing up their database, but these things happen.</p>

I subsequently used two versions of it in client projects (to prototype some solutions and to compile them to data used by the delivered product; nothing delivered to the clients depended on my weird Lisp dialect).</p><p>I wrote a tool called nym to help generate names for characters and other things in games and stories. It's enough fun in itself that I sometimes just play with it.</p><p>I wrote another tool called model-namegen to generate names with stricter constraints for science-fiction stories. Those names are mapped uniquely and reversibly to 64-bit integers used in the story to generate names for machine intelligences. I also wrote a prototype for a 3D multiplayer game called The Fabric set in the world of those stories, and wrote code to generate clusters of colored cubes for use as avatars representing the AIs. Each character's unique ID is mapped to a unique name and also to a unique 8x8x8 configuration of lighted cubes. An example name is Ixion Eleven Chrysotile, the name of the autonomous robot who is the narrator of my Fabric stories.</p><p>Following is a link to a very short movie of the avatar for the character Miriam Five Bittersweet Earth:
<a href="https://evins.net/downloads/miriam-5-bittersweet-earth-2-2.mp4" rel="nofollow">https://evins.net/downloads/miriam-5-bittersweet-earth-2-2.m...</a></p><p>I wrote a couple of versions of a library for Common Lisp to make certain functional programming idioms I like more convenient for me in Lisp. They're called folio and folio2.</p><p>I wrote a library called taps that similarly makes use of Richard Waters' SERIES package for Common Lisp a bit more convenient for me. Actually, taps started as part of folio and I ended up wanting to use it on its own often enough that I broke it out separately.</p><p>I've written several little tools for calculating and keeping track of information that's useful for friends-and-family gameplay.</p><p>I've written several other libraries and applications purely for the purpose of exploring some idea or other that interests me. For example, beasties was a pond-life simulation that I used as a playground for recreational genetic programming. Panels was an experiment in user interface that used a constraint solver for laying out windows and widgets, and an append-only log of all UI events together with a query engine and a knowledgebase. Panels could display graphic representations of recent user activity and retroactively define mappings from sequences of events to user-defined handlers. It operated on the principle that everything detectable that a user did potentially had some purpose, even if we don't know what it is, so we should remember all the user's actions and offer them the opportunity to define what they meant.</p><p>I've also written a few little things primarily for the purpose of helping friends and family with this or that task.</p><p>I've spent a lot of time over the years on things like these. As you would expect, they've taken varying amounts of time and I don't really keep track of how much. I use some of them (e.g. taps and other pieces of folio) almost every day, and others intermittently. A few of them (such as beasties and panels) I haven't really touched in years now.</p></div></td></tr>

One script parses the channel's RSS feed and inserts enclosure tags, with the target URLs pointing to the second script with the video ID as a parameter.  The second script then wraps youtube-dl and redirects to the raw video URL obtained for that video ID by youtube-dl.</p><p>This worked great for years, but recently, YouTube stopped serving their `22` format for most videos, which coupled 720p video with the audio stream.  Now, the best resolution you can get with audio and video interleaved is `18`, which contains only 360p video.  So that's the best resolution obtainable this way for now, unless I add a whole layer to this to reconstruct an interleaved video from separate audio and video streams selected from the DASH manifest.</p></div></td></tr>

Instead of just showing you the text of the page like a standard RSS reader, it proxies the web page so you can read the article directly from the website, but with the added benefit that since it's a proxy, I can control all the HTML, CSS, and Javascript on that page.</p><p>Another daily one I use is a random background music playlist for Spotify that is auto generated daily.

I store all the songs that have been added to the playlist in a DynamoDB database and make sure no song gets added twice.</p>

I'm using it as part of a video game decompilation project, but it also enables a whole bunch of other use cases I've documented on my blog.</p><p>It's not that it is meant for my use only (any capable reverse-engineer familiar with Ghidra should be able to pick it up and use it) nor that it will never see the light of the day (it's open-source). However, it is such an esoteric capability and outright heresy according to computer sciences that I'm having a hard time just finding people who can wrap their heads around the concept, let alone people who would actually want to use this. Simply put, it's so far out there that I don't even know where or how I could even advertise it in the first place, which makes it <i>de facto</i> for my own use only.</p><p>A couple of people did end up reaching out to me in the last couple of weeks about it, so it might be on the cusp of sprouting a very tiny user base.

                  <p>Something like that really deserves to be written in C so you don't need to install Ghidra to use it. The way I imagine it working is if I want the function `foo` then I'd say `objsuck -ffoo -ofoo.o prog.elf` and it'd look at the elf symbol table to find the `.size` of `foo` and copy that symbol into the .o. I guess you would then need to use xed to disassemble the opcodes to see what other symbols it jumps into or calls, and grab those too, along with any memory references, and then emit relocations. Overall I support this, since it'd be the easiest way to expropriate content from open source codebases whose source code is too byzantine to let me extract one teensy tiny little feature without the bloat. To me this is perfectly normal. You'd also be smart to only support COFF if the person uploads the binary to a hosted service you control and pays you money. In fact this would be even better if it could generate .s files from the object content, so no one would get triggered by binaries.</p>

A single, dial the weight dumbbell. Plates in metal range from 10 lbs to 0.25 lbs.</p><p>The SW:</p><p>1) using SQLite for DB</p><p>2) One application to calculate optimum weight settings - typical run takes 100 to 200 tries to get the best set.</p><p>3) Another application to present / track sessions.  It was a BIG timer display to ensure I do not do the workout too fast (goal is 45 sec a set)</p><p>4) A tracking report.</p><p>Complexity issues:
Not all dumbbell handles weigh the same - even the tightening nuts vary.  Solution was to weigh everything and pair up the nuts so that each dumbbell handle with nuts matched its pair - oh I color coded the metal dumbbell handles.</p><p>First algorithm took too long - my first version would calculate ALL combinations of all weights.  Then select the optimal solution - before adding the 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 pound plates would take between 15 to 30 minutes to run.  This was solved with a slightly more complex algorithm.  I calculated the all combinations for each dumbbell.  Merged those lists into a big list, Found the perfect setting for each exercise.  Check for conflicts.  When a conflict occurred, found the exercise with the least delta from optimal and changed it to the next weight setting.... Check for conflict.  Now it takes no more than 20 sec and reports 100 to 200 times it hit conflict before solving.</p></div></td></tr>

So, I put a simple proxy that validates the captcha before inserting the record to the software.</p><p>- Wanted a way to apply an email template to the Sendy mailing list, so I wrote a software that consumes my RSS feed, applies a template, and creates a draft in my mailing list software.</p><p>- Wrote a "Scoreboard" that aggregates MRR across Stripe accounts into a graph, and sends auto-emails to friends when I cross thresholds.</p><p>- Wrote a script that emails me when the HN "whoishiring" job goes live every month. (Simple crons like Zapier don't work)</p><p>There are a few other things in there, too.</p></div></td></tr>

I am very self-conscious of publishing my work. So over the years i have made many software games and utilities that will never be published. My wife thinks i am being silly and i shoud publish it. Anyway, here goes....</p><p>MP3Renamer(2002) - The age of music piracy is still rife and i have downloaded my share from napster, university file shares, etc. However, most filenames are horrendous and not clean. So, my first utility was a java program that would analyse file names based on common garbled patterns and rename it into [Artist] - [Songname].mp3. It worked surprisingly well for 90% of the use cases,</p><p>CombatLogAnalyzer(2008) - Me and my wife are in the throes of World of Warcraft arena which is a competetive dueling system. We only play 2v2 and we both suck at it. So, i enabled combatlogs in WoW and then wrote a parser, analyser and visualizer for every arena game and that shows which spells were used, where did  damage come up, highest contributer of damage and this was by each playable class. By the end, we learnt what was killing us and the statistics showed our strengths and weaknesses. Suffering high latency and poor skills we managed to crawl from 800 rating to 1800 rating! We just couldnt go beyond that! (I was the crutch). This was done in .NET WinForms and i really learnt how to use linq.</p><p>Space Commander (2019) - My daughter is almost 4 years old and i think she is ready for computer games. I decide to learn MonoGame and i make a Space Commander clone. It is a HIT!</p><p>HappyMrsChicken (2019) - From my smash hit game above, i make a clone of HappyMrsChicken except this is in a forest where you have corn that the chicken has to eat and there is competetion from a mysterious goblin creature who also goes after the corn. Who will win?? Turns out, i cheated and gave the chicken a boost. My daughter won a lot!!</p><p>OptionsTrading (2020) - It is covid and i am locked in a quarantine facility for 28 days. Like a lot of retail noobs, we are getting into trading stocks and options. I decide IBKR interface sucks and I can do better. While spending those 28 days in isolation from family, i learn react to write a frontend and python to write a backend that displays all our trades, statistics, UIs, loss calculators, PnL, etc. My wife and I use this to date but i am too chicken-shit to publish it.</p><p>My personal favourites are: CombatLogAnalyser, OptionsTrading and HappyMrsChicken in that order</p></div></td></tr>

You could even upload files or screenshots.</p><p>It was quite popular with power users as well as our own team. But most importantly, it gave angry users a place to complain instead of directly yelling at a developer.</p><p>It was over 10 years ago and I think it's still the project I'm most proud of. The bot as a whole was extremely complex and could interface with several external applications like google sheets and trello. It also had a very nice feature where it would answer my DMs for me. I was a pretty public figure in the community and got a lot of messages that would be better answered by just asking in the general chat. The bot would (respectfully) explain that I can't give 1:1 support to everyone and direct them to better support channels. It also explained that if something really did require my direct attention, I could still be reached by sending another message. Almost nobody ever did. I couldn't believe how effective it was. The DMs still existed in my inbox, but the bot marked them as read so I wouldn't get notified. I'd review them occasionally, I never found any false positives.</p><p>But of course that kind of thing is ancient history and will get your discord account banned nowadays. Using a bot to log in as a normal user has been prohibited for a long time. Too bad.</p></div></td></tr>

Two large ones off the top of my head.</p><p>First one: cloud services are expensive and come with a lot of overhead. However I do enjoy the idea of lambda/cloud functions a lot but I didn't want to rely on cloud services for them, especially since I have a ton of hardware to self-host stuff. So I built a service which piggybacks on DIND where I could add templates for such lambdas for a few languages(just rust and python cause that's mostly what I use) where I can allocate some resources and build tiny containers. In order to avoid wasting resources, they are all off by default but through the magic of what I build(management and something like a reverse proxy + container management for DIND), I can call an endpoint, which will check if there is a container to handle the requests and proxies the request and response to and from it or it will spin up the container, do the same and shut it down after a pre-defined amount of time. You could argue that I could have achieved the same with minikube or k3s but this has proven to use a lot more resources compared to a single rust binary I can run on anything x86 with docker on it. The downsides are that I can't distribute it across multiple servers so it only runs locally. But that fits my needs perfectly. There might be some people that would be interested in it but I never got to open sourcing it so I'm the only user. I've been planning to open source it "next week" for the past 2 years or so.</p><p>Second one: I love data. Specifically unstructured, raw data and I've been collecting a ton of articles from the internet over the past 2 years or so. The ingestion involves a pipeline that automatically processes them and extracts data/makes them a lot less unstructured: events, locations, timestamps, what has happened where and all that jazz. It's a long list of ml models, data transformations, validations, 3 llm's fighting each-other and a bunch of other stuff. Kinda feels like a child to me so I don't want to open source it. I know that I could hypothetically convert it into a product and make some money off it but my past entrepreneurial experiences have been very unsuccessful, I have limited time and lack motivation. So at the moment I'm simply enjoying the data getting spit out on a grafana dashboard such as this [1].</p><p>[1] <a href="https://i.imgur.com/fAoQghk.png" rel="nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/fAoQghk.png</a></p></div></td></tr>

I'd been looking for an excuse to learn Haskell and figured the best way to stay motivated was to make useful tool for myself.</p><p>I've been working on it for the better part of a year at this point (probably &gt;200 hours) and I use it roughly daily. After gathering a few months of station-level data it became clear enough that the system (specifically, how the e-bikes are handled) has some pretty serious issues.</p><p>I ended up sending the city a couple of freedom of information requests for some data I was missing and for the contract between them and the company that operates the system. The contract says that the operator gets paid a fee for every dead e-bike they move to a charging station - regardless of whether or not that bike actually manages to charge.</p><p>The city owns around 2000 e-bikes and there are frequently times where a whopping <i>20</i> are available - the rest are out of battery, sitting in docking stations for multiple days. Occasionally the operator shuffle the bikes over to the handful electrified charging stations, and about half the time the bikes don't charge (they just completely fill the stations, meaning nobody can use them - one of those stations happens to be right outside my partner's place). Then 4-7 days later they come around in a truck and get rid of the bikes, and the whole cycle repeats again in a couple days.</p><p>Basically, we're getting fleeced by the system operator. It isn't even clear to me if it's intentional or not, or just the usual combination of lax municipal oversight and an apathetic operator.</p><p>I've been meaning to send my data and the contract over to a few reporters who care about that sort of thing, since (a) the bike share system is genuinely a great way to get around (when it works) and (b) financially it's really good value for the city [1], and I'd like to see the problems fixed (especially given that the city is planning on massively expanding the e-bike fleet).</p><p>[0]: General Bikeshare Feed Specification: <a href="https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs">https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs</a></p><p>[1]: The per-trip subsidy is $0.67, versus $4.08 for a trip on our transit system (!)</p></div></td></tr>

Then again, maybe not. Having been a maintainer for a project with hundreds of contributors before, I can say that coding for oneself feels very liberating. Only as much infrastructure and process as necessary to get the job done. No need to deal with feature requests or bug reports. No commit races, or battles in code-review comments. You know the requirements perfectly (or have a perfectly compliant customer who is willing to change) so if you want to take a short cut you can. I was often a stickler for doing things "the right way" when I was working, but part of the reason I left is that my work seemed to be <i>all</i> about shepherding the process and not the joy of making code grow and do new things. Having total freedom on a project, even a small one, is good balm for a jaded programmer's soul.</p></div></td></tr>
