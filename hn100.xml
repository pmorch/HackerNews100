<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Everyone loves $\pi$. It’s usually the first irrational number someone encounters. $\pi$ is conceptually simple enough that it can be explained with basic geometry.</p><figure><figcaption><p>A circle with diameter 1 has a circumference of $\pi$. The circumference can be measured by slicing the circle and unwrapping it. The more slices that are added by moving the slider, the more accurate the measurement becomes. (Adapted from <a href="https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php?title=Approximation_of_the_circle_area">here</a>)</p></figcaption></figure><p>$\pi$ is the ratio between the circumference and the diameter. Usually, written as:</p><p>$$ C = 2\pi r $$</p><p>where $C$ is the circumference, $r$ is the radius (half of the diameter) and $\pi$ is famously $3.14159..$.</p><p>But why does $\pi$ have to have that value? Could it have some other value? The answer is yes! But to figure that out, we first have to talk about circles which are closely tied to the definition of $\pi$.</p><h2 id="circle">Circle</h2><p>Since the definition of $\pi$ depends on two properties of a circle (circumference, radius), it’s good to figure out what a circle even is. Mathematically, a circle is the collection of all points that are an equal distance from the center. So if the radius of a circle is 1, then the circle is the collection of all the points that are 1 unit distance away from the center.</p><p>In practical terms, a circle tells you all the points that have an equal “cost”. For example:</p><ul><li>If you start running from the center, then the circle represents all the farthest points you can reach in a given amount of time. Here the distance is measured in units of time.</li><li>If you start driving from the center, then the circle represents all the farthest points you can reach in a given amount of fuel. Here the distance is measured in units of fuel.</li></ul><p>But not all constant-cost functions will create the same shape. For example, suppose you are sailing on a windy day. Traveling in the direction of the wind will be easy but traveling orthogonal to the wind will require more effort and traveling against the wind will require significant effort. So for fixed effort, the farthest points you can travel will create an ellipse shifted against the direction of the wind.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/windy-sailing-effort_huec29f904673ee74b3c369a7ced6e6e03_94902_720x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp, https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/windy-sailing-effort_huec29f904673ee74b3c369a7ced6e6e03_94902_1080x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1.5x" media="(min-width: 500px)" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/windy-sailing-effort_huec29f904673ee74b3c369a7ced6e6e03_94902_450x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp, https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/windy-sailing-effort_huec29f904673ee74b3c369a7ced6e6e03_94902_675x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1.5x" media="(min-width: 300px)" type="image/webp"><img src="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/windy-sailing-effort_huec29f904673ee74b3c369a7ced6e6e03_94902_1080x0_resize_box_3.png" width="100%"></picture><figcaption><p>If there is strong wind to the right, you can sail much farther to the right than to the left with the same effort. The red ellipse shows the points you can reach with equal effort. The black circle represents the farthest you can travel with equal effort when traveling on a day without any wind or current.<span>
<a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gohgpumb54">[graph]</a></span></p></figcaption></figure><p>But does this cost-function (effort needed to sail) define a proper distance? Can we use it to measure radius and measure circumference? Seems kinda arbitrary to say yes or no. If time and fuel can all be “distances” in some situations then why couldn’t effort be a distance in this situation? Fortunately, we don’t have to make an arbitrary decision here since we can rely on a preexisting concept that defines what kinds of cost functions are valid distances.</p><h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2><p>Mathematics can be seen as a logic game. You start with a set of assumptions and you come up with all the logical conclusions you can from that. Then, if someone else finds a situation that fits those assumptions, they can benefit from the pre-discovered logical conclusions. This means that if some conclusions require fewer assumptions, then those conclusions are more generally applicable.</p><p>As a result, mathematics goes through continuous cycles where mathematicians go back and trim down the assumptions needed for any mathematical system. For example, a lot of geometry from the times of the Greeks used only the single definition of distance: the Euclidean distance ($d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$). We even named it after the Greek mathematician. Even Newton relied solely on Euclidean distance when he invented Calculus. Then, in the early 20th century, mathematicians realized that any function can be used as a distance function, as long as it followed some basic requirements. As long as the distance function followed those requirements, a lot of the established math would still work. So you could still do geometry and calculus and topology with just minor tweaks. Functions that fit these requirements are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space"><em>metrics</em></a>.</p><p>A function is a metric if it follows the following rules:</p><ol><li>The distance between a point and itself is always 0. If you don’t go anywhere, the distance traveled is 0.</li><li>The distance between any two different points is always positive</li><li>The distance from $a$ to $b$ is the same as the distance from $b$ to $a$</li><li>Going directly from $a$ to $c$ is at least as fast as going from $a$ to $b$ and then from $b$ to $c$</li></ol><p>Now, with these requirements, does “effort to sail” define a metric? The answer is no. We can probably debate 1 and 2 but 3 is very clearly not true. If $b$ is downwind of $a$, then the effort in one direction is smaller than the effort in the opposite direction.</p><p>Okay, so what functions are a metric? There are two classic examples: Manhattan distance and maximum distance.</p><h2 id="manhattan-distance">Manhattan Distance</h2><p>When you are driving in a city grid, you can’t drive diagonally. You have to drive in one grid direction and then the other. When you drive like this, the distance between two points is just $d = x + y$. This is popularly called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance">Manhattan distance</a> or the taxicab distance.</p><p>One application of this metric is measuring accuracy. Suppose you are asked to predict the total population change of two cities. If you guess within 1,000 people, then you win a prize. You can visualize this by charting the population change of one city on the x-axis and the population change of the other city on the y-axis. Then a “circle” around your guess with a radius of 1,000 tells you the range where you can still win the prize.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/manhattan_hu6795c5e0f4a35a67254c451fae67197c_99743_720x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp, https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/manhattan_hu6795c5e0f4a35a67254c451fae67197c_99743_1080x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1.5x" media="(min-width: 500px)" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/manhattan_hu6795c5e0f4a35a67254c451fae67197c_99743_450x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp, https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/manhattan_hu6795c5e0f4a35a67254c451fae67197c_99743_675x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1.5x" media="(min-width: 300px)" type="image/webp"><img src="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/manhattan_hu6795c5e0f4a35a67254c451fae67197c_99743_1080x0_resize_box_3.png" width="100%"></picture><figcaption><p>A circle using the Manhattan distance. The circle captures all the points that add up to 1,000. These are all the points that have a total inaccuracy of 1,000.<span>
<a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/a4okw60u43">[graph]</a></span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The circle looks like a rotated square!</p><p>The circle has radius of 1,000 but what is its circumference? If we use the Manhattan distance to measure the circumference then each line has a distance of 2,000 ($x + y = 1000 + 1000$) and since there are 4 lines, the circumference is 8,000. This means:</p><p>$$ C = 2 \pi r $$
$$ 8,000 = 2 \pi (1,000)$$
$$ 4 = \pi $$</p><p>In the universe where you measure distance using the Manhattan distance, the value of $\pi$ is 4!</p><h2 id="maximal-distance">Maximal Distance</h2><p>Another distance function that is a valid metric is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance">maximal distance</a>: $d = max(x,y)$. So instead of combining x and y, we use the larger of the two as the distance.</p><p>A lot of times when you are doing multiple things at the same time, it only matters how long the longest item takes. For example, suppose you need to prepare two ingredients for a dish, and you can prepare the ingredients in parallel. The amount of time you need to finish your dish is as long as the slowest ingredient.</p><p>Suppose for a cooking competition, you are required to finish cooking in exactly 60 minutes plus/minus 5 minutes. Then how much time can each ingredient take? If we use the x-axis to represent the time ingredient 1 takes and the y-axis to represent the time ingredient 2 takes, then we can draw a 5 minutes-wide circle that tells us how long each ingredient can take.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/p-infinity_hu6795c5e0f4a35a67254c451fae67197c_52805_720x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp, https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/p-infinity_hu6795c5e0f4a35a67254c451fae67197c_52805_1080x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1.5x" media="(min-width: 500px)" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/p-infinity_hu6795c5e0f4a35a67254c451fae67197c_52805_450x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp, https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/p-infinity_hu6795c5e0f4a35a67254c451fae67197c_52805_675x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1.5x" media="(min-width: 300px)" type="image/webp"><img src="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/p-infinity_hu6795c5e0f4a35a67254c451fae67197c_52805_1080x0_resize_box_3.png" width="100%"></picture><figcaption><p>As long as both ingredients are finished between 55 and 65 minutes, we can win the cooking competition. The red ‘circle’ demarcates the area where we can still win.<span>
<a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sixscn6qqc">[graph]</a></span></p></figcaption></figure><p>This circle looks like a regular square! The circle has radius 5 but what is its circumference? Each line has a distance of 10 and there are 4 lines so the circumference is 40.</p><p>$$ C = 2 \pi r $$
$$ 40 = 2 \pi 5 $$
$$ 4 = \pi $$</p><p>And again, in the universe where distance is measured using the maximal distance, the value of $\pi$ is 4!</p><h2 id="p-norm">p-norm</h2><p>Till now we have covered three distances: Euclidean, Manhattan, and Maximal. What other examples can we look at? Well, we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space#The_p-norm_in_finite_dimensions">p-norm metric</a> which is a collection of infinite metrics defined as:</p><p>$$ d = \left(x^p + y^p\right)^{1/p}$$</p><p>where $p$ can be any number greater than or equal to 1.</p><p>The cool thing about p-norms are that they are a generalization of the metrics we covered before.
Euclidean, Manhattan, and maximal distances are specific examples of p-norms.
When $p$ is 1, we have the Manhattan distance. When $p$ is 2, we have the Euclidean distance. When $p$ is $\infty$, we have the maximal distance. So Manhattan distance and maximal distance are the extremes of the p-norms.</p><p>Here are what circles look like in different p-norms:</p><figure><figcaption><p>P-norms define a different metric for different values of $p$. Here we graph the “circles” of the respective p-norm metrics.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Just as we did before, the circumference and the value of $\pi$ can be calculated for the different p-norms. In previous examples, we were able to calculate the circumference just by looking at it, since they were straight lines but that strategy doesn’t work in general. So, for the rest of the shapes we need to caculate the circumferences computationally. We can write a program to tell a computer to walk around the circle and track the distance traveled. Fortunately, someone else has already done this <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2687579">work</a> so we can refer to their results<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>p</th><th>$\pi$</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>3.757…</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3.141…</td></tr><tr><td>2.25</td><td>3.155…</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3.259…</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>3.757…</td></tr><tr><td>$\infty$</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In addition to calculating these values, the paper linked above also proves that 3.14159 is the smallest value of $\pi$ possible for all the p-norms. Our regular $\pi$ is the smallest possible $\pi$ in the family of p-norms!</p><h2 id="all-metrics">All Metrics</h2><p>While there are infinitely many p-norm metrics, there are infinitely more metrics that are not p-norms. What are the values of $\pi$ in all the other metrics?</p><p>This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07715v2">article</a> by Sahoo proves that $\pi$ is between 3 and 4 for <em>all</em> metrics. We have seen the metrics that give us $\pi = 4$. What’s the metric that gives us $\pi = 3$?</p><p>The <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3549811/194741">answer</a> is a little gnarly<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>$$ d = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\sum_{n=1}^6\left|x\sin\left(\frac{\pi n}{3}\right)+y\cos\left(\frac{\pi n}{3}\right)\right| $$</p><p>But drawing out the circle for this metric gives us a hexagon.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/hex-medium2_hufa459388e9cdd2daf1aebd501157aa11_64882_720x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp, https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/hex-medium2_hufa459388e9cdd2daf1aebd501157aa11_64882_1080x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1.5x" media="(min-width: 500px)" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/hex-medium2_hufa459388e9cdd2daf1aebd501157aa11_64882_450x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp, https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/hex-medium2_hufa459388e9cdd2daf1aebd501157aa11_64882_675x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1.5x" media="(min-width: 300px)" type="image/webp"><img src="https://azeemba.com/posts/pi-in-other-universes/hex-medium2_hufa459388e9cdd2daf1aebd501157aa11_64882_1080x0_resize_box_3.png" width="100%"></picture><figcaption><p>Circle with the ‘hexagon’ metric.

$$ 3 = \pi $$</p><p>So next March, instead of just celebrating $\pi$-day on March 14th (3/14), feel free to celebrate $\pi$-month all through March. You just have to do the work of finding the appropriate metric for each day of the month.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

  <summary><b>More indepth details about the PiKVM features</b></summary>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-fully-featured-and-modern-ip-kvm" dir="auto"><a href="#fully-featured-and-modern-ip-kvm">Fully-featured and modern IP-KVM</a></h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Cheaper, but better than commercial solutions</strong><br>
Costs between $30 and $100 depending on the features desired. Even the most expensive configuration will be cheaper than a $500 commercial IP-KVM.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to build - For the V0 variant</strong><br>
A ready-to-use OS that can be created just by running <code>make build</code> and installed to an SD-card using <code>make install</code>. The hardware can be made in half an hour and without soldering.</li>
<li><strong>The widest hardware support</strong><br>
There are many ways to build a PiKVM. Video capture devices can be attached using the CSI-2 or USB interfaces. Raspberry Pi models 2, 3, 4 or Zero2W may be used. Any combination of hardware is supported, and PiKVM implements the maximum possible set of features.</li>
<li><strong>Very low latency</strong><br>
~100 milliseconds of video latency. This is the smallest delay of all existing solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Extra lightweight and fancy Web UI</strong><br>
No weird proprietary clients. No ugly Java applets. Just use your favorite browser to connect to the PiKVM. No flash plugins either!</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard and mouse</strong><br>
Mouse usage works directly in the browser. The keyboard emulator supports displaying the state of the keyboard LEDs.</li>
<li><strong>Mass Storage Drive</strong><br>
On the Raspberry Pi 4 and Zero2W, PiKVM can emulate a virtual CD-ROM or Flash Drive. A live image can be uploaded to boot the attached server.</li>
<li><strong>ATX power management</strong><br>
With a very simple circuit that can be assembled on a breadboard, the power button of the attached server can be controlled using the ATX button headers on the motherboard.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong><br>
PiKVM can be opened to the Internet and no one will get access without the password. SSL is used to protect traffic from being intercepted by third parties.</li>
<li><strong>Local monitoring</strong><br>
PiKVM monitors the health of the Raspberry Pi board and will warn you if it's too hot or is not receiving enough power.</li>
<li><strong>GPIO management</strong>
You can control GPIO and USB relays via the web interface. The extensible interface allows you to make anything out of it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-production-ready" dir="auto"><a href="#production-ready">Production-ready</a></h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Linux-based embedded OS</strong><br>
The PiKVM OS is based on <a href="https://archlinuxarm.org/" rel="nofollow">Arch Linux ARM</a> and can be customized for any needs. Thousands of pre-built binary packages are at your service and can be updated with a single command!</li>
<li><strong>Read-only filesystem</strong><br>
By default the OS runs in read-only mode, as an embedded system should. This prevents damage to the memory card due to a sudden power outage.</li>
<li><strong>VNC server</strong><br>
The managed server and its BIOS can be accessed using a regular VNC client which supports JPEG compression.</li>
<li><strong>IPMI BMC and Redfish</strong><br>
Use <code>ipmitool</code>, <code>ipmiutil</code> or any existing network infrastructure that supports IPMI to monitor and manage the server's power. Redfish and <code>redfishtool</code> supported too.</li>
<li><strong>Wake-on-LAN</strong><br>
PiKVM can be configured to power up a managed server using WoL. This will be available in the Web menu.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible authorization methods</strong><br>
Multiple PiKVMs can be configured to use a <a href="https://github.com/pikvm/kvmd-auth-server">common authorization service</a>. PAM and its rich authorization mechanisms can also be used to integrate PiKVM into your existing authentication infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Macro scripts</strong><br>
If repetitive actions must be performed on the attached server (or on several different servers), a macro can be recorded with keyboard &amp; mouse actions and can be played back multiple times.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-open-source" dir="auto"><a href="#open-source">Open Source</a></h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Community &amp; support</strong><br>
PiKVM has a large community. Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/bpmXfz5" rel="nofollow">discord chat</a> if you have any questions.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible</strong><br>
PiKVM was designed as a set of microservices with a plug-in architecture. It's very easy to modify and maintain.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive API</strong><br>
Everything that can be done via the user interface can also be done via a powerful HTTP API.</li>
<li><strong>Know-how</strong><br>
We created <a href="https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer">our very own MJPG video server</a> written in C with multi-threading support and GPU video encoding - the fastest streaming solution available to provide the best video quality for PiKVM. We also tested a lot of hardware configurations so that you can be sure devices you assemble will work reliably.</li>

But it has some disadvantages compared with recommended <a href="https://aliexpress.com/item/4000102166176.html" rel="nofollow">HDMI-CSI bridge</a>: USB gives a lot of latency (200ms vs 100ms for MJPEG) and it doesn't support stream compression control (you won't be able to use PiKVM in a place with a poor internet connection). There is no H.264 support at the moment. It also cannot automatically detect screen resolution. All this is caused by the hardware limitations of the dongle itself. In addition, some users report hardware problems: the dongle may not work in the BIOS or simply stop working after a while. It's a black box, and no one knows what's inside it. If you have problems with it, it will not be possible to fix them.</details></li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<details><summary>❓ Why is this cable necessary?</summary>
On a Raspberry Pi only the USB port that receives power is capable of acting as a USB Device. The other USB ports are capable only of acting as USB Hosts. Therefore a special cable must be used on the USB power port that it can simultanously act as USB Device for the PC/server and receive external power from an official RPi adapter.

Insert the flexible flat cable of the HDMI bridge into the narrow white connector on the Raspberry Pi (the closest one to big USB sockets). It is labeled CAMERA. To insert you need to open the connector first. On the Raspberry Pi side you can gently lift the black part up and a little bit sideways:

<p dir="auto">For the HDMI-CSI bridge it depends on the version you bought. Either pull it gently up as on the Raspberry or push it sideways. Make sure that the cable is inserted on the correct side and until it stops, and then push the black latch back. Never connect or disconnect the flat cable from a powered device. This is not Plug-and-Play, and you can damage it. Also use only the cable that was included with the device package, or make sure that the third-party cable has the correct pinout.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Raspberry Pi 4</strong>: since one USB-C female connector is used to receive power and perform keyboard/mouse/drive emulation a special Y-cable must be made that splits the DATA and POWER lines of USB-C (see <a href="https://github.com/pikvm/docs/issues/11" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/pikvm/pikvm/issues/11/hovercard">reasons</a>). It can be made from two suitable connecting cables, or soldered together from scratch. Be sure to check the circuit diagram below, otherwise you may damage your devices. The appropriate USB pinout(s) can easily be found on Google. Please note that if you make a Y-cable from two no-name cables, the colors of the wires may not match those shown. Use a multimeter to make sure the connections are correct.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Raspberry Pi Zero (2) W</strong>: This board has two USB micro connectors: one for power supply, the second for emulating a USB OTG device. You need to prevent backpowering as in the RPi4 case. To do this, you need to cut off the red power wire in the OTG wire, or seal the +5v pin in the USB-A connector with electrical tape like this:

<p dir="auto">Note for the HDMI-USB dongle:</p>
 <details>
   <summary>❗Click to show❗</summary>
<p dir="auto">Many USB video capture devices tell the server's video card that the HDMI cable is supposedly disconnected. This may lead to the fact that if you boot the server without an active stream, the server will not detect your capture card. This is easy to fix:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Switch filesystem to RW-mode:

</li>
<li>Edit file <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code> and add these lines:
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="kvmd:
    streamer:
        forever: true
        cmd_append: [--slowdown]"><pre><span>kvmd</span>:

        <span>forever</span>: <span>true</span>

<p dir="auto">This project is developed by Open Source enthusiasts. If you find PiKVM useful or it has saved you a long trip to check on an unresponsive server, you can support us by donating a few dollars on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pikvm" rel="nofollow">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://paypal.me/pikvm" rel="nofollow">Paypal</a> or buying our devices. With this money, we will be able to buy new hardware (Raspberry Pi boards and other components) to test and maintain various configurations of PiKVM, and generally devote significantly more time to the project. At the bottom of this page are the names of all the people who have helped this project develop with their donations. Our gratitude knows no bounds!</p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to use PiKVM in production, we accept orders to modify it for your needs or implement custom features you require. Contact us via <a href="https://discord.gg/bpmXfz5" rel="nofollow">live chat</a> or email the lead developer at: <a href="mailto:mdevaev@gmail.com">mdevaev@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>We chose <a href="https://hono.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hono</a> as our API server with <a href="https://bun.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bun</a>
as the runtime and pick Fly.io as your hosting service.</p>
<h2 id="-why-did-we-want-to-move-our-backend-from-vercel">🤔 Why did we want to move our backend from Vercel?<a href="#-why-did-we-want-to-move-our-backend-from-vercel"><span></span></a></h2>
<h3 id="-a-lightweight-server">⚡ A lightweight Server<a href="#-a-lightweight-server"><span></span></a></h3>
<p>We required a lightweight server with a simple REST API for our monitoring
endpoint. Deploying a simple Express server is possible, but it is not
specifically designed for this purpose.</p>
<p><code>It's possible to deploy an Express.js application as a single Serverless Function, but it comes with drawbacks and should only be used as a migration path. Instead, use Next.js or embrace multiple Serverless Functions as you incrementally migrate to the Vercel platform.</code></p>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/guides/using-express-with-vercel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source Vercel Doc</a></p>
<p>Also launching a clean and new Next.js server takes 2.5 seconds on my MacBook
Pro M1 and takes 110mb of RAM, and it includes unnecessary extra features from
Next.js. Our prod Next.js app takes about 5 seconds to launch on my computer
(contentlayer).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.openstatus.dev/assets/posts/migration-backend-from-vercel-to-fly/next-server.png" alt="Next server"></p>
<p>For comparaison launching our current server takes 0.19ms and only takes 91mb.
Our current server stack is Hono + Bun.</p>

<h3 id="-pricing">💸 Pricing<a href="#-pricing"><span></span></a></h3>
<p>We initially aimed to provide multi-region monitoring for all users while
maintaining a free tier. On Vercel, if you want a multi-region function, you
need to opt for Edge Functions. Edge functions are cost-effective as you only
pay for the actual CPU execution. This means that you won't be billed for idle
times when fetching data.</p>
<p>It's still affordable, but we are a bootstrap business and it difficult for us
to predict our monthly expenses. If we experience an increase in new users, our
costs will also increase accordingly.</p>
<p>Here's the math for the cost of one monitor for a user:</p>
<pre><code>6 (10 min monitors) * 24 * 30 * 3 (average execution unit per monitor) * 6 (number of regions) = 77,760 executions units per month

77,600 * (2/1,000,000) = 0.15c per monitor monthly
</code></pre>
<p>We have over 1000 monitors, and the monthly cost to run them would be $150.</p>
<p>While on fly we only have 6 servers with 2vcpu/512Mb It cost us $23.34 monthly
($3.89*6).</p>
<h2 id="-what-challenges-did-we-face-during-our-migrations">🤯 What challenges did we face during our migrations?<a href="#-what-challenges-did-we-face-during-our-migrations"><span></span></a></h2>
<h3 id="docker--monorepo--">Docker + monorepo = 🪨<a href="#docker--monorepo--"><span></span></a></h3>
<p>We are deploying to fly.io. We have to setup our app as a Docker image. Our apps
is in a monorepo. Our initial image was over 2 GB in size, which was excessively
large for a basic server.</p>
<p>Our image included everything, which was inefficient. After optimizing, our
image now occupies only 700MB. Although it is still somewhat large, it is a
significant improvement over our initial version.</p>
<p>It was something we never had to manage with Vercel deployment.</p>
<h3 id="-fly-deployment-timed">⏳ Fly deployment timed<a href="#-fly-deployment-timed"><span></span></a></h3>
<p>Our Fly deployments have been experiencing frequent timeouts without any
specific reason. The only solution we have discovered is to increase the timeout
duration.</p>
<pre><code>flyctl deploy --wait-timeout=500
</code></pre>
<p>Based on our experience, Fly deployments are generally less reliable compared
(more timed out) to Vercel deployments. Additionally, we have not discovered a
quick method to rollback to the previous version.</p>
<h3 id="-the-bun-bug">🐛 The Bun bug<a href="#-the-bun-bug"><span></span></a></h3>
<p>When we migrated to Fly, we decided to use Bun as our runtime. However, in the
first few hours after the migration, we observed an unexplained increase in
request failures.</p>
<p>After digging into the Bun GitHub we found a solution: We needed to set the
<code>keepalive</code> parameter to <code>false</code>. This is necessary because closed connections
are not automatically removed and remain in the ﻿<code>CLOSE_WAIT</code> state.</p>
<p>Here's the GitHub issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/3327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/3327</a></p>
<p>I wish it had been documented elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="our-conclusion">Our conclusion<a href="#our-conclusion"><span></span></a></h2>
<p>We are pleased with our migration to Fly.io, although it was accompanied by a
challenging weekend. And we still love Vercel, they offer a super product, it
removes a lot of pain for the developers.However, if you require a hosting an
application other than Next.js, it may not be the best option.</p>
<p>We are still using it for our frontend.</p>

<div><p><time datetime="2023-10-29T16:11:46-04:00">October 29, 2023 at 4:11 PM</time>
</p></div>


    
<p>I first read about the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy">blue ocean</a>” strategy in a story (probably in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)">Edge magazine</a>) about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Nintendo Wii</a>. While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">its</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">competitors</a> were fighting for supremacy in the game-console market by producing ever-more-powerful hardware capable of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television">high-definition</a> visuals, Nintendo chose not to join this fight. The pursuit of graphics power was a “red ocean” that was already teeming with sharks, fighting over the available fish and filling the water with blood.</p>

<p>Nintendo’s “blue ocean” strategy was to stake out a position where none of its competitors were present. The idea of creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-definition_television">standard-definition</a> game console in the generation when all the other consoles were moving to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television">HD</a> seemed ridiculous, but that’s exactly what Nintendo did. In place of impressive graphics, the Wii differentiated itself with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii#Wii_Remote">motion controls</a> and a low price. It was <a href="https://hypercritical.co/2013/02/24/images/who-dares-wins.jpg">a hit</a>.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about the blue ocean strategy in the context of Apple. Like Nintendo, Apple has made some bold moves with its products, many of which were ridiculed at the time: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">smartphone without a physical keyboard</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac">candy-colored desktop computer</a> with no floppy drive and no legacy ports, a $695 (in 2023 dollars) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod">portable music player</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">digital music store</a> in the age of ubiquitous music piracy.</p>

<p>Unlike Nintendo, Apple has seen its competitors move quickly to imitate its innovations, turning these oceans red and leaving Apple to compete on the basis of execution…until it finds its next blue ocean.</p>

<p>But what is that? It’s tempting to point to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Vision Pro</a>. AR/VR headsets are not new, but then, neither were smartphones or portable music players. The Vision Pro hasn’t shipped yet, so the jury’s still out. Let’s keep an eye on it.</p>

<p>I have something else in mind. It’s actually related to one of Apple’s earlier "blue ocean" changes: the elimination of removable batteries. In the beginning, Apple’s laptops all used removable battery packs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_500_series#:~:text=The%20500%20series%20of%20PowerBooks,from%20two%20installed%20charged%20batteries.">Some</a> even let the user pull out the floppy-drive module and replace it with a second battery.</p>

<p>Starting in <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.66-aluminum-17-early-2009-unibody-specs.html">2009</a>, Apple began to phase out removable batteries across its laptop line in favor of batteries that were sealed inside the case and were not user-accessible. The iPod and the iPhone arguably started this trend by never including removable batteries to begin with. (The iPhone defied so many other norms that the sealed battery was less remarked upon than it might have been, but it was still noted.)</p>

<p>The upsides, which Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/01/06Apple-Introduces-17-inch-MacBook-Pro-With-Revolutionary-New-Built-in-Battery-That-Delivers-Eight-Hours-of-Use-1-000-Recharges/">touted</a>, were many: lighter weight, smaller size, better reliability, longer battery life. We are still reaping these benefits today, and we Apple fans rarely question them. Today, predictably, non-removable batteries are a red ocean in many product categories. They are the norm, not an innovation.</p>

<p>When thinking about Apple’s next blue ocean, it’s tempting to ignore past innovations. Technological progress seems like an arrow pointing in only one direction, never turning back. But I just can’t shake the idea that a return to removable, user-accessible batteries has now become a blue-ocean opportunity just waiting for Apple to seize it.</p>

<p>Follow me, here. Yes, sealed batteries still offer all the same advantages they always have. And, yes, a return to removable batteries would bring back all their problems: increased size and weight, increased risk of liquid and dust ingress, decreased aesthetic elegance.</p>

<p>But some things have changed in the past couple of decades. Battery technology has improved, and Apple has moved its entire product line to its own silicon chips that lead the industry in power efficiency. There’s more headroom than there has ever been to accommodate a tiny bit more size and weight in Apple’s portable products.</p>

<p>That’s still a step backwards, right? But there are several countervailing forces, one of which is rapidly increasing in importance. The first is the fact that, as noted earlier, removable batteries are now a blue ocean. Apple would be alone among its biggest competitors if it made a wholesale change (back) to removable batteries in any of its product lines.</p>

<p>Second, people still crave the <i>advantages</i> of removable batteries that were left behind: increasing battery life by swapping batteries instead of using a cumbersome external battery pack, inexpensively and conveniently extending the life of a product by replacing a worn-out battery with a new one—without paying for someone else to perform delicate surgery on the device.</p>

<p>Finally, related to that last point, worn-out batteries are an extremely common reason that old tech products are traded in, recycled, or replaced. Removable batteries are an easy way to extend the useful life of a product. This leads to less <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste">e-waste</a>, which is perfectly aligned with <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/">Apple’s environmental goals</a> as <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/">2030 approaches</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, longer product lifetimes means fewer product sales per unit time, which seems to run counter to Apple’s <i>financial</i> goals. But this is a problem that can be solved using one of Apple’s favorite financial tools: higher product margins. If Apple can actually make products that have a longer useful life, it can charge more money for the extra value they provide.</p>

<p>It’s easy to think of product ideas that run counter to accepted wisdom; it’s harder to think of the <i>right</i> one. Sometimes a blue ocean is free from sharks simply because there are no fish there. But I think this idea has merit. I am not making a prediction, but I am making a suggestion.</p>

<p>I know some of you remain unconvinced. How can a removable battery be easy to swap and yet also be sealed against the elements? Won’t removable batteries ruin the appearance of Apple’s existing products by adding unsightly cut lines? Won’t they become unacceptably large and heavy? How can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/24/17389220/apple-bendgate-internal-documents-iphone-6-plus">structural integrity</a> be maintained with a giant hole cut out of the product frame? What about the risk of fire due to faulty battery connections or a battery packs coming in contact with something metal in a someone’s pocket? The list of problems goes on and on.</p>

<p>Innovation is never easy, but since when has Apple shied away from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_electric_car_project">a challenge</a>? As the industry leader in consumer-electronics design and manufacturing, Apple is best positioned to overcome the obstacles and reap the benefits of removable batteries. There’s no question it will be difficult, but if done well, it will undoubtedly be a hit. And as the company that led the transition away from removable batteries, it’s only fitting<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for Apple to be the one to bring them back.</p>

  <time datetime="2023-10-29">
      <a href="https://andadinosaur.com/youtube-s-anti-adblock-and-ublock-origin">29 October 2023</a>
</time>
  <p>Recently, YouTube has been ramping up its anti-adblock effort, and I’ve been watching this closely due to <a href="https://andadinosaur.com/launch-vinegar">personal interest</a>. This blog post is where I write down what I know.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="some-background">Some Background</h3>
<p>Here’s how adblockers (used to) block YouTube ads. Before playing a video, YouTube would check its API, and the server would send back something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>video</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>something.mp4</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>ads</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>ad1</span><span>,</span> <span>ad2</span><span>,</span> <span>ad3</span><span>],</span>
  <span>"</span><span>etc</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And the adblockers would override <code>JSON.parse</code> and <code>Response.json</code> to make it return this instead:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>video</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>something.mp4</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>ads</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>[],</span>
  <span>"</span><span>etc</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This trick worked for a few years. But earlier this year, YouTube started making fake requests to see if the responses were changed. If the responses were changed, it meant the user was using an adblocker.</p>

<p>Most adblockers stopped working, but a few like uBlock Origin and AdGuard updated their filters to avoid these fake requests. Then YouTube would update their fake requests so the adblockers would fall for them. It’s been a game of cat and mouse between YouTube and the adblockers ever since.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-tech-support-hell">The Tech Support Hell</h3>
<p>YouTube isn’t rolling out the anti-adblock to everyone. It seems to depend on things like your account, browser, and IP address. And if you’re not logged in or you’re in a private window, you’re safe. As a result, there are a bunch of people saying, “I use XYZ and I haven’t seen an anti-adblock popup yet,” unknowingly spreading misinformation.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing: YouTube isn’t just targeting adblockers. Use Privacy Badger? You’ll get flagged. Use Malwarebytes? You’ll get flagged. Set your Edge browser’s tracking protection to “strict”? Yep, <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/10/10/google-blocks-youtube-in-windows-11-microsoft-edge-with-strict-tracking-protection/">you’ll get flagged</a>. So a lot of people think their extensions are safe to use, but actually they’re not.</p>

<p>And contrary to what you might think, using multiple adblockers can actually make things worse. That’s because all your adblockers need to be up-to-date to dodge YouTube’s detection.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this is creating a tech support nightmare if you’re part of an adblocker team.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-redditors">The Redditors</h3>
<p>On Reddit, the uBO team put up a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/178yasm/youtube_antiadblock_and_ads_october_16_2023/">detailed post</a> on how to handle YouTube’s anti-adblock. But many people don’t actually follow it. You’d see people saying, “I did what the post said but I’m still having issues.” But when they’re asked to share their system info for troubleshooting, it turns out they didn’t really follow the post.</p>

<p>Then there are non-tech-savvy users looking at the post and saying, “This is too complex. I give up.”</p>

<p>Then there are tech-savvy users who say, “Your filter has <strong>CODE</strong> in it. That’s risky. Can you explain what it does? I don’t want to run anything I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>And of course, there’s always the classic “<strong>IVE TRIED EVERYTHING AND NOTHING WORKS HELP!!!!</strong>”</p>

<p>All this noise makes it hard to find any useful info.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-stupid-filters">The Stupid Filters</h3>
<p>Some people have been sharing custom filters that use CSS to hide the popups. But that’s like sticking your head in the sand. Sooner or later, they’ll get totally blocked and won’t know why.</p>

<p>Recently, someone shared a filter on Twitter that literally had code to set <code>adBlocksFound</code> to 0. It’s as if they think YouTube’s anti-adblock works like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>adBlocksFound</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>blockUser</span><span>();</span> <span>//!!!!!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That tweet got super popular. And it probably led a lot of people to add those filters to their adblockers. This has really piled on the work for the troubleshooting team. Did the person who shared it not realize it was harmful? Or did they just care about getting likes?</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-script-id">The Script ID</h3>
<p>Every time YouTube tweaks their script, part of the URL changes. This part is what uBO calls the ID, and they have a <a href="https://pastefy.app/G1Txv5su/raw">webpage</a> that keeps track of the latest one.</p>

<p>But here’s where things get messy. Some people think this ID is what they need to block. Some even suggest ways to automate the process (like, “Why don’t you just block that with <strong>REGULAR EXPRESSION</strong>?”)</p>

<p>Another issue is that sometimes YouTube pushes out an update that has nothing to do with adblock. But it still changes the ID. Then you get people saying, “The ID changed, why hasn’t this post updated yet???”</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-moderator-who-quit-reddit">The Moderator Who Quit Reddit</h3>
<p>All this resulted in a ton of pressure on the uBO team members who were trying to help out in the thread. One by one, I saw them say they’d had enough of the comments and weren’t going to reply in these threads anymore.</p>

<p>And then one of the moderators actually deleted their Reddit account. “The ID in the post wasn’t updated because my mother was hospitalized,” they said.</p>

<p>It’s sad to see them leave because of some drive-by comments — new users who sign up for Reddit, leave their comments, and then delete their accounts without facing any consequences.</p>

<p>Sure, there are people who appreciate what the uBO team is doing. But the hurtful comments leave a bigger mark than the good ones.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-war-of-attrition">The War of Attrition</h3>
<p>Since May, uBO has been in a cat-and-mouse game with YouTube. And they’ve shown incredible resilience, especially when you consider that there are only two people on the uBO team dealing with YouTube.</p>

<p>The uBO team members are all volunteers. They’ve gone above and beyond to meet every little request from their users. But there’s a limit to how much they can take. At some point, the constant demands become too much, and they will leave uBO for good. It’s one thing to play cat and mouse with YouTube. It’s quite another to deal with a wave of angry users.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s how YouTube will win this war of attrition.</p>

<p>In about 10 years, Apple has multiplied by 19 the number of transistors in its mobile processors. It corresponds roughly to a steady rate of improvement of 34% per year on the number of transistors, or a doubling every 2.5 years. In real dollars, an iPhone has roughly a constant price: <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-price-history-3221497/">the price tag of a new iPhone increases every year, but it does so while tracking the inflation</a>. Thus you are getting ever more transistors in your iPhone for the same price.</p>

But above all, he endures as our era’s greatest patron saint of reason and critical thinking, a master of <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/05/23/carl-sagan-the-burden-of-skepticism/">the vital balance between skepticism and openness</a>. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle/dp/0345409469/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/demon-haunted-world-science-as-a-candle-in-the-dark/oclc/32855551&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) — the same indispensable volume that gave us Sagan’s timeless meditation on <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/06/12/carl-sagan-on-science-and-spirituality/">science and spirituality</a>, published mere months before his death in 1996 — Sagan shares his secret to upholding the rites of reason, even in the face of society’s most shameless untruths and outrageous propaganda.</p>
<p>In a chapter titled <strong>“The Fine Art of Baloney Detection,”</strong> Sagan reflects on the many types of deception to which we’re susceptible — from psychics to religious zealotry to paid product endorsements by scientists, which he held in especially low regard, noting that they “betray contempt for the intelligence of their customers” and “introduce an insidious corruption of popular attitudes about scientific objectivity.” (Cue in <a href="http://explore.noodle.org/post/70511854124/so-great-so-necessary-joe-hanson-of-its-okay">PBS’s Joe Hanson on how to read science news</a>.) But rather than preaching from the ivory tower of self-righteousness, Sagan approaches the subject from the most vulnerable of places — having just lost both of his parents, he reflects on the all too human allure of promises of supernatural reunions in the afterlife, reminding us that falling for such fictions doesn’t make us stupid or bad people, but simply means that we need to equip ourselves with the right tools against them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle/dp/0345409469/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/carlsagan1.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/carlsagan1.jpg?w=680&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p>
<p>Through their training, scientists are equipped with what Sagan calls a “baloney detection kit” — a set of cognitive tools and techniques that fortify the mind against penetration by falsehoods:</p>
<blockquote><p>The kit is brought out as a matter of course whenever new ideas are offered for consideration. If the new idea survives examination by the tools in our kit, we grant it warm, although tentative, acceptance. If you’re so inclined, if you don’t want to buy baloney even when it’s reassuring to do so, there are precautions that can be taken; there’s a tried-and-true, consumer-tested method.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the kit, Sagan argues, isn’t merely a tool of science — rather, it contains invaluable tools of healthy skepticism that apply just as elegantly, and just as necessarily, to everyday life. By adopting the kit, we can all shield ourselves against clueless guile and deliberate manipulation. Sagan shares nine of these tools:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the “facts.”</li>
<li>Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view.</li>
<li>Arguments from authority carry little weight — “authorities” have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.</li>
<li>Spin more than one hypothesis. If there’s something to be explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might systematically disprove each of the alternatives. What survives, the hypothesis that resists disproof in this Darwinian selection among “multiple working hypotheses,” has a much better chance of being the right answer than if you had simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.</li>
<li>Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it’s yours. It’s only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask yourself why you like the idea. Compare it fairly with the alternatives. See if you can find reasons for rejecting it. If you don’t, others will.</li>
<li>Quantify. If whatever it is you’re explaining has some measure, some numerical quantity attached to it, you’ll be much better able to discriminate among competing hypotheses. What is vague and qualitative is open to many explanations. Of course there are truths to be sought in the many qualitative issues we are obliged to confront, but finding <em>them</em> is more challenging.</li>
<li>If there’s a chain of argument, <em>every</em> link in the chain must work (including the premise) — not just most of them.</li>
<li>Occam’s Razor. This convenient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypotheses that explain the data <em>equally well</em> to choose the simpler.</li>
<li>Always ask whether the hypothesis can be, at least in principle, falsified. Propositions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much. Consider the grand idea that our Universe and everything in it is just an elementary particle — an electron, say — in a much bigger Cosmos. But if we can never acquire information from outside our Universe, is not the idea incapable of disproof? You must be able to check assertions out. Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and see if they get the same result.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle/dp/0345409469/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/carlsagan.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/carlsagan.jpg?w=680&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p>
<p>Just as important as learning these helpful tools, however, is unlearning and avoiding the most common pitfalls of common sense. Reminding us of where society is most vulnerable to those, Sagan writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to teaching us what to do when evaluating a claim to knowledge, any good baloney detection kit must also teach us what not to do. It helps us recognize the most common and perilous fallacies of logic and rhetoric. Many good examples can be found in religion and politics, because their practitioners are so often obliged to justify two contradictory propositions.</p></blockquote>
<p>He admonishes against the twenty most common and perilous ones — many rooted in our <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/11/11/dani-shapiro-still-writing-2/">chronic discomfort with ambiguity</a> — with examples of each in action:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>ad hominem</em></strong> — Latin for “to the man,” attacking the arguer and not the argument (e.g., <em>The Reverend Dr. Smith is a known Biblical fundamentalist, so her objections to evolution need not be taken seriously</em>)</li>
<li><strong>argument from authority</strong> (e.g., <em>President Richard Nixon should be re-elected because he has a secret plan to end the war in Southeast Asia</em> — but because it was secret, there was no way for the electorate to evaluate it on its merits; the argument amounted to trusting him because he was President: a mistake, as it turned out)</li>
<li><strong>argument from adverse consequences</strong> (e.g., <em>A God meting out punishment and reward must exist, because if He didn’t, society would be much more lawless and dangerous</em> — perhaps even ungovernable. Or: <em>The defendant in a widely publicized murder trial must be found guilty; otherwise, it will be an encouragement for other men to murder their wives</em>)</li>
<li><strong>appeal to ignorance</strong> — the claim that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa (e.g., <em>There is no compelling evidence that UFOs are not visiting the Earth; therefore UFOs exist — and there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe.</em> Or: <em>There may be seventy kazillion other worlds, but not one is known to have the moral advancement of the Earth, so we’re still central to the Universe.</em>) This impatience with ambiguity can be criticized in the phrase: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</li>
<li><strong>special pleading</strong>, often to rescue a proposition in deep rhetorical trouble (e.g., <em>How can a merciful God condemn future generations to torment because, against orders, one woman induced one man to eat an apple? Special plead: you don’t understand the subtle Doctrine of Free Will</em>. Or: <em>How can there be an equally godlike Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in the same Person? Special plead: You don’t understand the Divine Mystery of the Trinity.</em> Or: <em>How could God permit the followers of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam — each in their own way enjoined to heroic measures of loving kindness and compassion — to have perpetrated so much cruelty for so long? Special plead: You don’t understand Free Will again. And anyway, God moves in mysterious ways.</em>)</li>
<li><strong>begging the question</strong>, also called <strong>assuming the answer</strong> (e.g., <em>We must institute the death penalty to discourage violent crime. But does the violent crime rate in fact fall when the death penalty is imposed?</em> Or: <em>The stock market fell yesterday because of a technical adjustment and profit-taking by investors</em> — but is there any independent evidence for the causal role of “adjustment” and profit-taking; have we learned anything at all from this purported explanation?)</li>
<li><strong>observational selection</strong>, also called <strong>the enumeration of favorable circumstances</strong>, or as the philosopher Francis Bacon described it, counting the hits and forgetting the misses (e.g., <em>A state boasts of the Presidents it has produced, but is silent on its serial killers</em>)</li>
<li><strong>statistics of small numbers</strong> — a close relative of observational selection (e.g., <em>“They say 1 out of every 5 people is Chinese. How is this possible? I know hundreds of people, and none of them is Chinese. Yours truly.”</em> Or: <em>“I’ve thrown three sevens in a row. Tonight I can’t lose.”</em>)</li>
<li><strong>misunderstanding of the nature of statistics</strong> (e.g., <em>President Dwight Eisenhower expressing astonishment and alarm on discovering that fully half of all Americans have below average intelligence)</em>;</li>
<li><strong>inconsistency</strong> (e.g., <em>Prudently plan for the worst of which a potential military adversary is capable, but thriftily ignore scientific projections on environmental dangers because they’re not “proved.”</em> Or: <em>Attribute the declining life expectancy in the former Soviet Union to the failures of communism many years ago, but never attribute the high infant mortality rate in the United States (now highest of the major industrial nations) to the failures of capitalism.</em> Or: <em>Consider it reasonable for the Universe to continue to exist forever into the future, but judge absurd the possibility that it has infinite duration into the past)</em>;</li>
<li><strong><em>non sequitur</em></strong> — Latin for “It doesn’t follow” (e.g., <em>Our nation will prevail because God is great. But nearly every nation pretends this to be true; the German formulation was “Gott mit uns”</em>). Often those falling into the non sequitur fallacy have simply failed to recognize alternative possibilities;</li>
<li><strong><em>post hoc, ergo propter hoc</em></strong> — Latin for “It happened after, so it was caused by” (e.g., <em>Jaime Cardinal Sin, Archbishop of Manila: “I know of … a 26-year-old who looks 60 because she takes [contraceptive] pills.”</em> Or: <em>Before women got the vote, there were no nuclear weapons</em>)</li>
<li><strong>meaningless question</strong> (e.g., <em>What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object? But if there is such a thing as an irresistible force there can be no immovable objects, and vice versa</em>)</li>
<li><strong>excluded middle</strong>, or <strong>false dichotomy</strong> — considering only the two extremes in a continuum of intermediate possibilities (e.g., <em>“Sure, take his side; my husband’s perfect; I’m always wrong.” Or: “Either you love your country or you hate it.” Or: “If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem”</em>)</li>
<li><strong>short-term vs. long-term</strong> — a subset of the excluded middle, but so important I’ve pulled it out for special attention (e.g., <em>We can’t afford programs to feed malnourished children and educate pre-school kids. We need to urgently deal with crime on the streets.</em> Or: <em>Why explore space or pursue fundamental science when we have so huge a budget deficit?)</em>;</li>
<li><strong>slippery slope</strong>, related to excluded middle (e.g., <em>If we allow abortion in the first weeks of pregnancy, it will be impossible to prevent the killing of a full-term infant</em>. Or, conversely: <em>If the state prohibits abortion even in the ninth month, it will soon be telling us what to do with our bodies around the time of conception)</em>;</li>
<li><strong>confusion of correlation and causation</strong> (e.g., <em>A survey shows that more college graduates are homosexual than those with lesser education; therefore education makes people gay.</em> Or: <em>Andean earthquakes are correlated with closest approaches of the planet Uranus; therefore — despite the absence of any such correlation for the nearer, more massive planet Jupiter — the latter causes the former</em>)</li>
<li><strong>straw man</strong> — caricaturing a position to make it easier to attack (e.g., <em>Scientists suppose that living things simply fell together by chance</em> — a formulation that willfully ignores the central Darwinian insight, that Nature ratchets up by saving what works and discarding what doesn’t. Or — this is also a short-term/long-term fallacy — <em>environmentalists care more for snail darters and spotted owls than they do for people</em>)</li>
<li><strong>suppressed evidence</strong>, or <strong>half-truths</strong> (e.g., <em>An amazingly accurate and widely quoted “prophecy” of the assassination attempt on President Reagan is shown on television</em>; but — an important detail — was it recorded before or after the event? Or: <em>These government abuses demand revolution, even if you can’t make an omelette without breaking some eggs.</em> Yes, but is this likely to be a revolution in which far more people are killed than under the previous regime? What does the experience of other revolutions suggest? Are all revolutions against oppressive regimes desirable and in the interests of the people?)</li>
<li><strong>weasel words</strong> (e.g., The separation of powers of the U.S. Constitution specifies that the United States may not conduct a war without a declaration by Congress. On the other hand, Presidents are given control of foreign policy and the conduct of wars, which are potentially powerful tools for getting themselves re-elected. Presidents of either political party may therefore be tempted to arrange wars while waving the flag and calling the wars something else — “police actions,” “armed incursions,” “protective reaction strikes,” “pacification,” “safeguarding American interests,” and a wide variety of “operations,” such as “Operation Just Cause.” Euphemisms for war are one of a broad class of reinventions of language for political purposes. Talleyrand said, “An important art of politicians is to find new names for institutions which under old names have become odious to the public”)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Sagan ends the chapter with a necessary disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like all tools, the baloney detection kit can be misused, applied out of context, or even employed as a rote alternative to thinking. But applied judiciously, it can make all the difference in the world — not least in evaluating our own arguments before we present them to others.</p></blockquote>

<hr>

<p>This best-selling textbook for a second course in linear algebra is aimed at undergraduate math majors and graduate students. The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra.

</p><p>No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus the text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner product spaces are then introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences such as the singular value decomposition. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator. Determinants are cleanly introduced via alternating multilinear forms.
	
</p><h3>Excerpts from Reviews</h3>

Altogether, the text is a didactic masterpiece.<br>
<cite>zbMATH</cite>

<p>Axler demotes determinants (usually quite a central technique in the finite dimensional setting, though marginal in infinite dimensions) to a minor role.  To so consistently do without determinants constitutes a tour de force in the service of simplicity and clarity; these are also well served by the general precision of Axler's prose... The most original linear algebra book to appear in years, it certainly belongs in every undergraduate library.<br>
<cite>Choice</cite>

</p><p>The determinant-free proofs are elegant and intuitive.<br>
<cite>American Mathematical Monthly</cite>

</p><p>Clarity through examples is emphasized... the text is ideal for class exercises... I congratulate the author and the publisher for a well-produced textbook on linear algebra.<br>

<p>A gold coin minted by a little-known ruler in ancient Britain — an Iron Age man who said he was as "mighty" as a god — has been found by a metal detectorist and auctioned off in England.</p><p>The rare coin was discovered in March 2023 in Hampshire county and was auctioned Sept. 28 for 20,400 British pounds ($24,720), Spink auction house said in a series of statements.</p><p>A Latin alphabetic inscription on the coin bears the name "Esunertos," which can be translated as "mighty as the god Esos," (also spelled Esus) the statements said. The name itself is Gaulish, a language commonly spoken in the region at the time, <a href="https://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-john-a-sills" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-john-a-sills"><u>John Sills</u></a>, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford's Institute of Archaeology who examined the coin before it was auctioned, told Live Science in an email.</p><p>The coin dates to sometime between 50 B.C. and 30 B.C., a time after Julius Caesar invaded Britain twice around 55 B.C. to 54 B.C., the statement said. Caesar's invasions failed to establish permanent Roman control over Britain. It wasn't until after another Roman invasion, launched in A.D. 43 by Emperor Claudius, that the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/roman-empire" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/roman-empire"><u>Roman Empire</u></a> managed to gain long-term control over part of the island.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans/liquid-gypsum-burial-from-roman-britain-scanned-in-3d-revealing-1700-year-old-secrets" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans/liquid-gypsum-burial-from-roman-britain-scanned-in-3d-revealing-1700-year-old-secrets"><u><strong>'Liquid gypsum' burial from Roman Britain scanned in 3D, revealing 1,700-year-old secrets</strong></u></a></p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="This gold coin was found in March 2023 and has the name &quot;Esunertos&quot; inscribed on it." onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/livescience/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC.jpg"><source type="image/jpeg" alt="This gold coin was found in March 2023 and has the name &quot;Esunertos&quot; inscribed on it." onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/livescience/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC.jpg" alt="This gold coin was found in March 2023 and has the name &quot;Esunertos&quot; inscribed on it." onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/livescience/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr9PMSJ7xAX52sFB8BkXGC-1200-80.jpg 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>This gold coin was found in March 2023 and has the name "Esunertos" inscribed on it.&nbsp; </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Courtesy Spink)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This coin is one of only three on record that bear the name Esunertos, Sills said.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/fourth-us-health-visits-now-delivered-non-physicians">https://hms.harvard.edu/news/fourth-us-health-visits-now-delivered-non-physicians</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38058902">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><br><span><span><strong>At a glance:</strong></span></span></p>

<ul><li><span><span><strong>From 2013 to 2019 the share of U.S. health care visits delivered by non-physicians such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants increased from 14 to 26 percent.</strong></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>This rapid shift requires caregivers, medical educators, and policymakers to understand and manage this growing segment of the health care workforce.</strong></span></span></li>
</ul><hr><p><span><span>The proportion of health care visits delivered by nurse practitioners and physician assistants in the U.S. is increasing rapidly and now accounts for a quarter of all health care visits, according to a study <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj-2022-073933">published Sept. 14 in the <em>BMJ</em></a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/sign-email-communications">Get more HMS news here</a></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The analysis, led by researchers from the Department of Health Care Policy in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School, highlights the rising importance of this rapidly growing segment of the U.S. health care system.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The research is the first nationally representative study of the share of health care delivered by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, collectively known as advanced practice providers. It is also the first study to look at care delivered across different clinical conditions. The researchers analyzed 276 million visits from a nationally representative sample of Medicare insured patients. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Study co-authors <a href="https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/people/ateev-mehrotra">Ateev Mehrotra</a>, professor of health care policy at HMS, and <a href="https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/people/sadiq-patel">Sadiq Patel</a>, a former NIH postdoctoral fellow at HMS, spoke with <em>Harvard Medicine News</em> about the increasingly important role these providers play in our health care system.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><em>Harvard Medicine News:</em> How did we get to the point where a quarter of all medical visits are conducted by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, not by physicians?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Mehrotra:</strong> The roles of nurse practitioners and physician assistants were created in the mid 1960s to address what were already identified at that time as physician shortages. We looked specifically at the years from 2013 to 2019, when the proportion of all traditional health care visits delivered by nurse practitioners and physician assistants increased from 14 to 25.6 percent.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span><span><span>That’s the average, but it varied across different conditions. Forty-seven percent of respiratory infection visits and 31 percent of visits for anxiety disorders were conducted by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, but it was only 13 percent for eye disorders and 20 percent for hypertension. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><em>HMNews</em>: What’s driving this recent growth?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Mehrotra:</strong> The short answer is supply and demand. The U.S. has fewer physicians per capita than most of our peer nations. Who is going to provide that care? The number of nurse practitioners and physician assistants has grown more quickly than the number of physicians. And this trend will only continue as we move forward. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that between 2019 and 2031 the number of nurse practitioners in the U.S. will increase by 80 percent and the number of physician assistants by nearly 50 percent. In contrast, the growth rate for physicians over the next decade or so is estimated at less than 5 percent.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><em>HMNews:</em> Are there some patients who are more likely to see nurse practitioners or physician assistants than others?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Patel:</strong> Nurse practitioners and physician assistants are very widespread: Among all patients with at least one visit in 2019, 42 percent had one or more nurse practitioner or physician assistant visits. But there were some groups more likely to see nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The likelihood was greatest among patients who were lower income, rural residents, and people with disabilities.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>That’s another reason it’s so important to get this right. We’ve known that these groups often have greater difficulty accessing care, and nurse practitioners and physician assistants are critical to providing this access.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><em>HMNews:</em> When people are sick, they usually think about “going to the doctor.” Is this change worrying? Is there a difference in quality or cost between the care delivered by nurses and physician assistants versus the care delivered by physicians?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Mehrotra:</strong> First of all, it’s very important to emphasize that it’s not really a question of one or the other. Almost all these practitioners work in teams that include physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants working together.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Most of the research agrees that all three professions can do a good job delivering care in most settings, especially primary care. And it turns out that there is not a significant difference in spending. But there are clinical conditions that might be better suited to one profession or another.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Patel:</strong> One of the things that we wanted to do with this study was to start looking at the specific types of care these allied professionals were most likely to deliver.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><em>HMNews</em>: What did you learn?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Patel:</strong> As Ateev mentioned, patients were less likely to see a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant for an eye disorder, and more likely to see them for a respiratory infection. That seems like a reasonable allocation of resources, given the relative complexity of the clinical conditions. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The high use of nurse practitioners and physician assistants for anxiety disorders is another interesting example. There simply aren’t enough psychiatrists to treat all the people who need care for mental health conditions. But the good news is that there are highly effective evidence-based treatments that can help a lot of people with depression and anxiety that do not require a physician to deliver.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Mehrotra</strong>: Hopefully one benefit that will follow from this research is that we will be able to identify the services that allied health professionals can deliver and provide the training and support services they need to take care of their patients, like proactively planning for remote supervision in more complex psychiatric services or specialist consults by telemedicine.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><em>HMNews: </em>Any predictions on how these changes will shape health care going forward?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Mehrotra</strong>: The increase in care delivery by nurse practitioners and physician assistants represents a massive change. We need more research on how to best structure teams of clinicians — nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians — so that they can work together to provide the most effective care possible. If we are thoughtful about how we move forward as those changes continue to happen, that’s millions of opportunities to do it better. I hope we take advantage of that opportunity.</span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div x-data="prose"> <!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><p>This article was first published on Big Think in February 2022. It was updated in September 2023.</p><p>The surface of Mars is barren and dry, with what little water there is tied up in icecaps or perhaps existing below the surface. But if you look closely at the surface, you will see what looks like shorelines or canyons where massive floods once took place.</p><p>Billions of years ago, the atmosphere of Mars may have been denser and the air slightly warmer. By looking at deltas present on Mars, similar to river deltas on Earth, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some have suggested</a> that oceans used to partially cover the planet. (See <a href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/wet-mars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Strange Map #1043</a>.) <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-research-suggests-mars-once-had-more-water-than-earth-s-arctic-ocean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Others have looked at the composition of Mars meteorites</a>, which can show how the chemistry of Mars today compares to what the planet looked like billions of years ago. Both lines of evidence suggest that about four billion years ago, Mars’ northern hemisphere was covered with a massive ocean.</p><p>Today, this ocean is just a memory. Research led by the University of Tokyo and published in 2022 in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28274-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications</a></em> offers one reason why: Billions of years ago, Mars lost its magnetic field. Without the protection that a magnetic field offered, the atmosphere was stripped, and eventually, the oceans evaporated as water vapor in the atmosphere was lost to space.</p><h2 id="h-magnetic-fields-and-oceans">Magnetic fields and oceans</h2><p>The Solar System is a harsh place. Our life-giving Sun can also take life away. The Sun produces enormous amounts of radiation that — were it not for the protective effect of our magnetic field — would fry our planet. Without the magnetic field, the solar wind would strip our atmosphere, and the oceans would evaporate and be lost to space. In other words, Earth would end up like Mars.</p><p>The Earth is the only one of the rocky planets in our Solar System to have a strong magnetic field. Its presence is likely one of the major reasons why Mars and Earth are so vastly different. But billions of years ago, Mars too had a strong magnetic field. So, what happened?</p><h2>How Mars lost its magnetic field and oceans</h2><p>To investigate, a team led by Shunpei Yokoo of the University of Tokyo simulated the core of Mars in a lab here on Earth. The team made a material using a mixture of iron, sulfur, and hydrogen, which are believed to be present in the core of Mars.</p><p>Sulfur is probably in the core, since Mars meteorites (which sample the crust and mantle) do not contain many elements typically found alongside sulfur. Hydrogen may be plentiful in the core since Mars is close to the “snow line” in our Solar System, where water ice was abundant during planet formation. “We can reasonably assume that it [the core] is Fe-S-H liquid but needs to be verified by further marsquake (Martian earthquake) observations,” Yokoo told Big Think. “The ongoing NASA’s InSight mission might tell us more in the near future.”</p><p>The team then placed this iron, sulfur, and hydrogen mix between two diamonds and heated it with a laser, simulating the high temperatures and pressures present within the core of a rocky planet. The material separated into two distinct liquids — one with iron and sulfur, the other with iron and hydrogen. Because the liquid containing hydrogen was less dense, it rose to the top. And as the liquids separated, convective currents formed.</p><p>This is similar to what would have happened in the early history of Mars. The iron-sulfur-hydrogen liquid would form convective currents as the sulfur separates from the hydrogen. These currents would have formed a protective magnetic field around the planet. But such currents are short-lived. As soon as the two liquids fully separated, the currents would stop, and the magnetic field would vanish. Eventually, the atmosphere would be stripped and the oceans would disappear.</p><h2>Similar physics in the Earth’s core</h2><p>This separation of iron-sulfur and iron-hydrogen liquids is also seen within the Earth, but with a key difference: temperature.</p><p>“The temperature of the Earth’s core (~6,740 °F) is much higher than that of Mars’ core,” Yokoo told Big Think. At these high temperatures, the iron-sulfur and iron-hydrogen liquids mix together. However, we do see stratification higher in the core, where the temperatures are lower. “This is the reason why the Earth’s core is stratified only at its top, while Mars’ core is entirely stratified,” Yokoo said. “It should take a very long time (like one billion years) for the Earth’s core to be fully stratified.”</p><p>We’ve got time, in other words.</p><p>These results, however, have implications in the search for habitable exoplanets. A common metric used to determine if an extrasolar planet can host life is the presence of liquid water on the surface in a location that is neither too cold nor too hot. But perhaps a strong magnetic field <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-03-strong-planetary-magnetic-fields-earth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should be another key metric</a> to determine whether the planet can hold onto its water. And it may very well be that magnetic fields as strong as the Earth’s are relatively rare in the Universe.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2 id="the-popular-model">The popular model</h2><p>Software product companies aren’t usually started by people with a strong background in building software products. Those who most likely end up founding businesses are good at getting funding, and at understanding their target industry. They’ve been in their industry for a long time, know their industry inside out, convinced themselves this means they can do it, and used their relationships and skills to get the money necessary to start a company.
These people tend to lead everything personally, and a lot could be said about the damage domain experts cause to their own companies when they lead things. Somebody already did it though, and they did it so well that there’s no point in me doing a worse job.</p><p>Sometimes, though, they acknowledge the danger they represent, and hire somebody in charge of making decisions. Often, they think “We don’t want to be a service organization, but a product company. Product companies are product-led, hence product managers should be in charge.”</p><p>So they go and hire a career product manager, and have them make all decisions. Whenever somebody objects to this idea, the usual answer is that “all great companies work like this: Amazon, Apple, Tesla, etc.”.</p><p>It’s unquestionable that many great companies delegate control to a single person. Indeed, not all great companies adopt this model, but let’s keep this aspect for the end of the article.</p><h2 id="tremendous-people-are-amazing">Tremendous people are amazing</h2><p>So what’s wrong with giving control of a company to a single person? The problem is not much with the model, which can work really well, but with the who, the person you give control to.</p><p>Humans are inevitably fascinated by greatness. Movies, books, documentaries, quotes: we all can’t help being inspired by those people that changed the world with their vision and work.</p><p>Picasso, Jeff Bezos, Mozart, Steve Jobs, Nikola Tesla, Elon Musk, Robert Oppenheimer, Peter Thiel, Leonardo, and others are worshipped by the masses. And what’s not to love in the inspiring vision, magnetic charisma, unwavering self-confidence, stalwart resilience, and sheer greatness these people embody? Many would do anything to work with these people. Heck, for these people.</p><p>Tremendous people envision alternative realities, fully commit themselves to their work, and move mountains with their willpower. Even if these figures are often controversial, everybody dreams of being like them. You can love them or hate them, but you’re forced to acknowledge them.</p><p>So what’s the problem with wanting to adopt this model? Absolutely nothing. It’s amazing.</p><h2 id="but-theyre-not-for-every-company">But they’re not for every company</h2><p>Do you know, though, what all the great people mentioned above have in common? None of them was a product manager. Not a single one. Actually, take a minute to think hard, and come up with one product manager that achieved anything comparable to these folks.</p><p>These people were artists, mathematicians, inventors, scientists, CEOs, and often more than one of these at a time. Do you know what else they had in common? None of them were motivated by OKRs, KPIs, data, or other people’s opinion. They were obsessed by their vision and craft. In an all-consuming, totally uncompromising way: anything short of perfection was inconceivable to them.</p><p>Tremendous people also tend to have very strong opinions, a big ego, their way of doing things, rough edges, and a disdain for mediocrity. They’re borderline unemployable, and they likely wouldn’t want to work in most companies. To them, it’s about creating something extraordinary for the sheer pleasure of it. And that’s why they disregarded work-life balance: their craft is their biggest joy. Imagine asking Michelangelo not to sculpt the back of a statue because the customer wants to put it against a wall.</p><p>But the more somebody is mediocre, the more likely they are to be put off by this intensity and passion. The more they’re willing to compromise, to lower standards, and to cut corners.</p><p>There are various degrees of greatness, but the greater somebody is, the more they approach the behavior of the greatest.</p><p>So, sure, if you can find someone tremendous, you’re willing to get out of their way, and you can cope with their intensity, by all means give them control over your product and company. They’ll produce extraordinary things.</p><p>Good chances are, though, that you wouldn’t be able to find them, that they wouldn’t want to work for you or with you, and that you wouldn’t be able to tolerate their ego and burning intensity.</p><h2 id="the-mistake">The mistake</h2><p>So what do you do instead? The enormous mistake you can make is to adopt a model that requires tremendous people, without having these tremendous people. The product managers you can hire and are comfortable hiring aren’t tremendous people. Whether they’re business lackeys, framework fanatics, subject-matter experts, former makers that climbed the corporate ladder, metrics junkies, or - God forbid - MBA graduates, there’s nothing great about them.</p><p>So what happens when you try to replicate something you have heard or read, but with a different breed of people? When you think “product led” means having a product manager making all decisions, and you hire a career product manager for this?</p><p>It can be deadly, and it typically is. And not the kind of death people can usually see coming. A much sneakier one, one that saps your company’s strength and empties its soul, until there’s nothing left.</p><p>These PMs you hire have no vision, charisma, expertise, strong beliefs, or technical skills. So what do they do when you give them that kind of power? They play it safe, and they play politics. Since they know they’re inadequate, they continuously attempt to claim credit and avoid blame.</p><p>First, they weaponize data-driven decisions. Instead of acknowledging that you can find supporting data for every claim, they pretend that their decisions are the only possible sensible possibilities given the data. When things go south, they blame the market, the quality of the data, or the company’s bad luck. It was never their fault, as that’s what the data was saying.</p><p>Next up is introducing frameworks and roles for everything. You get a career progression framework with 18 levels, quarterly performance assessments, PI planning, ADRs, PRDs, RACI, MOSCOW, OKRs, KPIs, DORA, and SAFe. People get blamed for not following the process, not being data-driven, not writing enough documentation, not keeping their documentation up-to-date, and so on. You also end up with Director of KPIs, Deputy Director of Product Operations, and Global Head of Digital Whiteboard Solutions. You soon need approvals for everything, and nobody entirely controls a process or aspect anymore. Everything involves a large committee, where anyone can say “no” to anything, but nobody can fully say “yes”.</p><p>Meetings also tend to explode in number: status reports, alignment talks, 1:1s, staff meetings, strategy discussions, context-setting talks, release go/no-go meetings, project reports, etc.</p><p>As a final nail in the coffin, they hire a ton of bad people. People are hired based on whether they’d represent no treat, so any trace of greatness pretty much guarantees a rejection. The ideal hire becomes a mindless all-rounder, who semi-competently does everything they’re told, without any dissent or care for quality. They need hordes of them, to hide among the pack, and so that there are always people to blame. The number of product managers, in particular, skyrockets. A whole hierarchy of PMs, one or more in each team and on each aspect, all behaving the same.</p><h2 id="the-damage">The damage</h2><p>What happens to companies that, by putting mediocre people in charge, start the journey described above? Well, it’s not pretty.</p><p>Anyone with even a speckle of greatness eventually leaves. They either get pushed out by the mediocre dictator, or they leave on their own terms, as the environment has become intolerable to them.</p><p>Work grinds to a halt. Doing anything is suddenly painful, a big commitment, and a risky endeavor. Everybody runs just to stand still. Any grand vision becomes so unrealistic that it’s quickly abandoned. Low-hanging fruits and safe bets become the only work the company does. Even those who are not passionate about their craft feel the pain and eventually leave. Those who are numb enough to remain make the problem worse.</p><p>Slowly but surely, the company loses its best talent, forgets its vision, becomes internally-focused, and drifts into irrelevance. At best, it dies at some point. At worst, it survives in this half-life, turning passionate people into zombies who hate their job.</p><h2 id="a-ray-of-hope">A ray of hope</h2><p>Is there any alternative, then, to finding, hiring, putting in charge, and coping with a tremendous person? If you’re not pushed by greatness and craftsmanship, can you not build a successful product company? Good news is, you can! There’s an alternative model that works.</p><p>You hire everyday great people. Each one needs to be great at something, obsessed by their craft, and driven by quality. You then put them together in a team, without individual responsibilities, ensuring that there’s minimal overlap in areas of greatness. And you pay them to have fun doing what they love doing, in exchange for putting their time and skills at the service of your company.</p><p>These people are still going to be challenging, stubborn, egotistic, quirky, and volatile. But give them good problems to solve, allow them to do great work, and they’ll fully dedicate themselves to making your company successful.</p><h2 id="what-about-leaders-and-product-managers">What about leaders and product managers?</h2><p>Do you need to give up the idea of leaders altogether? Not really, even if you can definitely live without. You could avoid team leads completely, and have area leads as outside-in coordinators. But if you decide that you prefer having a leader responsible for each area, then by all means put a great person in that role. The leader of an area should be the person that gets closer to the various Jobs, Musk, and Bezos, in terms of vision, charisma, intensity, passion, and extreme behavior. Don’t fall into the trap of putting in charge those people who make your life easy in the short term, do what they’re told, and don’t require your attention. A wrong move here, and you risk the situation above.</p><p>And what about product managers? Is there no space for PMs in a well-operating company? Not for the PM role, no. At least not in its traditional meaning. This model still requires great people, passionate and visionary about their area of expertise. And you do need people that obsess about product discovery, product observability, and other areas traditionally delegated to product managers. Almost inevitably, these people will have held a product manager role, and that’s fine. But you’re hiring because of the obsession and the strengths, not because of the title. And you’re not going to give these folks a PM role, but put them in a team with people who obsess over engineering, design, performance, business, and domain knowledge.</p><h2 id="how-much-of-this-was-specific-to-product-managers">How much of this was specific to product managers?</h2><p>I’d be dishonest if I wouldn’t admit that the problems I described happen everytime anyone without vision, charisma, passion, technical skills, and willpower is put in charge. So why the focus on product managers? It’s because of this tendency to wanting people with a product manager title in charge of software product development. To be fair, some PMs I know are absolutely tremendous, and would do very well in both the models I described. But they wouldn’t necessarily do better than other great people, regardless of their background. Also, they’re a tiny minority, and most career PMs are nowhere near being capable of leading by greatness.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<h4>About this book</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
  Calculus Made Easy is a book on calculus originally published in 1910 by Silvanus P. Thompson, considered a classic and elegant introduction to the subject.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
	I read "Calculus Made Easy" by Silvanus P. Thompson and it's still to this day my inspiration for explaining complex technical topics to lay people. It's a fantastic book, and even if you know math you <em>must</em> read it if you want to understand how to teach complexity to others. <small><em><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1299805">(source)</a></em></small>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
	Thompson creates a warm, inviting environment where students will learn and grasp the true essence of calculus without any added fluff or overt technicality. <small><em><a href="http://mathblog.com/mathematics-books/">(source)</a></em></small>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>
	      Most college calculus texts weigh a ton; this one does not — it just gets to the point. This is how I learned calculus: my uncle gave me a copy. <small><em><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home//baez/books.html">(source)</a></em></small>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://umarbutler.com/how-i-built-the-largest-open-database-of-australian-law/">https://umarbutler.com/how-i-built-the-largest-open-database-of-australian-law/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38057759">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Late last year, while attempting to train a large language model to solve legal problems, I made a surprising discovery — there weren’t any open databases of Australian law to train my model on. While there were certainly a few free-to-access legal databases, none were truly <em>open</em>, at least not in the sense of being able to just download their data and start training models without fear of infringing on anyone’s copyright. They all had policies against web scraping, and they were all either unable or unwilling to license their content.</p>



<p>So, before I could start training an LLM on Australian legal data, I’d need to get my hands on that data first. As with most of my projects, this sounded much easier than it would actually turn out to be. Almost a year later, and I am still hard at work on expanding my database to encompass all of Australia’s legal code.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll walk you through the entire process of how I built the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/umarbutler/open-australian-legal-corpus">Open Australian Legal Corpus</a>, the largest open database of Australian law, from months-long negotiations with governments to reverse engineering ancient web technologies to hacking together a multitude of different solutions for extracting text from documents.</p>



<p>The first step was to ask Australian governments and courts for permission to scrape their data. For some jurisdictions like New South Wales and Queensland, which incidentally both use the same <a href="https://www.teratext.com/products/teratext-for-legislation.asp">legislation management system</a>, this was relatively easy, and I was helpfully directed to the endpoints of their public APIs. For others, however, the process was anything but simple. There were a few that imposed restrictions on my access to and use of their data, one that simply didn’t respond to my enquiries, and a great many that outright refused my requests, often times without giving a reason. Perhaps my most memorable interaction with a data source was when I was told that I would overburden their team by requiring them to manually sift through and package documents, despite my insistence that web scraping is an automated process that requires no additional work on the part of website owners.</p>



<p>In the end, after months of back and forth, I was granted access to the laws, regulations and bills of five out of the six states, one external territory and the Commonwealth. I was also able to secure permission to scrape judgments of three courts and five tribunals, all held by the Federal Court of Australia. To date, I am still in talks with my home state, Victoria, about being able to include their data in my database.</p>



<p>Once I had permission to access the various sources’ databases, the next step was to index and download their documents. Again, for those databases with public APIs, this was a cakewalk. But, for those without public APIs, it was a toss-up whether I’d need to block out a few days to reverse-engineer some ancient technology I had never heard of before. The Federal Government’s database was exceptionally difficult to work with, not only because of how slow it was but also because it was coded in ASP.NET and so made extensive use of <a href="https://asp-blogs.azurewebsites.net/infinitiesloop/Truly-Understanding-Viewstate">ViewStates</a>, requiring me to develop a <a href="https://github.com/umarbutler/open-australian-legal-corpus-creator/blob/1e05bd0a784e4b40703e9f072d723609540beade/src/oalc_creator/scrapers/federal_register_of_legislation.py#L83-L167">complex algorithm</a> just to be able to navigate between search engine results pages. Another notable mention is the Federal Court of Australia which, although easier to index, had used at least three different text encodings for various parts of its website (search results were in Unicode and judgments were a mix of Windows-1250, Windows-1252 and some were just encoded incorrectly). With enough trial and error, however, I was eventually able to create scrapers for every database.</p>



<p>Of course, even after getting my hands on the sources’ documents, I’d still need to convert them to a standardised format. I chose plain text for my database because it was what I’d be feeding my LLM, and it would be easy to convert documents to. Or so I thought. As it turns out, converting HTML to anything that isn’t HTML is a painful process. Especially if, like me, you want to preserve spacing, indentation, line breaks and tables. I went through <em>a lot</em> of Python packages before finally landing on <code><a href="https://github.com/weblyzard/inscriptis">Inscriptis</a></code>, an absolutely essential library for anyone wanting to extract text from HTML without mangling formatting. Still, some additional finetuning was necessary to get it to work well with every data source.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, mastering HTML parsing wasn’t enough to be able to build my database. I’d also need to learn how to work with RTFs, DOCXs and PDFs.</p>



<p>RTFs were the easiest of the lot. I let the <code><a href="https://github.com/joshy/striprtf">striprtf</a></code> Python library do the heavy lifting. DOCXs were a bit more difficult. I tested <code><a href="https://github.com/JessicaTegner/pypandoc">pypandoc</a></code>, <code><a href="https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx">python-docx</a></code>, <code><a href="https://github.com/ankushshah89/python-docx2txt">docx2txt</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/ShayHill/docx2python">docx2python</a></code> and none of them beat using <code><a href="https://github.com/mwilliamson/python-mammoth">mammoth</a></code> to convert DOCXs to HTML and then extracting text from the resulting HTML with <code>Inscriptis</code>.</p>



<p>Finally, when it came to PDFs, I tried out <code><a href="https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">pypdf</a></code>, <code><a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">tesseract</a></code>, <code><a href="https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six">pdfminer.six</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber">pdfplumber</a></code>, and found that all of them had a tendency to insert line breaks where they didn’t belong. Essentially, they would interrupt whole sentences with newline characters, mimicking words wrapping around a page. Nevertheless, I found <code>pdfplumber</code> to perform the best out of all the available options, and also discovered that, for PDFs from certain sources, I could stich sentences back together by replacing newlines preceded by whitespace with just whitespace.</p>



<p>After enough experimentation with various Python libraries and post-processing techniques, I managed to convert all the documents I had collected into plain text. This resulted in a dataset of over 100k texts. I then packaged those documents together, attached metadata on their nature and origin, and publicly released my database on HuggingFace as the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/umarbutler/open-australian-legal-corpus">Open Australian Legal Corpus</a>. I also set up a <a href="https://github.com/umarbutler/open-australian-legal-corpus-creator">GitHub repository</a> to host my database creator, which I built in such a way that anyone else interested in open legal data can contribute their own scrapers to be integrated into the database.</p>



<p>As I go along, negotiating with more governments and courts, reverse engineering their ancient tech stacks, I intend to continue updating the database, expanding its sources and enriching its content. And hopefully, the next time someone wants to build an LLM for Australian law, they won’t need to go down a year-long journey of trying to find the right data.</p>

              <p>We have successfully created an independent, bit-by-bit-identical rebuild of the <code>nixos-minimal</code> ISO published by Hydra <img src="https://discourse.nixos.org/images/emoji/twitter/tada.png?v=12" title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<a name="why-is-this-useful-1" href="#why-is-this-useful-1"></a>Why is this useful?</h2>
<p>While there are a number of ‘side-benefits’, the main point of Reproducible Builds is that it gives us a reliable way to verify the binaries we ship are faithful to their sources, and have not been tampered with anywhere in the build pipeline (e.g. on Hydra).</p>
<p>For general information on Reproducible Builds see:</p>


<h2>
<a name="what-exactly-was-reproduced-2" href="#what-exactly-was-reproduced-2"></a>What exactly was reproduced?</h2>
<p>This means we now have successfully reproduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>All packages that make it into the ISO</li>
<li>The building of the ISO itself</li>
</ul>
<p>The rebuild also built the packages that were needed to build the ISO (but aren’t included in it), rather than relying on cached binaries.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--option substitute false</code> makes sure ‘everything’ is built on the machine itself, instead of fetching them from the binary cache.</p>
<h3>
<a name="arent-there-bootstrap-problems-with-the-above-approach-4" href="#arent-there-bootstrap-problems-with-the-above-approach-4"></a>Aren’t there bootstrap problems with the above approach?</h3>
<p>Well, yes: if the 2020 <code>ova</code> or the downloaded <code>git</code> contained elaborate backdoors, those might still be attack vectors. It would have been better to do the rebuild on a fully-<a href="https://bootstrappable.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">bootstrapped</a> system, but we’re not quite <em>there</em> yet - see <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixpkgs-supply-chain-security-project/34345">this thread</a> for exciting progress in this area. Still, this test gives a high confidence in the reproducibility of the ISO.</p>
<h2>
<a name="werent-we-here-before-5" href="#werent-we-here-before-5"></a>Weren’t we here before?</h2>
<p>You may remember <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-unstable-s-iso-minimal-x86-64-linux-is-100-reproducible/13723">2021 announcement</a> that the minimal ISO was 100% reproducible. While back then we successfully tested that all packages were needed to build the ISO were <em>individually</em> reproducible, <em>actually</em> rebuilding the ISO still introduced differences. This was due to <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/125380">some remaining problems</a> in the hydra cache and the way the ISO was created. By the time we fixed those, regressions had popped up (notably an upstream problem in Python 3.10), and it isn’t until this week that we were back to having everything reproducible and being able to validate the complete chain.</p>
<h2>
<a name="where-to-from-now-6" href="#where-to-from-now-6"></a>Where to from now?</h2>
<p>Successfully rebuilding the minimal ISO once is an extremely satisfying milestone - but a somewhat arbitrary one. There is a lot more to do to reap the benefits of reproducibility, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the hacks above (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/263730">nixpkgs#263730</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/9251">nix#9251</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/263898">nixpkgs#263898</a>)</li>
<li>Making more packages reproducible. Reproducing the <a href="https://nixos.org/download#download-nixos">other installation media</a> such as the Gnome ISO seem like nice next milestones</li>
<li>Setting up infrastructure so that we can regularly independently rebuild these artifacts</li>
<li>Create tools to share and consume build attestations, such as <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/trustix">trustix</a>
</li>

This is done by running the Linux kernel on a RISC-V (rv32ima) emulator I wrote in Scratch, based off of Cnlohr’s mini-rv32ima emulator.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://experiments.turbowarp.org/next/892602496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turbowarp</a> for results that are actually usable.</p>
<p>To start the emulator (should be run in turbowarp), simply just press the green flag and load your ROM (or don’t to use the Linux kernel) then click the run button and wait for it to boot (takes around 40 seconds on my laptop). The Linux build comes with the usual programs like cat/echo and is fully capable of running shell scripts, but it also comes with a duktape (a JavaScript engine), as well as ed for text editing, and coremark for benchmarking</p>
<p>To use duktape, run “duktape {FILE_NAME}”. For testing, there is already a file called “fizzbuzz.js” that can be run In order to write to files you must use the “ed” text editor, for more information on ed and how to use it look <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.3.0?topic=files-using-ed-editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

However, there is another Ken Burns effect that is far more important. For 40-odd years Mr Burns has focused America’s attention on some of its most difficult chapters.</p><p data-component="paragraph">His breakout series, “The Civil War” (1990), was watched by nearly 40m viewers on public television, then a record; visits to battlefields more than doubled the next year, says Mr Burns. A bump in visitors&nbsp;also followed “The National Parks” series in 2009. Mr Burns’s subjects include biographies of <a href="https://www.economist.com/prospero/2021/04/07/ernest-hemingway-the-man-the-myth-the-legend">Ernest Hemingway</a> and Thomas Jefferson, as well as histories of baseball, jazz, slavery and the <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/09/15/a-powerful-new-documentary-series-on-the-vietnam-war">Vietnam war</a>. His aim, he says, is to tell the unsanitised story of his country.</p><p data-component="paragraph">His latest, “The American Buffalo”, takes on a double tragedy:  the wanton slaughter of buffaloes living in the Great Plains during the late 19th century and the parallel near-extinction of the Native American tribes that <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/humans-have-altered-other-species-as-well-as-the-environment/21805519">evolved alongside</a> these shaggy beasts for 10,000 years. Steeped in Native American perspectives, it is a tale of destruction and partial recovery unfamiliar to most Americans.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The Cheyenne had 27 words for the animal, which a Spanish conquistador in the 16th century described as numberless as the fish in the sea. The buffalo sustained Native Americans, who used every piece. “We are brothers, we are related,” M. Scott Momaday, a Kiowa poet, says in the film. “We have regard for each other.”</p><p data-component="paragraph">That regard was trampled by the voracious appetite of an <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/12/05/dreams-of-el-dorado-is-a-rollicking-flawed-history-of-america">expanding United States</a>. Between 1805, when Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first traversed the continent,<b> </b>and the 1860s, the buffalo’s numbers fell from probably 30m-60m to fewer than 15m. Then, over the next decade, they were almost wiped out. Sharpshooters arrived on the new railroads, seeking hides for leather belts in industrial machines. Buffaloes were “like walking gold pieces”, exclaimed one of those hunters.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Years later, Theodore Roosevelt wrote that “the extermination of the buffalo was the only way of solving the Indian question.” Though never an explicit policy, historians agree that army and political leaders tacitly approved of exterminating buffaloes in order to force Native Americans to move to reservations. A quarter of the Blackfeet tribe starved; it was “a death wind for my people”, said Chief Sitting Bull of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/10/31/the-forgotten-empire-of-the-lakota">Lakota Sioux</a>. </p><p data-component="paragraph">In its more uplifting second half, the film looks at efforts to save the buffalo from extinction: by tribal people, conservationists, white supremacists and former hunters haunted by regret. At a time when American history is often contested, Mr Burns says documentaries such as this one have “the possibility of reminding people how complex and contradictory our story is”.<span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>For more on the latest books, films, <small>TV </small>shows, albums and controversies,&nbsp;sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/introducing-plot-twist-our-new-culture-newsletter" target="_blank">Plot Twist</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter</i></p></div><p>This article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition under the headline "(Back) home on the range"</p><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/">Culture</a> <span>October 28th 2023</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/26/one-of-berlins-star-attractions-is-closing-for-14-years"><span>One of Berlin’s star attractions is closing for 14 years</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/23/how-superstars-and-heritage-acts-hijacked-the-vinyl-revival"><span>How superstars and heritage acts hijacked the vinyl revival</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/26/cia-plots-coups-and-a-gold-capped-molar-in-congo"><span>CIA plots, coups and a gold-capped molar in Congo</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/25/ken-burns-chronicles-the-sad-fate-of-the-american-buffalo"><span>Ken Burns chronicles the sad fate of the American buffalo</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/26/drug-lords-tombs-are-monuments-to-opulence"><span>Drug lords’ tombs are monuments to opulence</span></a></li></ul></div><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="America’s test" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1684" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/16/21/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/32/42/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/48/63/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/64/84/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/96/126/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/128/168/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/256/336/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/360/473/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/384/505/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/480/631/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/789/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/834/1097/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/960/1263/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1096/1441/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg"></figure></div><div orientation="vertical"><h3 orientation="vertical">From the October 28th 2023 edition</h3><p orientation="vertical">Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents </p><a href="https://www.economist.com/printedition/2023-10-28" data-analytics="sidebar:weekly_edition"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M12 1c6.075 0 11 4.925 11 11s-4.925 11-11 11S1 18.075 1 12 5.925 1 12 1zm.142 4.5l-1.008 1.062c3.33 3.276 4.194 4.14 4.608 4.5-1.602-.018-3.168-.018-10.242-.018v1.584c7.074 0 8.73 0 10.242-.018-.432.36-1.314 1.206-4.608 4.536l1.008 1.044 6.354-6.354L12.142 5.5z" fill="#2E45B8" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></g></svg><span>Explore the edition</span></a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

Besides the pleasure of the din, it is also useful to ecologists. If you want to measure the biodiversity of a piece of land, listening out for animal calls is mucher than grubbing about in the undergrowth looking for tracks or spoor. But such “bioacoustic analysis” is still time-consuming, and it requires an expert pair of ears.</p><p data-component="paragraph">In a paper published on October 17th in <i>Nature Communications</i>, a group of researchers led by Jörg Müller, an ecologist at the University of Würzburg, describe a better way: have a computer do the job. Smartphone apps already exist that will identify birds, bats or mammals simply by listening to the sounds they make. Their idea was to apply the principle to conservation work.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The researchers took recordings from across 43 sites in the Ecuadorean rainforest. Some sites were relatively pristine, old-growth forest. Others were areas that had recently been cleared for pasture or cacao planting. And some had been cleared but then abandoned, allowing the forest to regrow.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Sound recordings were taken four times every hour, over two weeks. The various calls were identified manually by an expert, and then used to construct a list of the species present. As expected, the longer the land had been free from agricultural activity, the greater the biodiversity it hosted.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Then it was the computer’s turn. The researchers fed their recordings to artificial-intelligence models that had been trained, using sound samples from elsewhere in Ecuador, to identify 75 bird species from their calls. “We found that the <small>AI</small> tools could identify the sounds as well as the experts,” says Dr Müller.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Of course, not everything in a rainforest makes a noise. Dr Müller and his colleagues used light-traps to capture night-flying insects, and <small>DNA</small> analysis to identify them. Reassuringly, they found that the diversity of noisy animals was a reliable proxy for the diversity of the quieter ones, too.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The results may have relevance outside ecology departments, too. Under pressure from their customers, firms such as L’Oreal, a make-up company, and Shell, an oil firm, have been spending money on forest restoration projects around the world. Dr Müller hopes that an automated approach to checking on the results could help monitor such efforts, and give a standardised way to measure whether they are working as well as their sponsors say.<span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>Curious about the world?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A mental model for service businesses.</p><div>
<p>A few years back, my team decided to get a custom meeting room table. In our search for something great, we were referred to a small studio that does great work: East Vancouver’s <a href="https://www.unionwoodco.com/">Union Wood Co</a>.</p>

<p>The team there met with us, showed us various samples, and asked thoughtful questions about what we needed.  When I asked if a table could be made to a custom shape – a superelliptical rectangle – they were all for it <em>and</em> totally <a href="https://twitter.com/steamclocksw/status/1202383942248095744">pulled it off</a>.</p>

<p>Afterward, sitting at this delightful table, I reflected on why it came together so well. Getting something custom-built can often be the path of frustration and expensive surprises, yet our experience was a delight. Was it because the furniture makers were experts? No. Was it because they charged a lot of money? No.</p>

<p>It was because they gave a shit.</p>

<p>In some ways, that’s the fundamental value proposition of a small boutique, whether it be a furniture shop or a software studio. Giving a shit as a service. Sure, you can always get a commodity good from off the shelf – when you’re selling soybean oil by the 100-ton lot, nobody wants to have a conversation with you about the subtle flavour profiles of different bean oils. But sometimes, you want to buy from someone that’s obsessed about the final product.</p>

<p>I used to puzzle over why potential clients who reached out to me always seemed to get <em>more</em> interested in hiring us if I tried to dissuade them by asking challenging questions. I think the biggest reason is that pushing back demonstrated that I care. If you email 4 software studios for a quote and 3 say “Sure, here’s a quote” but the 4th says “Hm, we certainly could build it but we can’t be sure about cost without knowing X and Y, and here are some other concerns we’d have” then the 4th is going to seem like they give a shit.</p>

<p>So, I suppose the moral of the story is: find yourself work you can give a shit about. And work with people who give a shit. It’ll make shit a lot more pleasant – I guarantee it.</p>

Instead a function called </span><span>dnc_copyin</span><span> is called, which does proper bounds checks.</span></p><p><span>So someone (at Nintendo?) fixed this several years before INFRA:HALT was discovered and disclosed? <b>Well, they tried!</b></span></p><p><span>As we can see from the full code above there are two places where </span><span>dnc_set_answer</span><span> is called. The first one for answer records and the second one for additional records pointing to the first answer.<b> But they only added the check for the first one?!</b></span></p><p><span>The second one still blindly calls </span><span>dnc_set_answer</span><span> without doing any size checks.</span></p><h3><span>Exploiting it on the Wii U <br></span></h3><p><span>After writing a quick PoC server to confirm this actually works on a Wii U, I decided to try and exploit this.</span></p><p><span>Since the </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct is stored on the heap, this is a basic heap overflow.&nbsp;</span><span>The Wii U added a few additional fields to the </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct, which we can overwrite.</span><span> Due to the NET stack running on the ARM co-processor, the Wii U later copies this entire struct back to the PPC side using an address stored in a reply struct. </span><span>Unfortunately to overwrite the pointer to this reply struct, we would need to spoof a reply struct and point to it. Since the heap layout is determined by various network setup specific factors we have no idea where in the heap this </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct is allocated. So we need a way to store a buffer at a location in memory which we know the address </span><span>of</span><span>.<br></span></p><h3>Introducing DNS over TCP</h3><div><p>This doesn't seem to be part of NicheStack, but the Wii U features support for DNS over TCP instead of UDP. After two attempts of using UDP, the Wii U will switch to TCP if the truncated flag was set in the DNS header. For TCP support more fields were added to the <span>dns_querys</span><span> struct, one of them is a pointer to a buffer in which the received TCP data is stored.</span></p><p><span>So just overwrite this with an address in the stack and we can receive data into the stack? Unfortunately, no. Before storing data into this buffer it is resized using </span><span>IOS_HeapRealloc</span><span> (basically </span><span>realloc</span><span>), if it isn't </span><span>NULL</span><span>. If the heap block is already the same size as the reallocated size, the same pointer is returned though. This allows us to take over already allocated blocks inside of the heap but limits us to stay in bounds of the heap. If we point the receive buffer to one of the already allocated packet buffers at the start of the heap, which will always have the same address, we can receive data into a known memory location (limited by the MTU and TCP/IP fragmentation).<br></span></p><p><span>Remember the reply struct which is pointed to by the </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct? We now have a known memory location at which we can create a fake reply struct which points the reply buffer to anywhere in IOS-NET memory. <b>This causes the entire </b></span><b><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct to be copied to anywhere we want and we can control&nbsp;</span><span><span data-dobid="hdw">approximately</span></span><span> 256 bytes in this struct!</span></b></p><p><b><span><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiJfhtSiAcGNa460z1cpWG2IVuW4uba0uWts652-RjxWX8nlmfsllfA36Efexv1OnpkvO4_v4zhJWJuX4gDoa0dQx447i2slzQWysIeEKHjPAg9xhFRCpaeYXfiPXFnGpKkIT947XHDk5Xigf4FEN6Pt126tQtu7rGRBdBJVQgimBI92b3O6-EgVMCABRY"><img alt="" data-original-height="186" data-original-width="1082" height="110" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiJfhtSiAcGNa460z1cpWG2IVuW4uba0uWts652-RjxWX8nlmfsllfA36Efexv1OnpkvO4_v4zhJWJuX4gDoa0dQx447i2slzQWysIeEKHjPAg9xhFRCpaeYXfiPXFnGpKkIT947XHDk5Xigf4FEN6Pt126tQtu7rGRBdBJVQgimBI92b3O6-EgVMCABRY=w640-h110" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td><span>Memory layout showing </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> copying.</span><br></td></tr></tbody></table></span></b></p><h3><span>Creating a ROP Chain</span><b><span> <br></span></b></h3><p><span>Since the Wii U features no-execute on the ARM side, we need to write a ROP chain which performs a kernel exploit.

<p>Recently a shoe store in France ran a promotion called “Rob It to Get It”, which invited customers to try to steal something by grabbing it and running out of the store. But there was a catch — the “security guard” was a professional sprinter, Méba Mickael Zeze. As you would expect, he is fast, but you might not appreciate how much faster he is than an average runner, or even a good runner.</p>



<p>Why? That’s the topic of Chapter 4 of <em><a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/probably-overthinking-it/">Probably Overthinking It</a></em>, which is <a href="https://amzn.to/3Kp629E">available for preorder now</a>. Here’s an excerpt.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Running Speeds</h2>



<p>If you are a fan of the Atlanta Braves, a Major League Baseball team, or if you watch enough videos on the internet, you have probably seen one of the most popular forms of between-inning entertainment: a foot race between one of the fans and a spandex-suit-wearing mascot called the Freeze.</p>



<p>The route of the race is the dirt track that runs across the outfield, a distance of about 160 meters, which the Freeze runs in less than 20 seconds. To keep things interesting, the fan gets a head start of about 5 seconds. That might not seem like a lot, but if you watch one of these races, this lead seems insurmountable. However, when the Freeze starts running, you immediately see the difference between a pretty good runner and a very good runner. With few exceptions, the Freeze runs down the fan, overtakes them, and coasts to the finish line with seconds to spare.</p>



<p>Here are some examples:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxXypNqiS5A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>But as fast as he is, the Freeze is not even a professional runner; he is a member of the Braves’ ground crew named Nigel Talton. In college, he ran 200 meters in 21.66 seconds, which is very good. But the 200 meter collegiate record is 20.1 seconds, set by Wallace Spearmon in 2005, and the current world record is 19.19 seconds, set by Usain Bolt in 2009.</p>



<p>To put all that in perspective, let’s start with me. For a middle-aged man, I am a decent runner. When I was 42 years old, I ran my best-ever 10 kilometer race in 42:44, which was faster than 94% of the other runners who showed up for a local 10K. Around that time, I could run 200 meters in about 30 seconds (with wind assistance).</p>



<p>But a good high school runner is faster than me. At a recent meet, the fastest girl at a nearby high school ran 200 meters in about 27 seconds, and the fastest boy ran under 24 seconds.</p>



<p>So, in terms of speed, a fast high school girl is 11% faster than me, a fast high school boy is 12% faster than her; Nigel Talton, in his prime, was 11% faster than him, Wallace Spearmon was about 8% faster than Talton, and Usain Bolt is about 5% faster than Spearmon.</p>



<p>Unless you are Usain Bolt, there is always someone faster than you, and not just a little bit faster; they are much faster. The reason is that the distribution of running speed is not Gaussian — It is more like lognormal.</p>



<p>To demonstrate, I’ll use data from the James Joyce Ramble, which is the 10 kilometer race where I ran my previously-mentioned personal record time. I downloaded the times for the 1,592 finishers and converted them to speeds in kilometers per hour. The following figure shows the distribution of these speeds on a logarithmic scale, along with a Gaussian model I fit to the data.</p>

<p>The logarithms follow a Gaussian distribution, which means the speeds themselves are lognormal. You might wonder why. Well, I have a theory, based on the following assumptions:</p>



<ul>
<li>First, everyone has a maximum speed they are capable of running, assuming that they train effectively.</li>



<li>Second, these speed limits can depend on many factors, including height and weight, fast- and slow-twitch muscle mass, cardiovascular conditioning, flexibility and elasticity, and probably more.</li>



<li>Finally, the way these factors interact tends to be multiplicative; that is, each person’s speed limit depends on the product of multiple factors.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s why I think speed depends on a product rather than a sum of factors. If all of your factors are good, you are fast; if any of them are bad, you are slow. Mathematically, the operation that has this property is multiplication.</p>



<p>For example, suppose there are only two factors, measured on a scale from 0 to 1, and each person’s speed limit is determined by their product. Let’s consider three hypothetical people:</p>



<ul>
<li>The first person scores high on both factors, let’s say 0.9. The product of these factors is 0.81, so they would be fast.</li>



<li>The second person scores relatively low on both factors, let’s say 0.3. The product is 0.09, so they would be quite slow.</li>
</ul>



<p>So far, this is not surprising: if you are good in every way, you are fast; if you are bad in every way, you are slow. But what if you are good in some ways and bad in others?</p>



<ul>
<li>The third person scores 0.9 on one factor and 0.3 on the other. The product is 0.27, so they are a little bit faster than someone who scores low on both factors, but much slower than someone who scores high on both.</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s a property of multiplication: the product depends most strongly on the smallest factor. And as the number of factors increases, the effect becomes more dramatic.</p>



<p>To simulate this mechanism, I generated five random factors from a Gaussian distribution and multiplied them together. I adjusted the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussians so that the resulting distribution fit the data; the following figure shows the results.</p>



<figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" width="960" height="720" src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2.png 960w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-300x225.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-768x576.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-360x270.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2.png 960w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-300x225.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-768x576.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-360x270.png 360w" data-lazy-src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>The simulation results fit the data well. So this example demonstrates a second mechanism [the first is described earlier in the chapter] that can produce lognormal distributions: the limiting power of the weakest link. If there are at least five factors affect running speed, and each person’s limit depends on their worst factor, that would explain why the distribution of running speed is lognormal.</p>



<p>And that’s why you can’t beat the Freeze.</p>

He recently split from a long-term partner and even what he describes as a sense of forboding, “that I’m fated to end up alone”, was not enough to drive him back to dating apps. The spam, bots and fake accounts are tough enough to contend with, he says, and that’s before all the issues with being assessed for attractiveness based on six pictures and a few lines of text.</p><p>“It does not matter how handsome or beautiful or charming you are, there is this underlying tension that you are 10 swipes away from a person that outranks you on the conventional beauty and charisma scale. It’s enough to make you feel all the insecurities that you haven’t needed to swallow since you were a teenager and a whole ream of new adult ones,” he says.</p><p>But with the apps being so embedded in the culture of modern dating, where else can single people turn to meet the love of their life, or even have a quick fling?</p><hr><p><span>N</span>ottinghamshire pharmacist Kevin Inglesant is one of many people who have struggled to make connections online. He has tried Bumble, Match, Badoo and Facebook dating, but in nearly three years has only met one person, with whom he had six dates before the relationship ended.</p><p>“The vast majority of matches have resulted in no dialogue,” says the 38-year-old. “With most of the rest there was a bit of to and fro before being ghosted. It’s quite soul-destroying.”</p><p>The new rules of dating mean approaching strangers in public is more frowned upon than it was previously, though he has found a potentially promising solution. “I came across an ad for the <a href="https://pearring.co/" data-link-name="in body link">Pear ring</a> on Facebook,” he says, referring to a pale green silicone ring that can be worn on any finger as a sign that the wearer is happy to be approached, in what its makers describe as “the world’s biggest single social experiment”.</p><p>“It was about £20, and honestly I haven’t seen anyone else wearing one and the only people who have asked me about it were people who already know me, know that I don’t generally wear jewellery and were curious. I think I need to wear it more in situations where I’ll be meeting new people before I can make a judgment as to how effective this technique is – and wait for the idea to become more widely known as well.”</p><p>Putting a new spin on an old-fashioned approach also appeals to Katy, a 37-year-old who lives in London, works for a charity, and says the apps had made her forget how to flirt. “So I’ve given myself the challenge of flirting with one person every day, which has been a lot of fun,” she says. “It’s made me realise that so many people are wrapped up in their phones, and aren’t aware of people around them, which is quite sad. I’ve had some fun interactions, and while it hasn’t brought me any dates – yet – that’s not the goal. I’m in absolutely no hurry to bring dating apps back into my life.”</p><p>Many say the apps feel like work and there is a genuine sense of burnout as people struggle to commit to what is essentially hours of admin a week alongside their day jobs and other responsibilities. And even those who have their pick of matches have found themselves having an unenjoyable experience.</p><p>“I was getting a torrent of likes – and I absolutely hated it,” says Sophie, 33, a London-based writer who used Hinge for more than a year before ditching it. “I’d try not to be too picky based on superficial qualities because I’m simply looking for an interesting or creative person, and that’s one thing you can’t spot easily on an app, but then I’d get too many matches, which was really overwhelming. I’d end up ghosting them all, which I felt really guilty about.”</p><figure id="a0bc039f-c470-4851-a10c-f2733307ace6" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="An illustration of hearts" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div></figure><p>She has tried Tinder (“even worse”) and at one point attempted to join <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raya/id957215308" data-link-name="in body link">Raya</a>, which markets itself as a “private community” of “exciting people”, though it is better known as the celebrity dating app. It is where Lily Allen met her husband, the Stranger Things actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/03/david-harbour-marvel-black-widow-stranger-things-jim-hopper" data-link-name="in body link">David Harbour</a>. Ben Affleck and Matthew Perry have also been Raya users.</p><p>“I tried to join that app because I wanted something more exclusive, but it was too exclusive to let me in,” she laughs. “After that I just gave up. I’d been clinging for so long to stories of friends who met their significant others on an app and I just had to let it go.”</p><p>After a “very humbling year” expecting to meet someone organically, she is now taking a bolder approach. “I started asking friends and acquaintances if there’s anyone they can set me up with.</p><p>When being single comes up in conversation, you naturally want to say, ‘It’s cool, I’m enjoying my independence, I’m sure I’ll meet someone soon,’ and it can be excruciating to say, ‘Actually I’m really unhappy and I’m desperately trying to meet someone’ – but I’ve learned that’s kind of the best thing to do.</p><p>“You really have to set some standards – people can be so keen to help that they tend to overestimate how good-looking or interesting their mates are, or they try to suggest the only single person they know, no matter how unsuitable – but it has worked quite well. It’s so easy to get an idea of whether you’ll click. I’ve had dates with two people through mutual friends so far, both musicians weirdly, and one of them has some potential.”</p><p>In a similar way, family might fill that role for Jeevan, a 30-year-old IT worker, who says his Indian parents had offered to set him up when he was younger. He had always declined, but is now reconsidering. “It’s not something I wanted to do before, but now I’m finding time has caught up with me a bit and I’m in a position where I do want to meet a partner. I think I’m going to keep trying for a couple more years, and if that doesn’t work, I will ask them.”</p><p>The benefit of meeting someone vouched for is also driving Clare, 38, from Bath, to explore her options, after having signed up to numerous dating apps over the years, only to quit after a few months each time. She always felt uneasy about meeting a person who is completely unknown, beyond a first name and age, which are not always genuine. She says: “It’s a bad platform for people with trust issues like myself as I don’t like meeting total strangers. You are meeting outside of any community accountability – so people are also generally a bit shitter in their ethics.</p><p>“There’s also the issue of selection,” she adds. “I connect with people strongly in real life I’d never have selected on a dating app. Either they would be too young, too hot, or unattractive on an app. People are so much more magic in real life.”</p><figure id="1b48a1c7-ecf8-434e-84ba-f14cff32a687" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A man and a woman looking at each other enthusiastically" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="414.98946259220236" loading="lazy"></picture></div></figure><p>She has done slow dating at Shambala festival, with an emphasis on doing exercises that could help to make emotional connections, including questions like, “What are you most proud of in your life?” and “What’s the biggest challenge you’ve overcome?”</p><p>However, her favourite thing was a workshop called The Art of Flirting: “Essentially a workshop full of (mostly) single people having their confidence built up collectively through playful exercises with a fair amount of emotional risk. For example, we had to walk in our most confident, flirtatious manner towards people and note how we felt about it. The big takeaway was how essential risk, self-confidence and not taking it too seriously were – maybe more like dating skills.”</p><p>She is keen to try more. “My friend mentioned events she went to in London that involved bringing your single friend to take the pressure off.” These events, such as Conscious Dating’s <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/conscious-dating-bring-a-friend-movie-meal-drinks-chat-social-mixer-tickets-704699584427" data-link-name="in body link">Bring-a-Friend nights</a>, usually involve bringing another single person of a different gender to ensure the room has an even split, but there are lots of variations.</p><p>Clare is not alone – the demand for more face-to-face interactions is increasing. Figures from Eventbrite shared with the Guardian show the number of dating or singles events in the UK has doubled since before the start of the pandemic. The event management company attributes this rise to both people wanting more physical connection after lockdown and the growing fatigue with dating apps.</p><p>Some events now focus on precise groups, such as black lesbians or divorced Muslim professionals, while others offer a twist, including speed-dating events that revolve around being naked, playing Jenga while drunk, playing video games or bringing your dogs.</p><p>Some people prefer something more simple, with fewer expectations. Stef began using the app Meetup, normally used to meet people in a friendly setting usually around a passion or interest, when she first moved to Paris. She has been hit on a few times at meet-ups, “which has been so nice honestly”.</p><p>“You have the opportunity to meet heaps of other cute, single people in real life with no stuffy or awkward first-date vibes because if you don’t click with someone, you can just excuse yourself and chat with someone else,” she says. “I sometimes think they must be what 1970s mixers were like. Just lots of fun chats with new people and wine – perfect. I haven’t met the love of my life yet, but I feel like I’m very close.”</p><hr><p><span>B</span>ut, for a lot of single people, the problems with the apps run deeper than being time-consuming and fruitless. Political journalist and writer Lucy Webster describes how she faced harassment and unpleasant comments about her disability when using dating apps.</p><p>“I’d get a lot of comments about being a wheelchair user, most of which were of the ‘Can you have sex?’ variety. I would just block them instantly, because what’s the point?” says Webster.</p><p>She describes how the superficiality of apps encourages ableism, because there are no consequences to unkind or abusive behaviour. “They’re not doing it in public and they’re not going to get banned for saying they don’t want to date a wheelchair user. It just encourages this awful, unacceptable behaviour,” she says. “Eventually I just thought, ‘What the hell am I doing?’”</p><figure id="40bab240-a68c-4d64-9d15-7f1c2d6ebc83" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:41,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/31/a-friend-said-it-gave-them-hope-four-ways-to-find-love-without-the-apps&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘A friend said it gave them hope’: four ways to find love – without the apps&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;40bab240-a68c-4d64-9d15-7f1c2d6ebc83&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:4,&quot;design&quot;:10}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>But her options outside the apps have been limited, too. Webster went viral in 2021 when she was left in tears after being told by a personal matchmaking service to reconsider joining as people may refuse dates with someone who uses a wheelchair. This meant, that in their words, “achieving good outcomes for full‑time wheelchair user clients can be quite challenging”. She says: “I renounced the whole thing and very quickly found my mental health was much better. I haven’t thought about getting back on a dating app or dating since, and I’m not really miserable any more.”</p><p>Many readers got in touch with the Guardian with similar stories about finding contentment away from the pressures of trying to date.</p><p>Erica Smart from Banbury gave up dating apps a year ago after spending a decade using them. “I have never regretted this, despite knowing that various friends have met their spouses and long-term partners through them – something that I would still dearly love to have. However, I am at peace with the idea that I may never meet someone. If it happens, great. But if not, I’m also content with that. Having a partner can bring happiness, but also stress,” says the 42-year-old.</p><p>In fact, there is a surprising sense of optimism among those who have said goodbye to the apps. For Emma Chappell, 42, doing enjoyable, fulfilling activities may lead to a date, even though her choir sessions and nature walks have yet to yield any opportunities. “At least joining things and learning a new skill or having a fun night out is more worthwhile. And you have that thought of, ‘You never know.’” She adds: “Life is for living, after all, not sitting behind a screen waiting for life to start.”</p></div></div>]]></description>
