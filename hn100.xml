<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-3">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>The Indian government's Information Technology ministry issued an order to block ProtonMail in the region.</li><li>The move comes after a bomb threat was sent to schools in Chennai via a ProtonMail account.</li><li>ProtonMail is still active in the country as of writing, but it remains to be seen if that will continue to be the case.</li></ul><hr><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-privacy-apps-android" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-privacy-apps-android">ProtonMail</a> is the best choice if you want an end-to-end encrypted email platform, and the nature of the service means it is inevitably used by bad actors. On February 8, a bomb threat was sent to 13 schools in Chennai, a city in the state of Tamil Nadu in southern India. The threat turned out to be a hoax, and the Tamil Nadu police found that the email was sent via a ProtonMail account.</p><p>Unable to trace the IP address of the sender and failing to get assistance from Interpol, the Tamil Nadu police put in a request to India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to block access to ProtonMail within the country, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-looks-to-block-proton-mail-on-request-of-tamil-nadu-police-101707938167006.html" data-url="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-looks-to-block-proton-mail-on-request-of-tamil-nadu-police-101707938167006.html">according to </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-looks-to-block-proton-mail-on-request-of-tamil-nadu-police-101707938167006.html" data-url="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-looks-to-block-proton-mail-on-request-of-tamil-nadu-police-101707938167006.html">Hindustan Times</a>. That request was granted today, with the government authority issuing an order to block the service in the region.</p><p>The enforcement will be carried out by the Department of Telecommunications, which will likely entail delisting ProtonMail from the App Store and Play Store. That said, the website is still working as of writing, and the app is listed on both storefronts. This isn't the first instance where the Indian government went after the Swiss-based Proton AG. Proton VPN <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.getproton.me/aff_c?offer_id=25&amp;aff_id=1046&amp;source=ac&amp;aff_click_id=ac-us-7827349702094175000&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fservers-india%2F%3FvisitorId%3Dho-%7Btransaction_id%7D%26aid%3D%7Baffiliate_id%7D%26offer_id%3D%7Boffer_id%7D%26url_id%3D%7Boffer_url_id%7D%26utm_campaign%3Dww-all-2a-vpn-gro_aff-g_acq-partners_program%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_source%3Daid-tune-%7Baffiliate_id%7D%26utm_content%3D%7Boffer_id%7D%26hfp%3Dfalse%26spl%3D%7Baffiliate_id%7D&amp;aff_sub2=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fapps-software%2Findian-government-moves-to-ban-protonmail-after-bomb-threat" data-url="https://protonvpn.com/blog/servers-india/" target="_blank" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.getproton.me/aff_c?offer_id=25&amp;aff_id=1046&amp;source=ac&amp;aff_click_id=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fservers-india%2F%3FvisitorId%3Dho-%7Btransaction_id%7D%26aid%3D%7Baffiliate_id%7D%26offer_id%3D%7Boffer_id%7D%26url_id%3D%7Boffer_url_id%7D%26utm_campaign%3Dww-all-2a-vpn-gro_aff-g_acq-partners_program%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_source%3Daid-tune-%7Baffiliate_id%7D%26utm_content%3D%7Boffer_id%7D%26hfp%3Dfalse%26spl%3D%7Baffiliate_id%7D&amp;aff_sub2=hawk-article-url" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="protonvpn.com" data-merchant-id="208252" data-merchant-url="protonvpn.com" data-merchant-network="HasOffers">pulled its servers out of the country</a> following a controversial 2022 ruling by the Indian government mandating providers to maintain usage logs.</p><p>As for the ProtonMail ban, Proton AG sent a statement to Hindustan Times that it was working with the government over the issue. "We are currently working to resolve this situation and are investigating how we can best work together with the Indian authorities to do so. We understand the urgency of the situation and are completely clear that our services are not to be used for illegal purposes. We routinely remove users who are found to be doing so and are willing to cooperate wherever possible within international cooperation agreements."</p><p>The government's move is in line with a recent policy that has targeted services with end-to-end encryption. A host of encrypted apps were blocked at the start of last year — including the likes of Threema, Element, Wickrme, and Safeswiss — and the government is going after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/technology/gadgets/govt-may-enforce-it-rules-on-whatsapp-to-reveal-id-of-fake-video-spreader-2728346" data-url="https://www.deccanherald.com/technology/gadgets/govt-may-enforce-it-rules-on-whatsapp-to-reveal-id-of-fake-video-spreader-2728346">WhatsApp to disable end-to-end encryption</a>, although it isn't clear how that would even work.</p><p>Proton AG clearly agrees with that sentiment, as it said this to HT: "We condemn a potential block as a misguided measure that only serves to harm ordinary people. Blocking access to Proton is an ineffective and inappropriate response to the reported threats. It will not prevent cybercriminals from sending threats with another email service and will not be effective if the perpetrators are located outside of India."</p><p>I'll share an update once there are more details, but if you use ProtonMail in India, there's a good chance that the service may be inaccessible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Last Thursday, I woke up to a pile of emails that I was, in truth, half expecting. They were all worded a bit differently and came from different senders but the message was the same:</p><blockquote><p>Today, Okta made the decision to eliminate a number of positions across multiple organizations.&nbsp;<strong>Unfortunately, your position has been eliminated as part of this reduction.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Things had been a little strange at work since the end of last year: unclear priorities for our group, an awkward reorganization, rumblings that <em>something</em> was going on. All of that contributed to a surge of professional anxiety and a sudden urge to make sure I had all my digital affairs in order.</p><p>And then it happened, I got the email. Slack didn't work. My laptop restarted and came back with accounts missing. It really, actually happened. And even though the writing seemed to be on the wall, I was still caught a bit off guard. What about that high-priority project I was helping to lead? What about the training I was scheduled to deliver? What about the offsite next month?</p><p>I wasn't totally sure what to do with myself so I tried to follow the instructions that were sent to me to log into the minimal number of apps I still had access to for the rest of the day. I found a few groups of former (or were they still current?) teammates collecting on Google Chat, Slack groups, and LinkedIn, everyone exchanging personal contact information and messages of support. I walked the dog and said "I can't believe it actually happened" to my wife several times.</p><p>By the end of the day, my phone was at record levels of screen time logged and I was exhausted from doing what probably looked like next to nothing but I felt ... OK. I had spent all day reading and responding to deluge of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshcanhelp_i-joined-the-layoff-club-this-morning-after-activity-7158890419303444480-ueBL">support, kind words, and offers to help on LinkedIn</a> and was told that the severance offered would give me at least a few months free from acute financial stress. I already made plans to see some former teammates, friends, and family in the next week. Things were going to be just fine.</p><p>I don't think there's any reason for me to dwell on the how and why these layoffs happened. There were reasons, some I was told and some I can guess. What I want to remember as I move on from the last 6 years was how it all started, what Auth0 meant to me, and why I will proudly wear that shield for as long as the hats, shirts, and socks hold up.</p><img src="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/_images/2024/auth0_swag.jpg" alt="Auth0 swag"><figcaption><em><p>I'm sure I'm missing something ...</p></em></figcaption><p>My journey with Auth0 started in January of 2018 working on SDKs, open source libraries that customers use to make integrating their applications with Auth0, hopefully, a bit easier. I was sent the job listing by a fellow preschool dad who thought I would be a good fit. The company culture sounded good (but who can trust that stuff), working in open source sounded fun (but maybe it's just a slog of support requests), and the security/authentication space felt like the challenge I was looking for (but could I hack it). I applied, made it through the interview and take-home project, and got an offer. I accepted and started my first W2 job in 4 years.</p><p>The SDKs team was scrappy, totally overloaded, and somewhat of an island in Auth0 engineering. We were mostly left to our own devices to manage somewhere around <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/libraries">60 open source libraries</a> with only 4 engineers. I scrambled to learn about OpenID Connect and OAuth 2 while figuring out what, exactly, the WordPress setup wizard was doing. I learned Laravel for the 3rd time, tried to dig back up what I remembered about Drupal, and squinted my eyes at Symphony code over and over. I dove into Ruby because I had gone through a tutorial a few years ago and remembered liking it. All the while I was being exposed to engineering concepts that just weren't a thing in agency work: <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/wordpress-unit-testing-techniques/">unit testing</a>, CI/CD, git hygiene, release management.</p><p><a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/pitfalls-of-being-a-wordpress-developer/">I wrote a post that year</a> that would have been confusing to me the year before. The amount of things I learned during my time there is hard to wrap my head around, even having been through it myself. I was surrounded by smart, talented people in a safe, growth-minded workplace. There was chaos and uncertainty but everywhere you looked there were people doing the best work of their career trying to get this cool thing off the ground.</p><p>That "Auth0 feeling" was made tangible on the first offsite I went to in Panama City. Everyone around me told me that it would be amazing and I would have a great time. I was, to be honest, a bit skeptical. I'm not typically a company kool-aid drinker and I was expecting a lot of eye roll moments. I was, thankfully, completely surprised.</p><img src="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/_images/2024/auth0_panama_2018.jpg" alt="Auth0 Panama offsite 2018"><p>There was something truly special about what happened during that offsite. You felt like a part of something, like you were contributing to something singular and unique. There was talk of growth and ARR and everything else but the passion that everyone had to do this to the best of their abilities was clear in almost every conversation you had. And it wasn't obsession or fanaticism, it was confidence and excitement combined with camaraderie and just genuine good vibes. You were accepted here, regardless of where you came from in your career and in the world. Just give us your best and we'll use it.</p><p>I was caught up in the feeling but my own internal stuff was looming large. I wrote this journal entry while I was there:</p><blockquote><p>I'm in Panama, building a raspberry pi to pull data from secure internal sources and display to everyone in the company. Imposer syndrome in full effect at the moment ... right up until I stop thinking about it and just collaborate with someone. If I lose myself in the work at hand, that's where I become valuable, focused, and productive.</p></blockquote><p>I can remember this precise feeling, trying to write Node.js code in vim in a terminal connected to this misbehaving little gadget. I was quaking inside, feeling like someone would call me out. But that never happened and I doubled down on learning and growing from that point on. The excitement I felt leaving Panama was like nothing I had ever felt in my professional life.</p><p>After a year (that felt like 3), I was approached to be a part of the technical onboarding program that happened monthly in Bellevue. <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/vittorio/">I wrote about that experience recently</a> and, when I look back on that time, I remember being so humbled and proud of where I worked as I met all the incredible people that came through. Once I got my footing as an instructor, I felt like a critical part of creating the culture at Auth0. I got to meet about half of all the new hires for a year or so and was a part of them learning the product and digital identity. Everyone would work through 4 technical labs, each one hour long, and it was so rewarding to see folks try and fail and try something else and ask a neighbor and ask me and then get it working. We gave them a safe space to try something totally new right away and just about everyone walked away with something positive. Just writing these words gives me warm, fuzzy feelings ...</p><img src="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/_images/2024/auth0_bellevue_shark.jpg" alt="Auth0 shark"><figcaption><em><p>My son called the Bellevue office "Dad's Bellevue" and both kids loved the snacks that came back with me.</p></em></figcaption><p>The offsite that year in Los Cabos was just like the one the year before but even better. I knew many more people because of the onboarding and we were larger and more established. We also heard the news that Auth0 had completed a funding round and was now, based on factors I only partially understood, worth over a billion dollars. And this was all well and good but it meant so much more to everyone that was had been a part of it. We had put in our best work, side-by-side with wonderful people from around the world, led by two kind and brilliant Argentinians, <strong>and it was working</strong>! There was no pressure to work long hours (even though some of us did because we felt like it) and there was no manufactured pressure around launch dates. We figured out what worked for us, it was paying off, and it felt like we were just getting started.</p><p>In the beginning of 2020, <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/moment-in-time-during-pandemic/">something huge happened in the world</a> but, being a "modern" adult with kids, I worked right on through it. I helped convert the onboarding to virtual instead of in-person, transitioned out of the SDKs team, and onboarded as the second person on the <a href="https://marketplace.auth0.com/">Marketplace</a> team. As a part of transition, I worked on a <a href="https://github.com/auth0/wordpress/security/advisories/GHSA-59vf-cgfw-6h6v">high-severity CVE</a> that resulted in a <a href="https://github.com/auth0/wordpress/releases/tag/4.0.0">huge major release for a popular SDK</a> that I maintained. If this happened anywhere else, I might have been too embarrassed to link to that here and, at the time, I was mortified to be a part of such a critical issue caused by a misconfigured code analyzer. At every point during the process, though, the security team was so kind, so gracious, and made it clear that issues like these were the result of process failures, not individuals. Just when I felt like I should have been hauled into involuntary security training for a month, I was surrounded by supportive folks who helped get the fixes out as soon as possible and <em>even praised me for my work</em> during that release. I learned something about a blame-free culture that I will carry with me to the end of my professional life.</p><p>That Auth0 spirit, the feeling that you were a part of something, was on full display throughout the pandemic. Our family had some <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/how-we-are-teaching-right-now/">major challenges</a> with two young kids at home and two working parents. My wife and I would switch off on shifts: one person worked from 6AM to noon and the other noon to 6PM, with the other handling the house and the kids. Both of us, exhausted, would convene on the couch at night with our laptops, trying to eke out another hour of productivity, breath held that it would all be over soon.</p><img src="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/_images/2024/pandemic_yolo.jpg" alt="Pandemic YOLO"><figcaption><em><p>Not actually, no.</p></em></figcaption><p>But, once it was clear that we were in it for the long haul, the message at Auth0 was, sincerely, don't make life harder by trying to do more than you can do. The message was clear from the CEO down: take care of your family, do what you can do, don't burn yourself out. We adjusted due dates, spent time on meetings checking in with each other, and just made it through. I've said to many people since then: I would have been voluntarily unemployed very quickly without that support.</p><p>We were <s>12 years</s> 18 months into the pandemic and my tenure on the Marketplace team when I got the shocking news about <a href="https://www.okta.com/press-room/press-releases/okta-signs-agreement-to-acquire-auth0/">The Acquisition</a>. One of our main competitors, Okta, had acquired us for $6.5B dollars and we would trade in our fiery Auth0 orange for the more staid Okta blue. I wasn't sure exactly what to think. I was happy that my stock options would be worth something but that meant less than the thought of the Auth0 spirit fading away. We've all heard the stories about the small and spunky startup being acquired and slowly being dissolved into the larger entity.</p><p>But, the fact is, I didn't want to leave right away and I had faith that Auth0 would still live on, in some form, even under the umbrella of larger corporate entity. I had faith in the people that started the company and the people that were a part of building it to what it had become.</p><p>I spent another 18 months on Marketplace working with my teammates and partners to design and build integrations into our platform. We were flying by the seat of our pants a lot of the time but, as always, the people around me and the work we were doing kept me motivated. In the summer of 2022, however, <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/stroke/">another catastrophe struck my family</a> and I was, yet again, unable to do much beyond handle the situation in front of me. I was, once again, surrounded by teammates, a new manager, and a new director, all of whom told me in no uncertain terms: take care of your people and we'll handle it at work. This was over a year after The Acquisition and that support was the same as it had always been. I returned after several months of family leave and jumped right back in, truly excited to have a distraction in the form of writing code.</p><p>At the beginning of last year, I made what would be my last team change at the company. I was working with some true veterans with as many or more years in the company than I had. I loved the team and liked the work but something was missing and it didn’t really occur to me until I wrote the bulk of this post: the Auth0 story had been told, the ending was revealed, the future was written. The question of whether we would IPO or stay private forever or get acquired and by what company was no longer a question. We were “Auth0 by Okta,” soon to be known only as “Okta CIC.” There was work to be done and still big hills to climb but the original book is closed and on the shelf. In a world full of companies, we were one of the few that made it and it happened because of the heart and soul and blood and sweat we put into it.</p><p>I will forever be grateful to the two incredible individuals who started Auth0, Eugenio Pace and Matias Woloski, along with all the impossibly talented humans I worked with and learned from over the last 6 years. I feel like I accomplished a decade of professional growth during that time and learned an enormous amount about what it means to build and run a people-first company.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/_images/2024/auth0_values.png" alt=""></p><p>So, what’s next for me?

<p>It’s Nobel Prize week, and the work behind mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has just <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/">earned the physiology or medicine prize</a>. But this is Retraction Watch, so that’s not what this post is about.</p>



<p>A Nobel prize-winning researcher whose publications have come under scrutiny has retracted his <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dSemenza%252c%2bGregg%2bL">10th paper</a> for issues with the data and images.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/gregg-semenza">Gregg Semenza</a>, a professor of genetic medicine and director of the vascular program at Johns Hopkins’ Institute for Cell Engineering in Baltimore, shared the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2019/semenza/facts/">2019 Nobel prize</a> in physiology or medicine for “discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis had flagged possibly duplicated or manipulated images in Semenza’s publications on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=gregg+l+semenza">PubPeer</a> before 2019, and other sleuths posted more beginning in October 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last September, Semenza and his co-authors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/03/nobel-prize-winner-gregg-semenza-retracts-four-papers/">pulled four papers</a> from <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Another <em>PNAS</em> paper, one in <em>Oncogene</em>, and two from the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em> were retracted over the past year, with each notice stating that Semenza requested or agreed to the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, <em>Molecular Cancer Research</em> has retracted another of the Nobelist’s articles,&nbsp; “<a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/11/5/456/89397/Procollagen-Lysyl-Hydroxylase-2-Is-Essential-for">Procollagen Lysyl Hydroxylase 2 Is Essential for Hypoxia-Induced Breast Cancer Metastasis</a>,” which appeared in 2013. The article has been cited 181 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a 2011 retraction for a paper co-authored with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Naoki+Mori">Naoki Mori</a> – who with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dNaoki%2bMori">31 retractions</a> sits at No. 24 on our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> – today’s retraction makes 10 for Semenza. More <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03032-9">may be on the way</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/21/10/1120/729213/Retraction-Procollagen-Lysyl-Hydroxylase-2-Is">notice</a> states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This article (1) has been retracted at the request of the authors. The authors found that lanes 4, 5, and 6 of the HIF-1α immunoblot in Fig. 3A are identical images. An internal review corroborated the authors’ claim, and the editors agreed with the authors’ retraction request. The authors apologize to the scientific community and deeply regret any inconveniences or challenges resulting from the publication and subsequent retraction of this article.</p>



<p>A copy of this Retraction Notice was sent to the last known email addresses for all authors. Four authors (Denis Wirtz, Carmen C. Wong, Daniele M. Gilkes, and Gregg L. Semenza) agreed to the retraction; the 3 remaining authors could not be located.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Semenza did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Johns Hopkins would not comment on whether they were investigating the matter when a reporter from <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-gregg-semenza-retractions-20230801-2wv7kspmq5awfes3omkacb4bpy-story.html"><em>The Baltimore Sun</em> asked this summer</a>.</p>



<p>In October 2020, a PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/23FCB85FEAF061E1677BF705DFC91D#1">commented</a> that the lanes of the figure identified in the retraction notice were “much more similar than expected.” The first author, Daniele M. Gilkes, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/23FCB85FEAF061E1677BF705DFC91D#3">responded</a> by posting an image of the “original uncropped version.” Another commenter raised more concerns about the image, but Gilkes did not respond again.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2024/02/let-me-tell-you-a-secret.html">https://blog.glyph.im/2024/02/let-me-tell-you-a-secret.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39378342">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>I do consulting<sup id="fnref:1:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:1:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> on software architecture, network protocol development,
python software infrastructure, streamlined cloud deployment, and open source
strategy, among other nerdy things.  I enjoy solving challenging, complex
technical problems or contributing to the open source commons. On the best
jobs, I get to do both.</p>
<p>Today I would like to share with you a secret of the software technology
consulting trade.</p>
<p>I should note that this secret is not specific to me. I have several colleagues
who have also done software consulting and have reflected versions of this
experience back to me.<sup id="fnref:2:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:2:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>We’ll get to the secret itself in a moment, but first, some background.</p>
<hr>
<p>Companies do not go looking for consulting when things are going great.  This
is particularly true when looking for high-level consulting on things like
system architecture or strategy.  Almost by definition, there’s a problem that
I have been brought in to solve.  Ideally, that problem is a technical
challenge.</p>
<p>In the software industry, your team probably already has some software
professionals with a variety of technical skills, and thus they know what to do
with technical challenges.  Which means that, as often as not, the problem is
to do with <em>people</em> rather than technology, even it appears otherwise.</p>
<p>When you hire a staff-level professional like myself to address your software
team’s general problems, that consultant will need to gather some information.
If I am that consultant and I start to suspect that the purported technology
problem that you’ve got is in fact a people problem, here is what I am going to
do.</p>
<p>I am going to go get a pen and a pad of paper, then schedule a 90-minute
meeting with the most senior IC<sup id="fnref:3:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:3:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:3">3</a></sup> engineer that you have on your team. I will
bring that pen and paper to the meeting.  I will then ask one question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is fucked up about this place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will then write down their response in as much detail as I can manage.  If I
have begun to suspect that this meeting is necessary, 90 minutes is typically
not enough time, and I will struggle to keep up.  Even so, I will usually
manage to capture the highlights.</p>
<p>One week later, I will schedule a meeting with executive leadership, and during
that meeting, I will read back a <em>very</em> lightly edited<sup id="fnref:4:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:4:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:4">4</a></sup> version of the
transcript of the previous meeting.  This is then routinely praised as a keen
strategic insight.</p>
<hr>
<p>I should pause here to explicitly note that — obviously, I hope — this is not
an oblique reference to any current or even recent client; if I’d had this
meeting recently it would be pretty awkward to answer that “so, I read your
blog…” email.<sup id="fnref:5:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:5:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:5">5</a></sup> But talking about clients in this way, no matter how
obfuscated and vague the description, is always a bit professionally risky.  So
why risk it?</p>
<p>The thing is, I’m not a people manager.  While I <em>can</em> do this kind of work,
and I do not begrudge doing it if it is the thing that needs doing, I find it
stressful and unfulfilling. I am a technology guy, not a people person.  This
is generally true of people who elect to go into technology consulting; we know
where the management track is, and we didn’t pick it.</p>
<p>If you are going to hire me for my highly specialized technical expertise, I
want you to get the maximum value out of it.  I know my value; my rates are not
low, and I do not want clients to come away with the sense that I only had a
couple of “obvious” meetings.</p>
<p>So the intended audience for this piece is potential clients, leaders of teams
(or organizations, or companies) who have a general technology problem and are
wondering if they need a consultant with my skill-set to help them fix it.
Before you decide that your issue is the need to implement a complex
distributed system consensus algorithm, check if that is really what’s at
issue.  Talk to your ICs, and — taking care to make sure they understand that
you want honest feedback and that they are safe to offer it — ask them what
problems your organization has.</p>
<p>During this meeting it is important to <em>only listen</em>.  Especially if you’re at
a small company and you are regularly involved in the day-to-day operations,
you might feel immediately defensive.  Sit with that feeling, and process it
later.  Don’t unload your emotional state on an employee you have power
over.<sup id="fnref:6:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:6:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>“Only listening” doesn’t exclusively mean “don’t push back”.  You also
shouldn’t be committing to fixing anything.  While the information you are
gathering in these meetings is extremely valuable, and you should probably act
on more of it than you will initially want to, your ICs won’t have the full
picture.  They really may not understand why certain priorities are set the way
they are.  You’ll need to take <em>that</em> as feedback for improving internal comms
rather than “fixing” the perceived problem, and you certainly don’t want to
make empty promises.</p>
<p>If you have these conversations directly, you can get something from it that no
consultant can offer you: credibility.  If you can actively listen, the
conversation alone can improve morale.  People like having their concerns
heard.  If, better still, you manage to make meaningful changes to <em>address</em>
the concerns you’ve heard about, you can inspire true respect.</p>
<p>As a consultant, I’m going to be seen as some random guy wasting their time
with a meeting.  Even if you make the changes I recommend, it won’t resonate
the same way as someone remembering that they <em>personally</em> told you what was
wrong, and you took it seriously and fixed it.</p>
<p>Once you know what the problems are with your organization, and you’ve got
solid technical understanding that you really <em>do</em> need that event-driven
distributed systems consensus algorithm implemented using Twisted, I’m
absolutely your guy.  Feel free to <a href="mailto:consulting@glyph.im">get in touch</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     
    <p>
	Air Canada has been ordered to compensate a B.C. man because its chatbot gave him inaccurate information.</p>
<p>
	The Civil Resolution Tribunal's decision on the dispute was <a href="https://decisions.civilresolutionbc.ca/crt/crtd/en/item/525448/index.do" target="_blank">posted online Wednesday</a>, finding in favour of a man who relied on information provided by the bot about fares when he was booking a flight to attend his grandmother's funeral.</p>
<p>
	"I find Air Canada did not take reasonable care to ensure its chatbot was accurate," tribunal member Christopher C. Rivers wrote, awarding $650.88 in damages for negligent misrepresentation.</p>
<p>
	"Negligent misrepresentation can arise when a seller does not exercise reasonable care to ensure its representations are accurate and not misleading," the decision explains.</p>
<p>
	Jake Moffatt was booking a flight to Toronto and asked the bot about the airline's bereavement rates – reduced fares provided in the event someone needs to travel due to the death of an immediate family member.</p>
<p>
	Moffatt said he was told that these fares could be claimed retroactively by completing a refund application within 90 days of the date the ticket was issued, and submitted a screenshot of his conversation with the bot as evidence supporting this claim.</p>
<p>
	He submitted his request, accompanied by his grandmother's death certificate, in November of 2022 – less than a week after he purchased his ticket. But his application was denied and the tribunal decision said emails submitted as evidence showed that Moffatt's attempts to receive a partial refund continued for another two-and-a-half months.</p>
<p>
	The airline refused the refund because it said its policy was that bereavement fare could not, in fact, be claimed retroactively.</p>
<p>
	In February of 2023, Moffatt sent the airline a screenshot of his conversation with the chatbot and received a response in which Air Canada "admitted the chatbot had provided 'misleading words.'"</p>
<p>
	But Moffatt was still unable to get a partial refund, prompting him to file the claim with the tribunal.</p>
<p>
	Air Canada, for its part, argued that it could not be held liable for information provided by the bot.</p>
<p>
	"In effect, Air Canada suggests the chatbot is a separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions. This is a remarkable submission. While a chatbot has an interactive component, it is still just a part of Air Canada’s website," Rivers wrote.</p>
<p>
	"It should be obvious to Air Canada that it is responsible for all the information on its website. It makes no difference whether the information comes from a static page or a chatbot."</p>
<p>
	The airline also argued that the chatbot's response to Moffatt's inquiry included a link to a section of its website that outlined the company's policy and said that requests for a discounted fare are not allowed after someone has travelled.</p>
<p>
	Rivers rejected this argument as well.</p>
<p>
	"While Air Canada argues Mr. Moffatt could find the correct information on another part of its website, it does not explain why the webpage titled 'Bereavement travel' was inherently more trustworthy than its chatbot. It also does not explain why customers should have to double-check information found in one part of its website on another part of its website," he wrote.</p>
<p>
	"Mr. Moffatt says, and I accept, that they relied upon the chatbot to provide accurate information. I find that was reasonable in the circumstances. There is no reason why Mr. Moffatt should know that one section of Air Canada’s webpage is accurate, and another is not."</p>
<p>
	The compensation the tribunal awarded was the equivalent of the difference between what Moffatt paid for his flight and a discounted bereavement fare.</p>
<p>
	In addition, the airline was ordered to pay $36.14 in pre-judgment interest and $125 in fees.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Copying a file across devices is painful. You’re on your phone, but you want to access a file that’s on your laptop. How do you do it? What about the other way around? What about copying any file between any of your devices? I asked my dad how he copies a file from his phone to his computer, and he replied with: “through mail attachments, or I use WeTransfer if it’s too big.”. If you had asked me 5 years ago, I would’ve said: “through Dropbox”. Obviously, all fair solutions to this common problem, but I want to make it a little harder. Instead, I’ll be looking for the easiest and laziest way, to copy a file between devices. On top of that, I’ll add a couple of rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I can’t use an account from an existing online service (like Dropbox, Google Drive, WeTransfer, email drafts, etc.).</li>
  <li>It needs to be useable for a non-technical person</li>
  <li>Its flow has to be consistent across platforms</li>
</ol>

<p>Relevant XKCD:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/file_transfer.png" alt="img"></p>

<h3 id="impossible">“Impossible”</h3>
<p>Now, you’re looking at the ruleset and think to yourself: “this is impossible”. If I however search online for my predicament - specifically “how do I copy a file from my <em>phone</em> to my laptop” - a Google Support page comes up which reads: “through a USB-cable” [1]. Fair enough, but what about copying it from phone to phone, or laptop to laptop. I can’t use a USB cable in that case; I would have to use an SD-card or a USB-stick.</p>

<p>Another route is Bluetooth, that feature you accidentally turn on from the Android top menu that drains batteries really fast. It might make sense, but the whole pairing feels complex, and unusable for the normal day-to-day user.</p>

<p>If I made an overview of some of the most popular file-sharing technologies out there, and other tools which I’ve used in the past, and test if they match the rules, this would be the list:</p>

* WeTransfer has an anonymous upload function, so it does scratch that itch.</p>

<p>** Whatsapp up until recently had the ability to send messages to yourself. Practically allowing file uploads to yourself. However, for some reason this doesn’t work anymore.</p>

<h3 id="in-an-ideal-world-">In an ideal world …</h3>
<p>… I would’ve been able to open op my phone, tap on a file from the file explorer, and hit share. A device from within my own network would show up, to which I can copy said file. In my personal situation this means: opening up the “Files” app from an Android phone. This “Files” app is actually opening up “Google Files”, and naturally that app wants you to use Google Drive, which breaks rule number 1. Besides, if I start out from my Ubuntu laptop there’s no share button, and no Google Drive.</p>

<p>I could obviously suck it up and install Google Drive, but for this particular use case I don’t want to. Which brings me to the following issue:</p>

<h3 id="no-junk-in-the-middle">No junk in the middle</h3>
<p>Another rule I want to add is: “no junk in the middle”. The problem with most file sharing services is that they leave junk behind. Especially the online services like Dropbox, WeTransfer and Google Drive. All of them use storage servers to temporarily or permanently store files. For a use-case which merely revolves around sharing files from one of <em>your</em> devices to another one of your devices, it feels redundant to also have that file stored in the “middle”. Or in other words: leave junk behind.</p>

<p>F.e.: if I were to use Dropbox, the flow would be as such:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open up Dropbox (either through a file explorer, or the app).</li>
  <li>Add a file and wait for it to sync.</li>
  <li>Open up Dropbox on the other device and see the file appear.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a look at another flow, like using mail attachments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open up a mail provider and sign-in on device 1.</li>
  <li>Create a draft, and add an attachment.</li>
  <li>Open up that same mail provider on device 2, and download the file from the drafts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Psychologically speaking, a user has successfully achieved its goal after the file arrives at the other device. Cleaning it up afterwards feels like an extra step, and in some cases it is kind of a hard step. In both cases, the file that’s uploaded will either be stuck forever in Dropbox’s folder (or until the user becomes inactive for over quite some time) or it will be stuck in the drafts folder of somebody’s mail service, until they decide to delete it.</p>

<p>Considering that nowadays in The Netherlands huge data parks are required for storing files either permanently or temporarily, which in their turn create all sorts of energy and political problems, I think we do need to take this behavior into account.</p>

<p>If we update the original list above with “4. No junk in the middle”, we get:</p>

<p><br>
For some of these services like WhatsApp or Apple’s Airdrop I’m not sure if there’s a storage provider in the middle. In the case of WeTransfer’s anonymous file transfer, a file persists for seven days. This is not ideal, but it’s slightly better than the alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="a-solution">A solution</h3>
<p>I would like to start out that this merely solves a problem I personally face in my day-to-day life. So, considering the solution needs to be cross-platform the easiest way to get something up and running would be through a web browser.</p>

<p>From the browser there are a couple of things that I can try. Let me say that one of the rules isn’t file size, and neither does it have to be efficient. The dumbest thing I can come up with is the URL itself. A GET-request has an upper limit of 8 kB (or 8192 bytes). This is not a lot, but I could turn a file into a binary-octet stream and read it from the URL. A simple example link would look like such: <a download="file.txt" href="data:application/octet-stream;charset=utf-8;base64,Zm9vIGJhcg==">text file</a>, or in code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;a</span> <span>download=</span><span>"file.txt"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"data:application/octet-stream;charset=utf-8;base64,Zm9vIGJhcg=="</span><span>&gt;</span>
  text file
<span>&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>All we would have to do here is create a simple HTML page with an upload input, add a file below 7 kB, turn it into a base64 string and copy it over to the receiving end through the URL. On the receiving end, it has to dynamically create a link element, parse the URL and put whatever is in there to the ‘href’ attribute. It’s cross-platform, it’s dumb and easy to use, but the 8 kB is a bit of a restriction. What if my file is bigger than 8 kB?</p>

<p>If I ignore the idiocy of using links to share small files, what this does teach me is that you can turn a file into text, and specifically into a downloadable link. Writing the most minimum of JavaScript, this seems to work as well:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>fileBytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>foo bar</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>File</span><span>([</span><span>fileBytes</span><span>],</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>octet/stream</span><span>"</span> <span>});</span>
<span>const</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>URL</span><span>.</span><span>createObjectURL</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>a</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>href</span> <span>=</span> <span>url</span><span>;</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>download</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>file.txt</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>innerHTML</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>text file</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>// TODO: add 'a' to the DOM.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Demo: </strong></p>





<p>All I would have to solve next is a way to send a lot of bytes from one client to the other, without leaving a mess in the middle. A way out could be websockets; it would allow me to stream more than 8 kB of data between clients, but it does require an entire websocket handler. In other words; a server that manages the websocket connections.</p>

<h3 id="websockets-a-love-story">Websockets, a love story</h3>
<p>Web browsers these days have websocket [3] functionality. For this to work, I’ll need to host a socket handler somewhere within my own network. Each websocket client will be able to connect to the websocket server from their respected devices, and are able to communicate to each other. In other words, send bytes from one to the other. A socket handler in Go looks roughly like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>static</span> <span>"github.com/gin-contrib/static"</span>
	<span>"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"</span>
	<span>"gopkg.in/olahol/melody.v1"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>gin</span><span>.</span><span>Default</span><span>()</span>
	<span>m</span> <span>:=</span> <span>melody</span><span>.</span><span>New</span><span>()</span>

	<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Use</span><span>(</span><span>static</span><span>.</span><span>Serve</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>static</span><span>.</span><span>LocalFile</span><span>(</span><span>"./public"</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>)))</span>

	<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>"/ws"</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>*</span><span>gin</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>m</span><span>.</span><span>HandleRequest</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>Writer</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span>
	<span>})</span>

	<span>m</span><span>.</span><span>HandleMessage</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>melody</span><span>.</span><span>Session</span><span>,</span> <span>msg</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>m</span><span>.</span><span>BroadcastOthers</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
	<span>})</span>

	<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>":8080"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’m using two frameworks in the example above, Gin and Melody, meaning I’ve officially been cancelled from the Go community. In my defense, I didn’t want to be going through the whole pain of implementing a websocket server from scratch, purely for trying something out. There are tons of other websocket servers out there, but because I’m currently learning Go, this is the one I picked.</p>

<p>The client-side code is where it gets rather complicated, because to make this work a couple of things need to be kept in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I can’t send a lot of data over the websocket server above, so each file needs to be sliced into pieces.</li>
  <li>The file pieces need to be stitched back together on the receiving end.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sending-files"><em>Sending files</em></h3>
<p>Sending a file over a websocket is not that complicated if we have to stick to the aforementioned rules. JavaScript has introduced the <code>slice()</code> function to <code>File</code>, and there’s a <code>FileReader()</code> API I can make use of. Firstly, I need to make sure to chunk the file into pieces:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Assuming there's a multipart input element in the html body:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>chunkSize</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>;</span>

<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>file</span> <span>of</span> <span>input</span><span>.</span><span>files</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>pointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>pointer</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>slice</span> <span>=</span> <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>pointer</span><span>,</span> <span>pointer</span> <span>+</span> <span>chunkSize</span><span>);</span>

        <span>pointer</span> <span>+=</span> <span>chunkSize</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If I have, for example, a file that’s 7 MB, this code will chunk it into slices of 5 MB and 2 MB. The slice method will try to take 5 MB of the end for the 2nd part, but it will read until the end (there’s no need to recalculate the offset).</p>

<p>Secondly, I can read the slice into memory like such:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>readChunk</span><span>(</span><span>blob</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>fr</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>FileReader</span><span>();</span>

    <span>fr</span><span>.</span><span>readAsArrayBuffer</span><span>(</span><span>blob</span><span>);</span>
    <span>fr</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>load</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>fr</span><span>.</span><span>result</span><span>;</span>
        <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>Array</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Uint8Array</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>)));</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The reason why I’m converting it into an array is because I’ll be sending it over a websocket later on, and this makes it a bit easier when converting it to JSON, and reading it back.</p>

<p>In the demo below I’m combining both the code snippets from above (feel free to inspect the source).</p>



<pre id="demo1-result"></pre>



<p>You can add some files and see the result of the chunking. As you can see, it reads the chunks randomly (unless you added a file that’s below 5 MB).</p>

<h3 id="receiving-files"><em>Receiving files</em></h3>
<p>Receiving files and stitching them back together is a bit strange in JavaScript. As you can see from the demo above, file parts are chunked randomly. Because of this, when stitching the parts back together, you have to retain the order, else the file ends up corrupted on the other side. The next demo is going to look a bit odd, but all this does is echo a file you upload back to yourself, all from within JavaScript.</p>

<p>See it as a really expensive way of doing:</p>





<pre id="demo2-result"></pre>



<p>Magical? Isn’t it. Technically, what is happening here is the following: files are being added to a form, they’re chunked and read into memory. Every chunk is being added to a ‘files’ object, and when all the chunks have been read, it reassembles the file back together and turns the file into a URL which can be downloaded by the browser. The full code for the demo looks as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>chunkSize</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>;</span>

<p>Now, all that is left is including some WebSocket functionality to send and receive the bytes. I need to increase the size of the buffers in the websocket server to make sure it can fit 5 MB parts, or stick to the default buffer sizes and instead make tiny 128 kB parts. I’m not sure what the best way is, but I went with the former.</p>

<p>After some tweaking I ended up with a solution that works for me, but how does it exactly hold up if I test it against my own rules? The following table appears:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tool</th>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>2</th>
      <th>3</th>
      <th>4</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Custom websocket solution</td>
      <td>✓</td>
      <td>❌</td>
      <td>~</td>
      <td>✓</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<p>At this point, it is impossible to use for a non-technical person. I can spend quite some time on designing a really nice interface, but the key issue here is that the backend needs to be self-hosted, which are solutions normal users never ever want to think about. I can however think about using a tool like Socketsbay [4] or Postman Websockets [5] to act as the socket server. Likewise, there are probably other paid and non-paid alternatives out there.</p>

<h3 id="concluding">Concluding</h3>
<p>Copying a file across your own personal devices is still painful. The flow is inconsistent between devices, some tools are available on one device and not the other, and most of them leave junk behind. Web browsers become like cross-platform Swiss army knives, and the file API’s I explored that are available are honestly fascinating. Websockets proved a good enough solution for my own personal pain. However, time-wise it might have been faster to rummage through that one kitchen drawer to find a USB-stick, SD-card or USB-cable.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p> Tagged as <a href="https://daninus14.github.io/tag/lisp.html">lisp</a>, <a href="https://daninus14.github.io/tag/common-lisp.html">common-lisp</a>, <a href="https://daninus14.github.io/tag/conference.html">conference</a> </p> <p> Written on 2024-02-13 14:08:59 </p> <p>This question is always asked. My thoughts are a little bit different than what I've read online.</p>

<p>I think the real reason may be because of the fact that <strong>there is</strong> a standard. Yes, you read that correctly.</p>

<p>The great benefit of a standard is that no matter what implementation you use, if they follow the standard, and your code follows the standard, you should have portable code between implementations. Further, and probably the greatest benefit, is that we don't have to worry about backwards compatibility. Code from about 40 years ago (yeah, even before the standard!) still runs today (I don't have a link at hand, but it was one of those popular lisp posts that I'm sure you can easily find) by simply importing a package. </p>

<p>However, a standard comes with a cost. The cost is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility">diffusion of responsibility</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The diffusion of responsibility refers to the decreased responsibility of action each member of a group feels when they are part of a group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What we are lacking is a body or organization who will take on the responsibility of promoting common lisp.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Foundation</a> for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Python Software Foundation is an organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And where do they get their <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/">money from</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PyCon US typically generates over 65% of the PSF’s revenue. With PyCon US 2020 and 2021 happening virtually, the PSF may lose $1.2 million USD of expected revenue for those two years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if there are different groups or individuals trying to promote CL, what we really need is one person who will lead a main CL only conference which is not just an <a href="https://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/">academic conference</a>. The purpose of the conference is both in itself to promote CL and serve as a place for CL companies, users, and implementors to get together, and <em>also</em> for fundraising for the organization.</p>

<p>Those funds can then be used to address the biggest issues plaguing CL, it seems from time immemorial, namely documentation and marketing. Marketing includes presenting the documentation in both an easy to understand and pleasant way, and also producing thorough and detailed references.</p>

<p>Further, the funds can be used to address anything lacking in the ecosystem for which there has not been a serious enough effort to provide a solution, and for which a solution could be provided with a given financial investment. I am sure there are <em>many</em> common lisp developers out there who would be thrilled to create common lisp projects that are robust and for the benefit of the community, if they had the financial support to be able to do it.</p>

<p>As an example of this, take a look at a new language: Julia. They have what looks like a <a href="https://juliacon.org/2024/">popular conference</a>, and a <a href="https://julialang.org/research/#sponsors">bunch of sponsors</a>. The Sloan Foundation by itself <a href="https://sloan.org/grant-detail/7999">gave almost 1 million USD in 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Another example is Racket, which is also covered in the academic conference mentioned above, and they even have two conferences! An <a href="https://con.racket-lang.org/">official one</a>, and <a href="https://racketfest.com/">another</a> one from the users.</p>

<p>So in conclusion, we need an organization which will aggressively work to fundraise for Common Lisp in order to promote the usage of the language by providing solutions to ecosystem issues that no one is taking care of in a robust enough way.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	At least one <a href="https://variety.com/t/amazon/" id="auto-tag_amazon" data-tag="amazon">Amazon</a> Prime member is furious over the ecommerce company’s <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/amazon-prime-video-advertising-revenue-forecast-1235888805/">move to start playing ads in Prime Video programming</a> — unless customers pay an extra monthly fee.</p>



<p>
	A lawsuit seeking class-action status accused Amazon of false advertising and deceptive practices because <a href="https://variety.com/t/prime-video/" id="auto-tag_prime-video" data-tag="prime-video">Prime Video</a> now serves commercials by default.</p>



<p>
	“For years, people purchased and renewed their Amazon Prime subscriptions believing that they would include ad-free streaming,” the lawsuit says. “But last month, Amazon changed the deal. To stream movies and TV shows without ads, Amazon customers must now pay an additional $2.99 per month… This is not fair, because these subscribers already paid for the ad-free version; these subscribers should not have to pay an additional $2.99/month for something that they already paid for.”

	</p>




<p>
	The case was filed on behalf of Wilbert Napoleon, a resident of Eastvale, Calif., who says he’s a Prime member. “Plaintiff brings this case for himself and for other Amazon Prime customers,” the suit said. The complain alleged that Amazon violates Washington State and California state consumer protection laws that prohibit unfair competition and deceptive business acts and practices.

</p>



<p>
	Amazon’s conduct, as alleged, “was immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous and substantially injurious to consumers,” according to the lawsuit. The suit seeks unspecific monetary damages, including punitive damages, as well as an injunction to block Amazon’s alleged deceptive conduct.</p>



<p>
	Asked for comment, an Amazon rep said in an email, “We are unable to comment on pending litigation.”</p>



<p>
	The suit was filed Feb. 9, after Amazon starting on Jan. 29 began running ads in Prime Video content in major markets including the United States unless users opt to pay extra ($2.99/month in the U.S.) to have an ad-free experience. Some analysts have forecast <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/amazon-prime-video-advertising-revenue-forecast-1235888805/">Prime Video ads generating more than $3 billion in revenue in 2024</a>.</p>



<p>
	Note that both Netflix and Disney+ recently introduced ad-supported plans. But unlike <a href="https://variety.com/t/amazon-prime-video/" id="auto-tag_amazon-prime-video" data-tag="amazon-prime-video">Amazon Prime Video</a>, those were offered as separate, lower-priced tiers, whereas Prime Video’s default plan now includes ads.</p>



<p>
	On Amazon’s fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy told Wall Street analysts that with the introduction of ads by default in Prime Video, “we’ll be able to continue investing meaningfully in content over time.” </p>



<p>
	“We have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own, and we’ll continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for Prime members like ‘Thursday Night Football,’ ‘Lord of the Rings,’ ‘Reacher,’ ‘Mr. &amp; Mr. Smith,’ ‘Citadel’ and more,” Jassy said.

	</p>




<p>
	The lead counsel in the Prime Video ads lawsuit is Dovel &amp; Luner, a Santa Monica-based law firm that specializes in class-action litigation. A copy of the complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, is available at <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.331191/gov.uscourts.wawd.331191.1.0.pdf" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>

<p>High school physics teachers describe them as featureless balls with one unit each of positive electric charge — the perfect foils for the negatively charged electrons that buzz around them. College students learn that the ball is actually a bundle of three elementary particles called quarks. But decades of research have revealed a deeper truth, one that’s too bizarre to fully capture with words or images.</p>
<p>“This is the most complicated thing that you could possibly imagine,” said <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/michael-williams/">Mike Williams</a>, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “In fact, you can’t even imagine how complicated it is.”</p>
<p>The proton is a quantum mechanical object that exists as a haze of probabilities until an experiment forces it to take a concrete form. And its forms differ drastically depending on how researchers set up their experiment. Connecting the particle’s many faces has been the work of generations. “We’re kind of just starting to understand this system in a complete way,” said <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/richard-milner/">Richard Milner</a>, a nuclear physicist at MIT.</p>

<p>As the pursuit continues, the proton’s secrets keep tumbling out. Most recently, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04998-2">monumental data analysis</a> published in August found that the proton contains traces of particles called charm quarks that are heavier than the proton itself.</p>
<p>The proton “has been humbling to humans,” Williams said. “Every time you think you kind of have a handle on it, it throws you some curveballs.”</p>
<p>Recently, Milner, together with Rolf Ent at Jefferson Lab, MIT filmmakers Chris Boebel and Joe McMaster, and animator James LaPlante, set out to transform a set of arcane plots that compile the results of hundreds of experiments into a series of animations of the shape-shifting proton. We’ve incorporated their animations into our own attempt to unveil its secrets.</p>
<h2><strong>Cracking Open the Proton</strong></h2>
<p>Proof that the proton contains multitudes came from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in 1967. In earlier experiments, researchers had pelted it with electrons and watched them ricochet off like billiard balls. But SLAC could hurl electrons more forcefully, and researchers saw that they bounced back differently. The electrons were hitting the proton hard enough to shatter it — a process called deep inelastic scattering — and were rebounding from point-like shards of the proton called quarks. “That was the first evidence that quarks actually exist,” said <a href="https://www.phys.virginia.edu/People/personal.asp?UID=xz5y">Xiaochao Zheng</a>, a physicist at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>After SLAC’s discovery, which won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1990, scrutiny of the proton intensified. Physicists have carried out hundreds of scattering experiments to date. They infer various aspects of the object’s interior by adjusting how forcefully they bombard it and by choosing which scattered particles they collect in the aftermath.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="" src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2022/10/Proton_gun_fix_920-Desktop.svg"></p></div></figure><figure></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>By using higher-energy electrons, physicists can ferret out finer features of the target proton. In this way, the electron energy sets the maximum resolving power of a deep inelastic scattering experiment. More powerful particle colliders offer a sharper view of the proton.</p>
<p>Higher-energy colliders also produce a wider array of collision outcomes, letting researchers choose different subsets of the outgoing electrons to analyze. This flexibility has proved key to understanding quarks, which careen about inside the proton with different amounts of momentum.</p>
<p>By measuring the energy and trajectory of each scattered electron, researchers can tell if it has glanced off a quark carrying a large chunk of the proton’s total momentum or just a smidgen. Through repeated collisions, they can take something like a census — determining whether the proton’s momentum is mostly bound up in a few quarks, or distributed over many.</p>

<p>Even SLAC’s proton-splitting collisions were gentle by today’s standards. In those scattering events, electrons often shot out in ways suggesting that they had crashed into quarks carrying a third of the proton’s total momentum. The finding matched a theory from Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig, who in 1964 posited that a proton consists of three quarks.</p>
<p>Gell-Mann and Zweig’s “quark model” remains an elegant way to imagine the proton. It has two “up” quarks with electric charges of +2/3 each and one “down” quark with a charge of −1/3, for a total proton charge of +1.</p>
</div></div><figure></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>But the quark model is an oversimplification that has serious shortcomings.</p>
<p>It fails, for instance, when it comes to a proton’s spin, a quantum property analogous to angular momentum. The proton has half a unit of spin, as do each of its up and down quarks. Physicists initially supposed that — in a calculation echoing the simple charge arithmetic — the half-units of the two up quarks minus that of the down quark must equal half a unit for the proton as a whole. But in 1988, the European Muon Collaboration <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0370269388915237?via%3Dihub">reported</a> that the quark spins add up to far less than one-half. Similarly, the masses of two up quarks and one down quark only comprise about 1% of the proton’s total mass. These deficits drove home a point physicists were already coming to appreciate: The proton is much more than three quarks.</p>
<h2><strong>Much More Than Three Quarks</strong></h2>
<p>The Hadron-Electron&nbsp;Ring&nbsp;Accelerator (HERA), which operated in Hamburg, Germany, from 1992 to 2007, slammed electrons into protons roughly a thousand times more forcefully than SLAC had. In HERA experiments, physicists could select electrons that had bounced off of extremely low-momentum quarks, including ones carrying as little as 0.005% of the proton’s total momentum. And detect them they did: HERA’s electrons rebounded from a maelstrom of low-momentum quarks and their antimatter counterparts, antiquarks.</p>
</div></div><figure></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>The results confirmed a sophisticated and outlandish theory that had by then replaced Gell-Mann and Zweig’s quark model. Developed in the 1970s, it was a quantum theory of the “strong force” that acts between quarks. The theory describes quarks as being roped together by force-carrying particles called gluons. Each quark and each gluon has one of three types of “color” charge, labeled red, green and blue; these color-charged particles naturally tug on each other and form a group — such as a proton — whose colors add up to a neutral white. The colorful theory became known as quantum chromodynamics, or QCD.</p>
<p>According to QCD, gluons can pick up momentary spikes of energy. With this energy, a gluon splits into a quark and an antiquark — each carrying just a tiny bit of momentum — before the pair annihilates and disappears. It’s this “sea” of transient gluons, quarks and antiquarks that HERA, with its greater sensitivity to lower-momentum particles, detected firsthand.</p>
<p>HERA also picked up hints of what the proton would look like in more powerful colliders. As physicists adjusted HERA to look for lower-momentum quarks, these quarks — which come from gluons — showed up in greater and greater numbers. The results suggested that in even higher-energy collisions, the proton would appear as a cloud made up almost entirely of gluons.</p>
</div></div><figure></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>The gluon dandelion is exactly what QCD predicts. “The HERA data are direct experimental proof that QCD describes nature,” Milner said.</p>
<p>But the young theory’s victory came with a bitter pill: While QCD beautifully described the dance of short-lived quarks and gluons revealed by HERA’s extreme collisions, the theory is useless for understanding the three long-lasting quarks seen in SLAC’s gentle bombardment.</p>
<p>QCD’s predictions are easy to understand only when the strong force is relatively weak. And the strong force weakens only when quarks are extremely close together, as they are in short-lived quark-antiquark pairs. Frank Wilczek, David Gross and David Politzer identified this defining feature of QCD in 1973, winning the Nobel Prize for it 31 years later.</p>
<p>But for gentler collisions like SLAC’s, where the proton acts like three quarks that mutually keep their distance, these quarks pull on each other strongly enough that QCD calculations become impossible. Thus, the task of further demystifying the three-quark view of the proton has fallen largely to experimentalists. (Researchers who run “digital experiments,” in which QCD predictions are simulated on supercomputers, have also made <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/impossible-particle-discovery-adds-key-piece-to-the-strong-force-puzzle-20210927/">key contributions</a>.) And it’s in this low-resolution picture that physicists keep finding surprises.</p>
<h2><strong>A Charming New View</strong></h2>
<p>Recently, a team led by <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/juan-rojo">Juan Rojo</a> of the National Institute for Subatomic Physics in the Netherlands and VU University Amsterdam analyzed more than 5,000 proton snapshots taken over the last 50 years, using machine learning to infer the motions of quarks and gluons inside the proton in a way that sidesteps theoretical guesswork.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>The new scrutiny picked up a background blur in the images that had escaped past researchers. In relatively soft collisions just barely breaking the proton open, most of the momentum was locked up in the usual three quarks: two ups and a down. But a small amount of momentum appeared to come from a “charm” quark and charm antiquark — colossal elementary particles that each outweigh the entire proton by more than one-third.</p>
</div></div><figure><div></div></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>Short-lived charms frequently show up in the “quark sea” view of the proton (gluons can split into any of six different quark types if they have enough energy). But the results from Rojo and colleagues suggest that the charms have a more permanent presence, making them detectable in gentler collisions. In these collisions, the proton appears as a quantum mixture, or superposition, of multiple states: An electron usually encounters the three lightweight quarks. But it will occasionally encounter a rarer “molecule” of five quarks, such as an up, down and charm quark grouped on one side and an up quark and charm antiquark on the other.</p>
<p>Such subtle details about the proton’s makeup could prove consequential. At the Large Hadron Collider, physicists search for new elementary particles by bashing high-speed protons together and seeing what pops out; to understand the results, researchers need to know what’s in a proton to begin with. The occasional apparition of giant charm quarks would <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06666">throw off the odds</a> of making more exotic particles.</p>
<p>And when protons called cosmic rays hurtle here from outer space and slam into protons in Earth’s atmosphere, charm quarks popping up at the right moments would shower Earth with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13852">extra-energetic neutrinos</a>, researchers calculated in 2021. These could confound observers <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmic-map-of-ultrahigh-energy-particles-points-to-long-hidden-treasures-20210427/">searching</a> for high-energy neutrinos coming from across the cosmos.</p>
<p>Rojo’s collaboration plans to continue exploring the proton by searching for an imbalance between charm quarks and antiquarks. And heavier constituents, such as the top quark, could make even rarer and harder-to-detect appearances.</p>
<p>Next-generation experiments will seek still more unknown features. Physicists at Brookhaven National Laboratory hope to fire up the Electron-Ion Collider in the 2030s and pick up where HERA left off, taking higher-resolution snapshots that will enable the first 3D reconstructions of the proton. The EIC will also use spinning electrons to create detailed maps of the spins of the internal quarks and gluons, just as SLAC and HERA mapped out their momentums. This should help researchers to finally pin down the origin of the proton’s spin, and to address other fundamental questions about the baffling particle that makes up most of our everyday world.</p>

<p><em><strong>Correction:</strong> October 20, 2022</em><br>
<em>A previous version of the article erroneously implied that lower-momentum quarks live shorter lives than higher-momentum quarks in the quark sea. The text has been updated to clarify that all these quarks are lower-momentum and shorter-lived than those in the three quark-picture.</em></p>

<pre>Two security issues were identified in nginx HTTP/3 implementation,
which might allow an attacker that uses a specially crafted QUIC session
to cause a worker process crash (CVE-2024-24989, CVE-2024-24990) or
might have potential other impact (CVE-2024-24990).

The issues affect nginx compiled with the ngx_http_v3_module (not
compiled by default) if the "quic" option of the "listen" directive
is used in a configuration file.

The issue affects nginx 1.25.0 - 1.25.3.
The issue is fixed in nginx 1.25.4.

<pre>Hello!

As you probably know, F5 closed Moscow office in 2022, and I no
longer work for F5 since then.  Still, we’ve reached an agreement
that I will maintain my role in nginx development as a volunteer.
And for almost two years I was working on improving nginx and
making it better for everyone, for free.

Unfortunately, some new non-technical management at F5 recently
decided that they know better how to run open source projects.  In
particular, they decided to interfere with security policy nginx
uses for years, ignoring both the policy and developers’ position.

That’s quite understandable: they own the project, and can do
anything with it, including doing marketing-motivated actions,
ignoring developers position and community.  Still, this
contradicts our agreement.  And, more importantly, I no longer able
to control which changes are made in nginx within F5, and no longer
see nginx as a free and open source project developed and
maintained for the public good.

As such, starting from today, I will no longer participate in nginx
development as run by F5.  Instead, I’m starting an alternative
project, which is going to be run by developers, and not corporate
entities:

<a href="http://freenginx.org/">http://freenginx.org/</a>

The goal is to keep nginx development free from arbitrary corporate
actions.  Help and contributions are welcome.  Hope it will be
beneficial for everyone.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/13/dnssec_vulnerability_internet/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/13/dnssec_vulnerability_internet/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39372384">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A single packet can exhaust the processing capacity of a vulnerable DNS server, effectively disabling the machine, by exploiting a 20-plus-year-old design flaw in the DNSSEC specification.</p>
<p>That would make it trivial to take down a DNSSEC-validating DNS resolver that has yet to be patched, upsetting all the clients relying on that service and make it seem as though websites and apps were offline.</p>
<p>The academics who found this flaw – associated with the German National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity (ATHENE) in Darmstadt – claimed DNS server software makers briefed about the vulnerability described it as "the worst attack on DNS ever discovered."</p>

<p>Identified by Professor Haya Schulmann and Niklas Vogel of the Goethe University Frankfurt; Elias Heftrig of Fraunhofer SIT; and Professor Michael Waidner at the Technical University of Darmstadt and Fraunhofer SIT, the security hole has been named <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.presseportal.de/pm/173495/5713546">KeyTrap</a>, designated <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-50387">CVE-2023-50387</a>, and assigned a CVSS severity rating of 7.5 out of 10.</p>
<p>As of December 2023, approximately 31 percent of web clients worldwide used DNSSEC-validating DNS resolvers and, like other applications relying on those systems, would feel the effects of a KeyTrap attack: With those DNS servers taken out by the flaw, clients relying on them would be unable to resolve domain and host names to IP addresses to use, resulting in a loss of connectivity.</p>

    

<p>The researchers said lone DNS packets exploiting KeyTrap could stall public DNSSEC-validated DNS services, such as those provided by Google and Cloudflare, by making them do calculations that overtax server CPU cores.</p>

        


        

<p>This disruption of DNS could not only deny people's access to content but could also interfere with other systems, including spam defenses, cryptographic defenses (PKI), and inter-domain routing security (RPKI), the researchers assert.</p>
<p>"Exploitation of this attack would have severe consequences for any application using the Internet including unavailability of technologies such as web-browsing, e-mail, and instant messaging," they claimed. "With KeyTrap, an attacker could completely disable large parts of the worldwide internet."</p>

        

<p>A non-public technical paper on the vulnerability provided to <em>The Register</em>, titled, "The KeyTrap Denial-of-Service Algorithmic Complexity Attacks on DNS," describes how an assault would be carried out. It basically involves asking a vulnerable DNSSEC-validating DNS resolver to look up an address that causes the server to contact a malicious nameserver that sends a reply that causes the resolver to consume most or all of its own CPU resources.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>With KeyTrap, an attacker could completely disable large parts of the worldwide Internet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"To initiate the attacks our adversary causes the victim resolver to look up a record in its malicious domain," the due-to-be-published paper states. "The attacker’s nameserver responds to the DNS queries with a malicious record set (RRset), according to the specific attack vector and zone configuration."</p>
<p>The attack works, the paper explains, because <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2535/">the DNSSEC spec</a> follows <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/117/assts/postel">Postel’s Law</a>: "The nameservers should send all the available cryptographic material, and the resolvers should use any of the cryptographic material they receive until the validation is successful."</p>
<p>This requirement, to ensure availability, means DNSSEC-validating DNS resolvers can be forced to do a lot of work if presented with colliding key-tags and colliding keys that must be validated.</p>
<p>"Our complexity attacks are triggered by feeding the DNS resolvers with specially crafted DNSSEC records, which are constructed in a way that exploits validation vulnerabilities in cryptographic validation logic," the paper explains.</p>

        

<p>"When the DNS resolvers attempt to validate the DNSSEC records they receive from our nameserver, they get stalled. Our attacks are extremely stealthy, being able to stall resolvers between 170 seconds and 16 hours (depending on the resolver software) with a single DNS response packet."</p>

</ul>
<p>The ATHENE boffins said they worked with all relevant vendors and major public DNS providers to privately disclose the vulnerability so a coordinated patch release would be possible. The last patch was finished today.</p>
<p>"We are aware of this vulnerability and rolled out a fix in coordination with the reporting researchers," a Google spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>. "There is no evidence of exploitation and no action required by users at this time."</p>
<p>Network research lab NLnet Labs published <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/patch_CVE-2023-50387_CVE-2023-50868.diff">a patch</a> for its Unbound DNS software, addressing two vulnerabilities, one of which is KeyTrap. The other bug fixed, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/CVE-2023-50387_CVE-2023-50868.txt">CVE-2023-50868</a>, referred to as the NSEC3 vulnerability, also allows denial of service through CPU exhaustion.</p>
<p>"The KeyTrap vulnerability works by using a combination of keys (also colliding keys), signatures and number of RRSETs on a malicious zone," NLnet Labs <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/news/2024/Feb/13/unbound-1.19.1-released/">wrote</a>. "Answers from that zone can force a DNSSEC validator down a very CPU intensive and time costly validation path."</p>
<p>PowerDNS, meanwhile, has an update <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://doc.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2024-01.html">here</a> to thwart KeyTrap exploitation.</p>
<p>"An attacker can publish a zone that contains crafted DNSSEC related records. While validating results from queries to that zone using the RFC mandated algorithms, the Recursor’s resource usage can become so high that processing of other queries is impacted, resulting in a denial of service," the team wrote. "Note that any resolver following the RFCs can be impacted, this is not a problem of this particular implementation."</p>
<p>The fix for CVE-2023-50387 is just <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2024/q1/125">one of six</a> vulnerabilities addressed in Internet Systems Consortium's BIND 9 DNS software. The others include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-4408">CVE-2023-4408</a>: Parsing large DNS messages may cause excessive CPU load;</li>

<li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-5679">CVE-2023-5679</a>: Enabling both DNS64 and serve-stale may cause an assertion failure during recursive resolution;</li>

<li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-6516">CVE-2023-6516</a>: Specific recursive query patterns may lead to an out-of-memory condition;</li>

<li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-50868">CVE-2023-50868</a>: Preparing an NSEC3 closest encloser proof can exhaust CPU resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirements for the KeyTrap vulnerability date all the way back to 1999 from the now obsolete RFC 2535, according to the research team that identified it. And by 2012, these elements appeared in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6781/">RFC 6781</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6840/">RFC 6840</a>, the implementation requirements for DNSSEC validation.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>One packet suffices. You don't have to do more than that to disconnect an entire network</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since at least August 2000 – more than 23 years ago – KeyTrap has been present in the BIND 9 DNS resolver, and it surfaced seven years later in the Unbound DNS resolver.</p>
<p>Dr Haya Shulman, a professor of computer science and one of the academics behind the KeyTrap research, told <em>The Register</em> in a phone interview the attack is simple and can be carried out by encoding it in a <a href="https://dnsinstitute.com/documentation/dnssec-guide/ch04s02.html#signing-verify-zone-file">zone file</a>.</p>
<p>"The vulnerability is actually something that's recommended in the DNSSEC standard," Prof Shulman explained. "One packet suffices. You don't have to do more than that to disconnect an entire network."</p>
<p>Prof Shulman said the patches that have been issued by various vendors break the standard. "The problem is this attack is not easy to solve," she said. "If we launch it against a patched resolver, we still get 100 percent CPU usage but it can still respond."</p>
<p>The ATHENE team observed that while the flaw remained undetected for decades, its obscurity isn't surprising because DNSSEC validation requirements are so complicated. So too is mitigating the vulnerability and completely eliminating it will require a revision of the DNSSEC standard. ®</p>

I did the bare minimum of research beforehand - just talked to a couple of different installers about pricing, sizing and the economics of a battery.</p><p>One thing I certainly did <em>not</em> do is any research into brands and their relative hackability or security merits.
I just specified that I wanted to monitor the devices and see some metrics.
The installer told me that this required a smart meter and a mobile app.
Honestly I assumed that all brands would be equally horrific <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> junk, so I just went with the recommendation of the installer.
At least that way the <em>electrical</em> functionality had to be reasonable, right?</p><p>The result of my lucky dip was a <a href="https://www.goodwe.com.au/dns-g3-au">GoodWe DNS G3 Inverter</a> and a <a href="https://www.goodwe.com.au/single-phase-homekit">GoodWe HomeKit 1000 Smart Meter</a>.
These devices look quite slick, and so does the website.
They are also popular here in Australia, so my hopes were high that it would be easy to set up local monitoring, because surely someone else had figured out how to do it.</p><h2 id="post-install-setup"><a href="#post-install-setup">##</a>
Post-install setup</h2><h3 id="metrics-you-need-to-be-online"><a href="#metrics-you-need-to-be-online">###</a>
Metrics? You need to be online.</h3><p>Right after physical installation the system is producing power, but the metrics aren’t visible anywhere.
The documented way to see metrics is to connect the device to GoodWe’s cloud, and then use their web <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> or mobile app.</p><p>The devices act in simultaneous wireless <abbr title="Access Point">AP</abbr> and <abbr title="Station (client)">STA</abbr> modes, and setup works like so:</p><ol><li>Connect to the device’s <abbr title="Wireless Local Area Network">WLAN</abbr>, which will be named <code>Solar-WiFiXXXXXXXX</code>, where the <code>X</code>s are the serial number of the device. The password is, naturally, <code>admin</code>.</li><li>Visit the device’s web <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> on <code>10.10.100.253</code>.</li><li>Log in (using credentials <code>admin</code> / <code>admin</code>, of course!).</li><li>In the web <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>, select the <abbr title="Wireless Local Area Network">WLAN</abbr> that you want the device to use to connect to the Internet.</li></ol><p>Now the devices are connected to GoodWe’s cloud.
But you still can’t see any metrics.</p><h3 id="sems-portal-account-required"><a href="#sems-portal-account-required">###</a>
SEMS Portal account required</h3><p>The next step is to go to GoodWe’s <a href="https://www.semsportal.com/"><abbr title="Smart Energy Management System">SEMS</abbr> Portal</a> and create an account.
Then let the installer know that the devices are connected, and the email you used to create an account on the <abbr title="Smart Energy Management System">SEMS</abbr> Portal.
Then the installer will <em>email</em> GoodWe (!?) to tell them to assocate your account with the serial number of the devices, and at some point GoodWe will action that request (I was assured they checked their inbox regularly).</p><p>Finally after a day or so the device’s metrics are visible in the <abbr title="Smart Energy Management System">SEMS</abbr> Portal.</p><p><img src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/sems.png" alt="Screenshot of SEMS portal showing power usage over a day" title="" width="867" height="270"></p><p>According to <a href="https://en.goodwe.com/Ftp/EN/Downloads/Datasheet/GW_SEMS_Flyer-EN.pdf">this flyer</a>, it seems that the installer would have a portfolio of “power plants”, and they can use the <abbr title="Smart Energy Management System">SEMS</abbr> Portal to perform “Fault self-analysis &amp; troubleshooting”.</p><blockquote><p>SEMS includes a range of functions and features to ensure reliable operation and to deliver precise information to operators at the press of a button. It is accessible by multiple accounts with different levels of access for owners, installers and EPC companies</p></blockquote><h2 id="post-setup-state-of-play"><a href="#post-setup-state-of-play">##</a>
Post-setup state of play</h2><p>So now these two devices were physically installed, and connected to GoodWe’s cloud over the internet via my isolated <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> <abbr title="Virtual Local Area Network">VLAN</abbr>.
But I had questions:</p><ol><li>I wanted to scrape metrics locally, dammit! Why should I have to use the crappy cloud <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> or equally bad mobile app?</li><li>What else can GoodWe do with this connection? E.g. can they remotely administer the devices? If so, can I disable this “feature”?</li></ol><p>It turns out that the inverter is powered by the solar panels, not by the grid.
So it loses power and goes offline as soon as the sun goes down.
And since I mostly have time to hack on this stuff after dark, I concentrated on the smart meter.</p><p>There is quite a cottage industry online documenting how to extract data from GoodWe <em>inverters</em>.
They respond to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus">Modbus</a> queries, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_technology">Operational Technology</a> standard.
There are many Github repositories with useful information about the GoodWe Modbus protocol, such as:</p><ul><li>a <a href="https://github.com/marcelblijleven/goodwe">python library for extracting metrics</a>;</li><li>a <a href="https://github.com/mletenay/home-assistant-goodwe-inverter">Home Assistant integration</a>, built on that library; and</li><li>some <a href="https://github.com/tkubec/GoodWe/wiki">GoodWe-specific</a> <a href="https://github.com/MiG-41/Modbus-GoodWe-DT">field documentation</a>.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, my Homekit 1000 smart meter is not supported by any of these libraries.</p><h2 id="hacking-the-homekit-1000"><a href="#hacking-the-homekit-1000">##</a>
Hacking the Homekit 1000</h2><p>I’m presenting the process I followed in chronological order.
So if you want to find out what actually worked, skip to the end.</p><h3 id="nmap"><a href="#nmap">###</a>
nmap</h3><p>The first thing I did was fire up <code>nmap</code>, and point it at the <abbr title="Homekit 1000">HK1000</abbr>.
It showed listening <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr> port <code>23</code> - good old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet">Telnet</a>!
Connecting to this port and trying Username: <code>admin</code>, Password: <code>admin</code> gave me a command prompt!</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ nc 192.168.18.17 23

</code></pre><p>Poking around this prompt soon showed that it was pretty limited<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and it seemed to be a development interface that was left enabled.
I couldn’t get any metrics out of it.</p><p>I also ran <code>nmap</code> in aggressive mode and was rewarded with a hard crash in the web server, and the device resetting back to factory settings.</p><h3 id="packet-capture"><a href="#packet-capture">###</a>
Packet capture</h3><p>Sniffing the traffic from the device showed that it was connecting out to <code>tcp.goodwe-power.com:200001</code>, and sending packets at regular intervals.
However a quick look at the traffic revealed that while the serial number of my inverter was visible, the main body of the payload was a high-entropy blob.
So the metrics data I was after seemed to be encrypted.</p><p>I also found <a href="https://github.com/mletenay/home-assistant-goodwe-inverter/issues/3#issuecomment-1523697494">a Github comment</a> which came to the same conclusion.</p><h3 id="modbus"><a href="#modbus">###</a>
Modbus</h3><p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/jantenhove/GoodWeLogger/files/6024769/Goodwe_Modbus_PROTOCOL_Grid_English-ningzenkun20200527.1.pdf">GoodWe Modbus protocol</a> spec sheet and register map floating around the internet which was invaluable in understanding how GoodWe encodes metrics from their inverters.
From this documentation I built a Modbus scanner that simply queried every register.
The address is only 2 bytes wide, so there are ~65k possible addresses.</p><p>Unfortunately the <abbr title="Homekit 1000">HK1000</abbr> only returns a value for a single register address.
I forget which register it was, but it was something useless like Firmware Version.</p><h3 id="aa55-protocol"><a href="#aa55-protocol">###</a>
AA55 protocol</h3><p>GoodWe devices also support another (older?) protocol known as the AA55 protocol.
I couldn’t find much info about it except for <a href="https://yamasun.com.tw/upload/F_20170313191367UrC8jo.PDF">another old spec sheet</a>.</p><p>I built a scanner for this too, but the <abbr title="Homekit 1000">HK1000</abbr> didn’t respond to any queries.</p><h3 id="zz5a5a-protocol-mobile-app"><a href="#zz5a5a-protocol-mobile-app">###</a>
ZZ/5A5A protocol (mobile app)</h3><p>The <abbr title="Smart Energy Management System">SEMS</abbr> portal mobile app has an interesting function where you can connect to the <code>SOLAR-Wifixxxx</code> network, and configure the device using the app but <em>without</em> any authentication.</p><p>Sniffing this traffic (thanks to <a href="https://aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airodump-ng">airodump-ng</a> and <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/HowToDecrypt802.11">Wireshark’s WPA2 decrypt support</a>) shows that the device can be configured without authentication by sending plaintext <abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr> packets to the right port.
Of course, this port is listening on all interfaces so it also probably works via whichever local wifi network you connect the device to.
Gross.</p><p><img src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/zz-protocol.png" alt="Screenshot of UDP dump showing the ZZ protocol" title="" width="552" height="91"></p><p>However, this protocol appeared to <em>only</em> be used for network configuration.
I didn’t find any way of extracting data from the device using this protocol.</p><h3 id="firmware-reverse-engineering"><a href="#firmware-reverse-engineering">###</a>
Firmware Reverse Engineering</h3><p>After no success with the query protocols, I decided that maybe the network was the wrong approach and I should try firmware instead.
I managed to dump the firmware of the device using the command prompt and a command similar to this<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>echo -e <span>'admin\nadmin\nspi rd 0 2097152\n'</span> | nc 192.168.18.17 <span>23</span> | tee ~/download/hk1000.spi2.img
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This hexdump is interspersed with log lines, and the bytes are transposed.
So I dumped it twice, diffed the two dumps to eliminate the log lines, and fixed the transposition manually using vim.</p><p>Then I <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/binascii.html#binascii.unhexlify">unhexlified</a> the binary with <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/xxd/xxd.1.en.html">xxd</a>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>xxd -r -p hk1000.spi.img &gt; hk1000.spi.bin.img

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This revealed that the OS was <a href="https://www.ecoscentric.com/ecos/index.shtml">eCos RTOS</a> on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture">MIPS architecture</a>.
I spent some time trying to reverse this binary using <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a>, but honestly I just don’t know what I’m doing when it comes to binary reverse engineering.</p><p>Finally, while staring at the binwalk output, these lines caught my eye:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>1976456       0x1E2888        AES Inverse S-Box

Network “glitching”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></h3><p>It was at this point that I found what would be the key to cracking the encryption scheme.</p><p>Back in October 2021, someone else did basically all the same work I did, and presented it at the <a href="https://www.mlug-au.org/">Melbourne Linux User’s Group</a>.
Not only that, but they put their presentation <a href="https://www.mlug-au.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=20210726-goodwe.pdf">online</a>!
Thank you Danny!</p><p>Anyway, Danny made a very interesting observation: if the internet connection went down, the device would buffer messages, and send them all at once when the connection came back up.
Crucially, for buffered frames sent in the same second, the first few 16-byte blocks of ciphertext were identical!</p><p>I was able to replicate this locally!</p><h3 id="empathy-a-powerful-reverse-engineering-tool"><a href="#empathy-a-powerful-reverse-engineering-tool">###</a>
Empathy: a powerful reverse-engineering tool</h3><p>When I’m looking at a problem like this, I like to put myself in the shoes of the developer.
What kind of person are they?
What are their motivations?</p><p>In this case, we can observe:</p><ul><li>Telnet left on in a production firmware image, with credentials <code>admin:admin</code>.</li><li><code>nmap</code> can crash the device hard enough to factory reset.</li><li>Packets sent over <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr> with identifying data (serial number) in the clear.</li><li>The metrics seem to be poorly encrypted (identical section of ciphertext in consecutive frames).</li><li>Unauthenticated configuration protocol.</li><li>A web <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> that looks like it was hacked together in an afternoon. Inspecting the source shows lots of commented out HTML blocks.</li></ul><p>In Danny’s presentation, he used this slide after discovering the Telnet port password:</p><p><img src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/telnet-password.png" alt="Picard facepalm meme" title="" width="631" height="460"></p><p>However I think this is more appropriate:</p><p><video title="Michael Scott wow meme" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/michael-scott-wow.mp4" type="video/mp4">There should have been an animation here but your browser doesn't seem to
support it.</video></p><p>What these observations tell me is that GoodWe doesn’t put a great deal of effort into securing their devices, and therefore the developers working on this device didn’t have much incentive to create a secure protocol.
So there’s a chance I can hack around their encryption.</p><p>Putting myself into the shoes of these developers, what would I need to implement a metric protocol?</p><ul><li>Framing: this is <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>; it’s a byte stream. So we need a header of some kind to know where frames start.</li><li>Length: how many bytes after the header do we need to read to get the full frame?</li><li>Detecting data corruption: not anything malicious, just bitflips.</li></ul><p>Looking at the packet captures, it is easy to see <code>POSTGW</code> is the frame header, and the very next field looks like a big-endian encoded int32 with a value consistently three bytes shy of the length of the data before the next <code>POSTGW</code>.
That must be the length!</p><p>And finally: detecting data corruption.
In the GoodWe Modbus document linked above, there is a description of the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Check">CRC</abbr> used to detect data corruption.
It is a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#Polynomial_representations">Modbus CRC-16</a> (two bytes), designed to effectively detect bitflips.
Again, assuming I am a software developer who is familiar with Modbus but who has been tasked with sending data over the internet (and didn’t really care much for security), why wouldn’t I use an algorithm or library I am already familiar with?</p><p>A quick check proves that running the data between the length field and the last two bytes through the Modbus <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Check">CRC</abbr> algorithm returns a value matching the last two bytes of the frame.</p><figure><img src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/postgw.png" alt="Annotated hexdump of protocol frame showing the components"><figcaption><h4>An annotated frame, with length in red, device type and serial in green, timestamp in blue and purple, and encrypted blob in yellow.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>My best guess for the length field being <em>three</em> bytes shy of the length of data rather than two is that it is just a sloppy implementation with an off-by-one error, which matches my profile of the developers.</p><p>Another data point to paint a picture of the engineering quality: the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Check">CRC</abbr> of frames from the client are encoded in big-endian byte order (same as all the other integers encoded in the protocol).
However the <em>server</em> sends the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Check">CRC</abbr> in little-endian byte order.
Why?
Maybe the server is <code>x86</code> and the developer forgot to call <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/htonl.html"><code>htons()</code></a>?</p><p>Now I just had the encrypted blob to decipher.</p><h3 id="encryption-scheme"><a href="#encryption-scheme">###</a>
Encryption scheme</h3><p>I guessed that they must be using <abbr title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</abbr> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC)"><abbr title="Cipher Block Chaining">CBC</abbr></a> mode because:</p><ul><li>The identical section of ciphertext in consecutive frames is a <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/329.html">classic <abbr title="Cipher Block Chaining">CBC</abbr> failure mode</a> when reusing <abbr title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr>s.</li><li>This is an old mode and widely supported in libraries, making it easy to use.</li><li>Since they don’t care about security they are hardly likely to be using <abbr title="Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data">AEAD</abbr> modes.</li></ul><p>When implementing a scheme using <abbr title="Cipher Block Chaining">CBC</abbr>, it is critically important that initialization vectors are not reused.
Otherwise identical plaintext will give you identical ciphertext.
Metrics from a smart meter are highly likely to be the same minute-to-minute, which is probably why we see identical sections of ciphertext in successive frames with the same <abbr title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr>!</p><p>A common practice is to prefix the <abbr title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr> to the ciphertext.
This is known as an explicit initialization vector, and it doesn’t need to be secret - just randomly generated in a cryptographically secure manner.
However what if you are running on a microcontroller without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator"><abbr title="Non-deterministic Random Bit Generator">NRBG</abbr></a>? Or maybe you just don’t know or care about <abbr title="Cipher Block Chaining">CBC</abbr> footguns?
Then you have to use some other “unique-ish” value!</p><p>The device is designed to only send metrics every minute.
Therefore the developers may have assumed that time based <abbr title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr>s will be unique enough, without taking into account buffering on network outage.</p><h3 id="power-glitching"><a href="#power-glitching">###</a>
Power “glitching”</h3><p>The final and most difficult question: what is the encryption key?</p><p>The first thing I checked was what happened when the device rebooted: was there any key exchange or handshake?
Fortunately the web <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> has a reboot button, so it was easy to confirm that no, there is no key exchange on startup.</p><p>So because we are assuming <abbr title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</abbr> (symmetric encryption), that probably means… fixed keys!</p><p>Since the keys are fixed, they are likely hard-coded.
<abbr title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</abbr> can use 16, 24, or 32 byte keys, so I started by assuming a 16-byte key.
I suspected they’d use some string like <code>GoodWeSolarPower</code>, and store it as a static string or byte array.
I poked around in the firmware a bit with Ghidra, but didn’t find any promising strings.</p><p>But in any case, there was another problem.
One of the properties of <abbr title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</abbr>-<abbr title="Cipher Block Chaining">CBC</abbr> is that you can plug <em>any</em> <abbr title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr> and secret key into it and it will “decrypt”.
But unless the <abbr title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr> and key are correct, the output will be garbage.
So how to know if I manage to correctly guess the <abbr title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr> and key?</p><p>At this point I made another educated guess.
The frame header and length field use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII"><abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr></a> characters and leading null bytes respectively.
Assuming the plaintext metric data is similarly structured, it will have relatively low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">Shannon entropy</a>.
Another property of <abbr title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</abbr> is that it is a <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/1651">secure block cipher</a>.
That is, the ciphertext should be indistinguishable from random bytes.
Therefore, using the incorrect key or <abbr title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr> should result in <em>high entropy</em> garbage.</p><p>Assuming the timestamp in the frame (which is null-padded to 16 bytes) is the <abbr title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr>, I wrote a really dumb tool to:</p><ol><li>step through the firmware one byte at a time, taking the next 16 bytes as a key.</li><li>“decrypt” the encrypted blob using that key, and the timestamp prefix as the <abbr title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr>.</li><li>calculate the entropy of the decrypted blob. If it is below a given threshold, print the plaintext and key.</li></ol><p>Fortunately although this was a very naïve brute force algorithm, one great thing about 2024 is that computers are fast.</p><p>Running this tool over the firmware dump from my device only took a few seconds and yielded… nothing.
Huh.</p><p>Fortunately my previous googling efforts had discovered a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/110hBxoNVC4M9F_GK5sKP7uq_aDNxwstZ">public Google drive</a> with relatively recent updates (early 2023) containing firmware for (all?) GoodWe inverters<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
Running the tool over a firmware image for another device yielded… nothing again!</p><p>Finally on the third attempt, I got a single hit:</p><p><img src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/key.png" alt="Screenshot of the firmware scan tool showing plaintext, the key used for decryption, and an entropy calculation of 2.862" title="" width="818" height="280"></p><p>Of course!
The key was just all bits set.
Why not!?</p><p>I doubt this was actually hard-coded as a key anywhere in the binary blob.
I think I just got lucky that this firmware had a run of <code>0xff</code> bytes.</p><p>Finally I had a plaintext with obvious structure, but nothing mapping fields to metrics values.
However I did have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine#Oracles">oracle</a>: the <abbr title="Smart Energy Management System">SEMS</abbr> Portal API!
I was able to dump metric values for my smart meter using <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> on the <abbr title="Smart Energy Management System">SEMS</abbr> Portal API, and observe the metrics changing every time a packet was sent from the smart meter.</p><p>Then by eyeballing the packets and the values (assuming standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two’s complement</a> signed integer encoding) it was relatively straightforward, though a little time consuming, to map offsets to metrics values.</p><p>This wiring diagram was helpful to understand that there were really only two <abbr title="Current Transformer">CT</abbr> sensors and every other metric was calculated from those two numbers:</p><p><img src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/hk-wiring.png" alt="High-level Homekit 1000 wiring diagram" title="" width="924" height="358"></p><h2 id="prometheus--grafana"><a href="#prometheus--grafana">##</a>
Prometheus &amp; Grafana</h2><p>I like <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> for gathering metrics.
So I built an <a href="https://github.com/smlx/goodwe-exporters">exporter</a> based on the research described above.
It works by conducting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attack</a> on the protocol.
Pointing the <abbr title="Homekit 1000">HK1000</abbr> at the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address of the exporter when it requests <code>tcp.goodwe-power.com</code> will cause the <abbr title="Homekit 1000">HK1000</abbr> to connect to the exporter instead of the GoodWe cloud.
Then the exporter will sniff the metrics out of the frames and forward them to the real <code>tcp.goodwe-power.com</code>.</p><p>The nice thing about this design is that you still get metrics in <abbr title="Smart Energy Management System">SEMS</abbr> Portal.
These metrics are visible to your installer, so if you have problems it is easy for them to troubleshoot.
I also added support for my inverter, which uses approximately the same protocol.</p><p>In addition, the Prometheus exporter will reject any packets from the server that it doesn’t understand.
So <em>hopefully</em> unsolicited firmware updates will be blocked.</p><p>Finally, I created a <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20479-household-power/">dashboard</a> in <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>:</p><p><img src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/grafana.png" alt="Household Power Grafana dashboard, showing a summary of power usage over a single day" title="" width="1007" height="396"></p><h2 id="conclusions"><a href="#conclusions">##</a>
Conclusions</h2><ul><li>This exercise has reinforced my prejudice that <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> devices are horribly insecure. In the case of GoodWe, where they even <em>have</em> authentication, they use fixed default passwords such as <code>admin</code>, and leave Telnet debug interfaces listening on their production devices.</li><li>Although the metrics protocol and encryption scheme are insecure, I didn’t find anything that could really be described as a security vulnerability as opposed to a design decision.</li><li>Only the metrics were encrypted in the data sent to <abbr title="Smart Energy Management System">SEMS</abbr> Portal over the internet.
Not the model or serial number.
So even with (bad) encryption, they have left the most sensitive data unprotected.
I guess they are just obfuscating the metrics?
Or maybe the boss asked for encryption?
<a href="https://youtu.be/_k7U55anSW8?t=132">“He said encryption! Give him encryption!”</a>.</li><li>Conversely the <em>hardware</em> seems pretty good, functions well, and looks great!</li><li>I spent months tinkering on this on-and-off.
I was motivated by equal parts indignant anger at not being able to scrape metrics locally from a device so intimately integrated into <em>my</em> house and running on <em>my</em> network, and morbid curiosity about what security flaw I was going to uncover next.
Now I understand what jwz means when he talks about <a href="https://www.jwz.org/hacks/">writing software in self-defence</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="how-to-secure-goodwe-devices"><a href="#how-to-secure-goodwe-devices">##</a>
How to secure GoodWe devices</h2><p>Finally, here’s my advice if you have a GoodWe device:</p><ul><li>Whatever else you do, keep these things off the public internet!
Preferably in your private, firewalled <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> <abbr title="Virtual Local Area Network">VLAN</abbr>.</li><li>There doesn’t seem to be a simple way to disable the <code>Solar-Wifixxxx</code> <abbr title="Wireless Local Area Network">WLAN</abbr> after the devices are set up.

You can do this via the web <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>.</li><li>The web server is listening on all interfaces, so it is accessible from your <abbr title="Virtual Local Area Network">VLAN</abbr>.
Change the password for the web UI from <code>admin</code> to something a bit more secure.
Note: not all devices have this option easily accessible.
For example the <abbr title="Homekit 1000">HK1000</abbr> only allows changing this password via the Telnet interface.</li></ul><p>For the paranoid:</p><ul><li>My prometheus exporter drops incoming packets it doesn’t recognize.

Miscellaneous notes</h2><p>This section contains a few notes I made that didn’t fit into the narrative of the blog post, but are interesting nonetheless.</p><h3 id="goodwes-cyber-security-claims"><a href="#goodwes-cyber-security-claims">###</a>
GoodWe’s Cyber Security claims</h3><p>GoodWe has a page on Cyber Security on their website with a nice infographic, basically confirming everything I have just discovered:</p><blockquote><p>In order to prevent cyber-attacks on photovoltaic systems to the greatest extent, inverter manufacturers usually deploy various security policies on the equipment side and server side. Taking GoodWe as an example, to ensure the security of data transmission between the inverter and the server, we use the transmission protocols of CRC+AES and TLS respectively for communication with servers with different functions.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/goodwe-cyber.png" alt="Infographic diagram of an inverter and a laptop connecting to the cloud. The inverter connection has a lock icon and is labelled AES 128. The laptop connection also has a lock icon and is labelled HTTPS." title="" width="909" height="548"></p><p>This is a great demonstration of how you can use secure cryptographic primitives such as <abbr title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</abbr>-<abbr title="Cipher Block Chaining">CBC</abbr>, and still come up with an insecure encryption scheme.</p><h3 id="hi-flying-and-xinwu"><a href="#hi-flying-and-xinwu">###</a>
Hi-Flying and Xinwu</h3><p>The GoodWe devices seem to use an <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> platform common to several Chinese manufacturers, for example <a href="https://github.com/StephanJoubert/home_assistant_solarman/blob/03470164fcad6b57d528f8c5b72dbc5603b0b2df/custom_components/solarman/scanner.py#L12">Solarman</a>.
It has a unique discovery protocol where you broadcast a special packet to a given port, and the device replies with its <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>, <abbr title="Medium Access Control">MAC</abbr>, and <abbr title="Service Set IDentifier">SSID</abbr> (which includes the device serial).</p><p>For example (in separate terminals):</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>nc -u -l -p <span>50123</span>
</span></span><span><span>192.168.18.17,907856FECDAB,Solar-WiFi12345678
</span></span></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>echo -n WIFIKIT-214028-READ | nc -u -b -p <span>50123</span> 192.168.18.255 <span>48899</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>According to the config dumped from the Telnet command prompt, the chip in the <abbr title="Homekit 1000">HK1000</abbr> is the <a href="http://www.hi-flying.com/hf-a21">HF-A21</a>, from a company called Hi-Flying, <a href="http://www.hi-flying.com/index.php?route=information/contact">based in Shanghai</a>.
You can build your <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> device on top of this platform by loading your own application onto it, while the included <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> takes care of the hardware, network etc.</p><p>An interesting part of the discovery protocol is the string <code>214028</code>.
Where does this come from?
Well approximately 150km from the Hi-Flying office is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinwu,_Wuxi">Xinwu district, Wuxi</a>.
According to Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p>In 2013, the output value of Internet of Things (IoT) core industry in Wuxi New District exceeded 70 billion yuan, accounting for 38.4 percent of the output value of the whole high-tech industry in the district. Wuxi New District has formed a cloud computing industrial distribution, featuring hardware, platform and application.</p></blockquote><p>Xinwu’s postcode is 214028.</p><h3 id="remote-administration"><a href="#remote-administration">###</a>
Remote administration</h3><p>According to market researchers, GoodWe was the <a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/top-10-solar-pv-inverter-vendors-account-for-86-of-global-market-share/">fifth largest supplier of solar inverters worldwide in 2022</a>.
GoodWe have full remote administration capability on the devices, including the capability to <a href="https://www.4x4community.co.za/forum/showthread.php/329200-Goodwe-Remote-firmware-update">push firmware updates</a>.
This seems like a lot of power for any company, let alone a company headquartered in a totalitarian dictatorship, to have over national power grids.</p><h3 id="batman-mode"><a href="#batman-mode">###</a>
Batman mode</h3><p><del>To validate the <abbr title="Man-In-The-Middle">MITM</abbr> functionality</del> For fun, I implemented Batman mode in the prometheus exporter.
In this mode, rather than forwarding metrics to the <abbr title="Smart Energy Management System">SEMS</abbr> Portal, the exporter replaces them with the <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/54506">batman equation</a>.</p><p><img src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/batman.png" alt="Screenshot of SEMS Portal showing batman logo plotted on the power graph" title="" width="648" height="766"></p><h3 id="dns-updates"><a href="#dns-updates">###</a>
DNS updates</h3><p>The GoodWe devices send their metrics to <code>tcp.goodwe-power.com:200001</code>.
When I first started investigating the protocol in mid 2023, this resolved to an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address in Alibaba Cloud.
However late last year this was updated to now resolve to a pair of <abbr title="Elastic Load Balancer">ELB</abbr>s in <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr>.</p><p><img src="https://smlx.dev/posts/goodwe-sems-protocol-teardown/dns.goodwe-power.png" alt="Screenshot of SecurityTrails showing the historical DNS records for tcp.goodwe-power.com" title="" width="992" height="318">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"> <header><p>14 Feb 2024</p></header><p>For years, the M1 has only supported OpenGL 4.1. That changes today – with our release of full OpenGL® 4.6 and OpenGL® ES 3.2! <a href="https://fedora-asahi-remix.org/">Install Fedora</a> for the latest M1/M2-series drivers.</p> <p>Already installed? Just <code>dnf upgrade --refresh</code>.</p> <p>Unlike the vendor’s non-conformant 4.1 drivers, our <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/asahi/mesa">open source</a> Linux drivers are <strong>conformant</strong> to the latest OpenGL versions, finally promising broad compatibility with modern OpenGL workloads, like <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, <a href="https://ryujinx.org/">Ryujinx</a>, and <a href="https://citra-emu.org/">Citra</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/Blender-Wanderer-high.avif"><img title="Screenshot of Blender running on Apple M1 on Fedora Linux 39. The scene is 'Wanderer', depicting a humanoid in a space suit on a rocky terrain, beside a rover with solar panels." src="https://rosenzweig.io/Blender-Wanderer.avif" width="1465" height="993"></a></p> <p>Conformant 4.6/3.2 drivers must pass over 100,000 tests to ensure correctness. The official list of conformant drivers now includes <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengl#submission_347">our OpenGL 4.6</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_1045">ES 3.2</a>.</p> <p>While the vendor doesn’t yet support graphics standards like modern OpenGL, we do. For this Valentine’s Day, we want to profess our love for interoperable open standards. We want to free users and developers from lock-in, enabling applications to run anywhere the heart wants without special ports. For that, we need standards conformance. Six months ago, we became the <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/first-conformant-m1-gpu-driver.html">first conformant driver for any standard graphics API for the M1</a> with the release of OpenGL ES 3.1 drivers. Today, we’ve finished OpenGL with the full 4.6… and we’re well on the road to Vulkan.</p> <hr> <p>Compared to 4.1, OpenGL 4.6 adds dozens of required features, including:</p> <ul> <li>Robustness</li> <li>SPIR-V</li> <li><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-6.html">Clip control</a></li> <li>Cull distance</li> <li><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/first-conformant-m1-gpu-driver.html">Compute shaders</a></li> <li>Upgraded transform feedback</li> </ul> <p>Regrettably, the M1 doesn’t map well to any graphics standard newer than OpenGL ES 3.1. While Vulkan makes some of these features optional, the missing features are required to layer DirectX and OpenGL on top. No existing solution on M1 gets past the OpenGL 4.1 feature set.</p> <p>How do we break the 4.1 barrier? Without hardware support, new features need new tricks. Geometry shaders, tessellation, and transform feedback become compute shaders. Cull distance becomes a transformed interpolated value. Clip control becomes a vertex shader epilogue. The list goes on.</p> <p>For a taste of the challenges we overcame, let’s look at <strong>robustness</strong>.</p> <p>Built for gaming, GPUs traditionally prioritize raw performance over safety. Invalid application code, like a shader that reads a buffer out-of-bounds, can trigger undefined behaviour. Drivers exploit that to maximize performance.</p> <p>For applications like web browsers, that trade-off is undesirable. Browsers handle untrusted shaders, which they must sanitize to ensure stability and security. Clicking a malicious link should not crash the browser. While some sanitization is necessary as graphics APIs are not security barriers, reducing undefined behaviour in the API can assist “defence in depth”.</p> <p>“Robustness” features can help. Without robustness, out-of-bounds buffer access in a shader can crash. With robustness, the application can opt for defined out-of-bounds behaviour, trading some performance for less attack surface.</p> <p>All modern cross-vendor APIs include robustness. Many games even (accidentally?) rely on robustness. Strangely, the vendor’s proprietary API omits buffer robustness. We must do better for conformance, correctness, and compatibility.</p> <p>Let’s first define the problem. Different APIs have different definitions of what an out-of-bounds load returns when robustness is enabled:</p> <ul> <li>Zero (Direct3D, Vulkan with <code>robustBufferAccess2</code>)</li> <li>Either zero or some data in the buffer (OpenGL, Vulkan with <code>robustBufferAccess</code>)</li> <li>Arbitrary values, but can’t crash (OpenGL ES)</li> </ul> <p>OpenGL uses the second definition: return zero or data from the buffer. One approach is to return the <em>last</em> element of the buffer for out-of-bounds access. Given the buffer size, we can calculate the last index. Now consider the <em>minimum</em> of the index being accessed and the last index. That equals the index being accessed if it is valid, and some other valid index otherwise. Loading the minimum index is safe and gives a spec-compliant result.</p> <p>As an example, a uniform buffer load without robustness might look like:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>load</span>.i32 result, buffer, index</span></code></pre></div> <p>Robustness adds a single unsigned minimum (<code>umin</code>) instruction:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>umin</span> idx, index, last</span>
<span><span>load</span>.i32 result, buffer, idx</span></code></pre></div> <p>Is the robust version slower? It can be. The difference should be small percentage-wise, as arithmetic is faster than memory. With thousands of threads running in parallel, the arithmetic cost may even be hidden by the load’s latency.</p> <p>There’s another trick that speeds up robust uniform buffers. Like other GPUs, the M1 supports “preambles”. The idea is simple: instead of calculating the same value in every thread, it’s faster to calculate once and reuse the result. The compiler identifies eligible calculations and moves them to a preamble executed before the main shader. These redundancies are common, so preambles provide a nice speed-up.</p> <p>We usually move uniform buffer loads to the preamble when every thread loads the same index. Since the size of a uniform buffer is fixed, extra robustness arithmetic is <em>also</em> moved to the preamble. The robustness is “free” for the main shader. For robust storage buffers, the clamping might move to the preamble even if the load or store cannot.</p> <p>Armed with robust uniform and storage buffers, let’s consider robust “vertex buffers”. In graphics APIs, the application can set vertex buffers with a base GPU address and a chosen layout of “attributes” within each buffer. Each attribute has an offset and a format, and the buffer has a “stride” indicating the number of bytes per vertex. The vertex shader can then read attributes, implicitly indexing by the vertex. To do so, the shader loads the address:</p> <p><img alt="Base plus stride times vertex plus offset" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'

Other hardware has bounds-checked buffers to accelerate robust software vertex fetch. Unfortunately, the M1 has neither. We need to implement vertex fetch with raw memory loads.</p> <p>One instruction set feature helps. In addition to a 64-bit base address, the M1 GPU’s memory loads also take an offset in <em>elements</em>. The hardware shifts the offset and adds to the 64-bit base to determine the address to fetch. Additionally, the M1 has a combined integer multiply-add instruction <code>imad</code>. Together, these features let us implement vertex loads in two instructions. For example, a 32-bit attribute load looks like:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>imad</span> idx, stride/<span>4</span>, vertex, offset/<span>4</span></span>
<span><span>load</span>.i32 result, base, idx</span></code></pre></div> <p>The hardware load can perform an additional small shift. Suppose our attribute is a vector of 4 32-bit values, densely packed into a buffer with no offset. We can load that attribute in one instruction:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>load</span>.v4i32 result, base, vertex <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>2</span></span></code></pre></div> <p>…with the hardware calculating the address:</p> <p><img alt="Base plus 4 times vertex left shifted 2, which equals Base plus 16 times vertex" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'

implement robustness with a clamp, like we did for uniform buffers. The problem is that the vertex buffer size is given in bytes, while our optimized load takes an index in “vertices”. A single vertex buffer can contain multiple attributes with different formats and offsets, so we can’t convert the size in bytes to a size in “vertices”.</p> <p>Let’s handle the latter problem. We can rewrite the addressing equation as:</p> <p><img alt="Base plus offset, which is the attribute base, plus stride times vertex" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'

attribute and no offset. This gives an alternate perspective on the same data layout. Is this an improvement? It avoids an addition in the shader, at the cost of passing more data – addresses are 64-bit while attribute offsets are <a href="https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/listreports.php?limit=maxVertexInputAttributeOffset&amp;value=4294967295&amp;platform=all0">16-bit</a>. More importantly, it lets us translate the vertex buffer size in bytes into a size in “vertices” for <em>each</em> vertex attribute. Instead of clamping the offset, we clamp the vertex index. We still make full use of the hardware addressing modes, now with robustness:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>umin</span> idx, vertex, last valid</span>
<span><span>load</span>.v4i32 result, base, idx <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>2</span></span></code></pre></div> <p>We need to calculate the last valid vertex index ahead-of-time for each attribute. Each attribute has a format with a particular size. Manipulating the addressing equation, we can calculate the last <em>byte</em> accessed in the buffer (plus 1) relative to the base:</p> <p><img alt="Offset plus stride times vertex plus format"

side and passes it into the shader.</p> <p>One last problem: what if a buffer is too small to load <em>anything</em>? Clamping won’t save us – the code would clamp to a negative index. In that case, the attribute is entirely invalid, so we swap the application’s buffer for a small buffer of zeroes. Since we gave each attribute its own base address, this determination is per-attribute. Then clamping the index to zero correctly loads zeroes.</p> <p>Putting it together, a little driver math gives us robust buffers at the cost of one <code>umin</code> instruction.</p> <hr> <p>In addition to buffer robustness, we need image robustness. Like its buffer counterpart, image robustness requires that out-of-bounds image loads return zero. That formalizes a guarantee that reasonable hardware already makes.</p> <p>…But it would be no fun if our hardware was reasonable.</p> <p>Running the conformance tests for image robustness, there is a single test failure affecting “mipmapping”.</p> <p>For background, mipmapped images contain multiple “levels of detail”. The base level is the original image; each successive level is the previous level downscaled. When rendering, the hardware selects the level closest to matching the on-screen size, improving efficiency and visual quality.</p> <p>With robustness, the specifications all agree that image loads return…</p> <ul> <li>Zero if the X- or Y-coordinate is out-of-bounds</li> <li>Zero if the level is out-of-bounds</li> </ul> <p>Meanwhile, image loads on the M1 GPU return…</p> <ul> <li>Zero if the X- or Y-coordinate is out-of-bounds</li> <li>Values from the last level if the level is out-of-bounds</li> </ul> <p>Uh-oh. Rather than returning zero for out-of-bounds levels, the hardware clamps the level and returns nonzero values. It’s a mystery why. The vendor does not document their hardware publicly, forcing us to rely on reverse engineering to build drivers. Without documentation, we don’t know if this behaviour is intentional or a hardware bug. Either way, we need a workaround to pass conformance.</p> <p>The obvious workaround is to never load from an invalid level:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span>level <span>&lt;=</span> levels<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span>    <span>return</span> <span>imageLoad</span><span>(</span>x, y, level<span>);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span>    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div> <p>That involves branching, which is inefficient. Loading an out-of-bounds level doesn’t crash, so we can speculatively load and then use a compare-and-select operation instead of branching:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>vec4</span> data <span>=</span> <span>imageLoad</span><span>(</span>x, y, level<span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>return</span> <span>(</span>level <span>&lt;=</span> levels<span>)</span> <span>?</span> data <span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div> <p>This workaround is okay, but it could be improved. While the M1 GPU has combined compare-and-select instructions, the instruction set is <em>scalar</em>. Each thread processes one value at a time, not a vector of multiple values. However, image loads return a vector of four components (red, green, blue, alpha). While the pseudo-code looks efficient, the resulting assembly is not:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>image_load</span> R, x, y, level</span>
<span><span>ulesel</span> R[<span>0</span>], level, levels, R[<span>0</span>], <span>0</span></span>
<span><span>ulesel</span> R[<span>1</span>], level, levels, R[<span>1</span>], <span>0</span></span>
<span><span>ulesel</span> R[<span>2</span>], level, levels, R[<span>2</span>], <span>0</span></span>
<span><span>ulesel</span> R[<span>3</span>], level, levels, R[<span>3</span>], <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div> <p>Fortunately, the vendor driver has a trick. We know the hardware returns zero if either X or Y is out-of-bounds, so we can <em>force</em> a zero output by <em>setting</em> X or Y out-of-bounds. As the maximum image size is 16384 pixels wide, any X greater than 16384 is out-of-bounds. That justifies an alternate workaround:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>bool</span> valid <span>=</span> <span>(</span>level <span>&lt;=</span> levels<span>);</span></span>
<span><span>int</span> x_ <span>=</span> valid <span>?</span> x <span>:</span> <span>20000</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>return</span> <span>imageLoad</span><span>(</span>x_, y, level<span>);</span></span></code></pre></div> <p>Why is this better? We only change a single scalar, not a whole vector, compiling to compact scalar assembly:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>ulesel</span> x_, level, levels, x, <span>#</span><span>20000</span></span>
<span><span>image_load</span> R, x_, y, level</span></code></pre></div> <p>If we preload the constant to a uniform register, the workaround is a single instruction. That’s optimal – and it passes conformance.</p> <hr> <p><em>Blender <a href="https://download.blender.org/demo/eevee/wanderer/wanderer.blend">“Wanderer”</a> demo by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/dbystedt">Daniel Bystedt</a>, licensed CC BY-SA.</em></p> <p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/">Back to home</a></p> </div>]]></description>

            On Tuesday, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) said that to obtain a patent, a real person must have made a “significant contribution” to the invention and that only a human being can be named as an inventor on a patent.
    </p>

            The official guidance <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/13/2024-02623/inventorship-guidance-for-ai-assisted-inventions" target="_blank">published this week</a> provides a boost to innovators by reassuring them that their inventions involving AI can be patented, while continuing to enshrine human creativity and ingenuity by establishing basic expectations about how AI could make or break a patent application.

            The guidelines reflect the Biden administration’s swift moves to get ahead of artificial intelligence issues. In a sweeping <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">executive order</a> last fall, the White House had directed the USPTO to issue its inventorship guidelines by the end of February.

            Precisely what constitutes a “significant contribution” is a little bit fuzzy and case-specific, and much of how the guidelines work will necessarily be figured out in real-time as they are applied and, perhaps in some situations, debated in court.

            “The challenge will be in implementing the guidance,” said Jamie Nafziger, an attorney at the law firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney. “How sophisticated of a prompt will be required for a given invention? In connection with training an AI system, what level of planning will be required?&nbsp;Patent examiners will surely have some interesting challenges ahead.”

            Still, the overall picture the USPTO has painted is one where real people continue to sit at the center of the US patent system, in what experts describe as a logical extension of the status quo.

            The USPTO has <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ai-inventorship-guidance-mechanical.pdf" target="_blank">provided</a> some hypothetical <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ai-inventorship-guidance-chemical.pdf" target="_blank">examples</a> of ways that its guidelines could work. For instance, an inventor who simply asks an AI chatbot to design a critical part for a remote-control car would not be eligible for a patent on the car, because he or she didn’t make enough of a contribution to the car’s invention. It was the AI that did the hard part, not the human.

            “A natural person who only presents a problem to an AI system may not be a proper inventor” of something, the USPTO <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ai-inventorship-guidance-mechanical.pdf" target="_blank">said</a>. “However, a significant contribution could be shown by the way the person constructs the prompt in view of a specific problem to elicit a particular solution from the AI system.”

            If an inventor could show the work he or she did to get the AI chatbot to produce a specific design that enabled the remote-control car to function, then that could open the door to a patent, according to the USPTO.

            The USPTO guidance builds on existing case law. A federal appeals court already held last year, in a case known as <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/21-2347.OPINION.8-5-2022_1988142.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Thaler v. Vidal</em></a>,  that only actual people can be listed as inventors on US patents, effectively ruling out the possibility for AI to be named as an inventor or co-inventor.

            In that case, the USPTO had rejected the patent applications of an inventor who had given his AI system sole credit for the inventions.

            The&nbsp;inventorship guidelines will help everyone understand the boundaries of patent protections as AI is increasingly used in the inventive process. That may resolve some of the uncertainties that could otherwise slow the development and use of AI, said Randy McCarthy, an attorney at the law firm Hall Estill.

            It’s also consistent with how the US Copyright Office is approaching copyright protections in relation to AI, McCarthy added.

            “Some sort of human agency is required, or no protection is available,” he said. “A practical result is that, when creating a new design, artwork, invention, novel, or even computer code, a human can use an AI-based system to assist in the creation of this content, but must make sure that they are sufficiently involved in the process.”

            At the same time, the USPTO guidelines don’t require inventors to disclose the use of AI, and some worry it could encourage so-called patent trolls to apply for broad patents that don’t lead to any actual creations but serve as the&nbsp;foundation for bogus patent lawsuits.

            “The economy already is harmed by a surplus of low-quality patents which leads to unproductive litigation, rent-seeking and transfers of wealth from productive businesses to those who are experts at navigating the legal system,” said John Bergmayer, legal director at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.&nbsp;“My worry would be that AI-assisted “inventions” [where the involvement of AI might be concealed] or just AI-assisted patent applications supercharges this.”
