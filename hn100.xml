<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Cloudflare on Thursday celebrated a victory over Sable Networks, which the former described as a "patent troll."</p>
<p>That’s a term for an individual or organization that exists solely to makes patent infringement claims in the hope of winning a settlement from defendants concerned about costly patent litigation.</p>
<p>"Sable sued Cloudflare back in March 2021," wrote Emily Terrell and Patrick Nemeroff, respectively Cloudflare’s senior counsel for litigation and senior associate general counsel, in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/patent-troll-sable-pays-up/">write-up</a> Wednesday.</p>

    

<p>"Sable is a patent troll. It doesn’t make, develop, innovate, or sell anything. Sable IP is merely a shell entity formed to monetize (make money from) an ancient patent portfolio acquired by Sable Networks from Caspian Networks in 2006."</p>

        


        

<p>Patent trolls have vexed the technology industry for years, sometimes even drawing regulatory responses as happened over a decade ago when opportunistic litigants focused on patents pertinent to the emerging smartphone market. The Obama administration responded by issuing a set of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/04/fact-sheet-white-house-task-force-high-tech-patent-issues">executive actions</a> to curb abuses.</p>
<p>Lately, these patent profiteers have targeted the open source community. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation and Linux Foundation last month <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/18/open_source_orgs_strengthen_alliance/">strengthened ties</a> with United Patents, a company focused on defending against predatory patent claims.</p>

        

<p>Five other companies that we know of sued by Sable – Cisco, Fortinet, Check Point, SonicWall, and Juniper Networks – settled out of court. Splunk, meanwhile, fought back and managed last year to convince Sable <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/leadership/splunk-defeats-non-practicing-entities-in-three-patent-cases.html">to dismiss</a> its claim against the operation prior to its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/19/cisco_closes_splunk_acquisition/">takeover</a> by, funnily enough, Cisco.</p>
<p>Internet services giant Cloudflare has notched up an even greater victory. Facing an initial infringement lawsuit regarding around a hundred claims related to four patents, the corporation ended up having to deal with just a single patent violation claim.</p>

</ul>
<p>In February, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/12/cloudflare_patent_troll/">Cloudflare prevailed</a> when a Texas jury found it did not infringe Sable's "micro-flow label switching" <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7012919B1/en">patent</a>.</p>
<p>The biz both convinced the jury that it did not use the "micro-flow" technology described in the US patent 7,012,919 and that the patent was invalid because of prior art.</p>
<p>The existence of two earlier US patents, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6584071B1/en?oq=6584071">6,584,071</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6680933B1/en?oq=6680933">6,680,933</a> for router technology developed by Nortel Networks and Lucent in the 1990s convinced the jury that Sable's '919 patent should never have been granted.</p>

        

<p>The matter also saw Sable pledge not to pursue further actions of this sort.</p>
<p>"In the end, Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare $225,000, grant Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent portfolio, and to dedicate its patents to the public, ensuring that Sable can never again assert them against another company," said Terrell and Nemeroff.</p>
<p>The agreement means that Sable will tell the US Patent and Trademark Office that it is abandoning its patent rights and no further claims based on those patents will be possible.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> called Sable’s listed phone number, and it is no longer in service. The company's website is unresponsive and an attorney for the firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Terrell and Nemeroff said that prior art submissions for the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-rules/">Sable case</a> related to Project Jengo, a crowd-sourced patent invalidation initiative, will be accepted until November 2, 2024. At some point thereafter, Cloudflare, which has already given out $70,000 in awards for the case, will select final award winners.</p>
<p>"We're proud of our work fighting patent trolls and believe that the outcome in this case sends a strong message that Cloudflare will fight back against meritless patent cases and we will win," a spokesperson for Cloudflare told <em>The Register</em>. ®</p>

<div>
<div><p>My insight into corporate legal disputes is as meaningful as my opinion on Quantum Mechanics. What I do know is that, when given the chance this week to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/159-employees-are-leaving-automattic-as-ceos-fight-with-wp-engine-escalates/?zeldman">leave my job with half a year’s salary paid in advance</a>, I chose to stay at <a href="applenotes:note/e336c252-1a41-4523-9974-ddd94bfa772b?ownerIdentifier=_ab35500906b57133eafa73464d88463e">Automattic</a>.</p><p>Listen, I’m struggling with medical debts and financial obligations incurred by the closing of my conference and <a href="https://abookapart.com/">publishing</a> businesses. Six months’ salary in advance would have wiped the slate clean. From a fiduciary point of view, if nothing else, I had to at least consider <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment/">my CEO’s offer</a> to walk out the door with a big bag of dollars.</p><p>But even as I made myself think about what six months’ salary in a lump sum could do to help my family and calm my creditors, I knew in my soul there was no way I’d leave this company. Not by my own choice, anyway.</p><p>I respect the courage and conviction of my departed colleagues. I already miss them, and most only quit yesterday. I feel their departure as a personal loss, and my grief is real. The sadness is like a cold fog on a dark, wet night. </p><p>The next weeks will be challenging. My remaining coworkers and I will work twice as hard to cover temporary employee shortfalls and recruit new teammates, while also navigating the complex personal feelings these two weeks of sudden, surprising change have brought on. <em>Who needs the aggravation, right?</em> But I stayed.</p><p>I stayed because I believe in <a href="https://automattic.com/about/">the work we do</a>. I believe in the open web and owning your own content. I’ve devoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Zeldman">nearly three decades of work</a> to this cause, and when I chose to move in-house, I knew there was only one house that would suit me. In nearly six years at Automattic, I’ve been able to do work that mattered to me and helped others, and I know that the best is yet to come.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>I also know that the <a href="https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem">Maker-Taker problem</a> is an issue in open source, just as I know that a friend you buy lunch for every day, and who earns as much money as you do, is supposed to return the favor now and then. If a friend takes advantage, you’re supposed to say or do something about it. Addressing these imbalances is rarely pretty. Doing it in public takes its own kind of courage. Now it’s for the lawyers to sort out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 1, 1992, a man who’d been horribly beaten by the L.A. police called for calm in five heartfelt, memorable words: “Can’t we all get along?” We couldn’t then, and we aren’t, now, but my job at Automattic is about helping people, and that remains my focus at the conclusion of this strange and stressful week. I’m grateful that making the tough business decisions isn’t my responsibility. In that light, my decision to stay at Automattic was easy.</p>
<p>P.S. <a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us/">We’re hiring</a>.<br></p>

Generative AI makes it easier — and cheaper — for customers, employees, competitors, and regulators to take legal action, at the same time that a turbulent geopolitical environment increases legal exposure. Future legal risks will be legal fishing expeditions akin to internet “phishing” attacks: less personal, mass-produced actions initiated by many actors. When coordinated, they’ll be much more like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which involves overwhelming a target with a flood of traffic to knock it offline. To prepare for this new reality companies need to take a page out of cybersecurity readiness. Specifically, they’ll need to quickly take action to better understand their vulnerabilities, emerging threats and their potential impact, the risk-mitigation actions they want to take, and their communication strategies to internal and external stakeholders.</p></span></section><p data-first-paragraph="true">Last year, in order to enhance tax compliance, the U.S. Treasury Department proposed a rule designed to increase cryptocurrency disclosures.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>John didn’t start his career mad. </p><p>He trained as an emergency medicine doctor in a tidily run Midwestern emergency room about a decade ago. He loved the place, especially the way its management was so responsive to the doctors’ needs, offering extra staffing when things got busy and paid administrative time for teaching other trainees. Doctors provided most of the care, occasionally overseeing the work of <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24050901/nurse-practitioner-physician-assistant-doctor-health-care-quality">nurse practitioners and physician associates</a>. He signed on to start there full-time shortly after finishing his residency.</p><p>A month before his start date, a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/6/21024740/private-equity-taylor-swift-toys-r-us-elizabeth-warren">private equity firm</a> bought the practice. “I can’t even tell you how quickly it changed,” John says. The ratio of doctors to other clinicians flipped, shrinking doctor hours to a minimum as the firm moved to save on salaries.</p><p>John — who is being referred to by a pseudonym due to concerns over professional repercussions — quit and found a job at another emergency room in a different state. It too soon sold out to the same private equity firm. Then it happened again, and then again. Small emergency rooms “kept getting gobbled up by these gigantic corporations so fast,” he said. By the time doctors tried to jump ship to another ER, “they were already sold out.”</p><p>At all of the private equity-acquired ERs where John worked, things changed almost overnight: In addition to having their hours cut, doctors were docked pay if they didn’t evaluate new arrivals within 25 minutes of them walking through the door, leading to hasty orders for “kitchen sink” workups geared mostly toward productivity — not toward real cost-effectiveness or diagnostic precision. Amid all of this, cuts to their hours when ER volumes were low meant John and his colleagues’ pay was all over the place.</p><p>Patient care was suffering “from the toe sprains all the way up to the gunshot wounds and heart attacks,” says John. His experience wasn’t an anomaly — it was happening in emergency rooms across the country. “All of my colleagues were experiencing the same thing.”</p><div><p>“Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” </p></div><p>At times, the short staffing combined with the pressure to churn patients led to deadly shortcuts. John remembers rushing to evaluate one patient and missing his extensive history of alcohol abuse. The patient spent hours getting tests directed at the wrong diagnosis.</p><p>John could have put together a more appropriate plan if he’d had a few more minutes to sit down and get a better history, but by the time he realized what was going on, the patient was too severely ill. He died in the intensive care unit two days later.</p><p>“Is that 100 percent because of that staffing? Probably not,” says John. “But if I wasn’t so stressed about jumping into that patient room, making sure my door-to-provider time was less than 25 minutes …” The hypothetical hangs in the air.</p><p>“Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” </p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of a giant round orange monster casting a dark shadow over an emergency medical center with medical equipment dangling from its teeth." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p><cite>Xinmei Liu for Vox</cite></p></div><p>The story of how private equity has been able to so thoroughly debilitate emergency care is one of the more dramatic examples of how corporate interests are corrosive to America’s health care system — and how powerless they leave individual consumers. Today, private equity continues to operate a shocking <a href="https://emworkforce.substack.com/p/state-of-the-us-emergency-medicine-677">quarter of ERs nationwide</a>, as of March 2024. </p><p>Still, there’s some hope: Academics, patient advocates, and doctors say you can make defensive moves to protect your finances and care before, during, and after you or a loved one visits an ER. </p><p>Understanding private equity’s transformation of America’s emergency rooms is the first step. </p><div><p id="how-private-equity-sunk-its-claws-into-emergency-care"><h2>How private equity sunk its claws into emergency care </h2></p></div><p>Modern private equity got its start in the early 1980s, when a free-market acolyte — and former member of the Nixon administration — completed the first major “<a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/private-equity-is-out-of-control-and-looting-america-this-prosecutor-says-we-can-fix-it">leveraged buyout</a>.” Using mostly borrowed money, William Simon and his partner bought a greeting card company, extracted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/business/reaping-the-big-profits-from-a-fat-cat.html">huge fees</a>, and then sold it for a massive profit less than two years later. </p><p>Over the next few decades, what was then called the leveraged buyout industry moved into other sectors. Firms flipped businesses to yield spectacular profits, often cutting corners on the products and services they offered, eliminating jobs, and reducing employee benefits. </p><p>It was only a matter of time until the industry, now rebranded as private equity, turned its gaze on the US’s $4 trillion health care sector, which was already becoming <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/nov/private-equity-role-health-care#:~:text=Given%20its%20short%2Dterm%20financial,reduce%20costs%2C%20thus%20improving%20value.">increasingly commercialized</a> as nonprofit health systems consolidated, paid their executives <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/2/24/23610762/hospital-ceo-nurses-salary-study-north-carolina">ever more extravagant salaries</a>, and otherwise played business hardball. Private equity takeovers in health care <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5673a288-f55b-4cfd-aa76-0ebb30b029a6">started around 2000</a> and have steadily increased since; when several big banks crumbled in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, private equity’s growth only accelerated. </p><p>Emergency medicine wasn’t always an appealing target for private equity. Physician staffing in many emergency rooms around the country was traditionally handled by <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/welcome-to-the-emergency-room-a-wall-street-honcho-will-decide-your-treatment">co-op-like groups, run by working doctors</a>, that contracted with hospitals. In the 1990s, <a href="https://substack.perfectunion.us/p/what-happens-when-private-equity">ex-physicians and businesspeople</a> began taking ownership of these so-called contract management groups (CMGs). As they did, they started acting more like for-profit businesses, centralizing decision-making and earnings. </p><p>The easier it was to make decisions that prioritized profits, the more money CMGs made — and the more attractive they became to private equity. </p><p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/1/1/qxad008/7203733?login=false">Through the mid- to late-2010s</a>, private equity firms swallowed up a shocking number of American emergency rooms, leaving in their wake a generationally hollowed-out system for providing emergency care to people across the country. Private equity firms and other corporate interests owned nearly 9 percent of ER doctor groups in 2009; by 2019, they owned <a href="https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/1/1/qxad008/7203733?login=false">22 percent</a>. The wave of takeovers and consolidations peaked in 2021 but carries on all over the US, especially in Florida, Texas, and other <a href="https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/1/1/qxad008/7203733?login=false">parts of the South and West where the firms have been most aggressive</a>. </p><p>Doctors trying to practice medicine the way they’d been trained to — with a priority on patient care, not profits — found they couldn’t outrun the monster. Private equity’s dominance persisted even after the federal <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-keyprotections.pdf">No Surprises Act</a>, enacted in 2022, made many of their most profitable practices illegal.</p><p>Lots of for-profit models are a bad fit for health care, but of all of them, private equity is perhaps the worst, says <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/about-us/meet-the-team/">Eileen O’Grady</a>, director of programs at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group: “It basically takes the for-profit model and makes it so much more extractive and so much more harmful and risky.”</p><div><p id="private-equity-puts-profit-above-all-else"><h2>Private equity puts profit above all else </h2></p></div><p>To understand what makes private equity such a malignant force in health care, you have to understand its uniquely craven and purposefully opaque corporate structure. </p><p>Imagine you own a lemonade stand, and you want it to make more money. You have a few options: You can plow all your profits back into the business until it grows — what business school types call organic growth. Alternatively, you can get a bank loan. If you’re really ambitious, you can sell shares of your lemonade stand to the general public by promising them a good return on their investment. </p><p>There’s another option here, one that will make you richer quicker: You can sell all or most of the stand to the rich kid at the end of the street. He’s offering you a lot of money for it — more than you’d get over the short term from the other options. That’s because he’s taken out a huge loan to pay for the deal.</p><p>But there are a couple of catches: First, if he runs into financial trouble (which he very well might, since he’s been buying up lemonade stands all over town), he’ll sell it off for parts, leaving the neighborhood lemonade-less. This will cost him nothing personally because he used the lemonade stand as collateral for that big loan.</p><p>The second and perhaps more important catch is that this kid is buying your lemonade stand in order to sell it. He doesn’t care about lemonade or the people who like it. His strategy is to make the stand’s balance sheet look so attractive that a few years later, another investor will buy it at a premium — or if that fails, then yes, to sell it off for parts. A year down the road, odds are high your precious lemonade stand will be a sad shadow of what it once was, or it might not exist at all. </p><p>That kid is private equity.</p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot3_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of an elderly patient in a hospital bed looking on as two doctors race in opposite directions past his room.

It’s not just lemonade. People’s lives are at stake.</p></div><p>The way private equity gets into emergency care is by buying out the CMGs that manage physician staffing — that is to say, the firms only buy the clinicians themselves. </p><p>It’s a different model than when private equity invests in other areas of health care. When firms buy hospitals, nursing homes, medical practices, rehabilitation facilities, and group homes, they acquire not only staff, but also buildings, land, and medical equipment.</p><p>In the case of emergency care, “private equity doesn’t pay the hospital rent, they don’t hire the nurses, they don’t pay the electric bills, they don’t provide any of the equipment,” says <a href="https://medicine.temple.edu/robert-mcnamara">Robert McNamara</a>, chair of the emergency medicine department at Temple University in Philadelphia. The hospital still handles those finances. “They’re just working the labor force. … The highest-cost thing on their expense side is the board-certified emergency physician.” </p><p>When emergency rooms first caught the eye of private equity firms, the prospective investors offered the physician owners of CMGs huge payouts. </p><p><a href="https://www.ivyclinicians.io/about">Leon Adelman</a>, an emergency medicine doctor who leads the staffing firm <a href="https://emworkforce.substack.com/p/state-of-the-us-emergency-medicine-677">Ivy Clinicians</a> and writes a workforce-focused <a href="https://emworkforce.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile">newsletter</a>, says the owners faced a tough choice: “‘Do I do what is ethical and feels right … and I get a nice going-away party and maybe a watch or something — or do I get $10 million?’”</p><p>“What they were buying was the ability to charge patients who were consuming a non-shoppable service,” Adelman says — one for which patients are unable to compare prices. If you’re having a heart attack, you’re not going to call around to hospitals to find out who is going to give you the best deal.</p><p>Hospitals that increasingly have profit on the brain often found private equity a more attractive partner than doctor-owned CMGs. The firms are flush with cash, which means they don’t look to the hospitals to shore up their finances. “They won’t ask you for a penny,” Adelman explains. “They’re making plenty of money.” </p><p>Once a private equity firm bought an emergency room, there were two levers it could pull to make a profit: It could maximize what it reaped from patients who’d received services, and it could cut what it spent paying the clinicians who provided those services.</p><p>Doing both at the same time has made emergency medicine practically unrecognizable.</p><div><p id="burned-out-doctors-screwed-over-patients"><h2>Burned-out doctors, screwed-over patients</h2></p></div><p>Under new private equity ownership, ERs adopted an assortment of unsavory practices. Firms not only pressured clinicians to see patients faster, as illustrated by John’s experience, but to recommend <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w23623">hospital admission</a> for more patients. They also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/upshot/the-company-behind-many-surprise-emergency-room-bills.html">dramatically raised the price tags</a> for a range of emergency services, resulting in back-breakingly large bills for patients nationwide, like ones charging <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/er-doctor-private-equity-in-medicine-is-dangerous-to-patients">thousands of dollars</a> for glue applied to a half-inch wound.</p><p>To avoid having to negotiate those astronomical bills with the expert hagglers at insurance companies, firms kept their ERs from participating in many insurance networks. It was easier to collect on a so-called balance bill — the portion of a medical bill not paid for by a patient’s insurer — if the care a patient had received wasn’t covered by their insurance at all. </p><p>In a study of two of the largest emergency medicine staffing firms in the US, health economist Zack Cooper found <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23623">costs to patients went up more than 80 percent</a> after a corporate interest took ownership. </p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot4_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of a doctor running in three different directions with timers floating above her head.

However, in recent years, the burnout rate has climbed to <a href="https://www.chiefhealthcareexecutive.com/view/nearly-half-of-doctors-report-burnout-but-there-is-some-progress-survey-finds">63 percent</a>, according to a 2024 Medscape survey, and the specialty is <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2023/03/21/ed-doctors#:~:text=According%20to%20Elizabeth%20Datner%2C%20chair,thousand%20cuts%2C%22%20she%20said.">losing popularity</a> among medical students.

Gary Peters (D-MI) <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/senate-questions-private-equity-hospital-emergency-departments-peters-rcna145909">initiated an investigation</a> into private equity’s effects on the quality of emergency care. </p><p>Private equity can only do what it does because so many other parts of American health care are so dysfunctional. “Just to be really clear, private equity is not the main harm of health care in the US,” says O’Grady. “I think it’s a symptom of a much bigger problem.”</p><p>In the US health care ecosystem, private equity is a bottom-feeder, an entity that can only exist because of the bad behavior and misaligned incentives of the bigger players in the marketplace. Private equity’s deep pockets, its willingness to extort patients, its heavy-handedness with telling doctors how to practice wouldn’t be possible — much less an advantage — in the absence of these larger upstream problems. </p><p>Maybe there wouldn’t be as many <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/private-equity-investment-as-a-divining-rod-for-market-failure-policy-responses-to-harmful-physician-practice-acquisitions/">opportunities for private equity to make money</a> in health care if hospital budgets were stable; if insurance companies didn’t play hardball with both providers and patients; if pharmaceutical industry players didn’t artificially and unevenly inflate drug prices; if elected officials weren’t so susceptible to powerful lobbies that block comprehensive, loophole-closing health care reform.</p><p>That’s not the world we live in, however; and because the American health care system is broken in these and so many other ways, private equity thrives within it, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/">often invisibly</a>. </p><div><p id="congress-tried-to-fix-the-problem-but-fell-short"><h2><strong>Congress tried to fix the problem — but fell short</strong></h2></p></div><p>In 2020, Congress threw a huge wrench in the private equity game plan when it passed the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-keyprotections.pdf">No Surprises Act</a>, aimed at saving patients from receiving shocking bills after getting emergency care. </p><p>When the law took effect in January 2022, it meant that patients who receive emergency care can’t get billed for out-of-network care, even if the care is from an out-of-network facility or doctor. (They do still have to pay whatever deductibles, copays, or coinsurance their insurance plan would require related to an in-network visit.) It also protects people from higher bills if they get routine, non-emergency care at an in-network facility from an out-of-network doctor without their knowledge or consent. </p><p>Billers — including private equity owners of emergency medicine practices — now have to ask insurance companies to pay the balance of their out-of-network bills. It turns out it’s a lot harder to extract unreasonable fees from insurance companies than from individuals. </p><p>The act served as the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-physician-partners-files-for-bankruptcy-after-shutdown-5792e23c">death</a> (or <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-downgrades-team-health-holdings-inc-to-ccc-13-11-2023">near</a>-<a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/envision-healthcare-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy">death</a>) blow for several emergency medicine groups backed by private equity, which at their peak staffed nearly one-fifth of American emergency departments. That really only means some of these firms are now being run with oversight from courts and creditors, not that all of them are out of business: They’re largely still standing, and many have since only expanded their footprint in emergency care. </p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot2_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of a giant orange monster peeking in the window of an emergency room’s seating area.

Many people simply are <a href="https://gop-waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Spicer-Testimony.pdf">unaware when they’ve been incorrectly billed</a>. Clinicians and the facilities they work for occasionally don’t follow the legislation’s rules, or inappropriately ask patients to waive their protections. Insurance companies don’t automatically absolve patients of responsibility for a surprise out-of-network bill, and the appeals process is complicated and time-consuming. And there are loopholes: Out-of-network ambulances and urgent care facilities aren’t covered, and neither is the follow-up care people get after an emergency room visit.</p><p>The emergency medicine profession, meanwhile, will take a while to recover from private equity’s onslaught. John’s colleagues are the kinds of doctors who will drive a patient home if they don’t have a ride, he says. Many of the people who seek care in American emergency rooms live on the poorest and most marginalized fringes of society; emergency medicine doctors know this, and for some of them, it’s an important reason they chose the work.</p><p>“This is not about pay for us,” he says. “This is just about being fair and letting us practice how we want to practice.

And yet, that’s the health care system the US has. </p><p>It’s hard for people to tell when a private equity firm has taken over a local emergency room. It’s not like the firm slaps its logo on the side of the building. Patients usually don’t even know until they get a bill that an investment company had a hand in determining who saw them in the emergency room and what kind of workup they ordered, says McNamara<strong>.</strong> </p><p>Given that reality, anyone who may one day visit an emergency room in the middle of a crisis — that is to say, nearly everyone — should know how to protect themselves, says <a href="https://pirg.org/people/patricia-kelmar/">Patricia Kelmar</a>, who directs health care campaigns for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG).

Still, it’s worth making an advance plan for where you’ll go if you have the option.</p><p>Cooper, the health economist, says an emergency room’s ownership isn’t the only thing that matters in deciding whether to go there in an emergency. If a private equity-owned ER sees a higher patient volume than others and is affiliated with an academic institution, it may still be the best option.</p><p>Even with the No Surprises Act in place, care from in-network doctors at in-network hospitals is far less likely to result in unpleasant bills. So before you need an emergency room, check with your insurance company to see which ones are in network and nearest to you. Once you’re at an emergency room, Cooper suggests asking to see an in-network physician. </p><div><p id="make-a-plan-for-how-to-get-there"><h3><strong>Make a plan for how to get there</strong></h3></p></div><p>Ambulance transport is <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-unexpectedly-high-ambulance-bills-are-still-a-problem-in-the-u-s#:~:text=Every%20year%2C%20roughly%203%20million,transports%20are%20out%20of%20network">unlikely to be cost-free</a> for most Americans, so if you need to get to an emergency room and you’re in stable condition, it’s worth trying to get there in other ways. </p><p>Air ambulances are covered by the No Surprises Act, but ground ambulances are not, and are unfortunately often out-of-network for many people. The ones owned by private equity are especially <a href="https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/research/ground-ambulance-billing-and-prices-differ-by-ownership-structure/">likely to be wildly expensive</a>. Nevertheless, many states have laws to protect consumers from outrageous ambulance bills — but <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/emergency-the-high-cost-of-ambulance-surprise-bills/">only if their plan is state-regulated</a>, which means about 60 percent of insured people are still unprotected. You can figure out if yours is one of them by contacting your <a href="https://content.naic.org/state-insurance-departments">state’s insurance department</a>. </p><p>You can also work with your insurance company and the ambulance company to negotiate big bills; legal aid organizations can also provide assistance. </p><div><p id="understand-what-youre-signing"><h3><strong>Understand what you’re signing</strong></h3></p></div><p>Non-emergency hospital departments (for example, the ones that would take care of you if you had to stay in the hospital for more care after an ER visit) are allowed to ask you to sign away your No Surprises Act protections.

    </div><p>A new study details how a nasal spray formulated by investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital may work to protect against viral and bacterial respiratory infections. Based on their preclinical studies, the researchers say the broad-spectrum nasal spray is long-lasting, safe, and, if validated in humans, could play a key role in reducing respiratory diseases and safeguarding public health against new threats.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    <p>Their results are published in the journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202406348" target="_blank"><i>Advanced Materials</i></a>.</p>
<p>"The COVID pandemic showed us what <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/respiratory+pathogens/" rel="tag">respiratory pathogens</a> can do to humanity in a very short time. That threat hasn't gone away," said co-senior author Jeffrey Karp, Ph.D., distinguished chair in Anesthesiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital. "Not only do we have the flu to deal with seasonally, but we now have COVID, too."</p>
<p>Influenza and COVID-19 infections cause thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of cases of severe disease every year. Milder infections cause significant discomfort, resulting in missed work or school.</p>
<p>Vaccines against these viruses can be beneficial, but they're imperfect. Vaccinated people still get infected and spread the infection to others. Masks are also helpful but aren't perfect, either—they can leak, and many people wear them improperly or choose not to wear them at all.</p>
<p>"We need new, additional ways to protect ourselves and reduce the transmission of the disease," Karp said.</p>
<p>Most viruses enter our system through the nose. When we catch an airborne infection like the flu and COVID, we breathe out tiny droplets of fluids that contain the pathogen. Healthy people around us breathe in these pathogen-containing droplets, which attach inside their nose and infect the cells that line the nasal passageways.</p>

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>The pathogen replicates and can be released back into the air when an individual who is sick, whether they know it or not, sneezes, coughs, laughs, sings, or even just breathes.</p>
<p>The new study details the research team's efforts to create a nasal spray to defend against airborne respiratory illness.</p>
<p>"The spray, called Pathogen Capture and Neutralizing Spray (PCANS) in the paper, was developed using ingredients from the FDA's Inactive Ingredient Database (IID), which have been previously used in approved nasal sprays, or from the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) list of the FDA," said co-senior author Nitin Joshi, Ph.D., an Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital.</p>
<p>"We developed a drug-free formulation using these compounds to block germs in three ways—PCANS forms a gel-like matrix that traps respiratory droplets, immobilizes the germs, and effectively neutralizes them, preventing infection."</p>
<p>The researchers did the experiments detailed in the study under laboratory settings. They have not studied PCANS directly in humans. The researchers developed the formulation and studied its ability to capture respiratory droplets in a 3D-printed replica of a human nose. They showed that when sprayed in the nasal cavity replica, PCANS captured twice as many droplets as mucus alone.</p>
<p>"PCANS forms a gel, increasing its <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mechanical+strength/" rel="tag">mechanical strength</a> by a hundred times, forming a solid barrier," said primary author John Joseph, Ph.D., a former postdoctoral fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. "It blocked and neutralized almost 100% of all viruses and bacteria we tested, including Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV, adenovirus, K Pneumonia and more."</p>

                                                                                                                                            <p>Experiments in mice showed that a single dose of the PCANS nasal spray could effectively block infection from an influenza virus (PR8) at 25 times the lethal dose. Virus levels in the lungs were reduced by &gt;99.99%, and the <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+cells/" rel="tag">inflammatory cells</a> and cytokines in the lungs of PCANS-treated animals were normal.</p>
<p>"The formulation's ability to inactivate a broad spectrum of pathogens, including the deadly PR8 <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/influenza+virus/" rel="tag">influenza virus</a>, demonstrates its high effectiveness," said co-senior author Yohannes Tesfaigzi, Ph.D., AstraZeneca Professor of Medicine in the Field of Respiratory and Inflammatory Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital.</p>
<p>"In a rigorous mouse model study, prophylactic treatment with PCANS demonstrated exceptional efficacy, with treated mice exhibiting complete protection, while the untreated group showed no such benefit."</p>
<p>While the study's limitations include the lack of human studies of PCANS, it provides a strong foundation for future research to explore the full potential of PCANS in a broader context. The researchers are exploring whether PCANS can also block allergens, opening a potential new avenue for allergy relief.</p>

          <p>Any striking marketing claims in companies' ads about the gut benefits of a popular probiotic may be full of, well, the same thing that has their target audience backed up.</p>
<p>In a randomized controlled trial, the probiotic <em>Bifidobacterium animalis</em> subsp. <em>lactis</em>—used in many probiotic products, including Dannon's Activia yogurts—did nothing to improve bowel health in people with constipation, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2824333">data from a randomized triple-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial</a> published Wednesday in JAMA Network Open.</p>
<p>The study adds to a mixed and mostly unconvincing body of scientific literature on the bowel benefits of the bacterium, substrains of which are sometimes sold with faux scientific-sounding names in products. Dannon, for instance, previously marketed its substrain, DN-173 010, as "Bifidus regularis."</p>
<h2>Digested data</h2>
<p>For the new study, researchers in China recruited 228 middle-aged adults, 85 percent of whom were women. The participants, all from Shanghai, were considered healthy based on medical testing and records, except for reporting <a href="https://www.justintimemedicine.com/curriculum/1913">functional constipation</a>. This is a condition defined by having two or more signs of difficulty evacuating the bowels, such as frequent straining and having rock-like stool. For the study, the researchers included the additional criterion that participants have three or fewer complete, spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week.</p>
<p>The participants were randomized to take either a placebo (117 participants) or the probiotic (112 participants) every day for eight weeks. Both groups got packets of sweetened powder that participants added to a glass of water taken before breakfast each morning. In addition to a sweetener, the daily probiotic packets contained freeze-dried <em>Bifidobacterium animalis</em> subsp. <em>lactis</em> substrain HN019, which is used in some commercial probiotic products. The first dose had a concentration of 7 × 10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming units (CFUs), then participants shifted to a daily dose of 4.69 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFUs. Many probiotic products have doses of <em>B. lactis</em> in ranges from 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> to 17 × 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Throughout the eight-week study, participants kept a daily diary, recording any changes in CSBM frequency, which was the primary focus of the study. But the diary entries also captured use of "rescue" laxatives, stool consistency, degree of straining for each bowel movement, abdominal pain, and bloating. Researchers also collected data on the participants' diet and physical activity at clinical visits at the beginning and end of the study. Half of the participants also provided stool samples at these visits.</p>
<h2>Pro-placebo</h2>
<p>At the start of the study, the mean number of CSBMs per week in the probiotic group was 0.73, which rose to 1.58 at the end of the study. While that looked like an improvement, the benefit was flushed away with the finding that the placebo group saw a similar improvement, going from a mean of 0.81 to 1.5 in the study. There was no statistical difference in complete spontaneous bowel movements between the groups, and the researchers concluded the increases in both groups were a placebo effect. Likewise, when the researchers just looked at (incomplete) spontaneous bowel movements and non-spontaneous bowel movements, they also found no statistical differences between the groups.</p>
<p>For individual symptoms of constipation, the groups had no statistically significant difference in stool consistency or straining. Bloating and abdominal pain were low in both groups at the beginning of the study but increased slightly in the placebo group by the end of the study, leading to a slim difference in the two groups. Overall assessments of patient constipation symptoms and quality of life scores found no statistically significant differences between the groups.</p>
<p>Tests from the stool samples also failed to find any significant differences. There was little change during the trial and no significant group differences in the moisture content of stools, or levels of short-chain fatty acids and calprotectin, a marker for intestinal inflammation. Analyses of fecal microbiota composition found that the participants taking the probiotic had a spike in the probiotic strain HN019&nbsp;but otherwise revealed no significant changes in microbial composition or diversity over the course of the study or between groups.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<p>"While this could align with the observed lack of efficacy of HN019, it is also commonly observed that probiotics do not change the microbiota composition in healthy adults," the researchers noted in their conclusion.</p>
<h2>Fermented failures</h2>
<p>Overall, daily intake of the probiotic bacteria did not improve the participants' functional constipation—which may not be surprising if you've followed the history of Activia.</p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2010/12/dannon-agrees-drop-exaggerated-health-claims-activia-yogurt-danactive-dairy-drink">the Federal Trade Commission and 39 state attorneys general</a> announced a $21 million settlement with Dannon over, in part, the false claim that Activia could treat irregularity. In its marketing—memorable for including a television commercial with actor Jamie Lee Curtis—Dannon indicated that Activia's gut benefits were backed by data. But they were not. In the settlement, Dannon agreed to drop the unsupported health claims. The company also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/dannon-settles-lawsuit/story?id=9950269">paid $45 million to settle a class-action lawsuit</a> over the false advertising.</p>
<p>Dannon still sells Activia products, making the softer claim that they "help support gut health." For this claim, Dannon has <a href="https://www.activia.us.com/healthcare-professionals/probiotics-for-patients/">pointed to two studies on its <em>B. lactis </em>substrain</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19622191/">The first study, published in 2009</a>, included 197 women with minor digestive symptoms and found that those who consumed <em>two servings</em> of the company's probiotic yogurt each day for four weeks reported improvement in symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and gas. But, then the company repeated the same trial with a larger number of participants—324—and the benefit disappeared.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23480238/">The second study Dannon points to</a> is an analysis from 2013, which pooled the data from the small successful trial and the larger failed trial and reported an overall benefit. In that analysis, Dannon scientists report that the larger trial failed to show a benefit from the probiotic because the placebo group also reported improvement, a placebo effect echoed in the new JAMA Network Open study.</p>

<p>The Soviet space program used completely different controls and instruments from American spacecraft.
One of the most interesting navigation instruments onboard Soyuz spacecraft was the Globus, which used a rotating globe
to indicate the spacecraft's position above the Earth.
This navigation instrument was an electromechanical analog computer that used an elaborate system of gears, cams, and differentials
to compute the spacecraft's position.
Officially, the unit was called a "space navigation indicator" with the Russian acronym ИНК (INK),<span id="fnref:ink"><a href="#fn:ink">1</a></span>
but I'll use the more descriptive nickname "Globus".</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/globus.jpg"><img alt="The INK-2S &quot;Globus&quot; space navigation indicator.

Coincidentally, the latitude indicator matches the Ukrainian flag." width="600"></a></p><p>The INK-2S "Globus" space navigation indicator. Coincidentally, the latitude indicator matches the Ukrainian flag.</p>
<p>We recently received a Globus from a collector and opened it up for repair and reverse engineering. 
In this blog post, I explain how it operated, show its internal mechanisms, and describe what I've learned so far from
reverse engineering.
The photo below gives an idea of the mechanical complexity of this device, which also has a few relays, solenoids, and other electrical
components.</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of the Globus was to indicate the spacecraft's position. The globe rotated while fixed crosshairs on the
plastic dome 
indicated the spacecraft's position.
Thus, the globe matched the cosmonauts' view of the Earth, allowing them to confirm their location.
Latitude and longitude dials next to the globe provided a numerical indication of location.
Meanwhile, a light/shadow dial at the bottom showed when the spacecraft would be illuminated by the sun or in shadow,
important information for docking.
The Globus also had an orbit counter, indicating the number of orbits.</p>
<p>The Globus had a second mode, indicating where the spacecraft would land if they fired the retrorockets to
initiate a landing. Flipping a switch caused the globe to rotate until the landing position was under the crosshairs
and the cosmonauts could evaluate the suitability of this landing site.</p>
<p>The cosmonauts configured the Globus by turning knobs to set the spacecraft's initial position and orbital period.
From there, the Globus electromechanically tracked the orbit.
Unlike the Apollo Guidance Computer, the Globus did not receive navigational information from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) or other sources, so it did not know the spacecraft's real position.
It was purely a display of the predicted position.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/gears.jpg"><img alt="A close-up of the complex gear trains in the Globus." height="450" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/gears-w600.jpg" title="A close-up of the complex gear trains in the Globus." width="600"></a></p><p>A close-up of the complex gear trains in the Globus.</p>
<h2>The globe</h2>
<p>The globe itself is detailed for its small size, showing terrain features such as mountains, lakes, and rivers.
These features on the map helped cosmonauts compare their position with the geographic features they could
see on Earth.
These features were also important for selecting a landing site, so they could see what kind of terrain they would
be landing on.
For the most part, the map doesn't show political boundaries, except for thick red and purple lines.
This line shows the borders of the USSR, as well as the boundaries between communist and non-communist countries,
also important for selecting a landing site.
The globe also has numbered circles 1 through 8 that indicate radio sites for communication with the
spacecraft, allowing the cosmonauts to determine what ground stations could be contacted.</p>

<h2>Controlling the globe</h2>
<p>On seeing the Globus, one might wonder how the globe is rotated.
It may seem that the globe must be free-floating so it can rotate in two axes.
Instead, a clever mechanism attaches the globe to the unit.
The key is that the globe's equator is a solid piece of metal that rotates around the horizontal axis of the unit.
A second gear mechanism inside the globe rotates the globe around the North-South axis.
The two rotations are controlled by concentric shafts that are fixed to the unit, allowing two rotational degrees of freedom through fixed shafts.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the frame that holds and controls the globe.
The dotted axis is fixed horizontally in the unit and rotations are fed through the two gears at the left.
One gear rotates the globe and frame around the dotted axis, while the gear train causes the globe to rotate around the
vertical polar axis (while the equator remains fixed).</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/axis.jpg"><img alt="The axis of the globe is at 51.8° to support that orbital inclination." height="331" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/axis-w500.jpg" title="The axis of the globe is at 51.8° to support that orbital inclination." width="500"></a></p><p>The axis of the globe is at 51.8° to support that orbital inclination.</p>
<p>The angle above is 51.8° which is very important: this is the inclination of the standard Soyuz orbit.
As a result, simply rotating the globe around the dotted line causes the crosshair to trace the standard orbit.<span id="fnref:orbit"><a href="#fn:orbit">2</a></span>
Rotating the two halves of the globe around the poles yields the different 51.8° orbits over the Earth's surface
as the Earth rotates.
(Why 51.8 degrees? The Baikonur Cosmodrome, launching point for Soyuz, is at 45.97° N latitude, so 45.97° would be
the most efficient inclination.
However, to prevent the launch from passing over western China, the rocket must be angled towards the north,
resulting in 51.8° (<a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/61553/why-is-51-8-inclination-standard-for-soyuz">details</a>).)</p>
<p>One important consequence of this design is 
that the orbital inclination is fixed by the angle of the globe mechanism. Different Globus units
needed to be built for different orbits.
Moreover, this design only handles circular orbits, making it useless during orbit changes such as rendezvous and docking.
These were such significant limitations that some
cosmonauts wanted the Globus removed from the control panel, but it remained until it was replaced by a computer display in Soyuz-TMA (2002).<span id="fnref:sirius"><a href="#fn:sirius">3</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/globe-gears.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the gears that drive the motion of the two halves of the globe around the polar axis, leaving the equator fixed." height="493" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/globe-gears-w400.jpg" title="A closeup of the gears that drive the motion of the two halves of the globe around the polar axis, leaving the equator fixed." width="400"></a></p><p>A closeup of the gears that drive the motion of the two halves of the globe around the polar axis, leaving the equator fixed.</p>
<p>This Globus had clearly suffered some damage.
The back of the case had some large dents.<span id="fnref:connector"><a href="#fn:connector">7</a></span>
More importantly, the globe's shaft had been knocked loose from its proper position and no longer meshed with the gears.
This also put a gouge into Africa, where the globe hit internal components.
Fortunately, CuriousMarc was able to get the globe back into position while ensuring that the gears had the right timing.
(Putting the globe back arbitrarily would mess up the latitude and longitude.)</p>
<h2>Orbital speed and the "cone"</h2>
<p>An orbit of Soyuz takes approximately 90 minutes, but the time varies according to altitude.<span id="fnref:altitude"><a href="#fn:altitude">4</a></span>
The Globus has an adjustment knob (below) to adjust
the orbital period in minutes, tenths of minutes, and hundredths of minutes.
The outer knob has three positions and points to the digit that changes when the inner knob is turned.
The mechanism provides an adjustment of ±5 minutes from the nominal period of 91.85 minutes.<span id="fnref2:sirius"><a href="#fn:sirius">3</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/period-control.jpg"><img alt="The control to adjust the orbital period." height="276" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/period-control-w200.jpg" title="The control to adjust the orbital period." width="200"></a></p><p>The control to adjust the orbital period.</p>
<p>The orbital speed feature is implemented by increasing or decreasing the speed at which the globe rotates around the orbital (horizontal)
axis.
Generating a variable speed is tricky, since the Globus runs on fixed 1-hertz pulses.
The solution is to start with a base speed, and then add three increments: one for the minutes setting, one for
the tenths-of-minutes setting, and one for the hundredths-of-minutes setting.<span id="fnref:hyperbolic"><a href="#fn:hyperbolic">5</a></span>
These four speeds are added (as shaft rotation speeds) using obtain the overall rotation speed.</p>
<p>The Globus uses numerous differential gears to add or subtract rotations. The photo below shows two sets of
differential gears, side-by-side.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/differential.jpg"><img alt="Two differential gears in the Globus." height="309" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/differential-w600.jpg" title="Two differential gears in the Globus." width="600"></a></p><p>Two differential gears in the Globus.</p>
<p>The problem is how to generate these three variable rotation speeds from the fixed input.
The solution is a special cam, shaped like a cone with a spiral cross-section.
Three followers ride on the cam, so as the cam rotates, the follower is pushed outward and rotates on its shaft.
If the follower is near the narrow part of the cam, it moves over a small distance and has a small rotation.
But if the follower is near the wide part of the cam, it moves a larger distance and has a larger rotation.
Thus, by moving the follower to a particular point on the cam, the rotational speed of the follower is selected.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/cone-diagram.jpg"><img alt="A diagram showing the orbital speed control mechanism. The cone has three followers, but only two are visible from this angle. The &quot;transmission&quot; gears are moved in and out by the outer knob to select which follower is adjusted by the inner knob." height="533" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/cone-diagram-w600.jpg" title="A diagram showing the orbital speed control mechanism. The cone has three followers, but only two are visible from this angle. The &quot;transmission&quot; gears are moved in and out by the outer knob to select which follower is adjusted by the inner knob." width="600"></a></p><p>A diagram showing the orbital speed control mechanism. The cone has three followers, but only two are visible from this angle. The "transmission" gears are moved in and out by the outer knob to select which follower is adjusted by the inner knob.</p>
<p>Obviously, the cam can't spiral out forever.
Instead, at the end of one revolution, its cross-section drops back sharply to the starting diameter.
This causes the follower to snap back to its original position. 
To prevent this from jerking the globe backward, the follower is connected to the differential gearing via a slip clutch and ratchet.
Thus, when the follower snaps back, the ratchet holds the drive shaft stationary.
The drive shaft then continues its rotation as the follower starts cycling out again. 
Thus, the output is a (mostly) smooth rotation at a speed that depends on the position of the follower.</p>
<h2>Latitude and longitude</h2>
<p>The indicators at the left and the top of the globe indicate the spacecraft's latitude and longitude respectively.
These are defined by surprisingly complex functions, generated by the orbit's projection onto the globe.<span id="fnref:functions"><a href="#fn:functions">6</a></span></p>
<p>The latitude and longitude functions are implemented through the shape of metal cams; the photo below shows the
longitude mechanism.
Each function has two cams: one cam implements the desired function, while the other cam
has the "opposite" shape to maintain tension on the jaw-like tracking mechanism.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/cam.jpg"><img alt="The cam mechanism to compute longitude." height="332" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/cam-w350.jpg" title="The cam mechanism to compute longitude." width="350"></a></p><p>The cam mechanism to compute longitude.</p>
<p>The latitude cam drives the latitude dial, causing it to oscillate between 51.8° N and 51.8° S.
Longitude is more complicated because the Earth's rotation causes it to constantly vary.
The longitude output on the dial is produced by adding the cam's value to the Earth's rotation through a differential gear.</p>
<h2>Light and shadow</h2>
<p>The Globus has an indicator to show when the spacecraft will enter light or shadow.
The dial consists of two concentric dials, configured by the two knobs.
These dials move with the spacecraft's orbit, while the red legend remains fixed.
I think these dials are geared to the longitude dial, but I'm still investigating.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/light-dark.jpg"><img alt="The light and shadow indicator is controlled by two knobs." height="210" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/light-dark-w600.jpg" title="The light and shadow indicator is controlled by two knobs." width="600"></a></p><p>The light and shadow indicator is controlled by two knobs.</p>
<h2>The landing location mechanism</h2>
<p>The Globus can display where the spacecraft would land if you started a re-entry burn now, with an accuracy
of 150 km.
This is computed by projecting the current orbit forward by a partial orbit, depending on how long it would take to land.
The cosmonaut specifies this value by the "landing angle", which indicates this fraction of an orbit as an angle.
An electroluminescent indicator in the upper-left corner of the unit shows "Место посадки" (Landing place) to indicate this mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/landing-angle.jpg"><img alt="The landing angle control." height="146" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/landing-angle-w300.jpg" title="The landing angle control." width="300"></a></p><p>The landing angle control.</p>
<p>To obtain the landing position, a motor spins the globe until it is stopped after rotating through the specified angle.
The mechanism to implement this is shown below.
The adjustment knob on the panel turns the adjustment shaft which moves the limit
switch to the desired angle via the worm gear. The wiring is wrapped around a wheel so the wiring stays controlled during this movement.
When the drive motor is activated, it rotates the globe and the swing arm at the same time.
Since the motor stops when the swing arm hits the angle limit switch, the globe rotates through the desired angle.
The fixed limit switch is used when returning the globe's position to its regular, orbital position.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/landing-angle-diagram.jpg"><img alt="The landing angle function uses a complex mechanism." height="628" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/landing-angle-diagram-w600.jpg" title="The landing angle function uses a complex mechanism." width="600"></a></p><p>The landing angle function uses a complex mechanism.</p>
<p>The landing location mode is activated by a three-position rotary switch. The first position
"МП" (место посадки, landing site) selects the landing site, the second position "З" (Земля, Earth) shows the position over the Earth, and the third position "Откл" (off) undoes the landing angle rotation and turns off the mechanism.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/rotary-switch.jpg"><img alt="The rotary switch to select the landing angle mode." height="222" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/rotary-switch-w250.jpg" title="The rotary switch to select the landing angle mode." width="250"></a></p><p>The rotary switch to select the landing angle mode.</p>
<h2>Electronics</h2>
<p>Although the Globus is mostly mechanical,
it has an electronics board with four relays and a transistor, as well as resistors and diodes.
I think that most of these relays control the landing location mechanism, driving the motor forward or
backward and stopping at the limit switch.
The diodes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode">flyback diodes</a>, two diodes in series across
each relay coil to eliminate the inductive kick when the coil is disconnected.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/electronics.jpg"><img alt="The electronics circuit board." height="267" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/electronics-w700.jpg" title="The electronics circuit board." width="700"></a></p><p>The electronics circuit board.</p>
<p>A 360° potentiometer (below) converts the spacecraft's orbital position into a voltage. Sources indicate that
the Globus provides this voltage signal to other units on the spacecraft.
My theory is that the transistor on the electronics board amplifies this voltage, but I am still investigating.</p>

<p>The photo below shows the multiple wiring bundles in the Globus, at the front and the left. The electronics board is at the front right.
The Globus contains a surprising amount of wiring for a device that is mostly mechanical.
Inconveniently, all the wires to the box's external connector (upper left) were cut.<span id="fnref2:connector"><a href="#fn:connector">7</a></span>
Perhaps this was part of decommissioning the unit.
However, one of the screws on the case is covered with a tamper-resistant wax seal with insignia, and this
wax seal was intact.
This indicates that the unit was officially re-sealed after cutting the wires, which doesn't make sense for
a decommissioned unit.</p>

<h2>The drive solenoids</h2>
<p>The unit is driven by two ratchet solenoids: one for the orbital rotation and one for the Earth's rotation.
These solenoids take 27-volt pulses at 1 hertz.<span id="fnref3:sirius"><a href="#fn:sirius">3</a></span>
Each pulse causes the solenoid to advance the gear by one tooth; a pawl keeps the gear from slipping back.
These small rotations drive the gears throughout the Globus and result in a tiny movement of the globe.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the globe, it has a bunch of pink dots added, along with three-letter labels in Latin (not Cyrillic) characters.<span id="fnref:sites"><a href="#fn:sites">8</a></span>
In the photo below, you can see GDS (Goldstone), MIL (Merritt Island), BDA (Bermuda), and NFL (Newfoundland).
These are NASA tracking sites, which implies that this Globus was built for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project,
a 1975 mission where an Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soyuz capsule.</p>

<p>Further confirmation of the Apollo-Soyuz connection is the VAN sticker in the middle of the Pacific Ocean (not visible above).
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Mission_San_Fernando">USNS Vanguard</a> was a NASA tracking ship that was used in the Apollo program to fill in gaps in radio coverage. It was an oil tanker from World War II, converted postwar to a missile
tracking ship and then used for Apollo. In the photo below, you can see the large tracking antennas on its deck.
During the Apollo-Soyuz mission, Vanguard was stationed at <a href="https://www.angelfire.com/space2/australia/recovery/recovery-astp/astp_cachets.htm">25 S 155 W</a> for the Apollo-Soyuz mission, exactly matching
the location of the VAN dot on the globe.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Globus has a long history, back to the beginnings of Soviet crewed spaceflight. The first version was simpler and had the Russian acronym ИМП (IMP).<span id="fnref:imp"><a href="#fn:imp">9</a></span>
Development of the IMP started in <a href="https://web.mit.edu/slava/space/essays/essay-tiapchenko1.htm">1960</a> for the Vostok (1961)
and Voshod (1964) spaceflights.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/globus-imp.jpg"><img alt="The Globus IMP. Photo from Francoisguay (CC BY-SA 3.0)." height="480" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/globus-imp-w500.jpg" title="The Globus IMP. Photo from Francoisguay (CC BY-SA 3.0)." width="500"></a></p>
<p>The basic functions of the earlier Globus IMP are similar to the INK, showing the spacecraft's position and the
landing position.
It has an orbit counter in the lower right. The latitude and longitude displays at the top were added for the Voshod flights.
The large correction knob
allows the orbital period to be adjusted.
The main differences are that the IMP doesn't have a display at the bottom for sun and shade and
doesn't have a control to set the landing angle.<span id="fnref2:imp"><a href="#fn:imp">9</a></span>
Unlike the INK, the mode (orbit vs landing position) was selected by external switches, rather than a switch on the unit.</p>
<p>The more complex INK model (described in this blog post) was created for the Soyuz flights, starting in 1967.
It was part of the "Sirius" information display system (IDS).
The Neptun IDS used on Soyuz-T (1976) and the Neptun-M for Soyuz-TM (1986) modernized much of the console but kept the
Globus INK. The photo below shows the Globus mounted in the upper-right of a Soyuz-TM console.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/soyuz-panel.jpg"><img alt="The Neptun-M IDS for the Soyuz-TM (source)." height="311" src="https://static.righto.com/images/globus-overview/soyuz-panel-w500.jpg" title="The Neptun-M IDS for the Soyuz-TM (source)." width="500"></a></p><p>The Neptun-M IDS for the Soyuz-TM (<a href="https://web.mit.edu/slava/space/essays/essay-tiapchenko4.htm">source</a>).</p>
<p>The Soyuz-TMA (2002) upgraded to the Neptun-ME system<span id="fnref4:sirius"><a href="#fn:sirius">3</a></span> which used digital display screens. In particular, the Globus was replaced with the graphical display below.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The Globus INK is a remarkable piece of machinery, an analog computer that calculates orbits through an intricate
system of gears, cams, and differentials.
It provided cosmonauts with a high-resolution, full-color display of the spacecraft's position, way beyond what
an electronic space computer could provide in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Although the Globus is an amazing piece of mechanical computation, its functionality is limited.
Its parameters must be manually configured: the spacecraft's starting position, the orbital speed, the light/shadow regions, and the landing angle.
It doesn't take any external guidance inputs, such as an IMU (inertial measurement unit), so it's not particularly accurate.
Finally, it only supports a circular orbit at a fixed angle.
While the more modern digital display lacks the physical charm of a rotating globe, the digital solution provides
much more capability.</p>
<p>I plan to continue reverse-engineering the Globus and hope to get it operational,
so follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff">@kenshirriff</a> or <a href="https://www.righto.com/feeds/posts/default">RSS</a> for updates.
I've also started experimenting with Mastodon recently as <a href="https://oldbytes.space/@kenshirriff">@oldbytes.space@kenshirriff</a>.
Many thanks to Marcel for providing the Globus.
Thanks to <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/61553/why-is-51-8-inclination-standard-for-soyuz/61554">Stack Overflow</a> for orbit information and my Twitter followers for translation assistance.</p>
<p>I should give a disclaimer that I am still reverse-engineering the Globus, so what I described is subject to change.
Also, I don't read Russian, so any errors are the fault of Google Translate. :-)</p>

This is quite a feat for an organization that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/technology/mira-murati-openai.html">reportedly</a> burns through $7 billion a year—far more cash than it brings in—but it makes sense when you realize that OpenAI’s primary product isn’t technology. It’s stories.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Case in point: Last week, CEO Sam Altman published an online manifesto titled “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ia.samaltman.com/">The Intelligence Age</a>.” In it, he declares that the AI revolution is on the verge of unleashing boundless prosperity and radically improving human life. “We’ll soon be able to work with AI that helps us accomplish much more than we ever could without AI,” he writes. Altman expects that his technology will fix the climate, help humankind establish space colonies, and discover all of physics. He predicts that we may have an all-powerful superintelligence “in a few thousand days.” All we have to do is feed his technology enough energy, enough data, and enough chips.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Maybe someday Altman’s ideas about AI will prove out, but for now, his approach is textbook Silicon Valley mythmaking. In these narratives, humankind is forever on the cusp of a technological breakthrough that will transform society for the better. The hard technical problems have basically been solved—all that’s left now are the details, which will surely be worked out through market competition and old-fashioned entrepreneurship. <em>Spend billions now; make trillions later! </em>This was the story of the dot-com boom in the 1990s, and of nanotechnology in the 2000s. It was the story of cryptocurrency and robotics in the 2010s. The technologies never quite work out like the Altmans of the world promise, but the stories keep regulators and regular people sidelined while the entrepreneurs, engineers, and investors build empires. (<em>The Atlantic</em> recently entered a corporate partnership with OpenAI.)</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">Read: AI doomerism is a decoy</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Despite the rhetoric, Altman’s products currently feel less like a glimpse of the future and more like the mundane, buggy present. ChatGPT and DALL-E were cutting-edge technology in 2022. People tried the chatbot and image generator for the first time and were astonished. Altman and his ilk spent the following year speaking in stage whispers about the awesome technological force that had just been unleashed upon the world. Prominent AI figures were among the thousands of people who signed an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">open letter in March 2023</a> to urge a six-month pause in the development of large language models ( LLMs) so that humanity would have time to address the social consequences of the impending revolution. Those six months came and went. OpenAI and its competitors have released other models since then, and although tech wonks have dug into their purported advancements, for most people, the technology appears to have plateaued. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/gpt4-release-rumors-hype-future-iterations/673396/">GPT-4</a> now looks less like the precursor to an all-powerful superintelligence and more like … well, any other chatbot.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The technology itself seems much smaller once the novelty wears off. You can use a large language model to compose an email or a story—but not a particularly original one. The tools still hallucinate (meaning they confidently assert false information). They still fail in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/05/google-search-ai-overview-health-webmd/678508/">embarrassing and unexpected ways</a>. Meanwhile, the web is filling up with useless “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html">AI slop</a>,” LLM-generated trash that costs practically nothing to produce and generates pennies of advertising revenue for the creator. We’re in a race to the bottom that everyone saw coming and no one is happy with. Meanwhile, the search for product-market fit at a scale that would justify all the inflated tech-company valuations keeps coming up short. Even OpenAI’s latest release, o1, was accompanied by a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1834283100639297910">caveat</a> from Altman that “it still seems more impressive on first use than it does after you spend more time with it.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In Altman’s rendering, this moment in time is just a waypoint, “the doorstep of the next leap in prosperity.” He still argues that the deep-learning technique that powers ChatGPT will effectively be able to solve any problem, at any scale, so long as it has enough energy, enough computational power, and enough data. Many computer scientists are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691249131/ai-snake-oil?srsltid=AfmBOoq0PglTl-ZvYI9vexaTNJouMOR1cqpznKeo_-DOv-KWBWCvQrZu">skeptical of this claim</a>, maintaining that multiple significant scientific breakthroughs stand between us and artificial general intelligence. But Altman projects confidence that his company has it all well in hand, that science fiction will soon become reality. He may need <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0">$7 trillion</a> or so to realize his ultimate vision—not to mention <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/sam-altman-s-helion-energy-promises-fusion-power-by-2028">unproven fusion-energy technology</a>—but that’s peanuts when compared with all the advances he is promising.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">There’s just one tiny problem, though: Altman is no physicist. He is a serial entrepreneur, and quite clearly a talented one. He is one of Silicon Valley’s most revered talent scouts. If you look at Altman’s breakthrough successes, they all pretty much revolve around connecting early start-ups with piles of investor cash, not any particular technical innovation.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/sam-altman-openai-for-profit/680031/">Read: OpenAI takes its mask off</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It’s remarkable how similar Altman’s rhetoric sounds to that of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">his fellow billionaire techno-optimists</a>. The project of techno-optimism, for decades now, has been to insist that if we just have faith in technological progress and free the inventors and investors from pesky regulations such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html">copyright law</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes">deceptive marketing</a>, then the marketplace will work its magic and everyone will be better off. Altman has made nice with lawmakers, insisting that artificial intelligence requires responsible regulation. But the company’s response to proposed regulation seems to be “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6288245/openai-eu-lobbying-ai-act/">no, not like that</a>.” Lord, grant us regulatory clarity—but <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225648/openai-letter-california-ai-safety-bill-sb-1047">not just yet.</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At a high enough level of abstraction, Altman’s entire job is to keep us all fixated on an imagined AI future so we don’t get too caught up in the underwhelming details of the present.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2><a id="user-content-motivation" aria-label="Permalink: Motivation" href="#motivation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Rune is a UX experiment inspired by the question: What if Zune<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-a4753a1c8085f420ff8eb5ba191ec640" id="user-content-fnref-1-a4753a1c8085f420ff8eb5ba191ec640" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> had continued to evolve? Using a modern tech stack (Flutter + Rust), Rune captures the essence of Zune, drawing from the design highlights of various Windows products since the Windows XP era, including Windows Mobile and Windows Media Center<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-a4753a1c8085f420ff8eb5ba191ec640" id="user-content-fnref-1-2-a4753a1c8085f420ff8eb5ba191ec640" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.</p>

<!-- /wp:separator --></div><p><a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/">Apple’s AI research team</a> has developed a new model that could significantly advance how machines perceive depth, potentially transforming industries ranging from augmented reality to autonomous vehicles.</p>



<p>The system, called&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02073">Depth Pro</a>, is able to generate detailed 3D depth maps from single 2D images in a fraction of a second—without relying on the camera data traditionally needed to make such predictions.</p>



<p>The technology, detailed in a research paper titled&nbsp;<em>“<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02073">Depth Pro: Sharp Monocular Metric Depth in Less Than a Second</a>,”</em>&nbsp;is a major leap forward in the field of monocular depth estimation, a process that uses just one image to infer depth.</p>



<p>This could have far-reaching applications across sectors where real-time spatial awareness is key. The model’s creators, led by Aleksei Bochkovskii and Vladlen Koltun, describe&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;as one of the fastest and most accurate systems of its kind.</p>

Depth Pro excels in capturing fine details like fur and birdcage wires, producing sharp, high-resolution depth maps in just 0.3 seconds, outperforming other models in accuracy and detail. (credit: arxiv.org)</figcaption></figure>







<p>Monocular depth estimation has long been a challenging task, requiring either multiple images or metadata like focal lengths to accurately gauge depth.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;bypasses these requirements, producing high-resolution depth maps in just 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU. The model can create 2.25-megapixel maps with exceptional sharpness, capturing even minute details like hair and vegetation that are often overlooked by other methods.</p>



<p>“These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction,” the researchers explain in their paper. This architecture allows the model to process both the overall context of an image and its finer details simultaneously—an enormous leap from slower, less precise models that came before it.</p>

<h2 id="h-metric-depth-zero-shot-learning">Metric depth, zero-shot learning</h2>



<p>What truly sets&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;apart is its ability to estimate both relative and absolute depth, a capability called “metric depth.”</p>



<p>This means that the model can provide real-world measurements, which is essential for applications like augmented reality (AR), where virtual objects need to be placed in precise locations within physical spaces.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;doesn’t require extensive training on domain-specific datasets to make accurate predictions—a feature known as “zero-shot learning.” This makes the model highly versatile. It can be applied to a wide range of images, without the need for the camera-specific data usually required in depth estimation models.</p>



<p>“Depth Pro produces metric depth maps with absolute scale on arbitrary images ‘in the wild’ without requiring metadata such as camera intrinsics,” the authors explain. This flexibility opens up a world of possibilities, from enhancing AR experiences to improving autonomous vehicles’ ability to detect and navigate obstacles.</p>



<p>For those curious to experience Depth Pro firsthand, a <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/depth-pro">live demo</a> is available on the Hugging Face platform.</p>

<h2 id="h-real-world-applications-from-e-commerce-to-autonomous-vehicles">Real-world applications: From e-commerce to autonomous vehicles</h2>



<p>This versatility has significant implications for various industries. In e-commerce, for example,&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;could allow consumers to see how furniture fits in their home by simply pointing their phone’s camera at the room. In the automotive industry, the ability to generate real-time, high-resolution depth maps from a single camera could improve how self-driving cars perceive their environment, boosting navigation and safety.</p>



<p>“The method should ideally produce metric depth maps in this zero-shot regime to accurately reproduce object shapes, scene layouts, and absolute scales,” the researchers write, emphasizing the model’s potential to reduce the time and cost associated with training more conventional AI models.</p>



<h2 id="h-tackling-the-challenges-of-depth-estimation">Tackling the challenges of depth estimation</h2>



<p>One of the toughest challenges in depth estimation is handling what are known as “flying pixels”—pixels that appear to float in mid-air due to errors in depth mapping.&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;tackles this issue head-on, making it particularly effective for applications like 3D reconstruction and virtual environments, where accuracy is paramount.</p>



<p>Additionally,&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;excels in boundary tracing, outperforming previous models in sharply delineating objects and their edges. The researchers claim it surpasses other systems “by a multiplicative factor in boundary accuracy,” which is key for applications that require precise object segmentation, such as image matting and medical imaging.</p>



<h2 id="h-open-source-and-ready-to-scale">Open-source and ready to scale</h2>



<p>In a move that could accelerate its adoption, Apple has made&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;open-source. The code, along with pre-trained model weights, is <a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on GitHub</a>, allowing developers and researchers to experiment with and further refine the technology. The repository includes everything from the model’s architecture to pretrained checkpoints, making it easy for others to build on Apple’s work.</p>



<p>The research team is also encouraging further exploration of&nbsp;Depth Pro’s potential in fields like robotics, manufacturing, and healthcare. “We release code and weights at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro</a>,”&nbsp;the authors write, signaling this as just the beginning for the model.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-ai-depth-perception">What’s next for AI depth perception</h2>



<p>As artificial intelligence continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible,&nbsp;<em>Depth Pro</em>&nbsp;sets a new standard in speed and accuracy for monocular depth estimation. Its ability to generate high-quality, real-time depth maps from a single image could have wide-ranging effects across industries that rely on spatial awareness.</p>



<p>In a world where AI is increasingly central to decision-making and product development,&nbsp;<em>Depth Pro</em>&nbsp;exemplifies how cutting-edge research can translate into practical, real-world solutions. Whether it’s improving how machines perceive their surroundings or enhancing consumer experiences, the potential uses for&nbsp;<em>Depth Pro</em>&nbsp;are broad and varied.</p>



<p>As the researchers conclude, “Depth Pro dramatically outperforms all prior work in sharp delineation of object boundaries, including fine structures such as hair, fur, and vegetation.” With its open-source release,&nbsp;<em>Depth Pro</em>&nbsp;could soon become integral to industries ranging from autonomous driving to augmented reality—transforming how machines and people interact with 3D environments.</p>

Why? Because Seth Altman’s offense took place in Lubbock, Texas. I live in Austin, Texas. Four hundred miles away. What I do care about however is the misuse of emergency alert systems and public trust.</p><p><span>Sending out a screeching alert to 30million+ people over 250 million square miles in the middle of the night should only be used in the absolute DIREST OF CIRCUMSTANCES… circumstances like “Texas is under threat from hurricane/chemical leak/nuclear weapons, seek shelter now!” It should </span><em>never</em><span> be used for something that’s utterly irrelevant to 99.99% of people. </span></p><p>Why? Because the public’s trust in government emergency protocols is already hanging by a thread, and in order for those protocols to work when we really need them, they will need to be received and listened to. Instead, Texans by the hundreds of thousands are now turning off their phone’s emergency alerts, possibly forever. Why would anyone with a life to lead leave them on and risk getting their sleep disrupted over personally inconsequential events hundreds of miles away? </p><p>Such an outcome could be truly dangerous for Texas in the long run. If and when a real major emergency strikes, we will no longer have this important tool of public awareness or coordination. And that’s just the second order effects! There are likely going to be some excess deaths today as a direct result—there are 30m+ people in Texas, many of whom are in weak cardiovascular health. I would not be surprised at all if hospitals report an spike in cardiovascular events today. Not to mention an increase in road accidents; Texas is a notoriously driving-heavy state, and few things are worse for safe driving than sleep impairment.</p><p>So I hope the local government takes a long hard look at its alert-pressing finger. We all know the lesson of the Boy Who Cried Wolf, exhausting his village with his over-zealous cries. Well this time the village is thirty million people. Heads need to roll.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>
