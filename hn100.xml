				<h2 id="user-content-dut-a-disk-usage-calculator-for-linux" dir="auto">dut - A disk usage calculator for Linux</h2>
<h2 id="user-content-features" dir="auto">Features</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Accurate counting of hard links with an output inspired by NCDU.</li>
<li>Pure ASCII output which is fully compatible with the plain Linux tty.</li>
<li>Configurable output format. Changing the maximum depth of files shown is a simple command-line
argument.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-examples" dir="auto">Examples</h2>
<p dir="auto">By default, <code>dut</code> will output a tree of the biggest directories it finds under your current directory.</p>
<pre><code>$ dut -n 10
 2.4G    0B       /- Local
 2.4G    0B     /- AppData
 2.4G    0B   /- NetworkService
 2.4G    0B |- ServiceProfiles
 2.5G   63M |- servicing
 5.2G  423M |   /- FileRepository
 5.2G  426M | /- DriverStore
 9.6G  2.5G |- System32
  12G  7.2G /- WinSxS
  29G  225M .
</code></pre><p dir="auto">The <code>-n 10</code> option limits it to 10 rows. To limit the depth shown, use <code>-d &lt;n&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ dut -n 10 -d 1
 964M    0B |- MEMORY.DMP
1010M    0B |- SoftwareDistribution
 1.2G  1.0G |- SysWOW64
 1.3G  208M |- assembly
 1.8G  1.8G |- SystemApps
 2.4G    0B |- ServiceProfiles
 2.5G   63M |- servicing
 9.6G  2.5G |- System32
  12G  7.2G /- WinSxS
  29G  225M .
</code></pre><p dir="auto">The first column in the output tells you how much space a given entry takes up on your disk.
This can be an overcount, however, because of hard links (identical files that are only stored
once on the disk). Hard links under a directory are deduplicated in the first column's number,
but hard links that go outside of a directory to somewhere else will still be counted here.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's where the second column comes in. It tells you how much of an entry's size is shared
with other entries outside of it because of hard links. In the output above, we can see that
most of the entries have a lot of data shared with other entries, but the root directory only
has 225M shared with others. This tells us that there's a lot of hard links going between all
of the entries shown above.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to see how much of an entry's size is unique to just it, you can subtract the second
column from the first one.</p>
<p dir="auto">The full list of options can be seen with <code>dut -h</code>.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-how-to-build" dir="auto">How to build</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>dut</code> is a single source file, so all you need is a C11 compiler:</p>
<pre><code>gcc -O3 -flto main.c -o dut
</code></pre><p dir="auto">To install, copy the <code>dut</code> executable to a directory on your PATH, e.g. <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If get linker errors about missing symbols, you may need to add the <code>-pthread</code> option to gcc.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-benchmarks" dir="auto">Benchmarks</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>dut</code> is remarkably fast, but it doesn't win in all cases. It loses to a couple programs when
Linux's disk caches aren't populated yet, which is usually the first time you run it on a certain
directory. On subsequent runs, <code>dut</code> beats everything else by a significant margin.</p>
<p dir="auto">Benchmarked programs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>du</code> from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html" rel="nofollow">coreutils</a> (C)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/byron/dua-cli" rel="nofollow"><code>dua</code></a> (Rust)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/KSXGitHub/parallel-disk-usage" rel="nofollow"><code>pdu</code></a> (Rust)</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/dundee/gdu" rel="nofollow"><code>gdu</code></a> (Go)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you know of a faster program, let me know and I'll add it to these benchmarks.</p>

<p dir="auto">In order to make things fair, I forced <code>dut</code> and <code>dust</code> to output in color and show 60 rows. I also
added a 10 second sleep between each program's run to limit the effects of thermal throttling.</p>

<p dir="auto">It's hard to say. My best guess is they have a really HDD-unfriendly access pattern, since they
both use Rayon for multithreading which uses FIFO ordering for tasks. This results in them doing
a breadth-first search of the filesystem, whereas <code>dut</code> and <code>du</code> both use depth-first search. I
don't know why one ordering is better than the other, but the difference is pretty drastic.</p>
<p dir="auto">I also think that ordering is the reason <code>dut</code> doesn't do so well on SSD either, but I'm not so
sure of that.</p>

<p>Northwestern Medicine and Brigham and Women’s Hospital scientists have discovered a molecular defect that promotes the pathologic immune response in systemic lupus erythematosus (known as lupus) and in a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07627-2">published</a> in <em>Nature</em>, show that reversing this defect may potentially reverse the disease.</p>



<p>Lupus affects more than 1.5 million people in the U.S. Until this new study, the causes of this disease were unclear. Lupus can result in life-threatening damage to multiple organs including the kidneys, brain and heart. Existing treatments often fail to control the disease, the study authors said, and have unintended side effects of reducing the immune system’s ability to fight infections.</p>



<p>“Up until this point, all therapy for lupus is a blunt instrument. It’s broad immunosuppression,” said co-corresponding author <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=33689">Jaehyuk Choi, MD, PhD</a>, the Jack W. Graffin Professor, an associate professor of <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/dermatology/index.html">Dermatology</a> and a Northwestern Medicine dermatologist. “By identifying a cause for this disease, we have found a potential cure that will not have the side effects of current therapies.”</p>



<p>“We’ve identified a fundamental imbalance in the immune responses that patients with lupus make, and we’ve defined specific mediators that can correct this imbalance to dampen the pathologic autoimmune response,” said co-corresponding author Deepak Rao, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and co-director of its Center for Cellular Profiling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the study, the scientists reported a new pathway that drives disease in lupus. There are disease-associated changes in multiple molecules in the blood of patients with lupus. Ultimately, these changes lead to insufficient activation of a pathway controlled by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which regulates cells’ response to environmental pollutants, bacteria or metabolites. Insufficient activation of AHR results in too many disease-promoting immune cells, called the T peripheral helper cells, that promote the production of disease-causing autoantibodies.</p>



<p>To show this discovery can be leveraged for treatments, the investigators returned the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-activating molecules to blood samples from lupus patients. This seemed to reprogram these lupus-causing cells into a cell called a Th22 cell that may promote wound healing from the damage caused by this autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>“We found that if we either activate the AHR pathway with small molecule activators or limit the pathologically excessive interferon in the blood, we can reduce the number of these disease-causing cells,” said Choi, who is also a member of the <a href="https://www.cancer.northwestern.edu/">Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. “If these effects are durable, this may be a potential cure.”</p>



<p>Choi, Rao and colleagues next want to expand their efforts into developing novel treatments for lupus patients. They are now working to find ways to deliver these molecules safely and effectively to people.</p>

	<p>
		While much attention has been focused on high-level software
		architectural patterns, what is, in effect, the de-facto standard
		software architecture is seldom discussed. This paper examines this
		most frequently deployed of software architectures: the <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>. A <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is a casually, even
		haphazardly, structured system. Its organization, if one can call it
		that, is dictated more by expediency than design. Yet, its enduring
		popularity cannot merely be indicative of a general disregard for
		architecture.
	</p>

	<p>
		These patterns explore the forces that encourage the emergence of a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>, and the undeniable
		effectiveness of this approach to software architecture. What are the
		people who build them doing right? If more high-minded architectural
		approaches are to compete, we must understand what the forces that
		lead to a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> are, and
		examine alternative ways to resolve them.
	</p>

	<p>
		A number of additional patterns emerge out of the <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>. We discuss them in
		turn. Two principal questions underlie these patterns: Why are so many
		existing systems architecturally undistinguished, and what can we do
		to improve them?
	</p>

	<a name="Introduction"></a>
	
	<!-- End of Pattern Header -->

	<p>
		Over the last several years, a number of authors [Garlan &amp; Shaw
		1993] [Shaw 1996] [Buschmann et. al. 1996] [Meszaros 1997] have
		presented patterns that characterize high-level software
		architectures, such as PIPELINE and LAYERED ARCHITECTURE. In an ideal
		world, every system would be an exemplar of one or more such
		high-level patterns. Yet, this is not so. The architecture that
		actually predominates in practice has yet to be discussed: the <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<a href="http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~ba116594/mmt.html"> <img src="http://laputan.org/images/pictures/spaghetti-medium.jpg" width="317" height="437" alt="Lennon Serves Too Much Spaghetti"></a>
	<p>
		A <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is haphazardly
		structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape and bailing wire, <a href="http://www.mdagroup.com/computing/spaghett.htm">spaghetti</a> <a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~dkw/C-humor/pasta.txt">code</a> <a href="http://leb.net/~tonyk/jargon/entry.cgi?idx=1710">jungle</a>.
		We’ve all seen them. These systems show unmistakable signs of
		unregulated growth, and repeated, <a href="http://home.swbell.net/mck9/cobol/style/rewrite.html">expedient</a>
		repair. Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of
		the system, often to the point where nearly all the important
		information becomes global or duplicated. The overall structure of the
		system may never have been well defined. If it was, it may have <a href="http://garynorth.com/y2k/detail_.cfm/881">eroded</a> beyond
		recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility
		shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about
		architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the
		day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are
		content to work on such systems.
	</p>

	<p>Still, this approach endures and thrives. Why is this
		architecture so popular? Is it as bad as it seems, or might it serve
		as a way-station on the road to more enduring, elegant artifacts? What
		forces drive good programmers to build ugly systems? Can we avoid
		this? Should we? How can we make such systems better?</p>

	<p>We present the following seven patterns:</p>

	<p>
		Why does a system become a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>? Sometimes, big, ugly systems emerge from <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode"></a><a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY
			CODE</a>. <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a> is
		quick-and-dirty code that was intended to be used only once and then
		discarded. However, such code often takes on a life of its own,
		despite casual structure and poor or non-existent documentation. It
		works, so why fix it? When a related problem arises, the quickest way
		to address it might be to expediently modify this working code, rather
		than design a proper, general program from the ground up. Over time, a
		simple throwaway program begets a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Even systems with well-defined architectures are prone to structural
		erosion. The relentless onslaught of changing requirements that any
		successful system attracts can gradually undermine its structure.
		Systems that were once tidy become overgrown as <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> gradually allows
		elements of the system to sprawl in an uncontrolled fashion.
	</p>

	<p>
		If such sprawl continues unabated, the structure of the system can
		become so badly compromised that it must be abandoned. As with a
		decaying neighborhood, a downward spiral ensues. Since the system
		becomes harder and harder to understand, maintenance becomes more
		expensive, and more difficult. Good programmers refuse to work there.
		Investors withdraw their capital. And yet, as with neighborhoods,
		there are ways to avoid, and even reverse, this sort of decline. As
		with anything else in the universe, counteracting entropic forces
		requires an investment of energy. Software <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?gentrification">gentrification</a>
		is no exception. The way to arrest entropy in software is to refactor
		it. A sustained commitment to refactoring can keep a system from
		subsiding into a BIG BALL OF MUD.
	</p>

	<p>
		A major flood, fire, or war may require that a city be evacuated and
		rebuilt from the ground up. More often, change takes place a building
		or block at a time, while the city as a whole continues to function.
		Once established, a strategy of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEPING
			IT WORKING</a> preserves a municipality’s vitality as it grows.
	</p>

	<p>
		Systems and their constituent elements evolve at different rates. As
		they do, things that change quickly tend to become distinct from
		things that change more slowly. The <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ShearingLayers">SHEARING
			LAYERS</a> that develop between them are like fault lines or facets that
		help foster the emergence of enduring abstractions.
	</p>

	<p>
		A simple way to begin to control decline is to cordon off the blighted
		areas, and put an attractive fa�ade around them. We call this strategy
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#SweepingItUnderTheRug">SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG</a>.
		In more advanced cases, there may be no alternative but to tear
		everything down and start over. When total <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a> becomes necessary,
		all that is left to salvage is the patterns that underlie the
		experience.
	</p>

	<p>Some of these patterns might appear at first to be antipatterns
		[Brown et al. 1998] or straw men, but they are not, at least in the
		customary sense. Instead, they seek to examine the gap between what we
		preach and what we practice.</p>

	<p>Still, some of them may strike some readers as having a schizoid
		quality about them. So, for the record, let us put our cards on the
		table. We are in favor of good architecture.</p>

	<p>Our ultimate agenda is to help drain these swamps. Where
		possible, architectural decline should be prevented, arrested, or
		reversed. We discuss ways of doing this. In severe cases,
		architectural abominations may even need to be demolished.</p>

	<p>At the same time, we seek not to cast blame upon those who must
		wallow in these mires. In part, our attitude is to "hate the sin, but
		love the sinner". But, it goes beyond this. Not every backyard storage
		shack needs marble columns. There are significant forces that can
		conspire to compel architecture to take a back seat to functionality,
		particularly early in the evolution of a software artifact.
		Opportunities and insights that can allow for architectural progress
		often are present later rather than earlier in the lifecycle.</p>

	<p>A certain amount of controlled chaos is natural during
		construction, and can be tolerated, as long as you clean up after
		yourself eventually. Even beyond this though, a complex system may be
		an accurate reflection of our immature understanding of a complex
		problem. The class of systems that we can build at all may be larger
		than the class of systems we can build elegantly, at least at first. A
		somewhat ramshackle rat's nest might be a state-of-the-art
		architecture for a poorly understood domain. This should not be the
		end of the story, though. As we gain more experience in such domains,
		we should increasingly direct our energies to gleaning more enduring
		architectural abstractions from them.</p>

	<p>
		The patterns described herein are not intended to stand alone. They
		are instead set in a context that includes a number of other patterns
		that we and others have described. In particular, they are set in
		contrast to the lifecycle patterns, <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/user/cope/Patterns/Process/section38.html">PROTOTYPE</a>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">PHASE</a>, <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSIONARY PHASE</a>, and
		<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION
			PHASE</a>, presented in [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote
			&amp; Opdyke 1995</a>] and [Coplien 1995], the <a href="http://laputan.org/metamorphosis/metamorphosis.html#SoftwareTectonics">SOFTWARE
			TECTONICS</a> pattern in [<a href="http://laputan.org/metamorphosis/metamorphosis.html#SoftwareTectonics">Foote
			&amp; Yoder 1996</a>], and the framework development patterns in [<a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/~droberts/evolve.html">Roberts
			&amp; Johnson 1998</a>].
	</p>

	<p>Indeed, to a substantial extent, much of this chapter describes
		the disease, while the patterns above describe what we believe can be
		the cure: a flexible, adaptive, feedback-driven development process in
		which design and refactoring pervade the lifecycle of each artifact,
		component, and framework, within and beyond the applications that
		incubate them.</p>

	<!-- End of Pattern Header -->

	<p>
		A number of forces can conspire to drive even the most architecturally
		conscientious organizations to produce <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. These pervasive, <i>"global" forces</i> are
		at work in all the patterns presented. Among these forces:
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Time:</i> There may not be enough <u>time</u> to consider the <a href="http://www.longnow.org/">long-term</a> architectural
		implications of one’s design and implementation decisions. Even
		when systems have been well designed, architectural concerns often
		must yield to more pragmatic ones as a deadline starts to loom.
	</p>

	<p>
		One reason that software architectures are so often mediocre is that
		architecture frequently takes a back seat to more mundane concerns
		such as cost, time-to-market, and programmer skill. Architecture is
		often seen as a luxury or a frill, or the indulgent pursuit of
		lily-gilding compulsives who have no concern for the bottom line.
		Architecture is often treated with neglect, and even disdain. While
		such attitudes are unfortunate, they are not hard to understand.
		Architecture is a long-term concern. The concerns above have to be
		addressed if a product is not to be stillborn in the marketplace,
		while the benefits of good architecture are realized later in the
		lifecycle, as frameworks mature, and reusable black-box components
		emerge [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke
			1995</a>].
	</p>

	<p>
		Architecture can be looked upon as a <i>Risk</i>, that will consume
		resources better directed at meeting a fleeting market window, or as
		an <i>Opportunity</i> to lay the groundwork for a commanding advantage
		down the road.
	</p>

	<p>Indeed, an immature architecture can be an advantage in a
		growing system because data and functionality can migrate to their
		natural places in the system unencumbered by artificial architectural
		constraints. Premature architecture can be more dangerous than none at
		all, as unproved architectural hypotheses turn into straightjackets
		that discourage evolution and experimentation.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Cost:</i> Architecture is expensive, especially when a new domain
		is being explored. Getting the system right seems like a pointless
		luxury once the system is limping well enough to ship. An investment
		in architecture usually does not pay off immediately. Indeed, if
		architectural concerns delay a product’s market entry for too
		long, then long-term concerns may be moot. Who benefits from an
		investment in architecture, and when is a return on this investment
		seen? Money spent on a quick-and-dirty project that allows an
		immediate entry into the market may be better spent than money spent
		on elaborate, speculative architectural fishing expedition. It’s
		hard to recover the value of your architectural assets if you’ve
		long since gone bankrupt.
	</p>

	<p>Programmers with the ability to discern and design quality
		architectures are reputed to command a premium. These expenses must be
		weighed against those of allowing an expensive system to slip into
		premature decline and obsolescence. If you think good architecture is
		expensive, try bad architecture.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Experience:</i> Even when one has the time and inclination to take
		architectural concerns into account, one’s experience, or lack
		thereof, with the domain can limit the degree of architectural
		sophistication that can be brought to a system, particularly early in
		its evolution. Some programmers flourish in environments where they
		can discover and develop new abstractions, while others are more
		comfortable in more constrained environments (for instance, Smalltalk
		vs. <a href="http://www.hamline.edu/~wnk/cpb/199707/0884.html">Visual
			Basic</a> programmers.) Often, initial versions of a system are vehicles
		whereby programmers learn what pieces must be brought into play to
		solve a particular problem. Only after these are identified do the
		architectural boundaries among parts of the system start to emerge.
	</p>

	<p>Inexperience can take a number of guises. There is absolute,
		fresh out of school inexperience. A good architect may lack domain
		experience, or a domain expert who knows the code cold may not have
		architectural experience.</p>

	<p>Employee turnover can wreak havoc on an organization’s
		institutional memory, with the perhaps dubious consolation of bringing
		fresh blood aboard.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Skill:</i> Programmers differ in their levels of skill, as well as
		in expertise, predisposition and temperament. Some programmers have a
		passion for finding good abstractions, while some are skilled at
		navigating the swamps of complex code left to them by others.
		Programmers differ tremendously in their degrees of experience with
		particular domains, and their capacities for adapting to new ones.
		Programmers differ in their language and tool preferences and
		experience as well.
	</p>


	<p>
		<i>Visibility:</i> Buildings are tangible, physical structures. You
		can look at a building. You can watch it being built. You can walk
		inside it, and admire and critique its design.
	</p>

	<p>A program’s user interface presents the public face of a
		program, much as a building’s exterior manifests its
		architecture. However, unlike buildings, only the people who build a
		program see how it looks inside.</p>

	<p>Programs are made of bits. The manner in which we present these
		bits greatly affects our sense of how they are put together. Some
		designers prefer to see systems depicted using modeling languages or
		PowerPoint pictures. Others prefer prose descriptions. Still others
		prefer to see code. The fashion in which we present our architectures
		affects our perceptions of whether they are good or bad, clear or
		muddled, and elegant or muddy.</p>

	<p>Indeed, one of the reasons that architecture is neglected is
		that much of it is "under the hood", where nobody can see
		it. If the system works, and it can be shipped, who cares what it
		looks like on the inside?</p>

	<p>
		<i>Complexity:</i> One reason for a muddled architecture is that
		software often reflects the inherent complexity of the application
		domain. This is what <a href="http://groucho.admin.unc.edu/endeavors/end496/brooks.htm">Brooks</a>
		called "essential complexity" [Brooks 1995]. In other words,
		the software is ugly because the problem is ugly, or at least not well
		understood. Frequently, the organization of the system reflects the
		sprawl and history of the organization that built it (as per <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/user/cope/Patterns/Process/section15.html">CONWAY’S
			LAW</a> [Coplien 1995]) and the compromises that were made along the way.
		Renegotiating these relationships is often difficult once the basic
		boundaries among system elements are drawn. These relationships can
		take on the immutable character of "site" boundaries that <a href="http://www.well.com/user/sbb/index.html"> Brand</a> [Brand
		1994] observed in real cities. Big problems can arises when the needs
		of the applications force unrestrained communication across these
		boundaries. The system becomes a tangled mess, and what little
		structure is there can erode further.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Change:</i> Architecture is a hypothesis about the future that
		holds that subsequent change will be confined to that part of the
		design space encompassed by that architecture. Of course, the world
		has a way of mocking our attempts to make such predictions by tossing
		us the totally unexpected. A problem we might have been told was
		definitely ruled out of consideration for all time may turn out to be
		dear to the heart of a new client we never thought we’d have.
		Such changes may cut directly across the grain of fundamental
		architectural decisions made in the light of the certainty that these
		new contingencies could never arise. The "right" thing to do
		might be to redesign the system. The more likely result is that the
		architecture of the system will be expediently perturbed to address
		the new requirements, with only passing regard for the effect of these
		radical changes on the structure of the system.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Scale:</i> Managing a large project is a qualitatively different
		problem from managing a small one, just as leading a division of
		infantry into battle is different from commanding a small special
		forces team. Obviously, "divide and conquer" is, in general, an
		insufficient answer to the problems posed by scale. Alan Kay, during
		an invited talk at OOPSLA '86 observed that "good ideas don't always
		scale." That observation prompted <a href="http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/people/lieber/">Henry
			Lieberman</a> to inquire "so what do we do, just scale the bad ones?"

		<a href="http://www.interlog.com/~rodneyb/paraguay/shantypix.html">Shantytowns</a>
		are squalid, sprawling slums. Everyone seems to agree they are a bad
		idea, but forces conspire to promote their emergence anyway. What is
		it that they are doing right?
	</p>

	<p>Shantytowns are usually built from common, inexpensive materials
		and simple tools. Shantytowns can be built using relatively unskilled
		labor. Even though the labor force is "unskilled" in the
		customary sense, the construction and maintenance of this sort of
		housing can be quite labor intensive. There is little specialization.
		Each housing unit is constructed and maintained primarily by its
		inhabitants, and each inhabitant must be a jack of all the necessary
		trades. There is little concern for infrastructure, since
		infrastructure requires coordination and capital, and specialized
		resources, equipment, and skills. There is little overall planning or
		regulation of growth. Shantytowns emerge where there is a need for
		housing, a surplus of unskilled labor, and a dearth of capital
		investment. Shantytowns fulfill an immediate, local need for housing
		by bringing available resources to bear on the problem. Loftier
		architectural goals are a luxury that has to wait.</p>

	<p>Maintaining a shantytown is labor-intensive and requires a broad
		range of skills. One must be able to improvise repairs with the
		materials on-hand, and master tasks from roof repair to ad hoc
		sanitation. However, there is little of the sort of skilled
		specialization that one sees in a mature economy.</p>

	<p>All too many of our software systems are, architecturally,
		little more than shantytowns. Investment in tools and infrastructure
		is too often inadequate. Tools are usually primitive, and
		infrastructure such as libraries and frameworks, is undercapitalized.
		Individual portions of the system grow unchecked, and the lack of
		infrastructure and architecture allows problems in one part of the
		system to erode and pollute adjacent portions. Deadlines loom like
		monsoons, and architectural elegance seems unattainable.</p>

	</p>
	<p>As a system nears completion, its actual users may begin to work
		with it for the first time. This experience may inspire changes to
		data formats and the user interface that undermine architectural
		decisions that had been thought to be settled. Also, as Brooks [Brooks
		1995] has noted, because software is so flexible, it is often asked to
		bear the burden of architectural compromises late in the development
		cycle of hardware/software deliverables precisely because of its
		flexibility.</p>

	<p>
		This phenomenon is not unique to software. <a href="http://www.well.com/user/sbb/index.html">Stewart Brand</a>
		[Brand 1994] has observed that the period just prior to a
		building’s initial occupancy can be a stressful period for both
		architects and their clients. The money is running out, and the
		finishing touches are being put on just those parts of the space that
		will interact the most with its occupants. During this period, it can
		become evident that certain wish-list items are not going to make it,
		and that exotic experiments are not going to work. Compromise becomes
		the "order of the day".
	</p>

	<p>The time and money to chase perfection are seldom available, nor
		should they be. To survive, we must do what it takes to get our
		software working and out the door on time. Indeed, if a team completes
		a project with time to spare, today’s managers are likely to take
		that as a sign to provide less time and money or fewer people the next
		time around.</p>

	<p><span><b>You need to deliver quality
						software on time, and under budget.</b></span></p>

	<p>
		<i>Cost</i>: Architecture is a long-term investment. It is easy for
		the people who are paying the bills to dismiss it, unless there is
		some tangible immediate benefit, such a tax write-off, or unless
		surplus money and time happens to be available. Such is seldom the
		case. More often, the customer needs something working by tomorrow.
		Often, the people who control and manage the development process
		simply do not regard architecture as a pressing concern. If
		programmers know that workmanship is invisible, and managers don't
		want to pay for it anyway, a vicious circle is born.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Skill</i>: Ralph Johnson is fond of observing that is inevitable
		that "on average, average organizations will have average people". One
		reason for the popularity and success of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> approaches might be
		that this appoach doesn't require a hyperproductive <a href="http://www.onenet.net/~njtdb/casey.html">virtuoso</a> architect
		at every keyboard.
	</p><p>
		<i>Organization</i>: With larger projects, cultural, process,
		organizational and resource allocation issues can overwhelm technical
		concerns such as tools, languages, and architecture.
	</p>

	<p>It may seem to a programmer that whether to don hip boots and
		wade into a swamp is a major quality-of-life matter, but programmer
		comfort is but one concern to a manager, which can conflict with many
		others. Architecture and code quality may strike management as frills
		that have only an indirect impact on their bottom lines.
	</p><p><b><span><u><i>Therefore</i></u>,
						focus first on features and functionality, then focus on
						architecture and performance. </span></b></p>

	<p>
		The case made here resembles Gabriel’s "<a href="http://laputan.org/gabriel/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a>"
		arguments [Gabriel 1991] in a number of respects. Why does so much
		software, despite the best intentions and efforts of developers, turn
		into <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS OF MUD</a>? Why do
		slash-and-burn tactics drive out elegance? Does bad architecture drive
		out good architecture?
	</p>

	<p>What does this muddy code look like to the programmers in the
		trenches who must confront it? Data structures may be haphazardly
		constructed, or even next to non-existent. Everything talks to
		everything else. Every shred of important state data may be global.
		There are those who might construe this as a sort of blackboard
		approach [Buschmann 1996], but it more closely resembles a grab bag of
		undifferentiated state. Where state information is compartmentalized,
		it may be passed promiscuously about though Byzantine back channels
		that circumvent the system's original structure.</p>

	<p>Variable and function names might be uninformative, or even
		misleading. Functions themselves may make extensive use of global
		variables, as well as long lists of poorly defined parameters. The
		function themselves are lengthy and convoluted, and perform several
		unrelated tasks. Code is duplicated. The flow of control is hard to
		understand, and difficult to follow. The programmer’s intent is
		next to impossible to discern. The code is simply unreadable, and
		borders on indecipherable. The code exhibits the unmistakable signs of
		patch after patch at the hands of multiple maintainers, each of whom
		barely understood the consequences of what he or she was doing. Did we
		mention documentation? What documentation?</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> might be thought
		of as an anti-pattern, since our intention is to show how passivity in
		the face of forces that undermine architecture can lead to a quagmire.
		However, its undeniable popularity leads to the inexorable conclusion
		that it is a pattern in its own right. It is certainly a pervasive,
		recurring solution to the problem of producing a working system in the
		context of software development. It would seem to be the path of least
		resistance when one confronts the sorts of forces discussed above.
		Only by understanding the logic of its appeal can we channel or
		counteract the forces that lead to a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>One thing that isn’t the answer is rigid, totalitarian,
		top-down design. Some analysts, designers, and architects have an
		exaggerated sense of their ability to get things right up-front,
		before moving into implementation. This approach leads to inefficient
		resources utilization, analysis paralysis, and design straightjackets
		and cul-de-sacs.</p>

	<p>Kent Beck has observed that the way to build software is to:
		Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast [Beck 1997]. "Make it
		work" means that we should focus on functionality up-front, and
		get something running. "Make it right" means that we should
		concern ourselves with how to structure the system only after
		we’ve figured out the pieces we need to solve the problem in the
		first place. "Make it fast" means that we should be
		concerned about optimizing performance only after we’ve learned
		how to solve the problem, and after we’ve discerned an
		architecture to elegantly encompass this functionality. Once all this
		has been done, one can consider how to make it cheap.</p>

	<p>
		When it comes to software architecture, form <u>follows</u> function.
		Here we mean "follows" not in the traditional sense of dictating
		function. Instead, we mean that the distinct identities of the
		system�s architectural elements often don�t start to emerge until <u>after</u>
		the code is working.
	</p>

	<p>Domain experience is an essential ingredient in any framework
		design effort. It is hard to try to follow a front-loaded, top-down
		design process under the best of circumstances. Without knowing the
		architectural demands of the domain, such an attempt is premature, if
		not foolhardy. Often, the only way to get domain experience early in
		the lifecycle is to hire someone who has worked in a domain before
		from someone else.</p>

	<p>The quality of one’s tools can influence a system’s
		architecture. If a system’s architectural goals are inadequately
		communicated among members of a team, they will be harder to take into
		account as the system is designed and constructed.</p>

	<p>
		Finally, engineers will differ in their levels of skill and commitment
		to architecture. Sadly, architecture has been undervalued for so long
		that many engineers regard life with a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a> as normal. Indeed some engineers are particularly skilled
		at learning to navigate these quagmires, and guiding others through
		them. Over time, this symbiosis between architecture and skills can
		change the character of the organization itself, as swamp guides
		become more valuable than architects. As per <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/user/cope/Patterns/Process/section15.html">CONWAY’S
			LAW</a> [Coplien 1995], architects depart in futility, while engineers
		who have mastered the muddy details of the system they have built in
		their images prevail. [<a href="http://laputan.org/selfish/selfish.html#LowSurfaceToVolumeRatio">Foote
			&amp; Yoder 1998a</a>] went so far as to observe that inscrutable code
		might, in fact, have a survival advantage over good code, by virtue of
		being difficult to comprehend and change. This advantage can extend to
		those programmers who can find their ways around such code. In a land
		devoid of landmarks, such guides may become indispensable.
	</p>

	<p>The incentives that drive the evolution of such systems can, at
		times, operate perversely. Just as it is easier to be verbose than
		concise, it is easier to build complex systems than it is to build
		simple ones. Skilled programmers may be able to create complexity more
		quickly than their peers, and more quickly than they can document and
		explain it. Like an army outrunning its logistics train, complexity
		increases until it reaches the point where such programmers can no
		longer reliably cope with it.</p>

	<p>
		This is akin to a phenonmenon dubbed the <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeterPrincipleProgramming"><i>PeterPrinciple
				of Programming</i></a> by authors on the Wiki-Wiki web [Cunninghan 1999a].
		Complexity increases rapidly until the it reaches a level of
		complexity just beyond that with which programmers can comfortably
		cope. At this point, complexity and our abilities to contain it reach
		an uneasy equilibrium. The blitzkrieg bogs down into a siege. We built
		<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheMostComplexWhichCanBeMadeToWork">
			the most complicated system that can possible work</a> [Cunningham
		1999b].
	</p>
	<a href="http://www.45thdivisionmuseum.com/Mainmuseum/Mauldin2.htm">
		<img src="http://laputan.org/images/pictures/mauldin-warm-mud.gif">
	</a>

	<p>Such code can become a personal fiefdom, since the author care
		barely understand it anymore, and no one else can come close. Once
		simple repairs become all day affairs, as the code turns to mud. It
		becomes increasingly difficult for management to tell how long such
		repairs ought to take. Simple objectives turn into trench warfare.
		Everyone becomes resigned to a turgid pace. Some even come to prefer
		it, hiding in their cozy foxholes, and making their two line-per-day
		repairs.</p>

	<p>It is interesting to ask whether some of the differences in
		productivity seen between hyper-productive organizations and typical
		shops are due not to differences in talent, but differences in
		terrain. Mud is hard to march through. The hacker in the trenches must
		engage complexity in hand-to-hand combat every day. Sometimes,
		complexity wins.</p>

	<p>Status in the programmer's primate pecking order is often earned
		through ritual displays of cleverness, rather than through
		workman-like displays of simplicity and clarity. That which a culture
		glorifies will flourish.</p>

	<p>
		Yet, a case can be made that the casual, undifferentiated structure of
		a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is one of its
		secret advantages, since forces acting between two parts of the system
		can be directly addressed without having to worry about undermining
		the system’s grander architectural aspirations. These aspirations
		are modest ones at best in the typical <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>. Indeed, a casual approach to architecture is emblematic
		of the early phases of a system’s evolution, as programmers,
		architects and users learn their way around the domain [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">Foote &amp; Opdyke
			1995</a>]. During the <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">PROTOTYPE</a>
		and <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSIONARY
			PHASES</a> of a systems evolution, expedient, white-box inheritance-based
		code borrowing, and a relaxed approach to encapsulation are common.
		Later, as experience with the system accrues, the grain of the
		architectural domain becomes discernable, and more durable black-box
		components begin to emerge. In other words, it’s okay if the
		system looks at first like a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>, at least until you know better.

	<p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> architectures
		often emerge from throw-away prototypes, or <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a>, because the
		prototype is kept, or the disposable code is never disposed of. (One
		might call these "<a href="http://www.muang.com/rice/plant.html">little
			balls of mud</a>".)
	</p>

	<p>
		They also can emerge as gradual maintenance and <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> impinges upon
		the structure of a mature system. Once a system is working, a good way
		to encourage its growth is to <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEP
			IT WORKING</a>. When the <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ShearingLayers">SHEARING
			LAYERS</a> that emerge as change drives the system's evolution run
		against the existing grain of the system, its structure can be
		undermined, and the result can be a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">PROTOTYPE
			PHASE</a> and <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSION
			PHASE</a> patterns in [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote
			&amp; Opdyke 1995</a>] both emphasize that a period of exploration and
		experimentation is often beneficial before making enduring
		architectural commitments.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, these activities, which can undermine a system's structure
		should be interspersed with <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION
			PHASES</a> [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke
			1995</a>], during which opportunities to refactor the system to enhance
		its structure are exploited. Proponents of <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme Programming</a> [Beck
		2000] also emphasize continuous coding and refactoring.
	</p>

	<p>
		[Brand 1994] observes that buildings with large spaces punctuated with
		regular columns had the paradoxical effect of encouraging the
		innovative reuse of space precisely <u>because</u> they <a href="http://laputan.org/chaos/chaos.html"><i>constrained</i></a> the design space.
		Grandiose flights of architectural fancy weren’t possible, which
		reduced the number of design alternatives that could be put on the
		table. Sometimes <a href="http://laputan.org/dfc/discussion.html#O2isEasy">FREEDOM
			FROM CHOICE</a> [Foote 1988] is what we <u>really</u> want.
	</p>

	<p>One of mud's most effective enemies is sunshine. Subjecting
		convoluted code to scrutiny can set the stage for its refactoring,
		repair, and rehabilitation. Code reviews are one mechanism one can use
		to expose code to daylight.</p>

	<p>
		Another is the <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme
			Programming</a> practice of pair programming [Beck 2000]. A pure pair
		programming approach requires that every line of code written be added
		to the system with two programmers present. One types, or "drives",
		while the other "rides shotgun" and looks on. In contrast to
		traditional solitary software production practices, pair programming
		subjects code to immediate scrutiny, and provides a means by which
		knowledge about the system is rapidly disseminated.
	</p>

	<p>Indeed, reviews and pair programming provide programmers with
		something their work would not otherwise have: an audience. Sunlight,
		it is said is a powerful disinfectant. Pair-practices add an element
		of performance to programming. An immediate audience of one's peers
		provides immediate incentives to programmers to keep their code clear
		and comprehensible, as well as functional.</p>

	<p>
		An additional benefit of pairing is that accumulated wisdom and best
		practices can be <a href="http://laputan.org/chaos/chaos.html">rapidly
			disseminated</a> throughout an organization through successive pairings.
		This is, incidentally, the same benefit that sexual reproduction
		brought to the genome.
	</p>

	<p>By contrast, if no one ever looks at code, everyone is free to
		think they are better than average at producing it. Programmers will,
		instead, respond to those relatively perverse incentives that do
		exist. Line of code metrics, design documents, and other indirect
		measurements of progress and quality can become central concerns.</p>

	<p>
		There are three ways to deal with <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. The first is to keep the system healthy.
		Conscientiously alternating periods of <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSION</a> with periods
		of <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION</a>,
		refactoring and repair can maintain, and even enhance a system's
		structure as it evolves. The second is to throw the system away and
		start over. The <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a>
		pattern explores this drastic, but frequently necessary alternative.
		The third is to simply surrender to entropy, and wallow in the mire.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since the time of Roman architect <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/vit/www/index.html">Marcus
			Vitruvius</a>, [<a href="http://www.ukans.edu/history/index/europe/ancient_rome/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/home*.html">Vitruvius
			20 B.C.</a>] architects have focused on his trinity of desirables: <i>Firmitas</i>
		(<b>strength</b>), <i>Utilitas</i> (<b>utility</b>), and <i>Venustas</i>
		(<b>beauty</b>). A <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>
		usually represents a triumph of utility over aesthetics, because
		workmanship is sacrificed for functionality. Structure and durability
		can be sacrificed as well, because an incomprehensible program defies
		attempts at maintenance. The frenzied, feature-driven "bloatware"
		phenomenon seen in many large consumer software products can be seen
		as evidence of designers having allowed purely utilitarian concerns to
		dominate software design.

	<p>A homeowner might erect a temporary storage shed or car port,

		something more permanent. Such structures have a way of enduring
		indefinitely. The money expected to replace them might not become
		available. Or, once the new structure is constructed, the temptation
		to continue to use the old one for "a while" might be hard
		to resist.</p>

	<p>Likewise, when you are prototyping a system, you are not usually
		concerned with how elegant or efficient your code is. You know that
		you will only use it to prove a concept. Once the prototype is done,
		the code will be thrown away and written properly. As the time nears

		<span><i>Time</i>, or a lack thereof, is frequently the

	<p>
		<span> Quick-and-dirty coding is often rationalized as being a

	<p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a> is often written
		as an alternative to reusing someone else’s more complex code.
		When the deadline looms, the certainty that you can produce a sloppy
		program that works yourself can outweigh the unknown cost of learning
		and mastering someone else’s library or framework.
	</p>

	<p>
		Programmers are usually not domain experts, especially at first. Use
		cases or <a href="http://www.c2.com/doc/crc/draw.html">CRC</a> <a href="http://www.du.edu/~mschwart/oo_review.html">cards</a> [<a href="http://c2.com/doc/oopsla89/paper.html">Beck &amp;
			Cunningham 1989</a>] can help them to discover domain objects. However,
		nothing beats building a prototype to help a team learn its way around
		a domain.
	</p>

	<p>When you build a prototype, there is always the risk that
		someone will say "that's good enough, ship it". One way to minimize
		the risk of a prototype being put into production is to write the
		prototype in using a language or tool that you couldn't possibly use

		but should never be mistaken for good designs [<a href="http://laputan.org/drc/drc.html">Johnson &amp; Foote 1988</a>].
	</p>
	Not every program need be a palace. A simple throwaway program is like

	<p>The EuroPLoP/PLoP/UP online registration code was, in effect, a
		distributed web-based application that ran on four different machines
		on two continents. Conference information was maintained on a machine
		in St. Louis, while registration records were kept on machines in
		Illinois and Germany. The system could generate web-based reports of
		registration activity, and now even instantaneously maintaineed an
		online attendees list. It began life in 1995 as a quick-and-dirty
		collection of HTML, scavenged C demonstration code, and csh scripts.
		It was undertaken largely as an experiment in web-based form
		processing prior to PLoP ‘95, and, like so many things on the
		Web, succeeded considerably beyond the expectations of its authors.
		Today, it is still essentially the same collection of HTML, scavenged
		C demonstration code, and csh scripts. As such, it showcases how
		quick-and-dirty code can, when successful, take on a life of its own.</p>

	<p>The original C code and scripts probably contained fewer than
		three dozen original lines of code. Many lines were cut-and-paste jobs
		that differed only in the specific text they generate, or fields that
		they check.</p>

	<p>Here’s an example of one of the scripts that generates the
		attendance report:</p>
	<span face="Lucida Sans Typewriter" size="2">

		<p>
			echo "&lt;H2&gt;Registrations: &lt;B&gt;" `ls | wc -l`
			"&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;"<br> echo
			"&lt;CODE&gt;"<br> echo "Authors: &lt;B&gt;"
			`grep 'Author = Yes' * | wc -l` "&lt;/B&gt;"<br> echo
			"&lt;BR&gt;"<br> echo "Non-Authors:
			&lt;B&gt;" `grep 'Author = No' * | wc -l` "&lt;/B&gt;"<br>
			echo "&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"
		</p>
	</span>

	<p>
		This script is slow and inefficient, particularly as the number of
		registrations increases, but not least among its virtues is the fact
		that it<i> works</i>. Were the number of attendees to exceed more than
		around one hundred, this script would start to perform so badly as to
		be unusable. However, since hundreds of attendees would exceed the
		physical capacity of the conference site, we knew the number of
		registrations would have been limited long before the performance of
		this script became a significant problem. So while this approach is,
		in general, a lousy way to address this problem, it is perfectly
		satisfactory within the confines of the particular purpose for which
		the script has ever actually been used. Such practical constraints are
		typical of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a>, and
		are more often than not undocumented. For that matter, everything
		about <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a> is more
		often than not undocumented. When documentation exists, it is
		frequently not current, and often not accurate.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Wiki-Web <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MoreAboutMechanics">code</a>
		at <a href="http://www.c2.com/">www.c2.com</a> also started as a CGI
		experiment undertaken by Ward Cunningham also succeeded beyond the
		author’s expectations. The name "wiki" is one of
		Ward’s personal jokes, having been taken from a Hawaiian word for
		"quick" that the author had seen on an airport van on a
		vacation in Hawaii. Ward has subsequently used the name for a number
		of quick-and-dirty projects. The Wiki Web is unusual in that <u>any</u>
		visitor may change anything that anyone else has written
		indiscriminately. This would seem like a recipe for vandalism, but in
		practice, it has worked out well. In light of the system’s
		success, the author has subsequently undertaken additional work to
		polish it up, but the same quick-and-dirty Perl CGI core remains at
		the heart of the system.
	</p>

	<p>
		Both systems might be thought of as being on the verge of graduating
		from little balls of mud to <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. The registration system’s C code <i><a href="http://laputan.org/dfc/discussion.html#Skeletons">metastasized</a></i> from one of
		the NCSA HTTPD server demos, and still contains zombie code that
		testifies to this heritage. At each step, <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEPING IT WORKING</a> is a premiere
		consideration in deciding whether to extend or enhance the system.
		Both systems might be good candidates for <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a>, were the
		resources, interest, and audience present to justify such an
		undertaking. In the mean time, these systems, which are still
		sufficiently well suited to the particular tasks for which they were
		built, remain in service. Keeping them on the air takes far less
		energy than rewriting them. They continue to evolve, in a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL</a> fashion, a little at a
		time.
	</p>

	<p>You can ameloriate the architectural erosion that can be caused
		by quick-and-dirty code by isolating it from other parts of your
		system, in its own objects, packages, or modules. To the extent that
		such code can be quarantined, its ability to affect the integrity of
		healthy parts of a system is reduced.</p>

	<p>
		Once it becomes evident that a purportedly disposable artifact is
		going to be around for a while, one can turn one's attention to
		improving its structure, either through an iterative process of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a>, or via a fresh

		Urban planning has an <a href="http://www.architectureweek.com/2001/0822/culture_1-2.html">uneven</a>
		history of success. For instance, Washington D.C. was laid out
		according to a <a href="http://www.nbm.org/Capital/">master plan</a>
		designed by the French architect <a href="http://www.nps.gov/nama/lenfant.htm">L’Enfant</a>. The
		capitals of
		<!-- Was: http://www1.estado.com.br/english/brasil/brasili2.html -->
		Brazil (<a href="http://www.macalstr.edu/~geograph/world-urbanization/jmoersch/geography.html">Brasilia</a>)
		and Nigeria (<a href="http://cityguide.lycos.com/africa/westcentral_africa/NGAAbuja.html">Abuja</a>)
		started as paper cities as well. Other cities, such as <a href="http://www.patternlanguage.com/leveltwo/archivesframe.htm?/leveltwo/../archives/alexander1.htm">Houston</a>,
		have grown without any overarching plan to guide them. Each approach
		has its problems. For instance, the radial street plans in
		L’Enftant’s master plan become awkward past a certain
		distance from the center. The lack of any plan at all, on the other
		hand, leads to a patchwork of residential, commercial, and industrial
		areas that is dictated by the capricious interaction of local forces
		such as land ownership, capital, and zoning. Since concerns such as
		recreation, shopping close to homes, and noise and pollution away from
		homes are not brought directly into the mix, they are not adequately
		addressed.
	</p>

	<p>Most cities are more like Houston than Abuja. They may begin as
		settlements, subdivisions, docks, or railway stops. Maybe people were
		drawn by gold, or lumber, access to transportation, or empty land. As
		time goes on, certain settlements achieve a critical mass, and a
		positive feedback cycle ensues. The city’s success draws
		tradesmen, merchants, doctors, and clergymen. The growing population
		is able to support infrastructure, governmental institutions, and
		police protection. These, in turn, draw more people. Different
		sections of town develop distinct identities. With few exceptions,
		(Salt Lake City comes to mind) the founders of these settlements never
		stopped to think that they were founding major cities. Their ambitions
		were usually more modest, and immediate.</p>

	<p>It has become fashionable over the last several years to take
		pot shots at the "traditional" waterfall process model. It may seem to
		the reader that attacking it is tantamount to flogging a dead horse.
		However, if it be a dead horse, it is a tenacious one. While the
		approach itself is seen by many as having been long since discredited,
		it has spawned a legacy of rigid, top-down, front-loaded processes and
		methodologies that endure, in various guises, to this day. We can do
		worse that examine the forces that led to its original development.</p>

	<p>
		In the days before waterfall development, programming pioneers
		employed a simple, casual, relatively undisciplined "code-and-fix"
		approach to software development. Given the primitive nature of the
		problems of the day, this approach was frequently effective. However,
		the result of this lack of discipline was, all too often, a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>The waterfall approach arose in response to this muddy morass.
		While the code-and-fix approach might have been suitable for small
		jobs, it did not scale well. As software became more complex, it would
		not do to simply gather a room full of programmers together and tell
		them to go forth and code. Larger projects demanded better planning
		and coordination. Why, it was asked, can't software be engineered like
		cars and bridges, with a careful analysis of the problem, and a
		detailed up-front design prior to implementation? Indeed, an
		examination of software development costs showed that problems were
		many times more expensive to fix during maintenance than during
		design. Surely it was best to mobilize resources and talent up-front,
		so as to avoid maintenance expenses down the road. It's surely wiser
		to route the plumbing correctly now, before the walls are up, than to
		tear holes in them later. Measure twice, cut once.</p>

	<p>One of the reasons that the waterfall approach was able to
		flourish a generation ago was that computers and business requirements
		changed at a more leisurely pace. Hardware was very expensive, often
		dwarfing the salaries of the programmers hired to tend it. User
		interfaces were primitive by today's standards. You could have any
		user interface you wanted, as long as it was an alphanumeric "green
		screen". Another reason for the popularity of the waterfall approach
		was that it exhibited a comfortable similarity to practices in more
		mature engineering and manufacturing disciplines.</p>

	<p>Today's designers are confronted with a broad onslaught of
		changing requirements. It arises in part from the rapid growth of
		technology itself, and partially from rapid changes in the business
		climate (some of which is driven by technology). Customers are used to
		more sophisticated software these days, and demand more choice and
		flexibility. Products that were once built from the ground up by
		in-house programmers must now be integrated with third-party code and
		applications. User interfaces are complex, both externally and
		internally. Indeed, we often dedicate an entire tier of our system to
		their care and feeding. Change threatens to outpace our ability to
		cope with it.</p>

	<p><span><b>Master plans are often
						rigid, misguided and out of date. Users’ needs change with
						time.</b></span></p>

	<p>
		<i>Change:</i> The fundamental problem with top-down design is that
		real world requirement are inevitably moving targets. You can't simply
		aspire to solve the problem at hand once and for all, because, by the
		time you're done, the problem will have changed out from underneath
		you. You can't simply do what the customer wants, for quite often,
		they don't know what they want. You can't simply plan, you have to
		plan to be able to adapt. If you can't fully anticipate what is going
		to happen, you must be prepared to be nimble.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Aesthetics:</i> The goal of up-front design is to be able to
		discern and specify the significant architectural elements of a system
		before ground is broken for it. A superior design, given this mindset,
		is one that elegantly and completely specifies the system's structure
		before a single line of code has been written. Mismatches between
		these blueprints and reality are considered aberrations, and are
		treated as mistakes on the part of the designer. A better design would
		have anticipated these oversights. In the presence of volatile
		requirements, aspirations towards such design perfection are as vain
		as the desire for a hole-in-one on every hole.
	</p>

	<p>To avoid such embarrassment, the designer may attempt to cover
		him or herself by specifying a more complicated, and more general
		solution to certain problems, secure in the knowledge that others will
		bear the burden of constructing these artifacts. When such predictions
		about where complexity is needed are correct, they can indeed be a
		source of power and satisfaction. This is part of their allure of
		Venustas. However, sometime the anticipated contingencies never arise,
		and the designer and implementers wind up having wasted effort solving
		a problem that no one has ever actually had. Other times, not only is
		the anticipated problem never encountered, its solution introduces
		complexity in a part of the system that turns out to need to evolve in
		another direction. In such cases, speculative complexity can be an
		unnecessary obstacle to subsequent adaptation. It is ironic that the
		impulse towards elegance can be an unintended source of complexity and
		clutter instead.</p>

	<p>In its most virulent form, the desire to anticipate and head off
		change can lead to "analysis paralysis", as the thickening web of
		imagined contingencies grows to the point where the design space seems
		irreconcilably constrained.</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, incrementally
					address forces that encourage change and growth. Allow
					opportunities for growth to be exploited <u>locally</u>, as they
					occur. Refactor unrelentingly.</b></p>

	<p>
		Successful software attracts a wider audience, which can, in turn,
		place a broader range of requirements on it. These new requirements
		can run against the grain of the original design. Nonetheless, they
		can frequently be addressed, but at the cost of cutting across the
		grain of existing architectural assumptions. [Foote 1988] called this
		architectural erosion <i><a href="http://laputan.org/dfc/discussion.html#Specificity">midlife generality loss</a></i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		When designers are faced with a choice between building something
		elegant from the ground up, or undermining the architecture of the
		existing system to quickly address a problem, architecture usually
		loses. Indeed, this is a natural phase in a system’s evolution [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke 1995</a>]. This
		might be thought of as <i>messy kitchen</i> phase, during which pieces
		of the system are scattered across the counter, awaiting an eventual
		cleanup. The danger is that the clean up is never done. With real
		kitchens, the board of health will eventually intervene. With
		software, alas, there is seldom any corresponding agency to police
		such squalor. Uncontrolled growth can ultimately be a malignant force.
		The result of neglecting to contain it can be a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In <i>How Buildings Learn</i>, Brand [Brand 1994] observed that what
		he called <i>High Road</i> architecture often resulted in buildings
		that were expensive and difficult to change, while vernacular, <i>Low
			Road</i> buildings like bungalows and warehouses were, paradoxically,
		much more adaptable. Brand noted that <i>Function melts form</i>, and
		low road buildings are more amenable to such change. Similarly, with
		software, you may be reluctant to desecrate another programmer’s
		cathedral. Expedient changes to a low road system that exhibits no
		discernable architectural pretensions to begin with are easier to
		rationalize.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the Oregon Experiment [Brand 1994][Alexander 1988] <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/ca/ca/ca.html">Alexander</a> noted:
	</p>
	<dir>
		<i> Large-lump development is based on the idea of <b>replacement</b>.
			Piecemeal Growth is based on the idea of <b>repair</b>. …
			Large-lump development is based on the fallacy that it is possible to
			build perfect buildings. Piecemeal growth is based on the healthier
			and more realistic view that mistakes are inevitable. … Unless
			money is available for repairing these mistakes, every building, once
			built, is condemned to be, to some extent unworkable. …
			Piecemeal growth is based on the assumption that adaptation between
			buildings and their users is necessarily a slow and continuous
			business which cannot, under any circumstances, be achieve in a
			single leap.
		</i>
	</dir>

	<p>Alexander has noted that our mortgage and capital expenditure
		policies make large sums of money available up front, but do nothing
		to provide resources for maintenance, improvement, and evolution
		[Brand 1994][Alexander 1988]. In the software world, we deploy our
		most skilled, experienced people early in the lifecycle. Later on,
		maintenance is relegated to junior staff, when resources can be
		scarce. The so-called maintenance phase is the part of the lifecycle
		in which the price of the fiction of master planning is really paid.
		It is maintenance programmers who are called upon to bear the burden
		of coping with the ever widening divergence between fixed designs and
		a continuously changing world. If the hypothesis that architectural
		insight emerges late in the lifecycle is correct, then this practice
		should be reconsidered.</p>

	<p>
		Brand went on to observe <i>Maintenance <b>is</b> learning.
		</i>He distinguishes three levels of learning in the context of systems.
		This first is habit, where a system dutifully serves its function
		within the parameters for which it was designed. The second level
		comes into play when the system must adapt to change. Here, it usually
		must be modified, and its capacity to sustain such modification
		determines it’s degree of adaptability. The third level is the
		most interesting: <i>learning to learn</i>. With buildings, adding a
		raised floor is an example. Having had to sustain a major upheaval,
		the system adapts so that subsequent adaptations will be much less
		painful.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> can be
		undertaken in an opportunistic fashion, starting with the existing,
		living, breathing system, and working outward, a step at a time, in
		such a way as to not undermine the system’s viability. You
		enhance the program as you use it. Broad advances on all fronts are
		avoided. Instead, change is broken down into small, manageable chunks.
	</p>

	<p>
		One of the most striking things about <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> is the role
		played by <i>Feedback</i>. Herbert Simon [Simon 1969] has observed
		that few of the adaptive systems that have been forged by evolution or
		shaped by man depend on prediction as their main means of coping with
		the future. He notes that two complementary mechanisms, homeostasis,
		and retrospective feedback, are often far more effective. Homeostasis
		insulates the system from short-range fluctuations in its environment,
		while feedback mechanisms respond to long-term discrepancies between a
		system's actual and desired behavior, and adjust it accordingly.
		Alexander [Alexander 1964] has written extensively of the roles that
		homeostasis and feedback play in adaptation as well.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you can adapt quickly to change, predicting it becomes far less
		crucial. Hindsight, as Brand observes [Brand 1994] is better than
		foresight. Such rapid adaptation is the basis of one of the mantras of
		<a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme Programming</a> [Beck
		2000]: <i>You're not going to need it</i>.
	</p>

	<p>Proponents of XP (as it is called) say to pretend you are not a
		smart as you think you are, and wait until this clever idea of yours
		is actually required before you take the time to bring it into being.
		In the cases where you were right, hey, you saw it coming, and you
		know what to do. In the cases where you were wrong, you won't have
		wasted any effort solving a problem you've never had when the design
		heads in an unanticipated direction instead.</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme Programming</a> relies
		heavily on feedback to keep requirements in sync with code, by
		emphasizing short (three week) iterations, and extensive, continuous
		consultation with users regarding design and development priorities
		throughout the development process. Extreme Programmers do not engage
		in extensive up-front planning. Instead, they produce working code as
		quickly as possible, and steer these prototypes towards what the users
		are looking for based on feedback.
	</p>

	<p>Feedback also plays a role in determining coding assignments.
		Coders who miss a deadline are assigned a different task during the
		next iteration, regardless of how close they may have been to
		completing the task. This form of feedback resembles the stern justice
		meted out by the jungle to the fruit of uncompetitive pairings.</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme Programming</a> also
		emphasizes testing as an integral part of the development process.
		Tests are developed, ideally, before the code itself. Code is
		continuously tested as it is developed.
	</p>

	<p>
		There is a "back-to-the-future" quality to Extreme Programming. In
		many respects, it resembles the blind <i>Code and Fix</i> approach.
		The thing that distinguishes it is the central role played by feedback
		in driving the system's evolution. This evolution is abetted, in turn,
		by modern object-oriented languages and powerful refactoring tools.
	</p>

	<p>Proponents of extreme programming portray it as placing minimal
		emphasis on planning and up-front design. They rely instead on
		feedback and continuous integration. We believe that a certain amount
		of up-front planning and design is not only important, but inevitable.
		No one really goes into any project blindly. The groundwork must be
		laid, the infrastructure must be decided upon, tools must be selected,
		and a general direction must be set. A focus on a shared architectural
		vision and strategy should be established early.</p>

	<p>Unbridled, change can undermine structure. Orderly change can
		enhance it. Change can engender malignant sprawl, or healthy, orderly
		growth.</p>

	<p>
		A broad consensus that objects emerge from an <i>iterative
			incremental</i> evolutionary process has formed in the object-oriented
		community over the last decade. See for instance [Booch 1994]. The <a href="http://laputan.org/metamorphosis/metamorphosis.html#SoftwareTectonics">SOFTWARE
			TECTONICS</a> pattern [Foote &amp; Yoder 1996] examines how systems can
		incrementally cope with change.
	</p>

	<p>
		The biggest risk associated with <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL
			GROWTH</a> is that it will gradually erode the overall structure of the
		system, and inexorably turn it into a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>. A strategy of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEPING
			IT WORKING</a> goes hand in hand with <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL
			GROWTH</a>. Both patterns emphasize acute, local concerns at the expense
		of chronic, architectural ones.
	</p>

	<p>
		To counteract these forces, a permanent commitment to <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION</a> and
		<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Table2">refactoring</a> must be
		made. It is through such a process that local and global forces are
		reconciled over time. This lifecyle perspective has been dubbed the <i><a href="http://laputan.org/frameworks/fractal.html">fractal model</a></i> [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke 1995</a>]. To
		quote Alexander [Brand 1994][Alexander 1988]:
	</p>
	<dir>
		<i>An organic process of growth and repair must create a gradual
			sequence of changes, and these changes must be distributed evenly
			across all levels of scale. [In developing a college campus] there
			must be as much attention to the repair of details—rooms, wings
			of buildings, windows, paths—as to the creation of brand new
			buildings. Only then can the environment be balanced both as a whole,
			and in its parts, at every moment in its history.</i>

	<p>Once a city establishes its infrastructure, it is imperative
		that it be kept working. For example, if the sewers break, and

		merely unpleasant to genuinely life threatening. People come to expect
		that they can rely on their public utilities being available 24 hours
		per day. They (rightfully) expect to be able to demand that an outage
		be treated as an emergency.</p>

	<p>Software can be like this. Often a business becomes dependent
		upon the data driving it. Businesses have become critically dependent
		on their software and computing infrastructures. There are numerous
		mission critical systems that must be on-the-air twenty-four hours a
		day/seven days per week. If these systems go down, inventories can not
		be checked, employees can not be paid, aircraft cannot be routed, and
		so on.</p>

	<p>
		There may be times where taking a system down for a major overhaul can
		be justified, but usually, doing so is fraught with peril. However,
		once the system is brought back up, it is difficult to tell which from
		among a large collection of modifications might have caused a new
		problem. Every change is suspect. This is why deferring such
		integration is a recipe for misery. Capers Jones [Jones 1999] reported
		that the chance that a significant change might contain a new error--a
		phenomenon he ominously referred to as a <i>Bad Fix Injection</i>--
		was about 7% in the United States. This may strike some readers as a
		low figure. Still, it's easy to see that compounding this possibility
		can lead to a situation where multiple upgrades are increasing likely
		to break a system.
	</p>

	<p><b>Maintenance needs have accumulated, but
					an overhaul is unwise, since you might break the system.</b></p>


	<p>
		<i>Workmanship:</i> Architects who live in the house they are building
		have an obvious incentive to insure that things are done properly,
		since they will directly reap the consequences when they do not. The
		idea of the architect-builder is a central theme of Alexander's work.
		Who better to resolve the forces impinging upon each design issue as
		it arises as the person who is going to have to live with these
		decisions? The architect-builder will be the direct beneficiary of his
		or her own workmanship and care. Mistakes and shortcuts will merely
		foul his or her own nest.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Dependability:</i> These days, people rely on our software
		artifacts for their very livelihoods, and even, at time, for their
		very safety. It is imperative that ill-advise changes to elements of a
		system do not drag the entire system down. Modern software systems are
		intricate, elaborate webs of interdependent elements. When an
		essential element is broken, everyone who depends on it will be
		affected. Deadlines can be missed, and tempers can flare. This problem
		is particularly acute in <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS
			OF MUD</a>, since a single failure can bring the entire system down like
		a house of cards.
	</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, do what it
					takes to maintain the software and keep it going. Keep it working.</b></p>

	<p>When you are living in the system you�re building, you have an
		acute incentive not to break anything. A plumbing outage will be a
		direct inconvenience, and hence you have a powerful reason to keep it
		brief. You are, at times, working with live wires, and must exhibit
		particular care. A major benefit of working with a live system is that
		feedback is direct, and nearly immediate.</p>

	<p>
		One of the strengths of this strategy is that modifications that break
		the system are rejected immediately. There are always a large number
		of paths forward from any point in a system’s evolution, and most
		of them lead nowhere. By immediately selecting only those that do <u>not</u>
		undermine the system’s viability, obvious dead-ends are avoided.
	</p>

	<p>
		Of course, this sort of reactive approach, that of kicking the
		nearest, meanest woolf from your door, is not necessarily globally
		optimal. Yet, by eliminating obvious wrong turns, <u>only</u> more
		insidiously incorrect paths remain. While these are always harder to
		identify and correct, they are, fortunately less numerous than those
		cases where the best immediate choice is also the best overall choice
		as well.
	</p>

	<p>It may seem that this approach only accommodates minor
		modifications. This is not necessarily so. Large new subsystems might
		be constructed off to the side, perhaps by separate teams, and
		integrated with the running system in such a way as to minimize
		distruption.</p>

	<p>Design space might be thought of as a vast, dark, largely
		unexplored forest. Useful potential paths through it might be thought
		of as encompassing working programs. The space off to the sides of
		these paths is much larger realm of non-working programs. From any
		given point, a few small steps in most directions take you from a
		working to a non-working program. From time to time, there are forks
		in the path, indicating a choice among working alternatives. In
		unexplored territory, the prudent strategy is never to stray too far
		from the path. Now, if one has a map, a shortcut through the trekless
		thicket that might save miles may be evident. Of course, pioneers, by
		definition, don’t have maps. By taking small steps in any
		direction, they know that it is never more than a few steps back to a
		working system.</p>

		<span face="Courier New" size="2"><b>R. V. O'Neill </b>, <i>A
				Hierarchical Concept of Ecosystems</i></span>
	</p>
	<p>
		The notion of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ShearingLayers">SHEARING LAYERS</a> is
		one of the centerpieces of Brand's <i>How Buildings Learn</i> [Brand
		1994]. Brand, in turn synthesized his ideas from a variety of sources,
		including British designer Frank Duffy, and ecologist R. V. O'Neill.
	</p>
	<a href="http://laputan.org/images/figures/shearing-layers.gif"> <img src="http://laputan.org/images/figures/shearing-small.gif" alt="Brand, Page 13">
	</a>

	<p>Brand quotes Duffy as saying: "Our basic argument is that there
		isn't any such thing as a building. A building properly conceived is
		several layers of longevity of built components".</p>

	<p>Brand distilled Duffy's proposed layers into these six: Site,
		Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff. Site is geographical
		setting. Structure is the load bearing elements, such as the
		foundation and skeleton. Skin is the exterior surface, such as siding
		and windows. Services are the circulatory and nervous systems of a
		building, such as its heating plant, wiring, and plumbing. The Space
		Plan includes walls, flooring, and ceilings. Stuff includes lamps,
		chairs, appliances, bulletin boards, and paintings.</p>

	<p>These layers change at different rates. Site, they say, is
		eternal. Structure may last from 30 to 300 years. Skin lasts for
		around 20 years, as it responds to the elements, and to the whims of
		fashion. Services succumb to wear and technical obsolescence more
		quickly, in 7 to 15 years. Commercial Space Plans may turn over every
		3 years. Stuff, is, of course, subject to unrelenting flux [Brand
		1994].</p>

		Software systems cannot stand still. Software is often called upon to
		bear the brunt of changing requirements, because, being as that it is
		made of bits, it <u>can</u> change.
	</p>

	<p><span><b>Different artifacts change
						at different rates.</b></span></p>

	<p>
		<i>Adaptability:</i> A system that can cope readily with a wide range
		of requirements, will, all other things being equal, have an advantage
		over one that cannot. Such a system can allow unexpected requirements
		to be met with little or no reengineering, and allow its more skilled
		customers to rapidly address novel challenges.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Stability:</i> Systems succeed by doing what they were designed to
		do as well as they can do it. They earn their niches, by bettering
		their competition along one or more dimensions such as cost, quality,
		features, and performance. See [<a href="http://laputan.org/lingua/lingua.html">Foote
			&amp; Roberts 1998</a>] for a discussion of the occasionally fickle nature of
		such completion. Once they have found their niche, for whatever
		reason, it is essential that short term concerns not be allowed to
		wash away the elements of the system that account for their mastery of
		their niche. Such victories are inevitably hard won, and fruits of
		such victories should not be squandered. Those parts of the system
		that do what the system does well must be protected from fads, whims,
		and other such spasms of poor judgement.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Adaptability</i> and <i>Stability</i> are forces that are in
		constant tension. On one hand, systems must be able to confront
		novelty without blinking. On the other, they should not squander their
		patrimony on spur of the moment misadventures.
	</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, factor your
					system so that artifacts that change at similar rates are together.</b></p>

	<p>
		Most interactions in a system tend to be within layers, or between
		adjacent layers. Individual layers tend to be about things that change
		at similar rates. Things that change at different rates diverge.
		Differential rates of change encourage layers to emerge. Brand notes
		as well that occupational specialties emerge along with these layers.
		The rate at which things change shapes our organizations as well. For
		instance, decorators and painters concern themselves with interiors,
		while architects dwell on site and skin. We expect to see things that
		evolve at different rates emerge as distinct concerns. This is <a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/~droberts/evolve.html#SeparateChangeable">"separate
			that which changes from that which doesn't"</a> [<a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/~droberts/evolve.html">Roberts
			&amp; Johnson 1998</a>] writ large.
	</p>

	<p>Can we identify such layers in software?</p>

	<p>Well, at the bottom, there are data. Things that change most
		quickly migrate into the data, since this is the aspect of software
		that is most amenable to change. Data, in turn, interact with users
		themselves, who produce and consume them.</p>

	<p>Code changes more slowly than data, and is the realm of
		programmers, analysts and designers. In object-oriented languages,
		things that will change quickly are cast as black-box polymorphic
		components. Elements that will change less often may employ white-box
		inheritance.</p>

	<p>The abstract classes and components that constitute an
		object-oriented framework change more slowly than the applications
		that are built from them. Indeed, their role is to distill what is
		common, and enduring, from among the applications that seeded the
		framework.</p>

	<p>
		As frameworks evolve, certain abstractions make their ways from
		individual applications into the frameworks and libraries that
		constitute the system's infrastructure [<a href="http://laputan.org/dfc/discussion.html">Foote 1988</a>]. Not all elements will
		make this journey. Not all should. Those that do are among the most
		valuable legacies of the projects that spawn them. Objects help
		shearing layers to emerge, because they provide places where more
		fine-grained chunks of code and behavior that belong together can
		coalesce.
	</p>

	<p>The Smalltalk programming language is built from a set of
		objects that have proven themselves to be of particular value to
		programmers. Languages change more slowly than frameworks. They are
		the purview of scholars and standards committees. One of the
		traditional functions of such bodies is to ensure that languages
		evolve at a suitably deliberate pace.</p>

	<p>Artifacts that evolve quickly provide a system with dynamism and
		flexibility. They allow a system to be fast on its feet in the face of
		change.</p>

	<p>Slowly evolving objects are bulwarks against change. They embody
		the wisdom that the system has accrued in its prior interactions with
		its environment. Like tenure, tradition, big corporations, and
		conservative politics, they maintain what has worked. They worked
		once, so they are kept around. They had a good idea once, so maybe
		they are a better than even bet to have another one.</p>

	<p>Wide acceptance and deployment causes resistance to change. If
		changing something will break a lot of code, there is considerable
		incentive not to change it. For example, schema reorganization in
		large enterprise databases can be an expensive and time-consuming
		process. Database designers and administrators learn to resist change
		for this reason. Separate job descriptions, and separate hardware,
		together with distinct tiers, help to make these tiers distinct.</p>

	<p>The phenomenon whereby distinct concerns emerge as distinct
		layers and tiers can be seen as well with graphical user interfaces.</p>

	<p>
		Part of the impetus behind using <a href="http://laputan.org/metadata/metadata.html#Metadata">METADATA</a> [<a href="http://laputan.org/metadata/metadata.html">Foote &amp; Yoder 1998b</a>] is the
		observation that pushing complexity and power into the data pushes
		that same power (and complexity) out of the realm of the programmer
		and into the realm of users themselves. Metadata are often used to
		model static facilities such as classes and schemas, in order to allow
		them to change dynamically. The effect is analogous to that seen with
		modular office furniture, which allows office workers to easily,
		quickly, and cheaply move partitions without having to enlist
		architects and contractors in the effort.
	</p>

	<p>Over time, our frameworks, abstract classes, and components come
		to embody what we've learned about the structure of the domains for
		which they are built. More enduring insights gravitate towards the
		primary structural elements of these systems. Things which find
		themselves in flux are spun out into the data, where users can
		interact with them. Software evolution becomes like a centrifuge spun
		by change. The layers that result, over time, can come to a much truer
		accommodation with the forces that shaped them than any top-down
		agenda could have devised.</p>

	<p>
		<span face="Courier New" size="2">Things that are good have a
			certain kind of structure. You can�t get that structure except
			dynamically. Period. In nature you�ve got continuous
			very-small-feedback-loop adaptation going on, which is why things get
			to be harmonious. That�s why they have the qualities we value. If it
			wasn�t for the time dimension, it wouldn�t happen. Yet here we are
			playing the major role creating the world, and we haven�t figured
			this out. That is a very serious matter.</span>

		long row to hoe, however. Distilling meaningful abstractions from a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is a difficult and
		demand task. It requires skill, insight, and persistence. At times, <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a> may seem like the
		less painful course. Still, it is not like unscrambling an egg. As
		with rehabilitation in the real world, restoring a system to
		architectural health requires resources, as well as a sustained
		commitment on the part of the people who live there.

	<p>Atlanta’s Fulton County Stadium was built in 1966 to serve
		as the home of baseball’s Atlanta Braves, and football’s
		Atlanta Falcons. In August of 1997, the stadium was demolished. Two
		factors contributed to its relatively rapid obsolescence. One was that
		the architecture of the original stadium was incapable of
		accommodating the addition of the "sky-box" suites that the
		spreadsheets of ‘90s sporting economics demanded. No conceivable
		retrofit could accommodate this requirement. Addressing it meant
		starting over, from the ground up. The second was that the
		stadium’s attempt to provide a cheap, general solution to the
		problem of providing a forum for both baseball and football audiences
		compromised the needs of both. In only thirty-one years, the balance
		among these forces had shifted decidedly. The facility is being
		replaced by two new single-purpose stadia.</p>

	<p>Might there be lessons for us about unexpected requirements and
		designing general components here?</p>

		<span face="Courier New" size="2"> <i>Plan to Throw One Away
				(You Will Anyway)</i> -- Brooks
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>Extreme Programming [Beck 2000] had its genesis in the Chrysler
		Comprehensive Compensation project (C3). It began with a cry for help
		from a foundering project, and a decision to discard a year and a
		half's worth of work. The process they put in place after they started
		anew laid the foundation for XP, and the author's credit these
		approaches for the subsequent success of the C3 effort. However, less
		emphasis is given to value of the experience the team might have
		salvaged from their initial, unsuccessful draft. Could this first
		draft have been the unsung hero of this tale?</p>

	<p><span><b>Your code has declined to
						the point where it is beyond repair, or even comprehension.</b></span></p>


	<p>
		<i>Obsolescence</i>: Of course, one reason to abandon a system is that
		it is in fact technically or economically obsolete. These are distinct
		situations. A system that is no longer state-of-the-art may still sell
		well, while a technically superior system may be overwhelmed by a more
		popular competitor for non-technical reasons.
	</p>

	<p>In the realm of concrete and steel, blight is the symptom, and a
		withdrawal of capital is the cause. Of course, once this process
		begins, it can feed on itself. On the other hand, given a steady
		infusion of resources, buildings can last indefinitely. It's not
		merely entropy, but an unwillingness to counteract it, that allows
		buildings to decline. In Europe, neighborhoods have flourished for
		hundreds of years. They have avoided the boom/bust cycles that
		characterize some New World cities.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Change:</i> Even though software is a highly malleable medium, like
		Fulton County Stadium, new demands can, at times, cut across a
		system’s architectural assumptions in such a ways as to make
		accommodating them next to impossible. In such cases, a total rewrite
		might be the only answer.
	</p>


	<p>
		<i>Cost</i>: Writing-off a system can be traumatic, both to those who
		have worked on it, and to those who have paid for it. Software is
		often treated as an asset by accountants, and can be an expensive
		asset at that. Rewriting a system, of course, does not discard its
		conceptual design, or its staff’s experience. If it is truly the
		case that the value of these assets is in the design experience they
		embody, then accounting practices must recognize this.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Organization:</i> Rebuilding a system from scratch is a
		high-profile undertaking, that will demand considerable time and
		resources, which, in turn, will make high-level management support
		essential.
	</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, throw it away
					and start over.</b></p>

	<p>Sometimes it’s just easier to throw a system away, and
		start over. Examples abound. Our shelves are littered with the
		discarded carcasses of obsolete software and its documentation.
		Starting over can be seen as a defeat at the hands of the old code, or
		a victory over it.</p>
	<a href="http://www.sheridanc.on.ca/~randy/design.dir/disaster.dir/disaster.htm">
		<img src="http://laputan.org/images/pictures/pruitt3.jpg" alt="Pruitt-Igoe">
	</a>

	<p>One reason to start over might be that the previous system was
		written by people who are long gone. Doing a rewrite provides new
		personnel with a way to reestablish contact between the architecture
		and the implementation. Sometimes the only way to understand a system
		it is to write it yourself. Doing a fresh draft is a way to overcome
		neglect. Issues are revisited. A fresh draft adds vigor. You draw back
		to leap. The quagmire vanishes. The swamp is drained.</p>

	<p>Another motivation for building a new system might be that you
		feel that you've got the experience you need to do the job properly.
		One way to have gotten this experience is to have participated at some
		level in the unsuccessful development of a previous version of the
		system.</p>

	<p>Of course, the new system is not designed in a vacuum.
		Brook’s famous tar pit is excavated, and the fossils are
		examined, to see what they can tell the living. It is essential that a
		thorough post-mortem review be done of the old system, to see what it
		did well, and why it failed. Bad code can bog down a good design. A
		good design can isolate and contain bad code.</p>

	<p>
		When a system becomes a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL
			OF MUD</a>, its relative incomprehensibility may hasten its demise, by
		making it difficult for it to adapt. It can persist, since it resists
		change, but cannot evolve, for the same reason. Instead, its
		inscrutability, even when it is to its s hort-term benefit, sows the
		seeds of its ultimate demise.
	</p>

	<p>If this makes muddiness a frequently terminal condition, is this
		really a bad thing? Or is it a blessing that these sclerotic systems
		yield the stage to more agile successors? Certainly, the departure of
		these ramshackle relics can be a cause for celebration as well as
		sadness.</p>
	<a href="http://www.webslingerz.com/~jhoffman/chcat.html"> <img src="http://laputan.org/images/pictures/chcat1.gif" alt="Cheshire Cat">
	</a>
	<p>Discarding a system dispenses with its implementation, and
		leaves only its conceptual design behind. Only the patterns that
		underlie the system remain, grinning like a Cheshire cat. It is their
		spirits that help to shape the next implementation. With luck, these
		architectural insights will be reincarnated as genuine reusable
		artifacts in the new system, such as abstract classes and frameworks.
		It is by finding these architectural nuggets that the promise of
		objects and reuse can finally be fulfilled.</p>

	<p>
		There are alternatives to throwning your system away and starting
		over. One is to embark on a regimen of incremental refactoring, to
		glean architectural elements and discernable abstractions from the
		mire. Indeed, you can begin by looking for coarse fissures along which
		to separate parts of the system, as was suggested in <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#SweepingItUnderTheRug">SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG</a>.
		Of course, refactoring is more effective as a prophylactic measure
		that as a last-restort therapy. As with any edifice, it is a judgement
		call, whether to rehab or restort for the wrecking ball. Another
		alternative is to reassess whether new components and frameworks have
		come along that can replace all or part of the system. When you can
		reuse and retrofit other existing components, you can spare yourself
		the time and expense involved in rebuilding, repairing, and
		maintaining the one you have.

		The United States Commerce Department defines <i>durable goods</i> as
		those that are designed to last for three years or more. This category
		traditionally applied to goods such as furniture, appliances,
		automobiles, and business machines. Ironically, as computer equipment
		is depreciating ever more quickly, it is increasingly our software
		artifacts, and not our hardware, that fulfill this criterion. Firmitas
		has come to the realm of bits and bytes.

	<p>
		In the end, software architecture is about how we distill experience
		into wisdom, and disseminate it. We think the patterns herein stand
		alongside other work regarding software architecture and evolution
		that we cited as we went along. Still, we do not consider these
		patterns to be anti-patterns. There are good reasons that good
		programmers build <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS OF MUD</a>.
		It may well be that the economics of the software world are such that
		the market moves so fast that long term architectural ambitions are
		foolhardy, and that expedient, slash-and-burn, disposable programming
		is, in fact, a state-of-the-art strategy. The success of these
		approaches, in any case, is undeniable, and seals their pattern-hood.
		People build
	</p><p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS OF MUD</a> because they <u>work</u>.
		In many domains, they are the only things that have been shown to
		work. Indeed, they work where loftier approaches have yet to
		demonstrate that they can compete.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is not our purpose to condemn <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. Casual architecture is natural during the early stages
		of a system’s evolution. The reader must surely suspect, however,
		that our hope is that we can aspire to do better. By recognizing the
		forces and pressures that lead to architectural malaise, and how and
		when they might be confronted, we hope to set the stage for the
		emergence of truly durable artifacts that can put architects in
		dominant positions for years to come. The key is to ensure that the
		system, its programmers, and, indeed the entire organization, <i>learn</i>
		about the domain, and the architectural opportunities looming within
		it, as the system grows and matures.
	</p>

	<p>
		Periods of moderate disorder are a part of the ebb and flow of
		software evolution. As a master chef tolerates a messy kitchen,
		developers must not be afraid to get a little mud on their shoes as
		they explore new territory for the first time. Architectural insight
		is not the product of master plans, but of hard won experience. The
		software architects of yesteryear had little choice other than to
		apply the lessons they learned in successive drafts of their systems,
		since <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a> was often
		the only practical means they had of supplanting a mediocre system
		with a better one. Objects, frameworks, components, and refactoring
		tools provide us with another alternative. Objects present a medium
		for expressing our architectural ideas at a level between
		coarse-grained applications and components and low level code.
		Refactoring tools and techniques finally give us the means to
		cultivate these artifacts as they evolve, and capture these insights.

		The onion-domed <i>Church of the Intercession of the Virgin on the
			Moat</i> in Moscow is one of Russia's most famous landmarks. It was built
		by Tsar Ivan IV just outside of the Kremlin walls in 1552 to
		commemorate Russia's victory over the Tatars at Kazan. The church is
		better known by it's nickname, St. Basil's. Ivan too is better known
		by his nickname "Ivan the Terrible". Legend has it that once the
		cathedral was completed, Ivan, ever true to his reputation, had the
		architects blinded, so that they could never build anything more
		beautiful. Alas, the state of software architecture today is such that
		few of us need fear for our eyesight.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at a press conference Wednesday on Capitol Hill. "There is no reason why members of&nbsp;Congress&nbsp;ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get."</p><p>The proposal is the latest chapter in a yearslong <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-opposes-banning-stock-buys-by-congress-members.html">saga</a> in Congress to pass regulations that limit lawmakers' ability to buy and sell stocks, and the first one to get formal consideration by a Senate committee — in this case the Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs&nbsp;Committee&nbsp;on July 24.</p><p>Ethics experts say that legislators' access to the kind of information they receive gives them the potential of having an unfair advantage to the investing public.</p><p>Wednesday's amendment to an existing stock trading ban bill would immediately forbid members of Congress, the president and the vice president from purchasing stocks and other covered investments. It would also give lawmakers 90 days to sell their stocks.</p><p>Sens. Hawley, Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Gary Peters, D-Mich., negotiated and announced the new details.</p><p>If passed, the bill would also prohibit lawmakers' spouses and dependent children from trading stocks, beginning March 2027. Also starting that year, the U.S. president, vice president and all members of Congress would have to divest from any covered investments.</p><p>The penalty for violating the divestment mandate, as proposed by the senators, would cost a lawmaker&nbsp;the greater amount of&nbsp;either their monthly salary, or 10% of the value of each covered asset in violation.</p><p>The effort to bar members of Congress from trading stocks has been an uphill battle since at least the start of the Biden administration.</p><p>Ossoff first introduced a ban in 2021 and put his own stock portfolio in a blind trust as an example.</p><p>The effort was turbocharged by disclosures that several senators made very profitable trades in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, when members of Congress were getting classified briefings that warned of how disastrous the virus could be for the U.S. economy. The FBI launched insider trading investigations into three senators, but eventually ended the probe without making any charges.</p><p>The effort picked up more steam ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, after former Democratic House Speaker <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-opposes-banning-stock-buys-by-congress-members.html">Nancy Pelosi</a> dropped her opposition to it.</p><p>Pelosi's husband is a multimillionaire investor Paul Pelosi, who regularly makes large and profitable stock trades. The then-speaker had previously written off the trading ban as a misguided effort to prevent lawmakers from participating in the "free market economy."</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

    </div><p>A researcher working alone—apart from the world and the rest of the wider scientific community—is a classic yet misguided image. Research is, in reality, built on continuous exchange within the scientific community: First you understand the work of others, and then you share your findings.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Reading and writing articles published in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/academic+journals/" rel="tag">academic journals</a> and presented at conferences is a central part of being a researcher. When researchers write a scholarly article, they must cite the work of peers to provide context, detail sources of inspiration and explain differences in approaches and results. A positive citation by other researchers is a key measure of visibility for a researcher's own work.</p>
<p>But what happens when this citation system is manipulated? A recent <i>Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology</i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24896" target="_blank">article</a> by our team of academic sleuths—which includes information scientists, a computer scientist and a mathematician—has revealed an insidious method to artificially inflate citation counts through metadata manipulations: sneaked references.</p>
<h2>Hidden manipulation</h2>
<p>People are becoming more aware of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+publications/" rel="tag">scientific publications</a> and how they work, including their potential flaws. Just last year more than <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8" target="_blank">10,000 scientific articles were retracted</a>. The issues around citation gaming and the harm it causes the scientific community, including damaging its credibility, are well documented.</p>
<p>Citations of scientific work abide by a standardized referencing system: Each reference explicitly mentions at least the title, authors' names, publication year, journal or conference name, and page numbers of the cited publication. These details are stored as metadata, not visible in the article's text directly, but assigned to a digital object identifier, or DOI—a unique identifier for each scientific publication.</p>
<p>References in a scientific publication allow authors to justify methodological choices or present the results of past studies, highlighting the iterative and collaborative nature of science.</p>
<p>However, we found through a chance encounter that some unscrupulous actors have added extra references, invisible in the text but present in the articles' metadata, when they submitted the articles to scientific databases. The result? Citation counts for certain researchers or journals have skyrocketed, even though these references were not cited by the authors in their articles.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Chance discovery</h2>
<p>The investigation began when Guillaume Cabanac, a professor at the University of Toulouse, wrote a post on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A172115FC8D0A5F44B31A18B08BB26" target="_blank">PubPeer</a>, a website dedicated to post-publication peer review, in which scientists discuss and analyze publications. In the post, he detailed how he had noticed an inconsistency: a Hindawi journal article that he suspected was fraudulent because it contained awkward phrases had far more citations than downloads, which is very unusual.</p>
<p>The post caught the attention of several sleuths who are now the authors of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24896" target="_blank">JASIST article</a>. We used a scientific search engine to look for articles citing the initial article. Google Scholar found none, but Crossref and Dimensions did find references. The difference? Google Scholar is likely to mostly rely on the article's main text to extract the references appearing in the bibliography section, whereas Crossref and Dimensions use metadata provided by publishers.</p>
<h2>A new type of fraud</h2>
<p>To understand the extent of the manipulation, we examined three scientific journals that were published by the Technoscience Academy, the publisher responsible for the articles that contained questionable citations.</p>
<p>Our investigation consisted of three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>We listed the references explicitly present in the HTML or PDF versions of an article.</li>
<li>We compared these lists with the metadata recorded by Crossref, discovering extra references added in the metadata but not appearing in the articles.</li>
<li>We checked Dimensions, a bibliometric platform that uses Crossref as a metadata source, finding further inconsistencies.</li>
</ol>

																																			<p>In the journals published by Technoscience Academy, at least 9% of recorded references were "sneaked references." These additional references were only in the metadata, distorting citation counts and giving certain authors an unfair advantage. Some legitimate references were also lost, meaning they were not present in the metadata.</p>
<p>In addition, when analyzing the sneaked references, we found that they highly benefited some researchers. For example, a single researcher who was associated with Technoscience Academy benefited from more than 3,000 additional illegitimate citations. Some journals from the same publisher benefited from a couple hundred additional sneaked citations.</p>
<p>We wanted our results to be externally validated, so we posted our study <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.02192" target="_blank">as a preprint</a>, informed both Crossref and Dimensions of our findings and gave them a link to the preprinted investigation. Dimensions acknowledged the illegitimate citations and confirmed that their database reflects Crossref's data. Crossref <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/09/how-thousands-of-invisible-citations-sneak-into-papers-and-make-for-fake-metrics/" target="_blank">also confirmed</a> the extra references in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/" target="_blank">Retraction Watch</a> and highlighted that this was the first time that it had been notified of such a problem in its database. The publisher, based on Crossref's investigation, has taken action to fix the problem.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Implications and potential solutions</h2>
<p>Why is this discovery important? Citation counts heavily influence research funding, academic promotions and institutional rankings. Manipulating citations can lead to unjust decisions based on false data. More worryingly, this discovery raises questions about the integrity of scientific impact measurement systems, a concern that has been highlighted by researchers for years. These systems can be manipulated to foster unhealthy competition among researchers, tempting them to take shortcuts to publish faster or achieve more citations.</p>
<p>To combat this practice we suggest several measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rigorous verification of metadata by publishers and agencies like Crossref.</li>
<li>Independent audits to ensure data reliability.</li>
<li>Increased transparency in managing references and citations.</li>
</ul>
<p>This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report a manipulation of metadata. It also discusses the impact this may have on the evaluation of researchers. The study highlights, yet again, that the overreliance on metrics to evaluate researchers, their work and their impact may be inherently flawed and wrong.</p>
<p>Such overreliance is likely to promote questionable research practices, including hypothesizing after the results are known, or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173715" target="_blank">HARKing</a>; splitting a single set of data into several papers, known as salami slicing; data manipulation; and plagiarism. It also hinders the transparency that is key to more <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-021-01304-y" target="_blank">robust</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60329-9" target="_blank">efficient</a> research. Although the problematic <a href="https://phys.org/tags/citation/" rel="tag">citation</a><a href="https://phys.org/tags/metadata/" rel="tag">metadata</a> and sneaked references have now been apparently fixed, the corrections may have, as is <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001572" target="_blank">often the case with scientific corrections</a>, happened too late.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>If you’ve read my <a href="https://www.timdbg.com/posts/fakers-guide-to-assembly">first post about assembly language</a>, you might expect that this is another post on how to understand assembly language. I will write more about that at some point, but this post is not that. Instead, this post is going to talk about some of the weird things and random trivia I learned while writing an x86 and amd64 emulator. The emulator I wrote was for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/time-travel-debugging-overview">Time Travel Debugging</a>. One piece of TTD is a CPU emulator, which is used to record the entire execution of a process at an instruction level. The first version of TTD was called iDNA, and the emulator for iDNA was written almost completely in assembly code, which was fast but difficult to maintain and extend.</p><p>I wasn’t involved in the first version of TTD, but I was involved in the second version where we rewrote the emulation portion (and eventually most other parts). The new one was written in C++, and we aimed to achieve most of the performance of the assembly language version while having a more maintainable code base. Writing a CPU emulator is, in my opinion, the best way to <em>REALLY</em> understand how a CPU works. You need to pay attention to every detail. This post is a somewhat random collection of the things I learned. If you have a lot of experience with x86 these might be old news, but maybe a few are things you haven’t seen before.</p><h2 id="useless-x86-encoding-trivia">Useless x86 encoding trivia</h2><p>The x86 encoding scheme is a bit funny in that there are often multiple ways to encode the exact same instruction. The <code>int 3</code> instruction can be encoded as <code>CD 03</code>, but can also be encoded in a single byte of <code>CC</code>. This is a very useful encoding because <code>int 3</code> is used as a software breakpoint. That way, it’s always possible to set a breakpoint at any point in a function, even if it’s an instruction that lands at the end of a memory page (with no page mapped after it). Many of these alternate encodings are designed to be shorter for some common case. For instance, adding an immediate value to <code>EAX</code> or <code>RAX</code> with the <code>ADD</code> instruction can be expressed in a compact form that’s shorter than the more general instruction. An <code>add eax, ...</code> instruction can be encoded like this:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>05cccccccc      add     eax,0CCCCCCCCh
</code></pre><p>Doing the same for ECX takes an extra byte:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>81c1cccccccc    add     ecx,0CCCCCCCCh
</code></pre><p>So while both registers are general purpose, the fact that <code>EAX</code> is called the “Accumulator register” is not just a convention, it actually makes a difference to the encoding (and potentially the performance, as a result). Compilers tend to be very smart, and can take advantage of these shorter encodings whenever possible. Shorter instructions mean less data transferred from main memory, and more instructions that can fit in the instruction cache, which is good for performance.</p><p>There are other ways to have equivalent instructions besides just alternate encodings. Instructions in x86 can take “prefix bytes” which modify the behavior of the instruction. The “REX” set of prefixes are commonly used in 64 bit code to access a wider range of registers compared to 32-bit code (and make code sequences <a href="https://www.timdbg.com/posts/recognizing-patterns">easier to recognize</a>). An x86 CPU will happily take one of these prefixes, even if it doesn’t have any effect. Put a “REX” byte on an 8-bit add, and it does nothing:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>4004cc          add     al,0CCh
</code></pre><p>In fact, you can put TWO of these prefixes on. Many disassemblers (including the one in WinDbg) will get confused, but the CPU will execute it just fine:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; rrax=0
0:000&gt; u . L2
00007ff8`22160950 40              ???
00007ff8`22160951 4004cc          add     al,0CCh
0:000&gt; t
00007ff8`22160954 cc              int     3
0:000&gt; rrax
rax=00000000000000cc
</code></pre><p>Can we add as many prefixes as we want? You can add quite a few until you get to 15 bytes<sup>1</sup>. This length is a hard limit on current x86-compatible CPUs. Any instruction longer than 15 bytes is considered invalid and will generate an exception.</p><p>There are also some other weird prefixes that you might not know about. The “Address override” prefix can be used to reference a 32-bit address when running in 64-bit mode.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>488d0424        lea     rax,[rsp]
67488d0424      lea     rax,[esp] # Note the extra '0x67' prefix
</code></pre><p>And when running 32-bit code, it will switch the address mode to 16-bit addresses! I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a compiler generate code like that, but it’s there. Something interesting to note, however, is that disassembling or interpreting these bytes correctly relies on knowing the default operand size and address size of a code segment (which can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_descriptor">configured by the kernel</a>). If we disassemble the same bytes in 32-bit mode and 64-bit mode, we can get different results.</p><p>In 32-bit mode:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>8b0424          mov     eax,dword ptr [esp]
</code></pre><p>In 64-bit mode:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>8b0424          mov     eax,dword ptr [rsp]
</code></pre><p>It’s not just address sizes either. The entire range that was previous dedicated to <code>INC reg</code> and <code>DEC reg</code> on x86 (40-4F) is now used for the <a href="https://twitter.com/ivanrouzanov/status/1616933010707972097">REX prefix bytes</a> on x64!</p><p>In 32-bit mode, we have this:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>48              dec     eax
030424          add     eax,dword ptr [esp]
</code></pre><p>But in 64-bit mode, those two instructions have merged to form a single instruction!</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>48030424        add     rax,qword ptr [rsp]
</code></pre><p>The encoding space used by <code>INC</code> and <code>DEC</code> was quite large, so it’s understandable why the AMD64 designers decided to use these bytes for the new prefixes to expand the register set in 64 bit mode. There was already a different encoding for these instructions that supported both registers and memory locations, so nothing was really lost (except a slightly larger encoding for a somewhat infrequent instruction).</p><p>I’ll also note that due to this peculiarity and due to the fact that WinDbg will always assemble instructions as if they are in 32-bit mode, trying to assemble an “INC reg” instruction will always fail, because it will generate the single byte form which is actually a REX prefix.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; a. 
00007ff8`4bfc0950 inc eax
00007ff8`4bfc0951 
0:000&gt; u .
ntdll!LdrpDoDebuggerBreak+0x30:
00007ff8`4bfc0950 40eb00          jmp     ntdll!LdrpDoDebuggerBreak+0x33 (00007ff8`4bfc0953)
</code></pre><p>The <code>inc eax</code> here got turned into a useless REX prefix modifying the next instruction, instead of actually being an <code>inc</code> instruction.</p><h2 id="odd-flag-quirks">Odd flag quirks</h2><p>Speaking of <code>INC</code> and <code>DEC</code>, there’s a slightly odd aspect of these instructions that’s worth noting. You might thing that <code>INC EAX</code> does the same thing as <code>ADD EAX, 1</code>, but they are slightly different. An <code>ADD</code> instruction will update the carry flag but the <code>INC</code> instruction does not! This is an easy thing to miss, and when writing the TTD emulator I got this wrong initially, until I caught it with some unit tests.</p><p>There are a few other outliers worth mentioning. Most arithmetic and logical operations will set the overflow, sign, zero, auxiliary carry, parity, and carry flags. That includes the <code>CMPXCHG</code> (compare and exchange) instruction. Interestingly, it does not include the <code>CMPXCHG8B</code>/<code>CMPXCHG16B</code> instructions, which will only modify the zero flag. Weird, right?</p><p>Other instructions leave some of the flags in an undefined state, although in some cases they are <em>conditionally</em> undefined. The shift and rotate instructions leave the overflow flag undefined if the shift amount was more than one. It seems that the actual behavior of the undefined flags is related to the internal implementation of the shift operation, and is different between different architectures. I’ve heard that the Atom line of CPUs used a cheaper/slower way of doing bit shifts in the ALU, which results in the undefined flags having different values, although I haven’t tested this myself.</p><h2 id="more-surprises-with-shift-instructions">More surprises with shift instructions</h2><p>Consider this instruction:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>66c1e810        shr     ax,10h
</code></pre><p>This instruction is to shift the <code>ax</code> register by 16 bits. Since this is a 16 bit register, it will clear the register to zero. Now consider this instruction:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>c1e820          shr     eax,20h
</code></pre><p>This instruction says that it will shift the eax register 0x20 (32 decimal) bits to the right. Since this is a 32 bit register, you might think that it will clear the <code>eax</code> register. In reality, the value of eax is unchanged! If you read the details of this instruction in the Intel SDM, you’ll see that the count is masked against 1FH, essentially using only the lowest five bits of the rotation.<sup>2</sup> If the <code>REX.W</code> prefix is used, the mask will be 3FH, meaning the maximum shift is 63 bits.</p><h2 id="segment-overrides">Segment overrides</h2><p>While segmented memory might make you think we are back in the days of 16-bit code, it turns out that segments are alive and well in 32-bit and 64-bit code, and they can have real effects. We tend not to think about them very much because for the most part every OS uses a mostly-flat memory model and all of the segments have a base address of 0.<sup>3</sup> The exception to this tends to be for thread local storage, where one of the “extra segment registers” is used, either <code>FS</code> or <code>GS</code> (or both).</p><p><del>What can complicate things is the fact that usermode code doesn’t have access to the CPU configuration that determines the base address of the FS or GS segments. So if you want to know what flat address corresponds to <code>GS:0x12345678</code>, there’s no way to determine that directly unless the OS has a way of querying this information.</del></p><p><strong>CORRECTION</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/sixtyvividtails/status/1621532553873080322">Sixtyvividtails points out</a> that you can read the base of fs/gs segs using the rdfsbase/wrfsbase/rdgsbase/wrgsbase instructions, which are available in unprivileged code. These instructions are available starting on Ivy Bridge (from 2012). Thanks for the correction, sixtyvividtails!</p><p>On Windows, these registers are used for referring to the TEB (Thread Execution Block), and these structures conveniently have a “self” pointer with a flat address to the start of the structure, which also happens to be the base of the segment.</p><p>In 32-bit processes, the TEB is located using <code>FS</code>. We can see how the OS does this by looking at the disassembly of the GetLastError function, which simply accesses a field out of the TEB.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; u kernelbase!GetLastError
KERNELBASE!GetLastError:
773e4080 64a118000000    mov     eax,dword ptr fs:[00000018h]   # Grab the TEB.NtTib.Self
773e4086 8b4034          mov     eax,dword ptr [eax+34h]        # Grab the "LastErrorValue" field out of the TEB
773e4089 c3              ret
</code></pre><p>Looking at this using public symbols, you can see what those offsets correspond to:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; dt -r1 _TEB
ntdll!_TEB
   +0x000 NtTib            : _NT_TIB
      +0x000 ExceptionList    : Ptr32 _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD
...
      +0x018 Self             : Ptr32 _NT_TIB
   +0x01c EnvironmentPointer : Ptr32 Void
...
   +0x034 LastErrorValue   : Uint4B
</code></pre><p>In 64-bit processes, the TEB is located using <code>GS</code>:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; u kernelbase!GetLastError
KERNELBASE!GetLastError:
00007ff8`4960cd60 65488b042530000000 mov   rax,qword ptr gs:[30h]
00007ff8`4960cd69 8b4068          mov     eax,dword ptr [rax+68h]
00007ff8`4960cd6c c3              ret
</code></pre><p>It might seem odd that that 64-bit processes use a different segment register for the TEB than a 32-bit process, but there is a very good reason for this. A 32-bit process on a 64-bit OS will have both a 32-bit TEB <em>and</em> a 64-bit TEB, and in some contexts it can be useful to have access to both TEBs (such as the 64-bit WOW code that runs in a 32-bit process).</p><h2 id="segment-overrides-more-trivia">Segment overrides: More trivia</h2><p>I mentioned earlier that the base address of the FS segment and GS segment is determined by CPU configuration. You might be wondering “what CPU configuration?” And the answer is “it depends”. Specifically, it depends on whether you’re in 32-bit mode or 64-bit mode. In 32-bit mode, the actual value of the segment register is used to reference a segment descriptor (defined by the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Global_Descriptor_Table">Global Descriptor Table</a> and <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Local_Descriptor_Table">Local Descriptor Table</a>). But in 64-bit mode, the base is controlled by two MSRs, the FS Base (IA32_FS_BASE in the Intel SDM) and GS Base (IA32_GS_BASE). A side effect of this scheme is that the actual value of FS and GS don’t matter at all in 64-bit mode. You can see the effect of this in WinDbg by trying to directly read from something in one of those segments. When debugging a 32-bit process, you can dump the contents of the “FS segment” by using the value of the FS register:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; rfs
fs=00000053
0:000&gt; db 53:0
0053:00000000  60 f2 2f 03 00 00 30 03-00 30 20 03 00 00 00 00 `./...0..0 .....
</code></pre><p>If you try the same thing on a 64-bit process, it doesn’t work because the segment values don’t matter, only the segment override prefixes!</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; rfs
fs=0053
0:000&gt; db 53:0
0053:00000000`00000000  ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??-?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??  ????????????????
0:000&gt; rgs
gs=002b
0:000&gt; db 2b:0
002b:00000000`00000000  ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??-?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??  ????????????????
</code></pre><h2 id="roll-credits">Roll credits</h2><p>This turned out to be a pretty random list of x86 trivia. Most of it totally useless unless you want to write an emulator (which I <em>highly</em> recommend if you ever get the chance). I still think it’s sort of interesting, and gives a little bit of insight into how things “really work”. Some of this I learned through trial and error, but I had some great mentors while writing an x86 emulator, one of whom was Darek Mihocka, who has been doing emulators long enough that he owns <a href="http://emulators.com/">emulators.com</a>. I’d never claim to be an expert myself, but if this sort of thing is interesting to you make sure to check out the fantastic resources on <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/">Agner Fog’s website</a>. As usual, if I made any mistakes or if you have any questions, let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/timmisiak">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://dbg.social/@tim">Mastodon</a>!</p><p><sup>1</sup> There are some other limits on prefixes on older CPUs, but the 15 byte limit applies even on newer CPUs. Besides the length limitation, some prefixes are also more strict about when they can be used, such as the <code>LOCK</code> prefix (F0)</p><p><sup>2</sup> This actually came up in an interview question at Microsoft. My interviewer was asking me all the ways you could clear a 32-bit register in a single instruction. He was convinced that using a shift would work and didn’t believe me when I said it wasn’t possible.</p><p><sup>3</sup> When executing in 64-bit mode, the segment base of CS, DS, ES, and SS are always treated as 0 by the CPU.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
              Large language models with vision capabilities (VLMs), e.g., <span>GPT-<span>4o</span></span> and <span>Gemini-<span>1.5</span>
                Pro</span> are
              powering countless image-text processing applications and scoring high on existing vision-understanding
              benchmarks.
              Yet, we find that VLMs fail on 7 visual tasks <em>absurdly easy</em> to humans such as identifying (a)
              whether two
              circles overlap; (b) whether two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d)
              counting the
              number of circles in an Olympic-like logo.
              The shockingly poor performance of four state-of-the-art VLMs suggests their vision is, at best, like that
              of a person
              with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia" target="_blank">myopia</a> seeing fine details as
              blurry, and at
              worst, like an intelligent person who is blind making
              educated
              guesses.

      <h2>Task 1: Counting line intersections <img src="https://vlmsareblind.github.io/static/images/logo/two_lines.svg" alt="Two intersecting lines"></h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          Given the impressive accuracy of VLMs on answering questions on diagrams and charts (e.g., <span>Sonnet-<span>3.5</span></span> scoring 94.7% on AI2D and 90.8% on
          ChartQA) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10244">[1]</a>, a reasonable hypothesis is that VLMs must be able
          to see whether two graphs
          intersect in a
          chart. Here, we test this hypothesis by asking VLMs to count the number of intersections between two 2-segment
          piece-wise linear functions.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          We create 150 images (see Figure 1) of 2D line plots drawn on a white canvas. Each line plot consists of two
          line
          segments, defined by three points whose x-coordinates are fixed and equally spaced. The y-coordinates are
          randomly
          sampled to create two plots that intersect at exactly 0, 1 or 2 points. See Appendix A for more details.

          In contrast to Task 1 where we tested VLMs on thin lines, here we evaluate their ability to perceive
          interactions
          between larger objects - specifically, two same-sized filled circles. This task assesses VLMs' capability to
          detect
          (1) small gaps between circles and (2) overlapping circles.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          We generate 672 images of two circles on a white canvas. The circles vary in size, distance, and orientation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Circle diameters: 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, or 1/7 of the canvas size</li>
          <li>Distances between circle perimeters: -0.15 to 0.5 times the diameter</li>

      <h2>Task 3: The circled letter <img src="https://vlmsareblind.github.io/static/images/logo/acknowledgement-svg.svg" alt="Two intersecting lines"></h2>



      <div>
        <p>
          Consistent with prior reports <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06712">[2]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11441">[3]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17421">[4]</a>, we find
          that VLMs can
          100%
          accurately identify a primitive shape (e.g., a red circle ⭕)<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06712">[2]</a>
          and can perfectly read an English word (e.g.,
          <span>Subdermatoglyphic</span>) alone. Here, we superimposed the red circle on every
          letter, one at a time, in the word,
          and ask
          VLMs to identify which letter is being circled. While the task is easy to humans, our hypothesis is that if a
          VLM's
          vision is "blurry", it might not be able to identify the exact letter being circled since there is tiny
          spacing
          between the adjacent letters.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          We choose three strings <span>Acknowledgement</span>, <span>Subdermatoglyphic</span>, and tHyUiKaRbNqWeOpXcZvM because they contain
          characters
          of variable widths and heights. Furthermore, all four tested VLMs can read out all characters in these strings
          when
          they are input to the models as an image. While <span>Acknowledgement</span> is a common
          English word, <span>Subdermatoglyphic</span> is
          the
          longest word without repetitive letters. We also test VLMs on the random string <span>tHyUiKaRbNqWeOpXcZvM</span> to
          estimate how
          much model accuracy is due to its familiarity with the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each (string, circled-letter) pair, we render a 512×512 image by choosing among 3 red oval line-thickness
          levels,
          2 font sizes, and 4 random positions in the canvas for a total of 24 images. That is, we generate 360, 408,
          and 480
          images for <span>Acknowledgement</span> (15 letters), <span>Subdermatoglyphic</span> (17 letters), and
          <span>tHyUiKaRbNqWeOpXcZvM</span> (20
          letters),
          respectively. We ensure each letter to be circled fits completely the oval.

          Aligned with prior research <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17421">[4]</a>, we also find VLMs to be able
          to count disjoint circles. Yet, here, we test
          VLMs on
          counting circles that are <em>intersecting</em> like in the Olympic logo—a common cognitive development
          exercise for
          preschoolers <a href="https://www.myteachingstation.com/preschool/math/numbers/count-shapes-printables">[5]</a><a href="https://depositphotos.com/vector/how-many-counting-game-with-color-simple-geometric-shapes-for-kids-educational-maths-task-for-266096226.html">[6]</a>.
          Our hypothesis is that a "blurry" vision may not see the
          intersection between two circles
          clearly
          and therefore unable to trace circles and count them. For generalization of our findings, we repeat the
          experiment
          with pentagons as well.

          different
          line thickness for rendering circles. This procedure renders 3 resolutions × 5 × 2 diameters = 60 images. We
          repeat
          for pentagons in addition to circles, resulting in 60 × 2 shapes = 120 images in total. For pentagons, their
          side
          length d ∈ {C/5, C/10}.

      <div>
        <p>
          Motivated by the findings that VLMs struggle in counting the intersected circles (Task 4), here, we arrange
          the shapes
          differently so that their edges do <em>not</em> intersect.
          That is, each shape is nested entirely inside another. For completeness, we test squares in this task.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          In a canvas of size C×C, we render N ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5} nested squares.
          The outermost square is rendered first using a random edge length d and a line thickness ∈ {2, 3, 4}px.
          The remaining N-1 squares are drawn using a size reduction factor, 0.75 × d and placed at a random coordinate
          that
          ensures they do not touch outer squares.
          For each line thickness, we generate 10 images (where squares have different, random locations) to create 3 ×
          10 = 30
          images.
          Repeating the process for all N values results in 4 × 30 = 120 images.

      <h2>Task 6: Counting the rows and columns of a grid <img src="https://vlmsareblind.github.io/static/images/logo/grid-3x4-svg.svg" alt="Two intersecting lines"></h2>


      <div>
        <p>
          The results from prior tasks show VLMs cannot always count shapes that are overlapping (Task 4) or nested
          (Task 5).
          What about adjacent shapes? Here, we tile up shapes (specifically, squares) into a grid and challenge VLMs to
          count—a
          task that is supposedly simple to VLMs given their remarkable performance (≥ 90% accuracy) on DocVQA, which
          includes
          many questions with tables.
          To simplify the task, we ask models to count the number of rows and columns in a given table.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          A grid may have N×N, N×N', or N'×N cells, where N∈{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and N' = N + 1.
          Each grid is rendered with two different line-thicknesses on a canvas of size C×C where C∈{500, 1250, 2000}px.
          Besides empty grids, we also replicate the procedure to make grids contain text (which is more common in
          real-world
          tables) where each cell contains a single random word.
          Two versions combined have 2×222 = 444 images.
        </p>
        
        <figcaption>Fig. 9: Examples of grid images used in the task, showing text-filled and empty grids with various

          <li><em>"Count the number of rows and columns and answer with numbers in curly brackets. For example, rows={5}
              columns={6}"</em></li>
          <li><em>"How many rows and columns are in the table? Answer with only the numbers in a pair (row, column),
              e.g.,
              (5,6)"</em></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Groundtruth</h3>
        <p>
            Answers include both the number of rows and columns. An answer is correct when both column and row counts
            are
            correctly predicted.

      <div>
        <p>
          It is important for VLMs to be able to follow paths in order to read maps or charts, interpret graphs, and
          understand
          user notations (e.g., arrows) in input images. To assess path-following capability, this task asks models to
          count the
          unique-color paths between two given stations in a simplified subway map. This is another easy-to-humans task
          that
          challenges VLMs significantly.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          We create each subway map on an image of size C×C, where C ∈ {512, 1024}px. We write 4 station names (A, B, C,
          D) at 4
          fixed coordinates. We divide the canvas into an invisible grid of 18×18 cells and initialize 3 path-starting
          points
          C/18px away from each station. We draw a path, using the depth-first search algorithm starting from a random
          station
          and a random starting point, where a valid move is one cell in any direction: North, south, east or west. We
          repeat
          the process so that each station has exactly N ∈ {1, 2, 3} outgoing paths, for a total of 180 maps.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Physical neural networks (PNNs) are a class of neural-like networks that leverage the properties of physical systems to perform computation. While PNNs are so far a niche research area with small-scale laboratory demonstrations, they are arguably one of the most underappreciated important opportunities in modern AI. Could we train AI models 1000x larger than current ones? Could we do this and also have them perform inference locally and privately on edge devices, such as smartphones or sensors? Research over the past few years has shown that the answer to all these questions is likely "yes, with enough research": PNNs could one day radically change what is possible and practical for AI systems. To do this will however require rethinking both how AI models work, and how they are trained - primarily by considering the problems through the constraints of the underlying hardware physics. To train PNNs at large scale, many methods including backpropagation-based and backpropagation-free approaches are now being explored. These methods have various trade-offs, and so far no method has been shown to scale to the same scale and performance as the backpropagation algorithm widely used in deep learning today. However, this is rapidly changing, and a diverse ecosystem of training techniques provides clues for how PNNs may one day be utilized to create both more efficient realizations of current-scale AI models, and to enable unprecedented-scale models.

<div><p data-sid="6000009">We are big fans of <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>, the build system, and we use NixOS literally everywhere at our company.<sup>1</sup> But not everybody in the world runs NixOS, so we are frequently in the business of building native executables and shared libraries that need to run both on NixOS and on the kinds of Linux used by normal people (insofar as any Linux user is a normal person). Does that sound like it should be straightforward? Buckle up and prepare yourself for a descent into the depths of ELF program interpretation and loading. We survived this journey, we even brought back an artifact. But at what cost? At what terrible cost?</p></div>

<p data-sid="6000015">Those paths that start with <code>/nix/store</code> followed by a long pseudorandom string might look ugly to you, but to me they look like salvation. Yes, salvation from the depths of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell">DLL Hell</a>. You see, in ancient times dynamic linking was invented to save a few kilobytes here and there. If a bunch of different programs all needed the same library, the OS could provide just one copy of the library, and everybody could map it into their address space. This seemed like a great idea at the time, and then it led to 40 years of version conflicts, inscrutable error messages, and total dependency resolution insanity.</p>
<p data-sid="6000016">It was partly in the interest of slaying this monster that containers were invented. One way to think of a container is that you’re just static-linking your entire userspace, which seems excessive unless you remember the world where it was normal to see your process spitting out errors like “cannot open shared object file” when you deployed it to prod, and vowed to become a wandering hermit and never to touch a computer again. Hypothetically. NixOS is a different way to solve the same problem. Instead of wrapping an entire Linux userspace around your process like a warm parka, we just store every version of every dependency, uniquely identified by the hash of all of <em>its</em> dependencies, and then recursively do the same thing to those, and so on. The result is that you can have multiple versions of your entire operating system happily coexisting on the same hard drive, and a lot of other crazy tricks.</p>
<div><p data-sid="6000017">If you’ve been around the software packaging block, then you probably know the first error you’ll run into when you try to run our hello world program on Ubuntu. Yes, it has to do with <code>glibc</code> version symbols, the bane of every software packager and maintainer. The problem boils down to the fact that it’s not safe to have a newer version of <code>glibc</code> on your build machine than on your deployment machine (developers who want to build one binary that targets multiple Linuxes generally have to keep around a computer with the <a href="https://gist.github.com/wagenet/35adca1a032cec2999d47b6c40aa45b1">lowest common denominator</a> version of <code>glibc</code>).<sup>2</sup> NixOS tends to have an extremely bleeding edge <code>glibc</code>, so this will always be a problem. Fortunately, it’s trivial on NixOS to summon another universe into existence where every program and every dynamic dependency was built with an old <code>glibc</code>, then do your build in that universe. Cool.</p>
<p data-sid="6000018">But you do that and then it still doesn’t work.</p>

<p data-sid="6000032">The clue is actually right there in that <code>ldd</code> output. Can you figure it out? Meditate on this picture of a heroic anteater facing down a nightmarish monster, and then scroll down when you have a guess.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://antithesis.com/img_opt/SGsqieHeaa-1294.webp 1294w"><img alt="Sometimes systems programming feels like this..." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://antithesis.com/img_opt/SGsqieHeaa-1294.png" width="1294" height="1294"></picture></p>
<p data-sid="6000033"><code>ldd</code> is a tool that tells you about the dynamic dependencies of your program, <em>and</em> what they got resolved to. The library you were looking for is on the left side of each of the arrows, and the actual, resolved library from your load path is on the right side. Since we’re running this in an Ubuntu container, the libraries it finds are all in normal locations under <code>/lib</code> rather than zany locations under <code>/nix/store</code>.</p>
<p data-sid="6000034"><code>ldd</code> prints the location of <code>ld-linux.so</code> (the Linux ELF program loader) in the same format, but in this case it’s a total lie. When you ran <code>ldd</code> on the program, it was able to find a copy of <code>ld-linux.so</code> for you. But when you run the actual program, <code>ld-linux.so</code> itself is the thing that does library name resolution! It can’t very well find itself, so every ELF native binary on Linux hardcodes the location of the <code>ld-linux.so</code> that it should use. Thus, if you want to know the copy of <code>ld-linux.so</code> that your program will use, <code>ldd</code> gives a very misleading answer. Only the thing on the <em>left</em> side of the arrow matters, the thing on the right-hand side is a lie that will not matter when your program actually runs. And in our case, the hardcoded path to <code>ld-linux.so</code> points to a location in the Nix store that definitely doesn’t exist on Ubuntu, and that’s what leads to the “No such file or directory” error. It’s a little clearer if you look at the output of the <code>file</code> utility:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-sid="6000035"><code><span><span>root@9cd480a40ee7:/#</span><span> file</span><span> /tmp/a.out</span><span> </span></span>

<span></span></code></pre>
<p data-sid="6000036">Where does this hardcoded path to <code>ld-linux.so</code> come from? Well, it’s injected in the link phase of your compilation toolchain, based on information provided by your installation of the C standard library. Fortunately, the good people at NixOS have produced a handy utility called <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf">patchelf</a> that lets you selectively modify the ELF headers of an existing executable or shared library, and <code>patchelf</code> has an option, <code>--set-interpreter</code> that lets you modify this path. So that’s it, we just need to add a call to <code>patchelf</code> in our toolchain, and we should be good…</p>
<p data-sid="6000037">…but what do we set the path to? If we set it to a location in the Nix store, this won’t work on any other kind of Linux. If we set it to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">FHS standard location</a>, it won’t work on NixOS. We want the same binary to work in both locations. Is this possible?</p>
<p data-sid="6000038">Yes… if you’re willing to embrace Madness.</p>
<div><p data-sid="6000039">Our first thought was that since the FHS location is fixed, we could simply configure our NixOS machines to have a symlink from that standard location to the “real” location of the <code>ld-linux.so</code> we wanted to use. Then, we would simply patch all the binaries we built to have the FHS loader location. This would mean they work out of the box on Ubuntu, and on NixOS they’d just require a line or two in your <code>configuration.nix</code>. In fact this approach is so sensible that in NixOS 24.05 they use <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=24.05&amp;show=environment.stub-ld.enable&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;type=packages&amp;query=stub-ld">something very much like it</a> to print a sensible error message when you try to run a binary compiled on a different system.<sup>3</sup></p></div>
<p data-sid="6000041">But we want to do better than that! We don’t want you to get an error message when you run a binary with an FHS loader path, we want it to actually work! Should be straightforward right? Just point the symlink at a real copy of <code>ld-linux.so</code>. There’s only one problem…</p>
<p data-sid="6000042">Which one?</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://antithesis.com/img_opt/REYEFhAVtq-1294.webp 1294w"><img alt="...and sometimes it feels like this." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://antithesis.com/img_opt/REYEFhAVtq-1294.png" width="1294" height="1294"></picture></p>
<p data-sid="6000043">Remember the part where I said the amazing thing about NixOS is that you can have multiple versions of every library happily coexisting on your computer? On a normal version of Linux, you have one copy and one version of all of your core system libraries. So on a normal Linux you also have one version of <code>ld-linux.so</code>, living in a canonical location, that’s tested and confirmed to work with those libraries. But a moment ago I just showed you that you can have multiple versions of <code>glibc</code> on the same Nix machine, and moreover entire non-overlapping software ecosystems using those different versions of <code>glibc</code>. Can we guarantee that the <code>ld-linux.so</code> we choose will work with all of them?</p>
<p data-sid="6000044">Unfortunately, this is not some theoretical issue. If you go try to build your own copy of <code>ld-linux.so</code>, you’ll discover that it’s part of the <code>glibc</code> project, and that it’s versioned together with <code>glibc</code>. There’s no documentation anywhere about what the rules are around using mismatched <code>glibc</code>/<code>ld-linux.so</code> versions, but we’ve determined via exhaustive experimentation that it is not guaranteed to work. So if we pick a random version of <code>ld-linux.so</code> out of the Nix store for our canonical symlink to point to, it might not work for some programs. In Nix jargon, this is what’s called an impurity, an arbitrary source of out-of-band state about your system that could cause a program to fail, and that’s a big no-no.</p>
<div><p data-sid="6000045">This is a tricky issue. There’s a project which I discovered while I was writing this post, called <a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-ld">nix-ld</a>, that is basically trying to deal with this same problem using a similar approach. They also ran into this impurity issue and decided that the best course was to force the <em>user</em> to specify which version of <code>ld-linux.so</code> to use via an environment variable. That’s a totally valid approach, and their program has some other very nice features,<sup>4</sup> but what if we could somehow scan the binary and just <em>figure out</em> dynamically which <code>ld-linux.so</code> to use?</p></div>
<p data-sid="6000047">If we <em>could</em> figure this out dynamically, there would be an easy way to take advantage of the information. You see, there’s a way to override the program loader path hardcoded into a binary, which is just to invoke the loader directly as the first argument of your command (even before the program you’re trying to run). So for instance: <code>$ foo</code> will execute the program <code>foo</code> using the path to <code>ld-linux.so</code> in <code>foo</code>’s ELF headers. But <code>$ /home/will/my_crazy_ld-linux.so foo</code> will ignore the one that’s present in <code>foo</code>’s ELF headers, and directly use <code>/home/will/my_crazy_ld-linux.so</code>. But what this means is that you can “chain” program loaders – it’s possible to write a “meta-loader” which when asked to load a program, invokes some other loader to finish the job. To make this concrete, here’s the simplest possible example of such a meta-loader:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-sid="6000048"><code><span><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span></span>
<span><span>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</span><span> $1</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p data-sid="6000049">So if we knew what the correct loader should be, then we could have the meta-loader invoke it (and hardcode the path to the meta-loader into our program). But is there a foolproof way to decide what the correct loader is? Again, YES! There’s another special header in your executable which defines the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath">“RPATH” and the “RUNPATH”</a>, think of these as a way of providing hints to the dynamic linker about where to go looking for certain libraries that you’ve linked against. But for a binary compiled on NixOS, these actually contain store paths for (among other things) the <code>glibc</code> that your program was built against. And that same store path will contain a copy of <code>ld-linux.so</code> that is guaranteed (well, I hope) to work with that version of <code>glibc</code>. Best of all, having a bunch of extra <code>RPATH</code>s pointing to nonexistent Nix store locations doesn’t break anything on normal Linux. And that means we can actually have a plan that works.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://antithesis.com/img_opt/abgCANcj6P-1265.webp 1265w"><img alt="That moment when you've figured it all out" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://antithesis.com/img_opt/abgCANcj6P-1265.png" width="1265" height="1265"></picture></p>
<p data-sid="6000050">Let’s consider the 4 possible cases of has/does not have a Nix-style <code>RPATH</code> and running on NixOS/normal linux:</p>
<ul>
<li data-sid="6000051"><span>Normal</span> binary, <span>Normal</span> Linux: No problem, the loader is where we expect and library resolution works as normal.</li>
<li data-sid="6000052"><span>Nix</span> binary, <span>Normal</span> Linux: No problem, we <code>patchelf</code>’d the binary so it works on normal linux. Library resolution using the <code>RPATH</code> will fail, and then it will fall back on the system library path and find what it needs.</li>
<li data-sid="6000053"><span>Nix</span> binary, <span>NixOS</span>: No problem, our symlink will point it at the meta-loader, which will then read the <code>RPATH</code> and pick the correct “real” loader to use.</li>
<li data-sid="6000054"><span>Normal</span> binary, <span>NixOS</span>: <strong>ALSO NO PROBLEM!!!</strong> Assuming that your binary is able to run at all, there is some <code>glibc</code> it will pick up at runtime (perhaps via your shell’s <code>PATH</code> or <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>). Our symlink will point the binary at the meta-loader, which will fail to read the <code>RPATH</code>, and fall back on the <code>ld-linux.so</code> provided by the <code>glibc</code> installation that your binary would have used. This will exactly match the <code>glibc</code> that gets loaded by the process, so everything will still work.</li>
</ul>
<p data-sid="6000055">So great, now we have a design that should work. Can we just write a little shell script to do this and act as our meta-loader?</p>
<p data-sid="6000056">Lol. Lmao, even.</p>
<p data-sid="6000057">Remember our simplest possible meta-loader? It takes your program and invokes it again using the real loader. It looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-sid="6000058"><code><span><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span></span>
<span><span>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</span><span> $1</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p data-sid="6000059">This minimal meta-loader will totally work if you invoke it directly like <code>$ meta_loader.sh foo</code>, and it will totally <em>not</em> work if you hardcode its path (or a symlink to it) in the ELF headers of a binary. Why? I dunno man, haven’t you learned not to ask these sorts of questions? This is the part of programming that feels more like archaeology. We are descending through geological strata, marveling at perfectly preserved skulls and papyri and stuff, pondering how to run our sewer line through here without triggering a lot of red tape.</p>
<div><p data-sid="6000060">Great, no shell script. Let’s write a C program. Yeah, a simple C program. C programs are great. C has a standard library. Unfortunately, if you attempt to use that standard library, your little meta-loader will fail in all sorts of gory ways.<sup>5</sup> Again, we don’t have an exact diagnosis of why this is. We are in the region of the space-time continuum where we sort of shrug our shoulders and roll with things.</p>
<p data-sid="6000061">Great, no standard library. We will write a C program like God intended: using raw system calls, intrinsics, and a little inline assembly. Unfortunately that is not the most productive programming environment, so we cheat and have our meta-loader actually just bootstrap the loading process, and defer all the hard work to a… shell script which we exec. This <em>totally</em> works.<sup>6</sup> Yes, after all that it really genuinely works. This program has never let us down. If you want to try it, we’ve open-sourced it <a href="https://github.com/antithesishq/madness">here</a> and turned it into a tiny NixOS module that’s trivial to enable. Enjoy!</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>.env</code> files can be loaded using the <code>--env</code> option.
Variables from these files can then be used in the UI.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h3><a id="user-content-example" aria-label="Permalink: Example" href="#example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Imagine you're testing an API which exists in both <code>dev</code> and <code>prod</code> environments.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>dev</code> and <code>prod</code> environments share some common variables, but differ in many ways too.
We can model this by having a single <code>shared.env</code> file which contains variables which are shared between environments, and then a <code>dev.env</code> and <code>prod.env</code> file which contain environment specific variables.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# file: shared.env
API_PATH=&quot;/api/v1&quot;
ENV_NAME=&quot;shared&quot;

# file: dev.env
API_KEY=&quot;dev-api-key&quot;
ENV_NAME=&quot;dev&quot;
BASE_URL=&quot;https://${ENV_NAME}.example.com&quot;

# file: prod.env
API_KEY=&quot;prod-api-key&quot;
ENV_NAME=&quot;prod&quot;
BASE_URL=&quot;https://${ENV_NAME}.example.com&quot;"><pre><span><span>#</span> file: shared.env</span>
API_PATH=<span><span>"</span>/api/v1<span>"</span></span>
ENV_NAME=<span><span>"</span>shared<span>"</span></span>

<span><span>#</span> file: dev.env</span>
API_KEY=<span><span>"</span>dev-api-key<span>"</span></span>
ENV_NAME=<span><span>"</span>dev<span>"</span></span>
BASE_URL=<span><span>"</span>https://<span>${ENV_NAME}</span>.example.com<span>"</span></span>

<span><span>#</span> file: prod.env</span>
API_KEY=<span><span>"</span>prod-api-key<span>"</span></span>
ENV_NAME=<span><span>"</span>prod<span>"</span></span>
BASE_URL=<span><span>"</span>https://<span>${ENV_NAME}</span>.example.com<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">When working in the <code>dev</code> environment, you can then load all of the shared variables and all of the development environment specific variables using the <code>--env</code> option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="posting --env shared.env --env dev.env"><pre>posting --env shared.env --env dev.env</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will load all of the shared variables from <code>shared.env</code>, and then load the variables from <code>dev.env</code>. Since <code>ENV_NAME</code> appears in both files, the value from the <code>dev.env</code> file will be used since that was the last one specified.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that you do <em>not</em> need to restart to load changes made to these files,
so you can open and edit your env files in an editor of your choice alongside Posting.
However, autocompletion and variable highlighting will not update until Posting is restarted.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to permit using environment variables that exist on the host machine (i.e. those which are not defined in any <code>.env</code> files), you must set the <code>use_host_environment</code> config option to <code>true</code> (or set the environment variable <code>POSTING_USE_HOST_ENVIRONMENT=true</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Environment specific config</h4><a id="user-content-environment-specific-config" aria-label="Permalink: Environment specific config" href="#environment-specific-config"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since all Posting configuration options can also be specified as environment variables, we can also put environment specific config inside <code>.env</code> files. There's a dedicated "Configuration" section in this document which covers this in more detail.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, if you wanted to use a light theme in the prod environment (as a subtle reminder that you're in production!), you could set the environment variable <code>POSTING_THEME=solarized-light</code> inside the <code>prod.env</code> file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that configuration files take precedence over environment variables, so if you set a value in both a <code>.env</code> file and a <code>config.yaml</code>, the value from the <code>config.yaml</code> file will be used.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Command palette</h2><a id="user-content-command-palette" aria-label="Permalink: Command palette" href="#command-palette"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Some functionality in Posting doesn't warrant a dedicated keyboard shortcut (for example, switching to a specific theme), and can instead be accessed via the <em>command palette</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To open the command palette, press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h2><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Posting can be configured using a configuration file, environment variables, and/or <code>.env</code> files.</p>
<p dir="auto">Configuration values are loaded in the following order of precedence (highest to lowest):</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Configuration file</li>
<li>Environment variables</li>
<li><code>.env</code> files</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The range of available configuration will be greatly expanded in the future.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration file</h3><a id="user-content-configuration-file" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration file" href="#configuration-file"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can write configuration for Posting using YAML.</p>
<p dir="auto">The location of the config file can be checked using the command <code>posting locate config</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's an example configuration file:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="theme: galaxy
layout: horizontal
response:
  prettify_json: false
heading:
  visible: true
  show_host: false"><pre><span>theme</span>: <span>galaxy</span>
<span>layout</span>: <span>horizontal</span>
<span>response</span>:
  <span>prettify_json</span>: <span>false</span>
<span>heading</span>:
  <span>visible</span>: <span>true</span>
  <span>show_host</span>: <span>false</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Environment variables</h3><a id="user-content-environment-variables" aria-label="Permalink: Environment variables" href="#environment-variables"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">All configuration values can also be set as environment variables.</p>
<p dir="auto">Simply prefix the name of the config with <code>POSTING_</code> and set it as an environment variable.</p>
<p dir="auto">For nested configuration values, use <code>__</code> as the delimiter. So to set <code>heading.visible</code> to <code>false</code>, you can set the environment variable <code>POSTING_HEADING__VISIBLE=false</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, to set the theme to <code>galaxy</code>, you can set the environment variable <code>POSTING_THEME=galaxy</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">dotenv (<code>.env</code>) files</h3><a id="user-content-dotenv-env-files" aria-label="Permalink: dotenv (.env) files" href="#dotenv-env-files"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Posting also supports <code>.env</code> (dotenv) files, which are useful if you want to keep your configuration in a file rather than in your shell's environment variables.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can tell Posting to use a <code>.env</code> file using the <code>--env-file</code> option.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's an example <code>.env</code> file:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="POSTING_THEME=&quot;cobalt&quot;
POSTING_LAYOUT=&quot;vertical&quot;
POSTING_HEADING__VISIBLE=&quot;false&quot;"><pre>POSTING_THEME=<span><span>"</span>cobalt<span>"</span></span>
POSTING_LAYOUT=<span><span>"</span>vertical<span>"</span></span>

<hr></div><p>The <a href="https://girlsintech.org/">Girls in Tech </a>nonprofit women’s tech community is closing its doors after 17 years, according to a newsletter from founder <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/adriana-gascoigne-on-how-girls-in-tech-can-get-women-to-infiltrate-silicon-valley/">Adriana Gascoigne</a>.</p>



<p>Gascoigne said the decision was made with “sadness and devastation” and was not made lightly.</p>



<p>“It is with a heavy heart that I share the news that Girls in Tech will be closing its doors. This decision was not made lightly, and the sadness and devastation we feel cannot be overstated,” Gascoigne wrote. “For 17 incredible years, we have offered a welcoming community based on empowerment, support, and inspiration for women in the tech industry. Together, we have made a profound impact, helping women reach for the stars and excel in their careers, while working tirelessly to eliminate the gender gap in tech worldwide.”</p>

<p>The group reached more than 250,000 individuals across 35 chapters in 30 countries on six continents. It was founded in Silicon Valley, but <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/adriana-gascoigne-why-girls-in-tech-moved-to-nashville/">Gascoigne relocated the group to Nashville</a>, Tennessee, in 2022 during the pandemic. I interviewed her numerous times about the group’s mission and goals, and how it rose to greater relevance in fighting the “<a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/girls-in-techs-adriana-gascoigne-fights-the-toxic-culture-of-silicon-valley/">toxic culture</a>” of Silicon Valley.</p>

The passion to support, uplift, and inspire each other is what has truly set us apart. I am immensely proud of what we have built together and the lasting impact we have made,” Gascoigne said in the newsletter.</p>



<p>The group’s programs included a mentorship program, hackathons, coding bootcamps, the Girls in Tech Conference, a startup challenge, global classroom, podcast, blog, jobs board, and shop. The group organized thousands of in-person and virtual events, producing educational and engaging content. </p>

<p>“To everyone who poured their heart into building this wonderful community where women in tech could have a voice, learn, grow, and be celebrated just as they are—I am profoundly grateful,” Gascoigne said. “A special thanks to all of our members, who established such a friendly, warm, and collaborative environment and culture; the managing directors and advisory board teams who led our chapters; our staff at headquarters who managed and grew the organization; our sponsors who funded our programs and events; and our board of directors.”</p>



<p>Without explanation, Gascoigne said in closing, “Though Girls in Tech is closing its doors, the movement we started must and will continue. I encourage each of you to carry on the fight to eliminate the gender gap in tech. Our mission will live on in other forms, driven by the same passion and commitment that have always defined us. I will miss you all deeply. Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: We’re introducing the “free as in beer”, self-hosted and AGPL-licensed Plausible Community Edition (CE). <a href="https://github.com/plausible/community-edition/">Installation instructions are here</a>.</p> <p>In October 2020, we changed <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-licenses">from the MIT to the AGPL license</a> to prevent corporations from exploiting our code without giving back.</p> <p>As mentioned at the time, we wanted a “don’t be evil” license. Here’s the quote of what we wrote more than three years ago on what we were trying to accomplish with the license change:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We want to prevent corporations from taking our code and using it as part of their closed-source proprietary products</li> <li>We want to prevent corporations from offering Plausible as a service without contributing to the open source project</li> <li>We want to prevent corporations from confusing people and making them think that the service they sell is in any shape or form approved by the original team</li> </ul> <p>And we don’t want this to in any way impact the actual use case Plausible is built for. A completely open source and self-hostable web analytics tool that helps people de-Googlify their sites and respect the privacy of their visitors.</p> </blockquote> <p>That license change has helped us build <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-saas">a sustainable open source project</a> with 8 core team members and several paid external contributors at the time of writing. We don’t have any investors, so all this is solely funded by the fees our 12,000+ subscribers pay us.</p> <p>As we’ve progressed in our journey, we’ve become aware that despite its advantages, the AGPL license doesn’t go far enough to protect us against all the threats we face. To better protect our project in the future, we’re changing some things about our self-hosted release. These changes don’t affect anyone subscribing to the Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the cloud. Everything stays the same there.</p> <p>If you have a blog, a personal site or a business site, we want you to be able to self-host our code on your servers without needing to pay us any fees if that’s your preference. Nothing changes about this either. Our self-hosted code continues being AGPL-licensed, “free as in beer” and is the same code running in the production on our Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the cloud.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here’s more on what’s being changed and why.</p> <ol id="markdown-toc"> <li><a href="#threats-were-facing" id="markdown-toc-threats-were-facing">Threats we’re facing</a></li> <li><a href="#sticking-to-the-agpl-license" id="markdown-toc-sticking-to-the-agpl-license">Sticking to the AGPL license&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="#changes-were-making-to-our-self-hosted-release" id="markdown-toc-changes-were-making-to-our-self-hosted-release">Changes we’re making to our self-hosted release</a> <ol> <li><a href="#our-self-hosted-release-will-be-called-plausible-community-edition" id="markdown-toc-our-self-hosted-release-will-be-called-plausible-community-edition">Our self-hosted release will be called Plausible Community Edition</a></li> <li><a href="#a-stronger-moat-for-our-official-managed-hosting" id="markdown-toc-a-stronger-moat-for-our-official-managed-hosting">A stronger moat for our official managed hosting</a></li> <li><a href="#features-to-be-offered-on-top-of-plausible-ce" id="markdown-toc-features-to-be-offered-on-top-of-plausible-ce">Features to be offered on top of Plausible CE</a></li> </ol> </li> <li><a href="#ensuring-the-continuous-sustainability" id="markdown-toc-ensuring-the-continuous-sustainability">Ensuring the continuous sustainability</a></li> </ol> <h2 id="threats-were-facing">Threats we’re facing</h2> <p>We want to reduce the threat from businesses such as hosting companies and other resellers who try to commercialize popular open source projects. We’ve seen our self-hosted code being used in a way it was never intended for by corporations that don’t care about us or open source. Our license doesn’t prevent these corporations from using the Plausible Analytics name and logo either, as these are a part of our self-hosted code.</p> <p>We face threats both from single-tenant and multi-tenant hosts and resellers. These entities compete against us using our work and brand without contributing back. For them it’s a business opportunity to commercialize open source software. They are even damaging our brand. We’ve had cases of these entities:</p> <ul> <li>Confusing people and making them think that we approve of the service they run</li> <li>Reselling our self-hosted code while running Google Analytics and other surveillance capitalism scripts on their site</li> <li>Using Google and Amazon-owned servers despite promising that they’re running on <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-illegal">EU-owned infrastructure</a></li> <li>Having a bad user experience with under provisioned servers, slow loading time, frequent downtime and no support&nbsp;</li> <li>Running paid advertising on Google and paying referral fees for people to promote them. Both marketing tactics that <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/best-marketing-practices">we say no to ourselves</a></li> </ul> <p>These use cases were never the intention behind our self-hosted release. We wanted to give site owners a way to de-Google their sites even if they didn’t want to or couldn’t use our managed service. Now, we’re facing situations where companies much larger than us with much bigger resources use our brand to compete against us and gain a business advantage.</p> <p>It’s telling that these entities rarely decide to build their brand on top of our code. They prefer to use the brand we’ve built instead as it gives them a better and easier starting point. These actions not only threaten our sustainability but also mislead people who trust the Plausible Analytics name. We want to ensure that anyone using or considering our services knows precisely what they’re getting, without confusion or misrepresentation.</p> <h2 id="sticking-to-the-agpl-license">Sticking to the AGPL license&nbsp;</h2> <p>We’re real people who have rent to pay and mouths to feed. We make $300 per month from donations from our self-hosted users. It would take us more than ten years of donations to pay one month of salary for our small team. If we cannot capture the economic value of our work, the project will become unsustainable and die.</p> <p>We believe this would not only hurt us as people but also all of the users of the product. Our self-hosted users directly benefit from the investments we can put into product development. All this is made possible and solely funded by the revenue we get from our managed hosting in the cloud.</p> <p>We’ve learned that being open source and transparent has costs. Dealing with these threats is an incredibly taxing and time-consuming distraction for our small team. It’s something our proprietary competitors never even have to think about.</p> <p>Several popular open source projects have shifted away from traditional models in the last few years because of similar threats that we’re facing. They’re adopting licenses such as the Business Source License (BSL) or the Server Side Public License (SSPL) as these licenses more directly address the concerns about resellers and hosting companies.</p> <p>These licenses are <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/">not approved nor recognized by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>, which is why we’re not interested in switching to them. We want to stay open source to continue providing a transparent and privacy-friendly web analytics tool with a “free as in beer” self-hosted release.</p> <h2 id="changes-were-making-to-our-self-hosted-release">Changes we’re making to our self-hosted release</h2> <p>Here’s how we’ll proceed with our self-hosted release. These changes will go live with the next version of our self-hosted release (2.1.0).&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/releases/tag/v2.1.0-rc.0">Release notes are here</a>.</p>  <p>Our self-hosted release will be renamed Plausible Community Edition (or Plausible CE). Plausible CE will also have a different logo from the Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the cloud. This is the main change you’ll see if you’re running our self-hosted code on your server.&nbsp;</p> <p>Plausible CE continues to be AGPL-licensed and “free as in beer”. It continues to be the same code running in the production on our managed hosting. As we’ve done so far, we’ll keep maintaining, improving and adding features to the Plausible CE with new releases twice annually.</p> <p>To further protect our brand from threats, we’ve registered trademarks for Plausible Analytics on both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="a-stronger-moat-for-our-official-managed-hosting">A stronger moat for our official managed hosting</h3> <p>We’re excluding features we use to manage Plausible Analytics at scale, such as the sites API and customer relationship management system, from Plausible CE. As a self-hoster, you likely haven’t noticed these features, as they’ve been undocumented and are primarily helpful when providing web analytics as a service.</p> <p>We’re also keeping some of the newly released business and enterprise features (<a href="https://plausible.io/docs/funnel-analysis">funnels</a> and <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/ecommerce-revenue-tracking">ecommerce revenue metrics</a> at the time of being) exclusive to the business plan subscribers on our Plausible Analytics managed hosting.&nbsp;</p> <p>The code for all these features is still available to the public so it can be reviewed and inspected, but these features will not be a part of Plausible CE and they’ll have a different license.</p> <p>This change also means that if you want to contribute to our codebase in the future as an external contributor, you’ll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).</p> <p>To provide a better service and experience to people who pay our bills, Plausible CE will continue to not have any premium customer support and is <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/building-open-source">community-supported only</a>.</p> <p>This open core model is something that GitLab and other open source projects have championed and we believe it’s the best and most open source friendly approach for the situation we’re in.</p> <h3 id="features-to-be-offered-on-top-of-plausible-ce">Features to be offered on top of Plausible CE</h3> <p>The plan moving forward is to carefully consider which features to keep exclusive to our managed cloud hosting. These will predominantly be features that help us run our managed hosting at scale and enterprise features. We aim always to ensure a protective barrier around our cloud offering.</p> <p>This doesn’t mean that all business and enterprise features won’t ever make it to the Plausible CE. Nothing from Plausible CE will be taken away in the future and we plan to periodically evaluate business and enterprise features to be added to Plausible CE.&nbsp;</p> <p>For instance, we’ve already decided to release <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/custom-props/introduction">custom properties</a> (another business feature in the cloud) as part of the Plausible CE. We’ll update the release notes with any new features making their way to Plausible CE in the future.</p> <h2 id="ensuring-the-continuous-sustainability">Ensuring the continuous sustainability</h2> <p>These changes will affect corporations that take our code to compete directly against us as it will create a more substantial moat and better protection for our official managed hosting. It will get more challenging for them to misrepresent their association with us or use our brand and logo misleadingly. And they won’t be able to offer a fully featured Plausible Analytics product with all the enterprise features included either.</p> <p>Many indie hackers that contact us about our experience of running an open source startup tell us that their main concern about open sourcing their code is the risk that large corporations will resell that code and take advantage of their project. It’s a valid concern. We hope that our new approach mitigates most potential downsides and still allows the upsides of releasing our code free to the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the change of our self-hosted release name and logo, the registration of our trademarks and the exclusive availability of certain enterprise features to our managed cloud hosting, we aim to better ensure the sustainability of Plausible Analytics in the face of external threats in the future. Thank you for your support!</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/plausible/community-edition/">Plausible CE installation instructions</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/releases/tag/v2.1.0-rc.0">Plausible CE 2.1.0&nbsp;release notes</a>.</li> <li>Complete overview of differences <a href="https://plausible.io/self-hosted-web-analytics">between Plausible Analytics Cloud and Plausible CE</a></li> </ul> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>Welcome to the home of Railway Signalling Simulations</h2>

<h2>So what is SimSig?</h2>

<p>
    Welcome to the world of railway signalling! SimSig brings the signal box to your home PC and with it the enjoyment and frustrations of running today's (and some of yesterday's) railways. How often has your train been delayed because of "signal failure" and you've wondered why trains can't be routed around the problem - or why it is even a problem in the first place? You'll soon see exactly why - with SimSig!
</p>
<p>
    SimSig puts you in the seat of a signaller, also called a Dispatcher or Network Control Officer, operating signalling screens based on the widely used IECC and Westcad graphics used in the UK. That is, you operate the signals and points/switches
    in order to get trains to their destinations on time. SimSig has a wide range of areas you can operate including large portions of the UK, a small US
    simulation, and a couple of Australian areas. Each has its own challenges and skill level, the latter ranging from easy to mentally complicated.

    <li>All signalling equipment simulated (track circuits, points, signals, etc.)</li>
    <li>Correct signalling (overlaps, aspect sequencing, approach control)</li>
    <li>Emphasis is on quality and realism, not quantity</li>
    <li>Used by signallers, drivers, and other professionals from all over the world</li>
    <li>User oriented - tell us what you want, we'll try to produce it!</li>
    <li>Free demo downloads of every simulation available right now</li>
</ul>

<p>SimSig runs on Windows 8.1 and 10.</p>

<p>
    <i>
        SimSig also runs on <a href="https://www.simsig.co.uk/Wiki/Show?page=usertrack:install">emulators such as Wine for Linux and Crossover for Mac</a>. This is not guaranteed but we try to keep such emulators supported.
        Tablets and phones are not supported.
    </i>
</p>

<h2>How much is it?</h2>

<p>
    You can peruse prices in our <a href="https://www.simsig.co.uk/Store">Shop</a> but we have several <b>free</b> simulations, then range from under £10 upwards,
    depending on the complexity of the simulation. All simulations come with an evaluation period so you can try before you buy.
</p>

<h2>Can I play with friends?</h2>

<p>
    Yes! Many of our simulations are suitable for multiplayer. The larger simulations have as many as nine positions keeping people busy. But many
    simulations also have optional automation such as ARS (Automatic Route Setting) which means you can run a larger simulation by yourself.
</p>

<p>
    Multiplayer works over the Internet, or your home LAN. One person acts as the host while others connect with an IP address and port number. We
    have run multiplayers across the world with members in the UK, the US, Australia, Europe, and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>Many simulations can be "chained", which is where adjacent areas can be linked together to form a larger area.</p>

<h2>Can I contribute?</h2>

<p>
    Unlike other products, anybody can write a timetable using the in-built timetable editor. We also do not charge for extra timetables. Our files
    area has plenty of user-contributed timetables to download.
</p>

<p><i>Sorry, users cannot produce simulations themselves.</i></p>

<h2>What does it look like?</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.simsig.co.uk/Media/LivSt2.gif"></p><p>
    Here we have the free Liverpool Street simulation running. ARS (automatic route setting) is setting the routes but we can easily take over.
    The eighteen platforms at Liverpool Street in London are very busy during the morning rush hour that we see here. The blue four-character
    labels are the train descriptions (like a flight number) such as 2H07. The signaller can identify the routing and destination of the train
    from that train description. The flashing white blobs indicate that a train is ready to depart. White lines show route set for trains, while
    you can see the signals showing red (stop), yellow (caution), double yellow (preliminary caution), or green.
</p>
<p><i>This animated GIF is running at approximately 4x normal speed.</i></p>
<center>
    
    
    <p><i><small>You must download and install the system files (from the <b>Download Now!</b> link above; under 3MB) before any simulations can be played</small></i></p>

		<p>Ariane 6 is the latest in Europe's Ariane rocket series, taking over from Ariane 5, and featuring a modular and versatile design that can launch missions from low-Earth orbit and farther out into deep space.</p><p>"A completely new rocket is not launched often, and success is far from guaranteed. I am privileged to have witnessed this historic moment when Europe's new generation of the Ariane family lifted off – successfully – effectively reinstating European access to space,” said ESA's Director General Josef Aschbacher.</p><p>"An inaugural launch is a huge undertaking from thousands of people who have worked relentlessly for years. To see it perform wonderfully at the first attempt is testament to their dedication and a demonstration of European excellence in engineering and technology. Heartfelt thanks go to the teams at ESA, CNES, ArianeGroup and Arianespace for their hard work to get to this point. I also want to sincerely thank our Member States for having enabled and supported the Ariane 6 programme along the way. Not always easy, but the endurance shown has paid off handsomely today."</p>	</div>

		<p>This inaugural flight, designated VA262, is a demonstration flight whose aim is to show the capabilities and prowess of Ariane 6 in escaping Earth's gravity and operating in space. Nevertheless, it had several passengers on board.</p><p>At 21:06 BST, 22:06 CEST,&nbsp;one hour after liftoff, the first set of satellites on board Ariane 6 were released from the upper stage and placed into an orbit 600 km above Earth. Satellites and experiments from various space agencies, companies, research institutes, universities and young professionals were included on this inaugural flight.</p>	</div>

		<p>In addition to the rocket, the liftoff demonstrated the functioning of the launch pad and operations on the ground at Europe's Spaceport. The new custom-built dedicated launch zone was built by France's space agency CNES and allows for a faster turnover of Ariane launches.</p><p>On the occasion of the launch, Philippe Baptiste, CEO of CNES, said: “With this first successful launch by Ariane 6, Europe has finally recovered its capacity to access space. Beyond the great emotion I am feeling right now, my first thoughts are for all the teams in Kourou, Paris, Vernon, Les Mureaux, Toulouse, Bremen, Lampoldshausen, Liège, Barcelona, Colleferro, Zürich and everywhere else in Europe who made this success possible. I would like to acknowledge the commitment of the employees of CNES, ESA, ArianeGroup, Arianespace and our subcontractors. The last few months have been intense, and I would like to thank them all. Europe can be proud of its space programme, Europe can be proud of its knowledge and expertise. Together, let's prepare the future of launchers and space.”</p>	</div>	
    
						
			<p>Ariane 6 was built by prime contractor and design authority ArianeGroup. “With the successful first flight of Ariane&nbsp;6, the European space industry has moved into a new era,” said Martin Sion, CEO of ArianeGroup. “This historic launch demonstrates the unfailing commitment of our teams and partners, whom I would like to thank warmly for this success, which reflects on the entire European industry. Seeing Europe’s new launcher lift off into space marks the culmination of an outstanding technical and technological adventure, and the beginning of a long history of Ariane&nbsp;6 operations. The next flight models are already in production and the stages of the second model will be shipped to the Guiana Space Centre this autumn for the first commercial flight of Ariane&nbsp;6.”</p>

		<p>With the placement of satellites into orbit, Ariane 6 has demonstrated that it can successfully launch its payloads into space, but ground control has more in store for its inaugural flight. Over the next hour, Ariane 6's upper stage will show again that it can restart its Vinci engine using the novel auxiliary propulsion unit. This restart capability will allow Ariane 6 to drop off multiple passengers into different orbits on future flights and deorbit itself through Earth’s atmosphere at the end of its mission, to ensure it does not become space debris.</p><p>On this flight the Ariane 6 upper stage is set to release two reentry capsules as it enters Earth's atmosphere for a clean disposal to burn up harmlessly, leaving no space debris in orbit.</p>	</div>

		<p>The next Ariane 6 is planned for launch this year on its first commercial flight under Arianespace as operator and launch service provider. “The success of this first flight marks the start of Ariane&nbsp;6’s operational career, giving Europe an autonomous access to space,” added Stéphane Israël, CEO of Arianespace. “The new launcher’s order book is proof of the versatility of Ariane 6 and of its capacity to accomplish a wide range of missions into multiple orbits. It reflects the confidence that customers have in Ariane 6 for both their institutional and commercial missions. We are eager to begin operating our new launcher.”</p>	</div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The amount of sugar consumed by children from soft drinks in the UK halved within a year of the sugar tax being introduced, a study has found.</p><p>The tax, which came into force in April 2018, has been so successful in improving people’s diets that experts have said an expansion to cover other high sugar food and drink products is now a “no-brainer”.</p><p>The <a href="https://jech.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/jech-2023-221051" data-link-name="in body link">research</a>, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, looked at responses from 7,999 adults and 7,656 children between 2008 and 2019 to the annual nationally representative UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey.</p><p>It showed that the daily sugar intake for children fell by about 4.8g, and for adults 10.9g, in the year after the levy’s introduction.</p><p>The total dietary free sugars, including food and drink, in children was about 70g a day at the beginning of the study, but this fell to about 45g by the end.</p><p>For adults, the study found that the total dietary free sugar consumption stood at about 60g a day, and fell to about 45g a day by the end of the study.</p><p>But despite this reduction, the amount of sugar consumed by adults and children still remains above the recommended guidelines and is contributing to high levels of tooth decay, obesity, diabetes and other illnesses.</p><p>The study found that compared to the period before the sugar tax was announced in 2016, free sugars consumed from all soft drinks reduced by around a half in children, and by a third in adults, after the levy was announced.</p><p>The researchers also note that the fall in consumption of free sugars observed in the whole diet rather than just from soft drinks suggests that consumption of free sugar from food was also falling from as early as 2008.</p><p>Eddie Crouch, the chair of the British Dental Association, said that the sugar tax was delivering “tangible results” and was effective.</p><p>He added: “Extending it to the likes of cereals is a no-brainer for any government that cares about prevention. This needn’t add to the cost of living. Where voluntary action on reformulation has failed, the levy forces the food industry to do the right thing.”</p><p>According to the World <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Health</a> Organization and the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, the consumption of free sugar should be below 5% of a person’s total calorie intake. For adults, this would be limited to 30g of sugar a day, 24g for children aged between 7 and 10, and 19g for children aged between 4 and 6.</p><p>Dr Nina Rogers, the lead author of the study and part of the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, said: “The findings of our study are encouraging and show that the UK soft drinks industry levy is linked to a significant reduction in daily sugar intake in adults and children. These results are consistent with previous research which show a reduction in household purchasing of sugar from soft drinks one year after adoption of the levy.”</p><figure id="c7041e84-e774-4012-b332-a1c667e8109c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:13,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Does Australia need a sugar tax to tackle diabetes, and how would it work?&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;c7041e84-e774-4012-b332-a1c667e8109c&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/04/australia-sugar-tax-diabetes-parliamentary-report&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>She added: “The new UK government might want to consider extending the tax to other (currently exempt) drinks which have a high sugar content, or even to some foods. They might also want to look at restructuring the tax to apply a per gram of sugar/100mls rather than threshold-based levy.”</p><p>Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in Public Health Nutrition at Queen Mary University of London, said: “This new analysis drives home the importance of policies designed to improve the nutritional quality of food and drink. In particular, the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL) in the UK has proven to be an effective lever to encourage food and drink manufacturers to reduce sugar.</p><p>“With a new government now in place, policymakers are urged to consider applying a similar levy to other discretionary products that are key contributors to sugar intake, such as chocolate confectionery, to shift diets towards a healthier direction.”</p><p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This government will take action to prevent ill-health and tackle the obesity crisis head on, easing the strain on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">NHS</a> and helping people to live well for longer.</p><p>“We will introduce tight restrictions on advertising junk food, alongside banning children from being able to purchase sugary, high-caffeine energy drinks.</p><p>“By building a healthier society, we will help to build a healthy economy.”</p></div></div>]]></description>
