</blockquote>

<p>About a year ago, we<a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/building-a-logging-platform-with-clickhouse-and-saving-millions-over-datadog"> shared the story of LogHouse </a>- our internal logging platform built to monitor ClickHouse Cloud. At the time, it managed what felt like a massive 19 PiB of data. More than just solving our observability challenges, LogHouse also saved us millions by replacing an increasingly unsustainable Datadog bill. The response to that post was overwhelming. It was clear our experience resonated with others facing similar struggles with traditional observability vendors and underscored just how critical effective data management is at scale.</p>
<p>A year later, LogHouse has grown beyond anything we anticipated and is now storing over 100 petabytes of uncompressed data across nearly 500 trillion rows. That kind of scale forced a series of architectural changes, new tools, and hard-earned lessons that we felt were worth sharing - not least that OpenTelemetry (OTel) isn’t always the panacea of Observability (though we still love it), and that sometimes custom pipelines are essential.</p>
<p><strong>In our case, this shift enabled us to handle a 20x increase in event volume using less than 10% of the CPU for our most critical data source - a transformation with massive implications for cost and efficiency.</strong></p>
<p>Other parts of our stack have also changed, not least due to the <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-acquires-hyperdx-the-future-of-open-source-observability">ClickHouse acquisition of HyperDX</a>. Not only did this give us a first-party ClickHouse-native UI, but it also led to the <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickstack-a-high-performance-oss-observability-stack-on-clickhouse">creation of ClickStack </a>- an opinionated, end-to-end observability stack built around ClickHouse. With HyperDX, we’ve started transitioning away from our Grafana-based custom UI, moving toward a more integrated experience for exploration, correlation, and root cause analysis.</p>
<p>As more teams adopt ClickHouse for observability and realize just how much they can store and query affordably, we hope these insights prove as useful as our first post. If you’re curious about this journey, when and where OTel is appropriate, and how we scaled a log pipeline to 100PB…read on.</p>

<p>Over the past year, our approach to observability has undergone a significant transformation. We've continued to leverage OpenTelemetry to gather general-purpose logs, but as our systems have scaled, we began to reach its limits. While OTel remains a valuable part of our toolkit, it couldn't fully deliver the performance and precision we needed for our most demanding workloads. This prompted us to develop purpose-built tools tailored to our critical systems and rethink where generic solutions truly fit. Along the way, we've broadened the range of data we collect and revamped how we present insights to engineers.</p>

<p>When we last wrote about LogHouse, we were proud to handle 19 PiB of uncompressed data across 37 trillion rows. Today, those numbers feel like a distant memory. LogHouse now stores over 100 petabytes of uncompressed data, representing nearly 500 trillion rows.
Here's a quick look at the breakdown:</p>




















<table><thead><tr><th>System</th><th>Uncompressed Size</th><th>Stored rows</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SysEx</td><td>93.6 PB</td><td>431 Trillion</td></tr><tr><td>OTel</td><td>14.5 PB</td><td>16.7 Trillion</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>These numbers also tell a story. In our original post, 100% of our telemetry flowed through OpenTelemetry, with every log line collected via the same general-purpose pipeline. But as the scale and complexity of our data grew, so did the need for specialization.
While our total volume has grown more than 5x, the breakdown reveals a deliberate shift in strategy: today, the vast majority of our data comes from “SysEx”, a new purpose-built exporter we developed to handle high-throughput, high-fidelity system logs from ClickHouse itself. This shift marks a turning point in how we think about observability pipelines - and brings us to our first key topic.</p>
<p>We hope the following helps comprehend the scale at which LogHouse operates.</p>


<p>Initially, we used OpenTelemetry (OTel) for all log collection. It was a great starting point and an established industry standard which allowed us to quickly establish a baseline where every pod in our Kubernetes environment shipped logs to ClickHouse. However, as we scaled, we identified two key reasons to build a specialized tool for shipping our core ClickHouse server telemetry.</p>
<p>First, while OTel capably captured the ClickHouse text log via stdout, this represents only a narrow slice of the telemetry ClickHouse exposes. Any ClickHouse expert knows that the real gold lies in its <strong>system tables</strong> - a rich, structured collection of logs, metrics, and operational insights that go far beyond what’s printed to standard output. These tables capture everything from query execution details to disk I/O and background task states, and unlike ephemeral logs, they can be retained indefinitely within a cluster. For both real-time debugging and historical analysis, this data is invaluable. We wanted all of it in LogHouse.</p>
<p>Second, the inefficiency of the OTel pipeline for this specific task became obvious as we scaled.</p>

<p>The data journey involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>A customer's ClickHouse instance writes logs as JSON to stdout.</li>
<li>The kubelet persists these logs in <code>/var/log/…</code></li>
<li>An OTel collector collects these logs from the disk, parsing and marshalling the JSON into an in-memory representation.</li>
<li>The collector transforms these into the OTel log format - again an in-memory representation.</li>
<li>Finally, they are inserted back into another ClickHouse instance (LogHouse) over the native format (requiring another transformation within the ClickHouse Go client).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The architecture described here is simplified. In reality, our OTel pipeline is more involved. Logs were first collected at the edge in JSON, converted into the OTel format, and sent over OTLP to a set of gateway instances. These gateways (also OTel collectors) performed additional processing before finally converting the data into ClickHouse’s native format for ingestion. Each step introduced overhead, latency, and further complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At our scale, this pipeline introduced two critical problems: inefficiency and data loss. First, we were burning substantial compute on repeated data transformations. Native ClickHouse types were being flattened into JSON, mapped into the OTel log format, and then re-ingested - only to be reinterpreted by ClickHouse on the other end. This not only wasted CPU cycles but also degraded the fidelity of the data.
Even more importantly, we were hitting hard resource limits on the collectors themselves. Deployed as agents on each Kubernetes node, they were subject to strict CPU and memory constraints via standard Kubernetes limits. As traffic spiked, many collectors ran so hot they began dropping log lines outright - unable to keep up with the volume emitted by ClickHouse. We were losing data at the edge before it ever had a chance to reach LogHouse.
We found ourselves at a crossroads: either dramatically scale up the resource footprint of our OTel agents (and gateways) or rethink the entire ingestion model. We chose the latter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: To put the cost in perspective - handling 20 million rows per second through the OpenTelemetry pipeline without dropping events would require an estimated 8,000 CPU cores across agents and collectors. That’s an enormous footprint dedicated solely to log collection, making it clear that the general-purpose approach was unsustainable at our scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our solution was to develop the <strong>System Tables Exporter</strong>, or <strong>SysEx</strong>. This is a specialized tool designed to transfer data from one ClickHouse instance to another as efficiently as possible. We wanted to go directly from the system tables in a customer's pod to the tables in LogHouse, preserving native ClickHouse types and eliminating all intermediate conversions. This has the fantastic side benefit that any query our engineers use to troubleshoot a live instance can be trivially adapted to query historical data across our entire fleet in LogHouse, as the table schemas are identical, with the addition of some enrichment columns (such as the Pod Name, ClickHouse version, etc).</p>
<p>Firstly we should emphasize that SysEx performs a <strong>literal byte-for-byte copy</strong> of data from the source to the destination. This preserves full fidelity, eliminates unnecessary CPU overhead, and avoids the pitfalls of repeated marshalling.</p>

<p>The architecture is simple and powerful. We run a pool of SysEx scrapers connecting to our customer's ClickHouse instances. A hash ring assigns each customer pod to a specific scraper replica to distribute the load. These scrapers then run SELECT queries against the source pod's system tables and stream the data directly into LogHouse, without any deserialization. The scrapers simply coordinate and forward bytes between the source and destination.
Scraping system tables requires careful handling to ensure no data is missed due to buffer flushes. Fortunately, nearly all system table data is inherently time-series in nature. SysEx leverages this by querying within a sliding time window, deliberately trailing real time by a small buffer - typically five minutes. This delay allows for any internal buffers to flush, ensuring that when a scraper queries a node, all relevant rows for that time window are present and complete. This strategy has proven reliable and meets our internal SLAs for timely and complete event delivery to LogHouse.</p>
<p>SysEx is written in Go, like most of our infrastructure components for ClickHouse Cloud. Naturally, this raises a question for anyone familiar with the Go ClickHouse client: how do we avoid the built-in marshalling and unmarshalling of data when reading from and writing to ClickHouse? By default, the client converts data into Go-native types, which would defeat the purpose of a byte-for-byte copy. To solve this, we <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go/pull/1233">contributed improvements</a> to the Go client that allow us to <strong>bypass internal marshalling entirely</strong>, enabling SysEx to stream data in its native format directly from the source cluster to LogHouse - without decoding, re-encoding, or allocating intermediary data structures.</p>
<p>This approach is broadly equivalent to a simple bash command:</p>
<pre><code>curl -s -u <span>'default:&lt;password&gt;'</span> <span>"https://sql-clickhouse.clickhouse.com:8443/?query=SELECT+*+FROM+system.query_log+FORMAT+Native"</span> | curl -s -X POST --data-binary @- <span>'http://localhost:8123/?query=INSERT+INTO+query_log+FORMAT+Native'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>An actual go implementation for the curious can be found <a href="https://pastila.nl/?00740eb5/722157a76fc25f54212d7097b805253b#OSfprbH3wM1dGgtyMAnmuw==">here</a>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, SysEx doesn’t require the heavy buffering that OTel does, thanks to its pull-based model. Because scrapers query data at a steady, controlled rate, we don’t risk dropping logs when LogHouse is temporarily unavailable or when the source experiences a spike in telemetry. Instead, SysEx naturally handles backfill by scraping historical windows, ensuring reliable delivery without overloading the system or requiring complex retry buffers.</p>


<p>One of the key challenges with the SysEx approach is that it assumes the source and target schemas match. But in reality, as any ClickHouse user knows, system table schemas change frequently. Engineers continuously add new metrics and columns to support emerging features and accelerate issue diagnosis, which means the schema is a moving target.</p>
<p>To handle this, we generate schemas dynamically. When SysEx encounters a system table, it inspects and hashes its schema to determine if a matching table already exists in LogHouse. If it does, the data is inserted there. If not, a new schema version is created for this system table e.g. <code>text_log_6</code>.</p>
<p>At query time, we use ClickHouse’s <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-release-25-01#better-merge-tables">Merge table engine</a> to unify all schema iterations into a single logical view. This allows us to query across multiple versions of a system table seamlessly. The engine automatically resolves schema differences by selecting only the columns that are compatible across tables, or by restricting the query to tables that contain the requested columns. This gives us forward compatibility as schemas evolve, without sacrificing query simplicity or requiring manual schema management.</p>

<p>As we continued to scale and refine our observability capabilities, one of our primary focuses was capturing in-memory system tables, such as <code>system.processes</code>. Unlike the time-series data we’ve been capturing, these tables provide a snapshot of the server’s state at a specific point in time. To handle this, we implemented a periodic snapshot process, capturing these in-memory tables and storing them in LogHouse.</p>
<p>This approach not only allows us to capture the state of the cluster at any given moment, but also provides time-travel through critical details like table schemas and cluster settings. With this additional data, we are able to enhance our diagnostic capabilities by performing cluster-wide or ClickHouse Cloud-wide analyses. This we can join against service settings or query characteristics like used_functions to pinpoint anomalies, making it easier to identify the root causes of issues as they arise. By correlating queries with particular schemas, we further improved our ability to proactively identify and resolve performance or reliability problems for our customers.</p>

<p>One of the many powerful capabilities we've unlocked with SysEx is the ability to take the same <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/common-issues-you-can-solve-using-advanced-monitoring-dashboards">Advanced Dashboard queries</a>  that customers use to monitor their individual ClickHouse instances and run them across our entire fleet of customer instances simultaneously.</p>
<p>For release analysis, we can now execute proven diagnostic queries before and after deployments to immediately identify behavioral changes across our entire fleet. This has been rolled into our comprehensive release analysis process. Queries that analyze query performance patterns, resource utilization trends, and error rates complete in real time, allowing us to quickly spot regressions or validate improvements at fleet scale.</p>
<p>Secondly, our support dashboards can now embed the same deep diagnostic queries that customers rely on, but with enriched context from our centralized telemetry. When investigating customer issues, support engineers can run familiar Advanced Dashboard queries while simultaneously correlating with network logs, Kubernetes events, data and control plane events - all within the same interface.</p>

<p>The efficiency gains from this SysEx are staggering. Consider these stats from LogHouse:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OTel Collectors:</strong> Use over 800 CPU cores to ship 2 million logs per second.</li>
<li><strong>LogHouse Scrapers (SysEx):</strong> Use just 70 CPU cores to ship 37 million logs per second.</li>
</ul>
<p>This specialized approach has allowed us to handle a 20x increase in event volume with less than 10 percent of the CPU footprint for our most important data source. Most importantly, it means we no longer drop events at the edge. To achieve this same level of reliability with our previous OTel-based pipeline, <strong>we would have needed over 8,000 CPU cores</strong>. SysEx delivers it with a fraction of the resources, maintaining full fidelity and consistent delivery.</p>

<p>If you’ve read this far, you might be wondering: when is OpenTelemetry still the right choice, and is it still useful?
We firmly believe that it is. While our architecture has evolved to meet challenges at extreme scale, such as parsing and processing over 20 million log lines per second, OpenTelemetry remains a critical part of our stack. It offers a standardized, vendor-neutral format and provides an excellent onboarding experience for new users - and is hence the default choice for ClickStack. Unlike SysEx, which is tightly integrated with ClickHouse internals, OpenTelemetry decouples producers from consumers, which is a major architectural advantage, especially for users who want flexibility across observability platforms.</p>
<p>It is also well suited for scenarios where SysEx cannot operate. SysEx is pull-based and relies on querying live system tables, which means the service must be healthy and responsive. If a service is crash-looping or down, SysEx is unable to scrape data because the necessary system tables are unavailable. OpenTelemetry, by contrast, operates in a passive fashion. It captures logs emitted to <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>, even when the service is in a failed state. This allows us to collect logs during incidents and perform root cause analysis even if the service never became fully healthy.
For this reason, we continue to run OpenTelemetry across all ClickHouse services. The key difference is in what we collect. Previously, we ingested everything, including trace-level logs. Now, we collect only info-level and above. This significantly reduces the data volume and allows our OTel collectors and gateways to operate with far fewer resources. The result is a smaller, more focused pipeline that still accounts for the 2 million log lines per second referenced earlier.</p>

<p>Collecting all this data is just the beginning. Making it usable and accessible is what really matters. In the first iteration of LogHouse, we built a highly customized observability experience on top of Grafana. It served us well, but as our internal data sources grew and diversified, particularly with the introduction of SysEx and wide-column telemetry, it became clear we needed something more deeply integrated with ClickHouse.</p>
<p>This challenge was not unique to us. Many teams building observability solutions on ClickHouse have encountered the same issue. Getting data into ClickHouse was straightforward, but building a UI that fully unlocked its value required significant engineering effort. For smaller teams or companies without dedicated frontend resources, ClickHouse-powered observability was often out of reach.</p>
<p>HyperDX changed that. It provided a first-party, ClickHouse-native UI that supports log and trace exploration, correlation, and analysis at scale. Its workflows are designed with ClickHouse in mind, optimizing queries and minimizing latency. When we evaluated HyperDX prior to the acquisition, it was already clear that it addressed many of the pain points we and others had experienced. The ability to query using Lucene syntax dramatically simplifies data exploration and is often sufficient. Importantly, it still allows us to query in SQL - something which we still find essential for more complex event analysis - see “SQL for more complex analysis”.</p>
<p>A key reason HyperDX was such a compelling fit was the schema-agnostic <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickstack-a-high-performance-oss-observability-stack-on-clickhouse">approach introduced in v2.0</a>. It doesn't require log tables to conform to a single, rigid structure. This flexibility is critical for a system like LogHouse, which ingests data from numerous sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>It seamlessly handles the standardized, yet evolving, data format from our <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> pipeline.</li>
<li>More importantly, it works out-of-the-box with the highly specialized, wide-column tables produced by <strong>SysEx</strong> and our other custom exporters. It does this with no prior knowledge of the SysEx schemas, or complex <em>grok pattern</em> specializations. It simply inspects the schema behind-the-scenes and adapts to work with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means our engineering teams can add new data sources with unique, optimal schemas to LogHouse without ever needing to worry about breaking or reconfiguring the user interface. By combining HyperDX's powerful UI and session replay capabilities with LogHouse's massive data repository, we have created a unified and adaptable observability experience for our engineers.</p>

<p>It is worth emphasizing that Grafana still has its place in our observability stack. Our internal Grafana-based application has some distinct advantages, particularly in how it handles routing and query scoping. Users are required to specify the namespace (effectively a customer service) they intend to query. Behind the scenes, the application knows exactly where data for each service resides and can route queries directly to the appropriate ClickHouse instance within LogHouse. This minimizes unnecessary query execution across unrelated services and helps keep resource usage efficient.</p>
<p>This is especially important in our environment, where we operate LogHouse databases across many regions. As our previous blog post described, efficiently querying across these distributed systems is critical for performance and reliability. We’re currently exploring how we might push this routing logic to ClickHouse itself, allowing HyperDX to benefit from the same optimization..so stay tuned.</p>
<p>In addition to its routing capabilities, Grafana remains the home for many of our long-standing dashboards and alerts, particularly those built on Prometheus metrics. These remain valuable, and migrating them is not currently a priority. For example, kube_state_metrics has almost become a de facto standard for cluster health monitoring. These high-level metrics are well suited for alerting, even if they are not ideal for deep investigation. For now, they continue to serve their purpose effectively.</p>
<p>For now, the two tools serve complementary purposes and coexist effectively within our observability stack.</p>

<p><em>Store everything, aggregate nothing</em></p>
<p>The development of SysEx has brought more than just technical gains. It has driven a cultural shift in how we think about observability. By unlocking access to system tables that were previously unavailable, where only standard output logs had been captured, we have embraced a model centered on wide events and high cardinality data.</p>
<p>Some refer to this as Observability 2.0. <strong>We simply call it LogHouse combined with ClickStack.</strong></p>
<p>This approach replaces the traditional three-pillar model with something more powerful: a centralized warehouse that can store high-cardinality telemetry from many sources. Each row contains rich context - query identifiers, pod names, version metadata, network details - without needing to pre-aggregate or discard dimensions to fit within the limits of a metric store.</p>
<p>As engineers, we have adapted to this new model, leaving behind outdated concerns about cardinality explosions. Instead of summarizing at ingest time, we store everything as is and push aggregation to query time. This approach allows for in-depth inspection and flexible exploration without sacrificing fidelity.</p>
<p>One pattern we have found particularly impactful is logging wide events that include timeseries attributes in place of traditional metrics. For example, here is a log line from SysEx that tracks data pushed from a source ClickHouse instance to the LogHouse cluster:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"level"</span><span>:</span> <span>"info"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"ts"</span><span>:</span> <span>1728437333.011701</span><span>,</span>

  <span>"podIP"</span><span>:</span> <span>"10.247.29.9"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"spokenName"</span><span>:</span> <span>"plum-qa-31"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"azTopoName"</span><span>:</span> <span>"us-east1-c"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"srcTable"</span><span>:</span> <span>"part_log"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"windowSize"</span><span>:</span> <span>120</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"insertDuration"</span><span>:</span> <span>0.00525254</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"insertLag"</span><span>:</span> <span>300.011693981</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"startGTE"</span><span>:</span> <span>1728436913</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"stopLT"</span><span>:</span> <span>1728437033</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you may be asking: <strong>how is this different from a traditional metrics store like Prometheus?</strong></p>
<p>The key difference is that we store <strong>every single data point</strong>. We do not pre-aggregate fields like <code>insertDuration</code>; instead, we capture and retain each value and store it together.</p>
<p>In contrast, a system like Prometheus typically stores either a gauge per series or, more commonly, pre-aggregates values into histograms to support efficient querying. This design introduces significant limitations. For example, storing time series for all label combinations in Prometheus would lead to a cardinality explosion. In our environment, with tens of thousands of unique pod names, each label combination would require its own timeseries just to preserve query-time flexibility. Pre-aggregating with histograms helps control resource usage but comes at the cost of fidelity. It makes certain questions impossible to answer, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Which exact insert is represented by this spike in insertDuration - down to the specific instance, table, and time window?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With our approach, we avoid these trade-offs entirely. We log each event as a wide row that captures all relevant dimensions and metrics in full. This shifts aggregation and summarization to query time while preserving the ability to drill down into individual events when necessary.</p>
<p>This model isn’t entirely new. Systems like Elasticsearch have long encouraged the ingestion of wide events and flexible document structures. The difference is that ClickHouse makes this approach operationally viable at scale. Its columnar design allows us to store high-cardinality, high-volume event data efficiently - without the runaway storage costs or query latency that traditionally limited these kinds of approaches to storing events.</p>

<p>The power of this approach is in how we can use that single event to draw many different conclusions by visualising its various characteristics, and we can always jump back to the raw logs from any given point on a chart.</p>
<p>First, we can focus on a particular service and see its inserts line by line in series. This is the raw view upon the data.</p>

<p>We can visualize the insert lag for all tables for this individual instance trivially…</p>

<p>We may go a layer up and visualise the insert lag for all servers in a region, which have lag &gt; desired.</p>

<p>And, because Observability is <em>Just another Data Problem</em>, we get to borrow all of the tooling in the data science space for our observability data, so we can visualise our logs in any tool of our choice for which C<a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/data-visualization">lickHouse either integrates directly</a> or <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/language-clients">via a client library</a>.

<p>The plot shows scrape time versus wall time, allowing us to inspect each event for duplication. With Plotly, I could size the width of the rectangles as the exact start/end times. The annotations highlight a window where duplicate scrapes occurred, confirming the presence of overlapping data in that range.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This plot illustrates the varying insert duration for some tables collected by the LogHouse Scraper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I tend to prefer Plotly, we recognize that others may favor more modern visualization libraries. Thanks to ClickHouse's broad integration support, our SREs can choose the best tools for their workflows. Whether it’s Hex, Bokeh, Evidence, or any other platform that supports SQL-driven analysis, they are free to work with the approach that suits them best.</p>
<p>Here, we saw five views of the same event - demonstrating the flexibility we have to choose how we render at query time, using different charting tools, always with the ability to drill down into the raw line-by-line events.</p>

<p>HyperDX offers a robust event search interface utilizing Lucene syntax, ideal for quick lookups and filtering. However, to answer more complex observability questions, a more expressive query language is needed. With ClickHouse as the engine behind LogHouse, we can always drop into full SQL</p>
<p>SQL allows us to express joins, time-based operations, and transformations that would be difficult or impossible to perform in typical log query tools. One example is identifying pod termination times by correlating Kubernetes event streams. The query below uses ASOF JOIN to align Killing and Created events for the same container, calculating the time between termination and restart:</p>

<p>Sure, we could write a component to track this as a metric, but the power of ClickHouse is that we don’t need to do so. It’s sufficient to store a warehouse of wide events and derive the metric we need at query time from them. So, when a colleague asks, ‘what’s the p95 replacement time for Pods after termination is requested’, we can just find a relevant set of events instead of responding, 'let me ship a new metric ', and getting back to them with an answer after the next release goes out.</p>

<p>Sold on the immense value of having deep, structured telemetry in a high-performance analytics engine, we've been busy adding more data sinks to LogHouse, mainly at the request of our engineering and support team, who love using LogHouse and want all critical data to live in the warehouse. This year, we've embraced a cultural shift towards high-cardinality, wide-event-based observability as shown above.</p>
<p>Some of our new data sources, which adhere to this wide event philosophy, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>kubenetmon:</strong> Our open-source tool for monitoring Kubernetes networking, giving us deep insights into cluster traffic. <code>kubenetmon</code> uses Linux's conntrack system to capture L3/L4 connection data with byte/packet counts. This provides three key capabilities: forensics (time-series connection records with per-minute bandwidth), attribution (mapping connections to specific workloads and pods), and metering (cost tracking for expensive data transfer like cross-region egress). The system processes millions of connection observations per minute, helping us identify costly cross-regional downloads, track cross-AZ traffic patterns, and correlate network usage with actual costs. You can find the project at<a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/kubenetmon"> https://github.com/ClickHouse/kubenetmon</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Kubernetes Event Exporter:</strong> We forked the popular exporter and added a native ClickHouse sink, allowing us to analyze Kubernetes API events at scale. You can find our fork <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/kubernetes-event-exporter">here</a>. This is hugely useful for understanding why things changed in K8s over time. We’re not stopping there, however! We’re already working on a plan to ingest not just the events, but the entire k8s object model into LogHouse, with snapshots at every change. This would allow us to model the full state of all clusters at any moment in time over the past six months, and step through all of the changes. Instead of just knowing "Pod X was terminated at 15<!-- -->," we’ll see the full cluster state before and after, understand dependencies, resource constraints, and the cascading effects of changes.</li>
<li><strong>Control Plane Data:</strong> We collect all operational data from our Control Plane department, who had not yet onboarded into LogHouse.</li>
<li><strong>Real User Monitoring (RUM):</strong> In a project that is still a work in progress, we collect frontend performance metrics from our users' browsers, which are pushed via a public gateway into our OTel pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Istio Access Log:</strong> We ingest HTTP-level traffic data from our Istio service mesh, capturing request/response patterns, latencies, and routing decisions. Combined with ClickHouse's system.query_log and kubenetmon's network flows, this creates a powerful tri-dimensional correlation capability. When network usage spikes occur, our support team can trace the complete story: which specific SQL queries were executing, what HTTP requests triggered them, and the exact packet flow patterns. This cross-layer visibility transforms debugging from guesswork into precise root cause analysis - if we see unusual egress traffic, we can immediately identify whether it's from expensive cross-region queries, backup operations, or unexpected replication, making troubleshooting incredibly efficient for the support team.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been an incredible year of growth for LogHouse. By moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach and embracing specialized, highly efficient tooling, we’ve scaled our observability platform to remarkable new heights while significantly enhancing our cost performance. Integrating HyperDX is a key part of that evolution, providing a flexible and powerful user experience on top of our petabyte-scale data warehouse. We're excited to see what the next year brings as we continue to build on this strong foundation.</p>

<p>While SysEx is designed to be efficient and resource-conscious, customers occasionally notice our scrape queries in their logs and metrics. These queries are <strong>tightly constrained with strict memory limits</strong>, but when they error (as they sometimes do) it can create concern. Although the actual resource impact is minimal, we recognize that even lightweight queries can create noise or confusion in sensitive environments.</p>
<p>To address this, we’re exploring what we call <strong>zero-impact scraping</strong> - the next evolution of SysEx. The goal is to eliminate all in-cluster query execution by entirely decoupling scraping from the live system. One promising direction involves leveraging <strong><a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/storing-data#s3-plain-rewritable-storage">plain rewritable disks on S3</a></strong>, where ClickHouse already writes its service logs. In this model, a pool of SysEx workers would mount these disk-based log tables directly, bypassing the need to query the running ClickHouse instance. This design would deliver all the benefits of our current system - native format, high fidelity, minimal transformation - while removing even the perception of operational impact.</p>
<p>OpenTelemetry remains a critical component of our platform, particularly for early-stage data capture before service tables are available. This is especially useful during crash loops, where structured logs may be unavailable. However, if our zero-impact scraping approach proves successful, it could reduce our reliance on OTel even further by providing a high-fidelity, low-disruption path for log ingestion throughout the lifecycle of a cluster.</p>
<p>This effort is still in progress, and we’ll share more once we’ve validated the approach in production.</p>

<p>The JSON type has been available in ClickHouse for some time and <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-release-25-03">recently reached GA in version 25.3</a>. It offers a flexible and efficient way to store semi-structured data, dynamically creating columns with appropriate types as new fields appear. It even supports <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/a-new-powerful-json-data-type-for-clickhouse">fields with multiple types</a> and gracefully handles schema explosion.</p>
<p>Despite these advantages, we’re still evaluating how well JSON fits common observability access patterns at scale. For example, querying a string across an entire JSON blob can effectively involve scanning thousands of columns. There are workarounds - such as also storing a raw string version of the JSON alongside the structured data - but we’re still developing best practices in this area.</p>
<p>Culturally, we have also come to recognize the practical limits of the Map type, which has served us well. Most of our log and resource attributes are small and stable enough that the Map continues to be the right fit. We have found that single-level JSON logs are often all you need, and for exceptions, tools like HyperDX automatically translate map access into <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/json-functions#jsonextract">JSONExtract</a> functions. While we plan to adopt JSON more broadly, this is still a work in progress. Expect us to share more in a future update.</p>

<p>Over the past year, LogHouse has evolved from an ambitious logging system into a foundational observability platform powering everything from performance analysis to real-time debugging across ClickHouse Cloud. What began as a cost-saving measure has become a catalyst for both cultural and technical transformation, shifting us toward high-fidelity, wide-event telemetry at massive scale. By combining specialized tools like SysEx with general-purpose frameworks like OpenTelemetry, and layering on flexible interfaces like HyperDX, we have built a system that not only keeps up with our growth but also unlocks entirely new workflows. The journey is far from over, but the lessons from scaling to 100PB and 500 trillion rows continue to shape how we think about observability as a core data problem we are solving at warehouse scale.</p></div><p><a href="https://clickhouse.cloud/signUp?loc=blog-cta-footer&amp;utm_source=clickhouse&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=blog">Get started</a> with ClickHouse Cloud today and receive $300 in credits.

                <h3>How can I try out Cosmoe?</h3>
                <p>Cosmoe is still a work in progress, and exists as a source-only technology preview for now.  To run it, clone or download the <a href="https://gitlab.com/haydentech/cosmoe-wayland/">Cosmoe source code repo from Gitlab</a> and compile the code on your Linux distribution of choice.  There are several sample applications included which demonstrate what it is capable of.</p>
                </div><!-- End Faq item-->

              <div>
                <h3>What are the plans for Cosmoe going forward?</h3>
                <div><p>Cosmoe needs 2 main improvements to be a reliable, full-featured UI library:</p><p>
					<strong>Stability</strong><br>While I've made incredible strides with getting the BeOS class libraries to talk to Wayland, much work still remains to weed out crashes and incorrect behavior.  Wayland is powerful, but not friendly.</p><p>
					<strong>Compatibility</strong><br>Cosmoe implements about 95% of the BeOS API currently.  Notable feature that are not yet implemented include "offscreen" BBitmaps for accelerated drawing, and BFilePanel which implements Open and Save dialog boxes.  Some file-related classes like BVolume are only partially implemented.  Also, for security reasons, Wayland forbids certain Window-related actions such as window positioning and centering, so that functionality can never exist.</p><p>
					For more details on this items and other in-progress aspects of Cosmoe, please see the <a href="https://gitlab.com/haydentech/cosmoe-wayland/-/blob/master/TODO?ref_type=heads">TODO file in the Cosmoe repo</a>.
				</p></div>
                </div><!-- End Faq item-->

              <div>
                <h3>What license does Cosmoe use?</h3>
                <p>Cosmoe is distributed under the MIT license.</p>
                </div><!-- End Faq item-->

              <div>
                <h3>What source code comprises Cosmoe?  Where did it come from, and what inspired it?</h3>
                <p>Cosmoe is a fork of the Haiku operating system, which itself is an open-source re-implementation of BeOS.  The current iteration of Cosmoe is implemented as a UI library, but <a href="https://gitlab.com/haydentech/cosmoe-haiku/">the previous iteration (now known as "Cosmoe Classic")</a> was a full port of Haiku to the Linux kernel.</p>
                </div><!-- End Faq item-->

              <div>
                <h3>How is the current iteration of Cosmoe different from Cosmoe Classic?</h3>
                <p>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/haydentech/cosmoe-wayland/">current iteration of Cosmoe</a> is a shared library which implements the BeOS class library on top of Wayland.  There are no supporting programs, e.g. app_server or registrar, needed to use it.  All the necessary functionality is rolled into the library.  Apps linked with the library run natively on Linux via Wayland.
  <br>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/haydentech/cosmoe-haiku/">previous iteration of Cosmoe (now known as "Cosmoe Classic")</a> is a full port of the Haiku OS to the Linux kernel.  It runs inside an SDL window on Linux.  It would be possible to develop graphics drivers to allow it to run as its own standalone Linux-based OS, but those have not been developed.
<br>Moving forward, my focus is on the shared library version since I believe it has the most practical benefit.</p>

"The EFS has just discovered the 48<sup>th</sup> blood group system in the world!" the agency said in a statement on the social network LinkedIn. "This discovery was officially recognised in early June in Milan by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT)."</p>              <p>The announcement was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient who was undergoing routine tests ahead of surgery, the French Blood Establishment (EFS) said on Friday. The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems. The discovery was first reported by radio <a href="https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/podcasts/l-info-de-france-inter/l-info-de-france-inter-1294478" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Nouvelle fenêtre">France Inter</a>.</p>                   <p>Thierry Peyrard, a medical biologist at the EFS involved in the discovery, told AFP that a "very unusual" antibody was first found in the patient in 2011. However, resources at the time did not allow for further research, he added. Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to "high-throughput DNA sequencing", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said.</p>              <p>The patient, who was 54 at the time and lived in Paris, was undergoing routine tests before surgery when the unknown antibody was detected, Peyrard said. This woman "is undoubtedly the only known case in the world," said the expert. "She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself," he said. Peyrard said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene.</p>              <p>The name "Gwada negative", which refers to the patient's origins and "sounds good in all languages," has been popular with the experts, said Peyrard. He and colleagues are now hoping to find other people with the same blood group. "Discovering new blood groups means offering patients with rare blood types a better level of care," the EFS said.</p>              <p>The ABO blood group system was first discovered in the early 1900s. Thanks to DNA sequencing the discovery of new blood groups has accelerated in recent years.</p>              <section>  <p>  <span>Le Monde</span>  </p>   </section>    <section>     <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/syndication/" title="Reuse this content" target="_blank">Reuse this content</a>   </section>   </article>   </section>                        </section>          <section id="js-capping" data-full="0" data-mini="0">  <section id="js-capping-content"> <p>Vous pouvez lire <i>Le Monde</i> sur un seul appareil à la fois</p>   <p>Ce message s’affichera sur l’autre appareil.</p>    <a href="https://moncompte.lemonde.fr/" id="js-capping-yellow-button" data-cta="multi">Découvrir les offres multicomptes</a>  </section> <section id="js-capping-bottom">     <ul id="js-capping-faq"> <li> <p>Parce qu’une autre personne (ou vous) est en train de lire <i>Le Monde</i> avec ce compte sur un autre appareil.</p> <p>Vous ne pouvez lire <i>Le Monde</i> que sur <strong>un seul appareil</strong> à la fois (ordinateur, téléphone ou tablette).</p> </li> <li> <p>Comment ne plus voir ce message ?</p> <p>En cliquant sur «&nbsp;&nbsp;» et en vous assurant que vous êtes la seule personne à consulter <i>Le Monde</i> avec ce compte.</p> </li> <li> <p>Que se passera-t-il si vous continuez à lire ici ?</p> <p>Ce message s’affichera sur l’autre appareil.

<p>You may not need any incentive to do this, but I’m going to argue that moving from WhatsApp to Signal is an important action, right now. There are other alternatives to WhatsApp, of course, but several have received criticism over various issues so I’m going to focus on Signal here. Please comment below if you’d like to propose ethical alternatives to WhatsApp. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In March I argued that we should <a href="https://greenstarsproject.org/2025/03/30/bluesky-an-ethical-replacement-for-x-twitter/"><strong>choose Bluesky over X/Twitter</strong></a>, based on the obvious reason of boycotting companies connected to Musk. Bluesky is structured as a benefit corporation (like Patagonia) and based on an open network, two features that create strong incentives for the company to not upset its users.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This creates an alignment between Bluesky and its users – Bluesky is disincentivized to make a bad user experience. This also acts as a kind of poison pill against a billionaire takeover, or at least a deterrent against this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moving from X/Twitter to Bluesky does require some sacrifice for people who worked hard to build up a following on the former. But we’ve reached a point where support of Musk is unconscionable, whatever the sacrifice involved. The move from WhatsApp to Signal, however, is quite straightforward and completely painless. But in this case, some may be wondering, <em>why should I bother moving at all?</em></p>

<h2>Ethical issues with WhatsApp</h2>



<p>My biggest issues with using WhatsApp are related to its parent corporation, Meta (formerly Facebook) and its founder/CEO Mark Zuckerberg. But first, I want to mention a few issues specific to WhatsApp.</p>



<p>In early 2021, WhatsApp updated its terms of service, requiring users to opt into <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/whatsapps-new-terms-of-service-are-a-facebook-or-die-ultimatum/">sharing their data</a> with Facebook – including network details and location (even if you haven’t turned on location sharing). This 180° reversal on an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users">earlier promise</a> made by Zuckerberg that “WhatsApp is going to operate completely autonomously” was one of several events over the last 5 years that accelerated an exodus from WhatsApp to Signal. The large amount of metadata that WhatsApp collects is also shared with law enforcement agencies.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WhatsApp shares metadata, unencrypted records that can reveal a lot about a user’s activity, with law enforcement agencies such as the Department of Justice. Some rivals, such as Signal, intentionally gather much less metadata to avoid incursions on its users’ privacy, and thus share far less with law enforcement. – <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users">ProPublica</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have to admit that I don’t give a huge amount of time fretting over these things during normal times. But we no longer live in normal times – people are now guilty by suspicion (or by association, based on their WhatsApp contacts) and convicted without due process.</p>



<p>Over the years, Zuckerberg and Meta have done more flip flopping than a White Lotus guest (walking around in flip-flops, you see). Facebook has since been <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_1369">fined</a> €110 million by EU antitrust regulators and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions">$5 billion</a> by the US Federal Trade Commission for deceiving regulators and users. Following this greater level of scrutiny, Zuckerberg has shown himself to be a person of little scruples, capitulating to whoever will do him favors.</p>



<h2>Meta and Zuckerberg</h2>



<p>Meta – a company so bad that it had to change its name to try to clean its reputation. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> involved the collection of user data without consent to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychographics">psychographic profiles</a> that were used in Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign and suppressing Black voters in Trinidad and Tobago. WhatsApp, in particular, played a role in the Brazil’s 2018 election.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of false information shared on WhatsApp in Brazil during the presidential election favoured the far-right winner, Jair Bolsonaro. The analysis sheds light on the spread of misinformation on the Facebook-owned app, with fears it could be poisoning political debate in one of the largest democracies in the world. – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/whatsapp-fake-news-brazil-election-favoured-jair-bolsonaro-analysis-suggests">The Guardian</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>Companies supporting Jair Bolsonaro are buying a service called “mass blasts,” using the candidate’s list of WhatsApp users or buying lists from agencies specializing in digital strategy. – <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/10/businessmen-fund-whatsapp-campaign-against-pt.shtml">Folha de S.Paulo</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2018, Zuckerberg testified before US Congress, admitting: “It was my mistake, and I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>Aww! You’re totally forgiven, Zuck! You’ve learned your lesson, right?</p>



<p>But wait! Last year, as you probably know, Zuckerberg did the cowardly act of endorsing Trump by implication. I happened to catch this interview with the Zuck live on Bloomberg and was totally gagged (Hey Gen Z readers!). Take a look and marvel at Zuck sticking to his guns and maintaining his neutrality:</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe title="Zuckerberg Calls Trump 'Badass' Without Endorsing Him #politics" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bE7SyQWf4_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>Post-election, Zuck flew down to Florida for dinner with Trump (I’m imagining scenes from the hunting episode of <em>Succession</em>) and then got rid of DEI and moderation and all that weak stuff. It didn’t take long for Zuck to switch from humility (<em>It was my mistake, and I’m sorry</em>) to going on the Joe Rogan show to say this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Masculine energy is good, and obviously, society has plenty of that, but I think corporate culture was really trying to get away from it,” Zuckerberg continued. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive.” – <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-masculine-feminine-energy">Mashable</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Ethical review of Signal</h2>



<p>Signal provides a very similar user experience to WhatsApp, so switching over is pretty seamless. This is not too surprising, considering that the current CEO of Signal LLC., Brian Action, was one of the cofounders of WhatsApp. WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook in 2014, and Acton <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/whatsapp-co-founder-acton-named-signals-interim-ceo-2022-01-10/">left the company</a> three years later due to differences around the use of customer data and targeted advertising.</p>



<p>A year later, Acton contributed $50 million to launch a non-profit, the Signal Foundation and a subsidiary, Signal Messenger, LLC.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On 21 February 2018, Moxie Marlinspike and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton announced the formation of the Signal Technology Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is “to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal’s mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous”. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)#History">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/secure-messaging-scorecard">ranked messaging apps</a> for privacy and transparency, Signal was one of the few that received a perfect score. The nonprofit also has an <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-use-signal">updated guide</a> to using Signal, navigating its settings, etc.</p>



<p>The protection of data and personal privacy is important. The nonprofit Signal Foundation is led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Whittaker">Meredith Whittaker</a>, a former director of the AI Now Institute at NYU, which examined the social impacts of AI and concentration of power in tech. She is a strong proponent of protecting privacy as a human right and an opponent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>. Signal’s predecessor, Open Whisper Systems <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/tor-signal-funding-donald-trump-steve-bannon-encryption/">received funding from</a> journalism nonprofit Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p>



<p>Signal has been recommended to Democratic Party staffers and officially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)#History">approved</a> by the US Senate in 2017. Just not for texting top secret plans, obviously!</p>

<h3>Action plan for migrating from WhatsApp</h3>



<p>It’s easy to see how we all get drawn into using specific apps like WhatsApp – the user base reaches a critical size and it becomes the app to find everyone on. At the same time, the company becomes more lucrative (and in many cases is taken over by a bigger fish) and then ethical issues creep in. We learn to suppress our concerns because the app is just too convenient and, to quote The Cranberries, <em>Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We? </em>(R.I.P., Dolores).</p>



<p>The exit plan from WhatsApp is quite simple. Start by installing Signal and setting it up – it takes only a couple of minutes. Then, resume any WhatsApp conversations on Signal if that person is already a Signal user. If they are not, then switch to regular text messaging and gently suggest to that person to switch over to Signal. [Shout out to CeCe for reminding me to install Signal!] Group chats are a good way to get people to switch over as nobody will want to be the person who can’t be bothered making the switch.</p>



<p>The interference with elections is not OK.</p>



<p>I’ll leave the last word to future president, AOC:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Meta as in ‘we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society… for profit!'” – <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/facebook-to-meta-a-new-name-but-the-same-old-problems/">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://smex.org/open-letter-to-samsung-end-forced-israeli-app-installations-in-the-wana-region/">https://smex.org/open-letter-to-samsung-end-forced-israeli-app-installations-in-the-wana-region/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44334167">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    
<p>In recent months, we have received numerous reports from users across West Asia and North Africa (WANA) expressing alarm over a little-known but deeply intrusive bloatware application—AppCloud—pre-installed on Samsung’s A and M series smartphones. Without users’ knowledge or consent, this bloatware collects sensitive personal data, cannot be removed without compromising device security, and offers no clear information about its privacy practices.</p>



<p>AppCloud, developed by the controversial Israeli-founded company ironSource (now owned by the American company <a href="https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2022/Unity-Announces-Merger-Agreement-with-ironSource/default.aspx">Unity</a>), is embedded into devices sold in countries where such affiliations carry legal implications. Despite the serious privacy and security risks, Samsung has offered no transparency on how AppCloud functions, what data it collects, or why users cannot opt out.</p>



<p>This open letter, addressed to Samsung, calls for immediate transparency, accountability, and dialogue. Users deserve to know what is installed on their devices and how their data is being used, especially amid Israel’s espionage campaigns in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>_________</p>



<p>To Whom it May Concern,&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are writing to urgently request that Samsung be transparent regarding the pre-installation of AppCloud on its A and M series smartphones, particularly in West Asia and North Africa (WANA). We ask that Samsung provide information about AppCloud’s privacy practices, opt-out and removal options, and that Samsung reconsider future pre-installations in light of privacy rights. We also request a meeting with Samsung teams to discuss these concerns further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the expansion of Samsung’s <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/ironsource-expands-samsung-partnership-launching-on-samsung-mobile-devices-in-mena">partnership</a> with ironSource in 2022, AppCloud has been embedded by default on <a href="https://smex.org/invasive-israeli-software-is-harvesting-data-from-samsung-users-in-wana/">new A and M devices distributed in this region</a>.</p>



<p>According to our <a href="https://smex.org/invasive-israeli-software-is-harvesting-data-from-samsung-users-in-wana/">analysis</a>, this intrusive software is <strong>unremovable</strong>, deeply integrated into the devices’ operating system, making it nearly impossible for regular users to uninstall it without root access, which voids warranties and poses security risks. Even disabling the bloatware is not effective as it can reappear after system updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The privacy policy is <strong>opaque, </strong>there is no accessible and transparent privacy policy for this bloatware and users are in the dark about what data is collected and how it is used. There is also no straightforward opt-out mechanism. The bloatware collects sensitive user data, including biometric information, IP addresses, device fingerprints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The installation of AppCloud is done <strong>without any consent </strong>from the user, which violates GDPR provisions in the EU and relevant data protection laws in the WANA region states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AppCloud is developed by ironSource, <strong>an Israel-founded company (now acquired by American company Unity),</strong> raising additional legal and ethical concerns in countries where Israeli companies are barred from operating, such as <a href="https://www.lexismiddleeast.com/law/Lebanon/Law_1_1955">Lebanon</a>. ironSource is notorious for its questionable practices regarding user consent and data privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Samsung’s terms of service mention third party applications but do not specifically address AppCloud or ironSource, despite the significant data access and control granted to this bloatware app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The forced installation of AppCloud <strong>undermines the privacy and security rights of users in the MENA region and beyond.</strong> The lack of transparency and control over personal data is particularly alarming given<a href="https://telecomlead.com/smart-phone/smartphone-strategies-in-middle-east-for-market-share-119061"> Samsung’s <strong>significant market share in the region</strong></a>.</p>



<p>In light of these concerns, we respectfully request that Samsung:</p>



<ul>
<li>Disclose the full privacy policy and data handling practices of AppCloud, making this information easily accessible to all users.</li>



<li>Offer a straightforward and effective method for users to opt out of AppCloud and remove it from their devices without compromising device functionality or warranty.</li>



<li>Provide a clear explanation for the decision to pre-install AppCloud on all A and M series devices in the WANA region.</li>



<li>Reconsider the continued pre-installation of AppCloud on future devices, in line with the right to privacy as established by Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</li>



<li>We also request a <strong>meeting with the relevant Samsung teams</strong> to discuss these issues in detail and to better understand the company’s approach to user privacy and data protection in the WANA region.</li>
</ul>



<p>We look forward to your prompt response and to working together to ensure the privacy and security of all Samsung users.</p>

<h2>RJ45 Angle Adapters</h2>
<p>I mostly use laptops to do various tasks and cables sticking out on the sides perpendicularly does not help. Not many laptops today have the RJ45 LAN socket – but if they do – they are mostly on the side of the laptop.</p>

<p>Thanks to such angle RJ45 adapters it is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>You can find them for about <b>$2</b> – for example – on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> page – with the <b>RJ45 ANGLE ADAPTER</b> keywords in their search.</p>

<h2>RJ45 Angle Cable Adapters</h2>
<p>The mentioned earlier <i>RJ45 Angle Adapters</i> are quite bulky – but as an alternative its possible to get a short 40cm cable with smaller plug.</p>
<p>Not sure if its noticeable on the picture below – but I also cut the top ‘cover’ with knife of the plug – so its easier to detach.</p>

<p>With these simple ‘join’ adapters it is no longer a problem. You would not use them in a serious Data Center with 10+ GE speeds – but for home 1.0-2.5 GE speeds its more then enough.</p>
<p>You can find them for about <b>$1-$2</b> – for example – on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> – with the <b>RJ45 JOIN ADAPTER</b> keywords in their search.</p>

<p>I usually boot from some USB drive with FreeBSD and while new SSD is attached with these adapters – I then execute <tt><b>dd(8)</b></tt> command to clone the old HDD disk to new SSD drive … and then just swap them out.</p>
<p>You can find them for about <b>$1-$5</b> – for example – on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> – with the <b>SATA USB ADAPTER</b> keywords in their search.</p>

<p>While I usually omit Bluetooth I can not say the same about WiFi … and as FreeBSD lacks a little in that department – using a very tiny chip such as <a href="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2020/10/30/realtek-usb-wifi-review/">Realtek RTL8188CUS</a> often does the job done.</p>
<p>You can find them for about <b>$1-$3</b> – for example – on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> – with the <b>WIFI USB</b> or <b>BLUETOOTH USB</b> keywords in their search.</p>

<h2>USB-C &lt;=&gt; Micro USB Adapter</h2>
<p>In the past – in the USB Micro times – I remember using an adapter to be able to charge – then new and uncommon – USB-C devices.</p>
<p>Fast forward several years and now the situation is the other way around (as expected). The USB-C is the standard and USB Micro devices are less and less common … but there are still here. To not have to keep separate dedicated USB Micro cables I use a small USB-C to USB Micro adapters.</p>

<p>Such adapter takes USB-C as input power and is able to charge USB Micro devices.</p>

<h2>USB-C &lt;=&gt; Laptops/Routers/5.5mmx2.5mm Adapters</h2>
<p>When it comes to delivering power to my (and not only) laptops – the new standard seems to be the USB-C connector with ‘requirement’ of 45W or more (it depends).</p>
<p>Not that long ago I discovered that even laptops as old as 13 years – <strong>ThinkPad X220/T420s/W520</strong> – can be powered the same – but with simple and very cheap adapter cables – such as these below. From the left there is <strong>5.5mm/2.5mm</strong> typical router socket – then more modern <strong>ThinkPad X270/T470s</strong> (and many more) – then oldschool models from 2011 year – <strong>ThinkPads</strong> such as <strong>X220/T420s/W520</strong> models.</p>

<p>All they need is a USB-C power input.</p>

<p>You need to only meet two requirements – the USB charger that will make enough power for example 20V at 3.25A for 65W that would power <strong>ThinkPad X220/T420s</strong> or 20V at 6.75A for 135W that would power <strong>ThinkPad W520</strong>. While the official power supply for ThinkPad W520 is 170W – its perfectly fine to use the 135W power adapter from <strong>ThinkPad W510</strong> to power <strong>ThinkPad W520</strong> laptop.</p>
<p>This makes organizing cables (and chargers) a lot easier – for example – I would not be able to fit 3 ‘dedicated’ ThinkPad chargers in that white cable organizer behind laptops – but I will fir there two powerful 65W and 85W USB-C chargers perfectly fine.</p>

<h2>Creative BT-W2 USB-A Bluetooth Adapter</h2>
<p>When I have to cope with Bluetooth technology – its ‘tolerable’ on Android devices such as phones/tablets and mostly nowhere else. After bad audio (just not working) Bluetooth possibilities on FreeBSD I decided to try the hardware solution instead. The audio related Bluetooth on FreeBSD have failed me too many times – to the point called <i>enough is enough</i> – that also means I do not want to waste any more time trying to figure the way using FreeBSD Bluetooth stack devices anymore – at least for audio related devices.</p>
<p>Not so long ago I got the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones. I am/was a big fan of the <i>Technics RP-F290</i> cable headphones (Jack or Mini Jack based). They have so much BASS and ‘power’ that I could not ask for more … and their cost is very low – like <b>$24</b> or less. The only ‘downside’ of the <i>Technics RP-F290</i> headphones is that they are audio only – they do not have any microphone at all – they are dedicated for music only – and that is OK – they do GREAT in that role.</p>
<p>I have tried some Bluetooth based headphones in the past – and they were SHIT to say the least. Not enough ‘power’ – not enough BASS etc. After reading multiple reviews I decided to give <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones a chance … and I was not disappointed. Its the first time after <i>Technics RP-F290</i> cable headphones that ANY Bluetooth based headphone delivered. I was (and I still am) really satisfied with them.</p>
<p>This is where the USB powered <i>Creative BT-W2</i> comes handy. Its also relatively cheap as the cost of used unit is less then <b>$20</b> – at least that is the price I payed for mine in Poland. The <i>Creative BT-W2</i> allows to connect Bluetooth audio devices everywhere – even on OpenBSD – on the system that cut off Bluetooth stack entirely – and it works well on FreeBSD too. The ‘downside’ of the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones is that they do have microphone – but only in Bluetooth node – they have Mini Jack connector – but for audio only …</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6264" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/creative-bluetooth-adapter/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/creative-bluetooth-adapter.jpg" data-orig-size="740,550" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="creative-bluetooth-adapter" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/creative-bluetooth-adapter.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/creative-bluetooth-adapter.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/creative-bluetooth-adapter.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/creative-bluetooth-adapter.jpg?w=625&amp;h=465 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/creative-bluetooth-adapter.jpg?w=150&amp;h=111 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/creative-bluetooth-adapter.jpg?w=300&amp;h=223 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/creative-bluetooth-adapter.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>This is also only downside of the <i>Creative BT-W2</i> solution – it transmits only audio – but w/o microphone. Its more then OK for listening music – but if You have to do live conferencing/meetings on FreeBSD as I do – its a dead end.</p>
<p>I have tried to find a solution to this problem – to the point that I wanted to abandon <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones entirely and find some Mini Jack (or Jack) based BASS oriented headphones that will also have a working microphone.</p>
<p>On my journey I have found a solution that I did not expected at all – and that was the solution that solved all my problems – and allowed me to enjoy the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones – but more about that in the next ‘subsection’.</p>

<h2>External Microphone for SONY Headphones</h2>
<p>You already know the downsides of the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones that were giving me headaches. Now its time to address them.</p>
<p>After many hours of searching the Internet I have found a very ‘usable’ Mini Jack cable. A cable that came with microphone and a one that perfectly integrated with <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones … and FreeBSD as well.</p>
<p>Its available to buy for <b>$22</b> on <a>amazon.de</a> (and possible other locations) and its called <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b>. Thanks to the knowledge that <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones have Mini Jack port with microphone part – the <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b> cable even comes with volume controls and even come with physical kill switch for microphone.</p>

<p>After You attach this <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b> to the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones it looks (and works) like a natural solution.</p>

<p>The only ‘downside’ is generally the downside of the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones – that You CAN NOT disable their silencing while you speak – so using them in ‘passive’ mode with <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b> is preferred to meet all needs.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: </strong>After reading comments to this article I learned that this ‘silencing’ is called <em>Speak to Chat</em> and it can be disabled in the SONY Android app or by holding <span>two fingers</span> on the <span>right earcup</span> until the headphones say <em>“Speak to Chat disabled.”</em> Thank You for that.</p>

<h2>Headphones Handle</h2>
<p>I got used to the fact that I just put my headphones on the desk … but I wanted something more useful – after some searching it was obvious to me that I needed just some headphones handle that I could attach somewhere.</p>
<p>After another several hours of browsing I have found a ‘part’ that would fit perfectly – a <b>$4-5</b> part from <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> that I could find with the <b>HEADPHONES HOLDER</b> keywords in their search.</p>

<p>With its dirt cheap <b>$1-2</b> price (at <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> with <b>USB HUB</b> keywords) its a ‘steal’ … and it is a 3 port hub – there is another USB-A port at the end of it – the one that is not visible.</p>

<h2>C13/C14 Power Adapters with Additional C1/C2 or C5/C6 Sockets</h2>
<p>After You have spent some time to lay down the C13/C14 power cables just to power your PC its really annoying to do the same for another set of C1/C2 or C5/C6 cables/sockets … but not anymore.</p>
<p>Now with single cable adapter You are able to power more then one computer – depending on the needs with additional connectors.</p>

<h2>HDMI 3in1 Switch with Remote Control</h2>
<p>I happen to have a 2010 FullHD 50 Inch TV that has ONLY ONE port of HDMI kind … and it was pretty annoying to say the least … up to the time I added a HDMI switch/hub to it.</p>

<p>For the record – I have used the <b>UGreen 3in1 HDMI Switch with 4K @ 30Hz Capability and Remote</b> and I was able to get one for <b>$16</b>.</p>

<h2>Cable Organizers</h2>
<p>To not have a mess in the cables its useful to have them organized in some way.</p>
<p>I use multiple solutions for that.</p>
<p>Lets start with simple organizers.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6280" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizer-cables/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg" data-orig-size="740,530" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizer-cables" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=625&amp;h=448 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=150&amp;h=107 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=300&amp;h=215 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>… and a larger/taller one for more capacity/possibilities.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6281" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizer-cables-larger/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg" data-orig-size="740,430" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizer-cables-larger" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=625&amp;h=363 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=150&amp;h=87 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=300&amp;h=174 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>They are available for <b>$3-9</b> on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> with <b>CABLE ORGANIZER</b> keywords on the search box.</p>
<p>I also use some IKEA containers …</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6282" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizers-containers/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg" data-orig-size="740,520" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizers-containers" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=625&amp;h=439 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=150&amp;h=105 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg?w=300&amp;h=211 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-containers.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>… and smaller boxes in which I keep the tiny things.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6283" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizers-boxes/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg" data-orig-size="740,510" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizers-boxes" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=625&amp;h=431 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=300&amp;h=207 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>I do not even remember after what product these boxes are … and that does not even matter I think.</p>

<h2>Mouse Jigger</h2>
<p>While there are many software settings or solutions to prevent screen from locking up – there is one bulletproof solution what just always works – a hardware USB mouse jigger.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6284" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/mouse-jigler/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg" data-orig-size="740,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="mouse-jigler" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=625&amp;h=422 625w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=150&amp;h=101 150w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=300&amp;h=203 300w, https://vermaden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>I use a very simple one with 3 modes – but its more then enough for me needs.</p>

<h2>FM Transmitter</h2>
<p>Last but not least – the car FM transmitter.</p>
<p>My daily ‘real’ driver (I mean on the real road outside) is the <b>2006 Dodge Magnum</b> car. I really love it for the simplicity and calm that it provides during the ride – but on the audio side it only has an old FM/AM radio and a CD slot … and not MP3 support in that one.</p>
<p>This is where the FM transmitter such as mine <b>Blow</b> comes really handy.</p>

<p>It supports two modes. One is being a Bluetooth slave of your phone – it just plays on the car speakers anything you are currently playing on your phone – it also has microphone builtin – so You can also use it as a ‘loud’ phone talking device.</p>

<p>I use it in a more simple mode – I just attach a tiny <b>Lexar S47 32GB</b> pendrive to it – and play a random song of it.</p>
<p>Besides these features it also has additional USB-A port available to attach a cable to it and charge some device.</p>
<p>I was able to get one a new one for about <b>$19</b>.</p>
<p>~</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The mentioned devices above are probably not the only ones that make my life easier – but definitely the most crucial ones.</p>
<p>Feel free to share your ‘helper’ hardware in the comments.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the introduction to a series on Abstract Algebra. In particular, our focus will be on Galois Fields (also known as Finite Fields) and their applications in Computer Science. This is a project I've been excited about for many years now, but have been too busy to dedicate the adequate effort to meet my perfectionism standards (yay perfectionism!).</p>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>Many moons back I was self-learning Galois Fields for some erasure coding theory applications. I was quite disappointed with the lack of accessible resources for computer scientists.
Many resources assumed either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its beyond your skill level so let's oversimplify (<code>"it's hard, don't worry about it"</code>), or</li>
<li>You had prior Pure Math studies in Abstract Algebra (<code>"it's easy, just use jargon jargon jargon"</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, Abstract Algebra is not standard subject matter in most computer science curriculums. Often computer science mathematics start and end
with Discrete Math. If you're lucky, maybe you've also been exposed to Linear Algebra.</p>
<p>So, ultimately, I ended up self-learning Abstract Algebra from a pure math textbook. But for the great majority of computer scientists, there has to be a better way.
This series intends to fill this gap. This is the gentle step-by-step approach with applications implemented with actual code. It's the intro I wanted when I was starting out.</p>
<h3>What is this subject?</h3>
<p>Abstract algebra is a beautiful subject. It's the idea that the numbers you're familiar with don't matter. The numbers are just
arbitrary labels. What matters is the relationships they have with other numbers when you add or multiply them. If the numbers
don't matter, then we can swap those labels for different labels and all the normal math rules will still work.</p>
<p>For example, we could create an algebra that allows us to add or multiply colors:</p>
<p><img src="https://xorvoid.com/color_arithmetic.png" alt="a double rainbow?"></p>
<p>And this is what makes the subject abstract and confusing. How can you just say that numbers don't matter? It doesn't make sense.</p>
<p><img src="https://xorvoid.com/jackie_chan_confused_numbers.jpg" alt="even jackie struggles at math" width="300"></p>
<p>And even so, why would we want to study this? Why would a computer scientist care?</p>
<p>Well, we use computer algorithms to manipulate data. We encode/decode it, we encrypt/decrypt it, we detect corruption, etc.
Wouldn't it be great if we could use normal math to do those things? Wouldn't it be great if would could add or multiply
an 8-bit byte by an 8-bit byte and get another 8-bit byte? And if we could do that, could we also do Linear Algebra over Data? Yes, yes, and more yes.
This is why studying Abstract Algebra is worthwhile.</p>

<p>(Hint: Neither 263 nor 9282 are answers, they are not 8-bit numbers)</p>
<p>You can also make quirky blog posts that make your friends think you've gone crazy, like <a href="https://xorvoid.com/milk_and_cookies.html">milk and cookies</a> 🥛 🍪 😊</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>The applications and algorithms are staggering. You interact with implementations of abstract algebra everyday: CRC,
AES Encryption, Elliptic-Curve Cryptography, Reed-Solomon, Advanced Erasure Codes, Data Hashing/Fingerprinting, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, etc.</p>
<p>Having a solid-background in Galois Fields and Abstract Algebra is a prerequisite for understanding these applications.</p>
<h3>Approach: Step-by-step, Active Learning, and Literate Programming</h3>
<p>In this series, we will start from the very basics of theory and build up step-by-step to interesting applications such as Reed-Solomon,
AES, etc. As such, the material will be <b>very</b> cumulative. Many exercises will be included to aid understanding. Each section will build gradually,
but will assume mastery of the previous section. Active learning is <b>strongly encouraged</b>. We will expect that
readers are putting in adequate effort to grok the abstract concepts.</p>
<p>We won't assume too much mathematical background beyond high-school level algebra. However, in some applications (for example: Reed-Solomon),
familiarity with Linear Algebra will be required. We won't explain Linear Algebra since great resources already
exist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D">here</a>. You are encouraged to supplement as needed.</p>
<p>We will be including code in a Literate Programming style where appropriate.  For example, to aid understanding, we will build some interactive
command-line tools that allow you to play around with various theoretical concepts in practice. All code will be the
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust Programming Language</a>, but advanced features will be intentionally avoided so that the code will be readable
by most experienced computer programmers.</p>
<p>The main goal of this series is understandability and education. As such, the implementations will not be optimal. We will forgo nearly all
optimizations you'd see in a production quality implementation: lookup-tables, vectorized instructions, clever representations, computer
architecture optimizations, etc. It's possible that later posts in the series will discuss optimizations, but this is not a primary goal. At the end,
we hope these implementations will serve as good reference implementations. This can have it's own merit since highly optimized algorithms are
often difficult to read and understand.</p>
<p>For active learning, I strongly encourage you to do your own implementations and to play around with the command-line tools while reading. If you'd
like to open-source your implementations, I'm more than happy to link them here:</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs' capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman (NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

We're here today at AMD's Advancing AI 2025 event, where the MI350 series has just been announced. And I have the pleasure to introduce, Alan Smith from AMD.</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Hello, everyone.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> What do you do at AMD?</span></p><p><strong>Alan</strong><span>: So I'm the chief architect of Instinct GPUs.</span></p><p><strong>George</strong><span>: Awesome, what does that job entail?</span></p><p><strong>Alan</strong><span>: So I'm responsible for the GPU product line definition, working with our data center GPU business partners to define the-, work with them on the definition of the requirements of the GPUs, and then work with the design teams to implement those requirements.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> Awesome. So, moving into MI350: MI350's still GFX9 based, and- for you guys in the audience, GFX9 is also known as Vega, or at least derivative of GFX9. Why is it that MI350 is still on GFX9, whereas clients such as RDNA 3 and 4, GFX11 and 12 respectively?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Sure, yeah, it's a great question. So as you know, the CDNA architecture off of, you know, previous generations of Instinct GPUs, starting with MI100 and before, like you said, in the Vega generations, were all GCN architecture, which was Graphics Core Next. And over several generations, CDNA's been highly optimized for the types of distributed computing algorithms for high-performance computing and AI. And so we felt like starting with that base for MI350 would give us the right pieces that we needed to deliver the performance goals that we had for the MI350 series.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And with GCN, as you know, there's a separate L1 cache and LDS, or Local Data Store. Why is that still in MI350? And why haven't they been merged?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Yeah, so like you said, you know, it is a legacy piece of the GCN architecture. It's sort of fundamental to the way the compute unit is built. So we felt like in this generation, it wasn't the right opportunity to make a microarchitectural change of that scale. So what we did instead, was we increased the capacity of the LDS. So previously in MI300 series, we had a 64 kilobyte LDS, and we've increased that capacity to 160 kilobytes in MI350 series. And in addition to that, we increased the bandwidth as well. So we doubled the bandwidth of the LDS into the register file, in order to be able to feed the Tensor Core rates that we have in the MI350 series.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And speaking of Tensor Cores, you've now introduced microscaling formats to MI350x for FP8, FP6, and FP4 data types. Interestingly enough, a major differentiator for MI350 is that FP6 is the same rate as FP4. Can you talk a little bit about how that was accomplished and why that is?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Sure, yep, so one of the things that we felt like on MI350 in this timeframe, that it's going into the market and the current state of AI... we felt like that FP6 is a format that has potential to not only be used for inferencing, but potentially for training. And so we wanted to make sure that the capabilities for FP6 were class-leading relative to... what others maybe would have been implementing, or have implemented. And so, as you know, it's a long lead time to design hardware, so we were thinking about this years ago and wanted to make sure that MI350 had leadership in FP6 performance. So we made a decision to implement the FP6 data path at the same throughput as the FP4 data path. Of course, we had to take on a little bit more hardware in order to do that. FP6 has a few more bits, obviously, that's why it's called FP6. But we were able to do that within the area of constraints that we had in the matrix engine, and do that in a very power- and area-efficient way.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And speaking of data types, I've noticed that TF32 is not on your ops list for hardware level acceleration. Why remove that feature from... or why was that not a major consideration for MI350?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Yeah, well, it was a consideration, right? Because we did remove it. We felt like that in this timeframe, that brain float 16, or BF16, would be a format that would be leverageable for most models to replace TF32. And we can deliver a much higher throughput on BF16 than TF32, so we felt like it was the right trade off for this implementation.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And if I was to use TF32, what would the speed be? Would it still be FP32, the speed of FP32?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> You have a choice. We offer some emulation, and I don't have all the details on the exact throughputs off the top of my head; but we do offer emulation, software-based emulation using BF16 to emulate TF32, or you can just cast it into FP32 and use it at FP32 rate.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And moving from the CU up to the XCD, which is the compute die; the new compute die's now on N3P, and yet there's been a reduction from 40 CUs to 36 CUs physically on the die with four per shader engine fused off. Why 32 CUs now, and, why that reduction?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Yeah, so on MI300, we had co-designed for both MI300X and MI300A, one for HPC and one for AI. In the MI300A, we have just six XCDs. And so, we wanted to make sure when we only had six of the accelerator chiplets that we had enough compute units to power the level of HPC or high-performance computing - which is traditional simulation in FP64 - to reach the performance levels that we wanted to hit for the leadership-class supercomputers that we were targeting with that market.</span></p><p>And so we did that and delivered the fastest supercomputer in the world along with Lawrence Livermore, with El Capitan. But so as a consideration there, we wanted to have more compute units for XCD so that we could get 224 total within MI300A. On 350, where it's designed specifically as an accelerator only, a discrete accelerator, we had more flexibility there. And so we decided that having a power of two number of active compute units per die - so 36 physical, like you said, but we enable 32. Four of them, one per shader engine, are used for harvesting and we yield those out in order to give us good high-volume manufacturing through TSMC-N3, which is a leading edge technology. So we have some of the spare ones that allow us to end up with 32 actually enabled.</p><p>And that's a nice power of two, and it's easy to tile tensors if you have a power of two. So most of the tensors that you're working with, or many of them, would be matrices that are based on a power of two. And so it allows you to tile them into the number of compute units easily, and reduces the total tail effect that you may have. Because if you have a non-power of two number of compute units, then some amount of the tensor may not map directly nicely, and so you may have some amount of work that you have to do at the end on just a subset of the compute unit. So we find that there's some optimization there by having a power of two.</p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> While the new compute unit is on N3P, the I/O die is on N6; why stick with N6?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Yeah, great question. What we see in our chiplet technology, first of all, we have the choice, right? So being on chiplets gives you the flexibility to choose different technologies if appropriate. And the things that we have in the I/O die tend not to scale as well with advanced technologies. So things like the HBM5s, the high-speed certis, the caches that we have with the Infinity Cache, the SRAMs, those things don't scale as well. And so sticking with an older technology with a mature yield on a big die allows us to deliver a product cost and a TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) value proposition for our clients. And then we're able to leverage the most advanced technologies like N3P for the compute where we get a significant benefit in the power- and area-scaling to implement the compute units.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And speaking of, other than the LDS, what's interesting to me is that there have not been any cache hierarchy changes. Why is that?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Yeah, great question. So if you remember what I just said about MI300 being built to deliver the highest performance in HPC. And in order to do that, we needed to deliver significant global bandwidth into the compute units for double precision floating point. So we had already designed the Infinity Fabric and the fabric within the XCC or the Accelerated Compute Core to deliver sufficient bandwidth to feed the really high double precision matrix operations in MI300 and all the cache hierarchy associated with that. So we were able to leverage that amount of interconnecting capabilities that we had already built into MI300 and therefore didn't need to make any modifications to those.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And with MI350, you've now moved from four base dies to two base dies. What has that enabled in terms of the layout of your top dies?</span></p><p>Alan: Yeah, so what we did, as you mentioned, so in MI350, the I/O dies, there's only two of them. And then each of them host four of the accelerator chiplets versus in MI300, we had four of the I/O dies, with each of them hosting two of the accelerator chiplets. So that's what you're talking about.</p><p>So what we did was, we wanted to increase the bandwidth from global, from HBM, which, MI300 was designed for HBM3 and MI350 was specially designed for HBM3E. So we wanted to go from 5.2 or 5.6 gigabit per second up to a full 8 gigabit per second. But we also wanted to do that at the lowest possible power, because delivering the bytes from HBM into the compute cores at the lowest energy per bit gives us more power at a fixed GPU power level, gives us more power into the compute at that same time. So on bandwidth-bound kernels that have a compute element, by reducing the amount of power that we spend in data transport, we can put more power into the compute and deliver a higher performance for those kernels.</p><p>So what we did by combining those two chips together into one was we were able to widen up the buses within those chips; so we deliver more bytes per clock, and therefore we can run them at a lower frequency and also a lower voltage, which gives us the V-squared scaling of voltage for the amount of power that it takes to deliver those bits. So that's why we did that.</p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And speaking of power, MI350x is 1000 watts, and MI355x is 1400 watts. What are the different thermal considerations when considering that 40% uptick in power, not just in terms of cooling the system, but also keeping the individual chiplets within tolerances?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Great question, and obviously we have some things to consider for our 3D architectures as well.</span></p><p>So when we do our total power and thermal architecture of these chips, we consider from the motherboard all the way up to the daughterboards, which are the UBB (Universal Baseboard), the OAM (OCP Accelerator Module) modules in this case, and then up through the stack of CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate), the I/O dies, which are in this intermediate layer, and then the compute that's above those. So we look at the total thermal density of that whole stack, and the amount of thermal transport or thermal resistance that we have within that stack, and the thermal interface materials that we need in order to build on top of that for heat removal, right?</p><p>And so we offer two different classes of thermal solutions for MI350 series. One of them air-cooled, like you mentioned. The other one is a direct-attach liquid cool. So the cold plate would then, in the liquid cool plate, liquid-cooled case would directly attach to the thermal interface material on top of the chips. So we do thermal modeling of that entire stack, and work directly with all of our technology partners to make sure that the power densities that we build into the chips can be handled by that entire thermal stack up.</p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> Awesome, and since we're running short on time, the most important question of this interview is, what's your favorite type of cheese?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Oh, cheddar.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> Massively agree with you. What's your favorite brand of cheddar?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> I like the Vermont one. What is that, oh... Calbert's? I can't think of it. [Editor's note: It's Cabot Cheddar that is Alan's favorite]</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> I know my personal favorite's probably Tillamook, which is, yeah, from Oregon. But anyway, thank you so much, Alan, for this interview.</span></p><p>If you would like to support the channel, hit like, hit subscribe.

<p><a href="https://electrek.co/guides/byd/">BYD</a> has now begun testing solid-state EV batteries in its Tesla Model 3-rivalling Seal. Initial tests suggest that the total driving range could reach nearly 1,200 miles (1,875 km).</p>



<h2 id="h-byd-begins-testing-solid-state-ev-batteries-in-the-seal">BYD begins testing solid-state EV batteries in the Seal</h2>



<p>It has been over a decade since BYD first began researching and developing the promising new EV battery technology.</p>



<p>Last year, the company reached a milestone by testing its first solid-state battery cells with capacities of 20 Ah and 60 Ah. We knew BYD was planning to launch its first vehicles powered by the new batteries in 2027 after Sun Huajun, the CTO of BYD’s battery business, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/17/byd-confirms-evs-all-solid-state-batteries-2027/">confirmed the timeline</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>At the 2025 China All-Solid-State Battery Innovation and Development Summit, Sun stated that BYD has officially installed solid-state batteries in its popular Seal EV and is now testing them on roads.</p>	
	



<p>Once testing is finalized, which is expected to occur in 2027, BYD plans to begin installing solid-state batteries in its production vehicles.</p>

<p>Between 2027 and 2029, production will be limited during the first two years. However, in 2030, BYD plans to begin mass production. BYD has previously said that by the end of the decade, it expects “liquid and solid to be the same price.” In other words, solid-state batteries will be about the same cost as current liquid lithium-ion batteries.</p>



<p>The Seal, BYD’s Tesla Model 3-rivalling electric sedan, is expected to be the first EV available with solid-state batteries, starting in 2027. Other models will begin to hit the market in 2028 and the following years.</p>

<p>BYD’s solid-state batteries have an energy density of 400 Wh/kg, or nearly twice that of current lithium-ion batteries.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://post.smzdm.com/p/a0zp33or/">local reports</a>, BYD’s solid-state EV batteries set a record by gaining 1,500 km (932 miles) range in just 12 minutes of charging. </p>

<p>The test charged the battery to just 80%, meaning total EV range could reach upwards of 1,875 km (1,165 miles). Keep in mind, that is CLTC range. On the EPA scale, it would be closer to 1,300 km (808 miles), which is still way more than enough.</p>



<p>BYD’s Seal currently starts at just 175,800 yuan in China, or about $25,000. When it initially hits the market in 2027 with solid-state batteries, the Seal will likely be priced higher.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>




	<p>BYD is already dominating the global EV market. It just surpassed Tesla in Europe and the UK in monthly registrations for the first time, and this could be just the start.</p>



<p>With several new batteries and plenty of other EV technologies, including ultra-fast chargers, smart driving features, and advanced new platforms, BYD is laying the groundwork for more growth over the next few years.</p>



<p>Not only that, BYD is already known for its low-cost cars like the Seagull (Dolphin Surf in Europe), priced under $10,000 in China. The new tech is expected to unlock longer driving range, faster charging, and lower costs.</p>



<p>BYD will compete with CATL, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Nissan, and several others that are also aiming to launch their first EVs with solid-state batteries around 2027 or 2028. Nissan’s director of product planning in Europe, Christop Ambland, confirmed the company’s timeline this week with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/nissan/367112/nissan-deliver-solid-state-battery-tech-production-car-2028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Auto Express</a></em>, saying, “We will be ready for SSB (solid-state batteries) in 2028.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>As we’re all celebrating the <a href="https://www.jaws50th.com/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">50th anniversary</a> of the movie <em>Jaws</em>, here’s something I bet you didn’t know: Due to a fluke of publishing and copyright law, the <em>Jaws</em> shark is public domain.</p><p>It’s not the <em>character</em> of the shark that’s public domain – or someone would surely be making a low-budget horror prequel about how he became the Amity Island Killer. But I’m talking about the famous shark painting from the movie poster:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/poster.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="889" height="1358" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/poster.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/poster.jpg 889w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Yep. That painting, the same one that appeared on the cover of the paperback edition of the novel, is public domain.</p><p>This is kind of a wild story.</p><p>When the book first came out, it didn’t have this cover art. An old <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/04/21/119458470.html?pageNumber=266&amp;ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">article</a> about the book’s origin explains that the author, Peter Benchley, actually had his own idea for the cover. He thought it should show “a peaceful unsuspecting town through the bleached jaws of a shark.” He pitched his idea to Doubleday, who was publishing the hardcover version of the book.</p><p>So Doubleday senior editor Tom Congdon worked with art director Alex Gotfryd and had an artist produce this mock-up:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="330" height="482"><figcaption><span>Art by Wendell Minor</span></figcaption></figure><p>Congdon didn’t like it. He said, “the shark’s bones look too liplike and pendulous.” A preview of the cover was shown at a book sales manager’s conference, and there was “considerable resistance” from the salesmen who said it resembled a vagina with teeth.</p><p>The book was supposed to come out in January, 1974, but publication was delayed until February to rework the cover.</p><p>Congdon asked, “Can we have just a fish on the cover?”</p><p>But Gotfryd said no. “The cover’s not big enough. It will look like a sardine.”</p><p>So they settled on no image at all. The first printed cover was just black:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/original-cover.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1270" height="1858" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/original-cover.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/original-cover.jpg 1000w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/original-cover.jpg 1270w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>From an eBay listing that was asking for $7,500. It didn’t sell.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bantam had purchased the paperback rights to the book, but when Bantam president Oscar Dystal saw the empty cover, he didn’t like it. He said, “Without an image, no one would know what <em>Jaws</em> was. It could have been a book about dentistry.” It needed a shark.</p><p>So Gotfryd contacted an artist named Paul Bacon who made a rough sketch of the shark’s head, and at Gotfryd’s suggestion added a swimmer for scale. The next day, Bacon came back with the finished artwork that became the new hardcover dust jacket:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="925" height="1381" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/image-2.png 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/image-2.png 925w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Congdon later said, “We realized that the new version looked like a penis with teeth. But was that bad?”</p><p>Has any other design project ever gone from “we can’t use that because it looks like a vagina with teeth” to “that looks like a penis with teeth but let’s go with it?”</p><p>A year later, when Bantam was preparing to publish the paperback edition, they hired artist Roger Kastel to make an updated version of the cover. He went to the Museum of Natural History to study sharks, and he had a model pose across a couple of stools for reference of what someone looks like swimming. He used those elements in creating the now-famous illustration:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/paperback-cover.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="989" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/paperback-cover.jpg 600w"><figcaption><span>Here’s a whole other rabbit hole: The snow leopard exhibit in the Central Park Zoo is actually </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/nyregion/13snow.html?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><span>named after</span></a><span> the model who posed for this cover, Allison Maher.

Kastel’s <a href="http://www.rogerkastel.com/biography.htm?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">official website</a> says that “Universal Studios, so impressed by the work, purchased the right to use this image as the poster for the movie.”</p><p>But a 2012 <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/jaws-unsung-heroes/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">article</a> in <em>Empire</em> says that Universal actually got the rights from Bantam for free:</p><blockquote>Impressed by the cover, Universal purloined Kastel’s work for the movie poster — Bantam books chief Oscar Dystel gave it to the filmmakers for free, losing out on millions of dollars — and it quickly became iconic.</blockquote><p>Whether Universal paid for the rights or not, Kastel became bitter about all the places it was showing up.</p><p>In 2015, he <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/07/26/how-the-famous-poster-from-jaws-was-created-and-lost/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">told</a> the New York Post, “What really bothered me was that they used the image for merchandising. You see that poster on everything.” And in 2020, Kastel <a href="https://michaelpcoleman.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/jaws-iconic-artwork-and-the-artist-behind-it/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">told</a> writer Michael P. Coleman, “We were floored by how they merchandised that image, from t-shirts to cartoons.”</p><p>It’s unclear when exactly Kastel realized that there was something fishy about the painting’s copyright situation. I can only speculate that at some point he wondered if he was entitled to some of the money from all the licensing, and discovered that the copyright to the image had never been properly established.</p><p>See, when he made the painting in 1975, copyright was still ruled by a 1909 law that said you had to include a copyright notice upon publication of a work, and that notice had to include your name. When the book was published, it carried no such notice for the artwork. It only had a copyright notice for the text. That meant that the painting became public domain as soon as it was published.</p><p>In a bit of timing bad luck, a new copyright law enacted just a year after the book came out eliminated the notice requirement.</p><p>So in early 2013, almost 40 years after <em>Jaws</em> was published, Kastel filed a copyright application for the <em>Jaws</em> illustration. But the copyright office denied it.</p><p>He filed an appeal. They denied that, too.</p><p>In 2014, he submitted a final appeal to the Copyright Office Review Board, and the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/rulings-filings/review-board/docs/2014-appeal-JawsIllustration2014.pdf?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">decision</a> from the board is <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Jaws_Illustration_%28USCO_Review_Board%2C_2014%29?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">available</a> to read online. The main points are:</p><ul><li>The image was published without a proper copyright notice, so it became public domain under the law at the time.</li><li>The fact that the book said “Copyright © 1974 Peter Benchley” isn’t good enough to let the public know that the cover is copyrighted because that’s not the name of the cover art’s copyright owner.</li><li>This situation is not like magazines and anthologies, which are collective works with multiple contributors that can be covered by a single copyright notice. One illustration on the cover of a novel doesn’t make it a collective work.</li><li>If Benchley had licensed the artwork from Kastel or had some other legal relationship, that might make a difference. But he didn’t, so the works are unrelated and require separate notices.</li></ul><p>So the review board unambiguously rejected the claim:</p><blockquote>The Board has concluded that the copyright notice in the Book, which includes only Peter Benchley’s name, does not meet the statutory notice requirement under the 1909 Act and, as such, the Work was forfeited to the public domain upon its publication.</blockquote><p>So whether Universal paid anything for permission to use the artwork becomes a moot point because it turns out that they didn’t need permission. And anyone could have sold merchandise with the image without paying any licensing fees to Universal, Bantam, or Kastel.</p><p>Kastel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/arts/roger-karl-kastel-dead-jaws-poster.html?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">died</a> in 2023 and, while he didn’t see any <em>Jaws</em> royalties from merchandise that featured his artwork, he did get more work as a result of it, including illustrating the <em>Gone With The Wind-</em>inspired poster for <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="1000" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg 1000w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>How did I never notice this before?</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that Kastel definitely did own is the original artwork used for the <em>Jaws</em> book cover and poster. Unfortunately, the painting went missing in 1976 and nobody knows where it is.</p><p>One story goes that the painting went on a national tour to promote the book, making stops to appear in various book store windows, and then disappeared somewhere in Hollywood. Or it may have been last seen hanging in an exhibit at the Society of Illustrators in New York.</p><p>Kastel’s son Matthew thinks it was last seen at the New York Historical Society. At least that’s what he said in an article a few years back for <a href="https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/jaws-missing-painting/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Daily Art Magazine</a> but I suspect he was actually thinking of the Society of Illustrators. Either way, he wrote:</p><blockquote>But the question remains. What happened to my father’s work?<p>Where is one to start on a mystery over 45 years old with no clues? Outside of putting my father’s&nbsp;<em>Jaws</em>&nbsp;illustration on the back of milk cartons under the caption&nbsp;<em>MISSING</em>, I have no clue.</p><p>Was the painting simply lost, misplaced, or thrown away like an old movie prop by Universal out of lack of care or ignorance? Or was it stolen somewhere in Universal’s care by an admirer and/or enterprising thief?</p><p>My recourse is limited. By writing this article, I am taking a longshot approach that someone out there reading this may know about its whereabouts or fate and step forward. </p></blockquote><p>If you happen to know where the original <em>Jaws</em> painting is, <a href="http://thirdstrikeproductions.com/contact.htm?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">here</a> is where you can reach out to Matthew Kastel.</p><p>So that’s the story of how a pop culture icon became freely available for anyone to use. It’s good that creative works eventually become public domain, but I also believe an artist should be able to enjoy the fruits of his work in his lifetime if he wants to. So while I’m usually in favor of the commons, I feel like this time... it’s personal.</p><p>Fin.</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/horiz-2.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="295" height="22"></figure><p>What a story.

I thought that was interesting and dug deeper.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/scoop-commission-eyes-ditching-microsoft-azure-for-frances-ovhcloud-over-digital-sovereignty-fears/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/scoop-commission-eyes-ditching-microsoft-azure-for-frances-ovhcloud-over-digital-sovereignty-fears/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44331045">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="metered-article"><p>
<strong>The European Commission is in advanced business negotiations with OVHcloud, the France-based major European cloud service provider, to transition its cloud services away from Microsoft, according to three senior sources with internal knowledge of the matter who spoke to Euractiv on condition of anonymity.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The infrastructure shift is being driven by a push for European digital sovereignty in the cloud market, following <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/microsofts-email-shutdown-of-icc-prosecutor-fuels-eu-fears-of-us-tech-blackmail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns raised</a> by a US executive order that led to the shutdown of Microsoft services for an employee of a European-based institution.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the move would be to ensure that European institutions have greater control over their digital infrastructure and data – an idea that has been championed by the <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/european-industry-big-win-germany-france-both-support-sovereign-eu-based-tech-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EuroStack initiative</a>. It is also a blow for US tech behemoth Microsoft, which has been striving to reassure its European customers in the past weeks.
</p>
<p>
Once the European Commission "gets its house into order," it is expected to set a precedent for national public administrations to direct public procurement funds towards homegrown cloud providers, one source said. The Commission sees itself as a trend setter, they added, aligning with its broader strategy to enhance the EU's digital autonomy and reduce reliance on non-European tech giants.
</p>
<p>
We understand the Commission has been in discussions with OVHcloud for several weeks. However, an unknown number of other European cloud providers, including Germany's IONOS, France's Scaleway and Italy's Aruba, are also being considered as potential alternatives.
</p>
<p>
A unique aspect of this situation is that, for the first time, the two key digital departments of the Commission – DG CNECT, which drafts and enforces digital policies, and DG DIGIT, the IT department – are under the oversight of a single Commissioner (Henna Virkkunen) with a tech sovereignty portfolio.
</p>
<p>
This consolidation has made it easier to harmonise the political and technical priorities of the European executive, our sources told us.
</p>
<p>
"Discussions are indeed underway, both with the Commission and with other public and private institutions and organisations that are evaluating projects to migrate to a sovereign cloud," an OVHcloud spokesperson told Euractiv when we sought comment.
</p>
<p>
The Commission is "constantly scanning the market" and already "has a contract with OVHcloud" a Commission spokesperson said in response to Euractiv's request for comment. It did not confirm whether the Commission will actually switch away from Microsoft Azure.
</p>
<p>
In January, Euractiv <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/internal-documents-reveal-commission-fears-over-microsoft-dependency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;that the Commission was concerned about its reliance on Microsoft, quoting internal documents.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the EU institutions watchdog, the European Data Protection Supervisor <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/eu-commission-breached-data-protection-rules-using-microsoft-365-eu-watchdog-found/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> last year that the EU's executive is in breach of data protection rules that apply to EU institutions over its use of Microsoft Azure cloud for some of its data.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://www.jazzyear.com/article_info.html?id=1352">http://www.jazzyear.com/article_info.html?id=1352</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44330850">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://jiazi-pc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/1721291943273" title="" alt=""></p><p><span>In the sweltering heat of Shanghai, Jazzyear had the privilege of meeting Professor Jürgen Schmidhuber, a distinguished guest at the 2024 World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Based on years of earlier research, Schmidhuber and his student Sepp Hochreiter published the architecture and training algorithms for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in 1997 in a journal. This type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is widely used by tech giants for applications in natural language processing, speech recognition, video games, and more, including Apple’s Siri and Google’s translation services. Prior to the advent of ChatGPT, LSTM was heralded as “the most commercially valuable achievement in AI.” The 1997 LSTM paper is the most cited AI paper of the 20th&nbsp;century, perhaps even the most cited computer science paper of the century.</span></p><p><span>Even earlier, in his “Annus Mirabilis” 1990-1991, Schmidhuber laid the foundations for Generative AI, by introducing the principles of what ‘s now called GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), non-normalized linear Transformers, and self-supervised Pretraining. These 3 contributions correspond to the “G,” “P,” and “T” in ChatGPT, where GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.</span></p><p><span>Long before the so-called “Deep Learning Trio” shared a Turing Award, Schmidhuber was already being hailed as the “Father of Mature AI” by The New York Times. Elon Musk also praised him on X, stating, “Schmidhuber invented it all.”</span></p><p><span>In 2013, the International Neural Network Society (INNS) awarded Schmidhuber the Helmholtz Award. In 2016, he received the IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award in recognition of &nbsp;his&nbsp;"pioneering contributions to deep learning and neural networks."&nbsp;Currently, he serves as Scientific Director at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA and heads the AI initiative at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia. He is also involved with several AI companies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Therefore, this 61-year-old German luminary has sparked a discourse: Why has Schmidhuber not won a Turing&nbsp;Award？</span></p><p><span>This is a key concern for many industry professionals, but it does not include Schmidhuber himself. During our two-day in-depth conversation, Schmidhuber, donning his signature stylish black beret and speaking fluent English with a German accent, came across as a scholar who combines humor with approachability. Yet beneath this amiable exterior lies an indomitable spirit, eager to establish scientific integrity in the fast moving field of AI research.</span></p><p><span>Discussing overlooked contributions of AI pioneers—particularly groundbreaking advancements achieved by small European labs before the tech giants took notice—Schmidhuber expressed a palpable urgency to correct misleading historical records of AI.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For years, he has engaged in public debates with Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Ian Goodfellow, and others, accusing them of rehashing not only his own earlier work, but also the earlier work of others, without citing the original inventors. He backs up his claims with numerous peer-reviewed references.</span></p><p><span>Schmidhuber’s forthrightness naturally stirs controversy. However, his perspective provides a valuable counter&nbsp;to a widespread yet misleading Silicon Valley&nbsp;narrative. Moreover, he not only speaks up for himself and his outstanding students, but also tirelessly champions other underappreciated contributors to the AI field, striving to give them their due recognition.</span></p><p><span>Regarding the debate over who should be called the “Father of AI,” Schmidhuber points out that one needs an entire civilization to build an AI. He also points out that modern AI is driven by mathematical and algorithmic principles discovered decades and even centuries before the term “AI” was coined in the 1950s.</span></p><p><span>As for the controversy online, Schmidhuber&nbsp;remains&nbsp;unfazed.&nbsp;He quotes Elvis Presley, saying, “Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain’t going away.”</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;<img src="https://jiazi-pc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/1721291983283" title="" alt=""></span></p><p><span>In this exclusive interview with Jazzyear, Schmidhuber discussed the origins of AI, which greatly predate 1956, his own research that laid the foundations of modern AI, his view of the “Deep Learning Trio,” as well as the cosmos-changing future of self-replicating, self-improving machine civilizations. He also believes that, on the journey toward AGI, even those without significant funding can bring about revolutionary changes in AI research.</span></p><h2><span>1.&nbsp;Something better than the Transformer</span></h2><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;</span><span>Let’s start with the history of artificial intelligence. You have a deep understanding of AI’s development. What do you think needs to be clarified about AI’s history?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Oh, there is a lot.&nbsp;For example, the origins of AI date back well before the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, which is sometimes cited as AI’s inception point, because there the name “AI” was coined for a field that was already old by then. In fact, as early as 1914, the Spaniard Leonardo Torres y Quevedo designed a chess-playing automaton at a time when chess was considered a domain exclusive to intelligent beings. The theory of AI can be traced back to Kurt Gödel’s work in 1931-1934 when he identified fundamental limitations of what can be computed by any AI.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some claim&nbsp;that artificial neural networks (NNs, now widely used) are a relatively novel concept from the 1940s and 50s. However, “modern” neural nets date back over 200 years ago. Around 1800, Carl Friedrich Gauss and Adrien-Marie Legendre introduced what we now call a linear neural network, though they called it the “least squares method.” They had training data consisting of inputs and desired outputs, and minimized training set errors through adjusting weights, to generalize on unseen test data: linear neural nets!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This was what’s now called “shallow learning.” Some think that the more powerful, more recent “deep learning” is a 21st-century innovation. It isn’t. In 1965, in Ukraine, Alexey Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa had the first working deep multilayer networks that learned. For example, Ivakhnenko’s 1970 paper detailed an eight-layer deep learning network. Regrettably, certain much later publications on very similar approaches failed to credit the Ukrainian pioneers. Our field is rife with such cases of inadvertent or deliberate plagiarism.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;You have also played a pivotal role in AI history. Could you talk about the miraculous year of 1991? What contributions did your research make to the AI industry during that period?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Our miracle year of 1990-91. That's something I'm really proud of. At the Technical University of Munich, we were lucky enough to publish many of the basic concepts behind today's AI, in particular,&nbsp;Generative AI.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The GPT in ChatGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. Let’s first look at the G in GPT and in “Generative AI.” Back in 1990, I had what’s now called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which I initially dubbed “Artificial Curiosity.” This involves two competing neural networks—a generator with adaptive probabilistic units and a predictor influenced by the generator’s output. The predictor tries to predict how the environment will react to the outputs of the generator. It minimizes its loss by gradient descent. However, in a minimax game, the generator tries to maximize what the predictor is minimizing. Essentially, it aims to “fool” the adversary by generating surprising content. This idea later found extensive use in Deepfake applications.</span></p><p><span>As for the “P” in GPT, it refers to Pre-training, another concept I published in 1991. I saw that unsupervised or self-supervised Pre-training can greatly compress sequences, facilitating downstream deep learning for long sequences, such as very long texts.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Then there’s the T, which stands for a neural net called Transformer. The name “Transformer” was coined&nbsp;at Google in 2017. However, I had already introduced variants of the concept in 1991 under the term “fast weight controllers” or “fast weight programmers.” One of my variants is now called the “unnormalized linear Transformer.” It was even more efficient than the modern Transformer, because it scaled linearly, requiring only a hundredfold increase in computational power for a hundredfold increase in input size, unlike today’s “quadratic” Transformers, which need a ten-thousandfold increase.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear：Many, including the creators of the quadratic Transformer, have stated that we need something better than it. It is certainly not perfect. What do you think the next generation of architectures should look like?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;The 1991 linear Transformer above is actually a good starting point for making quadratic Transformers more efficient.&nbsp;However, to predict the next generation of large language models (LLMs), let’s first revisit the first generation. The first LLMs of Google and Facebook utilized our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), which also has roots in 1991, namely, in the thesis of my brilliant student Sepp Hochreiter. This thesis not only described experiments with the aforementioned pre-training (the P in ChatGPT), but also introduced residual connections, essential for deep learning and handling long sequences. I coined the term LSTM in 1995, but the name is not important, the only thing that counts is the math. LSTM was used for LLMs until the late 2010s when Transformers, easier to parallelize and thus advantageous for modern hardware like NVIDIA GPUs, took over.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear：Can&nbsp;RNNs solve tasks that elude Transformers?&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Yes, they are more powerful in principle. For example, parity: consider bit strings such as 01100 or 101 or 1000010101110. Given such a bit string, is the number of 1s odd or even? Looks like a simple task, but Transformers fail to generalise on it. However, even simple RNNs can quickly solve this task, as I showed decades ago.</span></p><p><span>Recently, Hochreiter’s team developed an impressive LSTM extension called xLSTM, with linear scalability, outperforming Transformers on various language benchmarks. Its exceptional understanding of text semantics, alongside its versions that can be highly parallelized, makes xLSTM a compelling candidate for future large-scale experiments.</span></p><h2><span>2.&nbsp;What&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;linear way of thinking？</span></h2><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: You are now leading the AI initiative at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia. What drew you to take up this position?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber: </span></strong><span>Before that, I mostly worked in Switzerland, which is a great place for science, leading the world in terms of Nobel prizes, patents, citations, and AI publications per capita. But they don’t have a place like KAUST, which is now the university with the highest impact per faculty, surpassing institutions like Caltech and Princeton. KAUST seemed like a great opportunity to push AI research further. Saudi funding benefits the rest of the world, since we are producing lots of open-source results that are accessible from China, the USA, and other places.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: I’m sure KAUST has substantial funds and resources for AI research. Is this why big companies are more attractive? Have small independent teams or academia become unable to achieve significant breakthroughs?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> What constitutes a “significant breakthrough”? Is it the next foreseeable 0.5% performance boost of LLMs, demanding lots of computational power and money? Or is it a real breakthrough that makes the next AI as energy-efficient as a human brain? I still believe that someone with a good idea can revolutionize AI research without requiring enormous resources.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: Based on your diverse experiences, how do you view the differences in AI academia and industry across the US, Europe, the Middle East, and China?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> Europe, of course, is the origin of computers, computer science, AI, deep learning etc. Most of modern AI originated there. In particular, almost all of the core deep learning techniques were developed in the previous millennium in Europe (although there were also important contributions from Japan). Europe is still producing a lot of AI talent. At some point, however, scaling became crucial, and that’s where the US and China took over.&nbsp;Europe lacks tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, TenCent, etc, although all these companies are based on the WWW, which also originated in Europe around 1990. Today, the US and China have numerous unicorn startups, whereas Europe has just a few. Large US companies with huge market valuations can easily buy some of Europe’s best talents and entire startups such as DeepMind.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: How do you think DeepMind&nbsp;has developed recently? Earlier achievements like AlphaGo and AlphaZero were published in Nature or other journals. But now, the trend is more towards OpenAI’s model of delivering excellent products directly to users.</span></strong><span>（Shane Legg, co-founder of DeepMind, was a PhD student in Schmidhuber’s Swiss lab)</span></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber</span></strong><span>: DeepMind once was almost like academia without its drawbacks. Their well-funded researchers could publish without having to worry about writing grant proposals or teaching. However, even a star company like DeepMind was unable to sustain independent growth. It was sold to a much bigger US company even before it became a unicorn valued at $1 billion. Now it’s just a small part of Google.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: There’s always a comparison between academic labs and big companies. Aditya Ramesh, one of the heads of OpenAI’s video generation product Sora, recently said that academia can mainly do evaluation and measurement or research AI explainability now, lacking resources like GPUs to make more significant contributions. By the way, Aditya doesn’t have a PhD because he joined OpenAI right after his undergraduate studies.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> Did he really say that? Anyway, such statements seem a bit naïve, reflecting a very linear way of thinking: the current trend is to scale large foundation models through more and more compute, and since some people cannot imagine anything else, let’s just extrapolate the current trend, everything else must be useless!&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: So, you are definitely not a fan of scaling law?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> I am the biggest fan of the old scaling law that says: every 5 years compute is getting 10 times cheaper (this law has held since 1941 when Konrad Zuse completed the first working general purpose computer in Berlin). That scaling law is the reason why our techniques from the 1990s are now on billions of smartphones. AI is getting 100 times cheaper per decade, and everybody will profit from this, not just a few big companies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s just that the scaling of present LLMs has little to do with AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) that learns like humans learn. How does a baby learn? Not by downloading the web. It learns to collect data through self-invented experiments that improve its adaptive neural world model, which it can use for planning. All of this, however, has little to do with the LLMs that are now so popular.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Corporations must maximize shareholder value, whereas scientific research seeks unprecedented discoveries. Don’t expect these quite different objectives to be aligned!</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: But money issues are always crucial, even for science.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> Sure, for centuries, science and art have followed the money. For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, well-funded labs in rich countries such as Japan and West Germany were the cradle of innovations such as CNNs and Generative AI, respectively. Around 1995, the combined nominal GDP of these two tiny countries, the 2 big losers of World War II, exceeded the GDP of the US (the Chinese economy was still small back then). Today, only 3 decades later, the US and China are much bigger economically (since 2017, China has been number 1 in terms of PPP), and the scaling up of these old inventions mostly happened on the Pacific Rim in industrial labs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I recall when I first came to China 15 years ago, I had to show taxi drivers a picture of my hotel to tell them where I was going. Now, they just lift their smartphones, and I speak the destination in English or German, and they understand. My taxi driver may not know that this is based on research results from my lab, but it’s those resourceful and powerful companies that have popularized these technologies, helping to profoundly transform daily life. They are the ones who took academic inventions and made them accessible services.</span></p><h2><span>3.&nbsp;They should be stripped of their awards</span></h2><p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Do you like being called the “Father of Modern AI”?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;A single person cannot create an AI from scratch. You need an entire civilization to build an AI. You need people to create the basic algorithms, others to build computers, others to mine the materials from which the computers are made. You also need consumers, like gamers, who drive the demand for faster computers, and farmers who grow the food for all.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;That’s interesting. Everyone plays a role in the creation of AI.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Of course, you can trace specific neural networks to their creators. For instance, the father of convolutional neural networks (CNN) is Kunihiko Fukushima, who published the basic CNN architecture in 1979 in Japan. In 1987, Alex Waibel, a German working in Japan, combined convolutions and backpropagation, the method published 1970 in Finland by Seppo Linnainmaa, now widely used to train neural nets. Zhang (1988) published&nbsp;the first backprop-trained two-dimensional CNNs, also in Japan.&nbsp;Thus, from 1979 to 1988, modern CNNs as we know them originated in Japan.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;You have yet to receive the Turing Award. Is this a significant regret, or do you not concern yourself with it?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>How much should you care about an&nbsp;award that was also given to people who republished key methods and ideas whose creators they failed&nbsp;to credit?&nbsp;is a total no-go in science, please check my report on this on the web.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Apparently you are referring to the European-born Deep&nbsp;Learning Trio—Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun—who won the Turing Award. You mentioned they have not adequately cited or acknowledged your earlier work. Has your opinion of them changed?&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;No.&nbsp;They frequently re-published others’ work without proper attribution. Even worse, they failed to correct this in subsequent publications. In science, this is unacceptable. My team has particularly suffered from this behavior; their most&nbsp;prominent work directly builds on ours. But this isn’t just about my own team; relevant work of many other scientists has been republished by them without proper attribution.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Do you think they owe you an apology?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;They have never apologized in the past when they had a chance, and have never corrected their papers accordingly. They have violated the "Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct" of ACM, &nbsp;the organisation that hands out these awards:&nbsp;computing professionals should&nbsp;"credit the creators of ideas, inventions, work, and artifacts, and respect copyrights, patents, trade secrets, license agreements, and other methods of protecting authors' works."&nbsp;The awardees didn't; instead they credited each other (and collected citations) for inventions of other researchers. However, ACM&nbsp;"retains the right to revoke an Honor previously granted if ACM determines that it is in the best interests of the field to do so."&nbsp;&nbsp;So I guess they should be stripped of their awards.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Do you think they&nbsp;directly&nbsp;stole your ideas？</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;It is well-known that&nbsp;plagiarism can be “intentional and reckless” or “unintentional.” However,&nbsp;science has a well-established way of dealing with "multiple discovery" and plagiarism, be it unintentional or not, based on facts such as time stamps of publications and patents. &nbsp;And if you unintentionally reinvent something previously published, you must publish a corrigendum and credit the original inventor in all future papers and presentations. Failing to do so disqualifies you as a scientist. In a mature field such as math, you'd never get away with plagiarism. However, the field of machine learning seems still rather immature in comparison. Anyway, science is self-correcting, and we'll see that in machine learning, too. Sometimes it may take a while to settle disputes, but in the end, the facts must always win.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="https://jiazi-pc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/1721292650522" title="" alt=""></p><p><span>Schmidhuber&nbsp;and the Deep Learning Trio</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Criticizing prominent figures could lead to negative comments about you online. Do you read these comments? Do you Google yourself?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Richard Feynman, the famous physicist, once wrote a book: "What Do You Care What Other People Think?" The only thing that counts in science are the facts. If the facts are known, why should you care for misleading anonymous comments by trolls on the&nbsp;web?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some people resort to personal attacks when they can’t refute fact-based information, following the adage, “If you can’t argue with the facts, attack the messenger.” Fortunately, unlike politics, science is immune to personal attacks. Science isn’t democratic. If 100 people claim one thing and one person presents the opposite with factual support, the latter wins.</span></p><p><span>The famous singer Elvis Presley said, “Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain’t goin’ away.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Are you jealous of the American scientists? They might be richer than you.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Jealous?&nbsp;Richer? How on earth did you come up with this&nbsp;idea? Also, wealth means nothing in science. Einstein, the most famous scientist of all time, wasn’t rich. Still, they named him “person of the century.” No, I am just happy that the Americans and many others are using our methods so much.</span></p><h2><span>4.&nbsp;Self-replicating, self-improving machine civilizations</span></h2><p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Jazzyear: Do you have any mentors or role models in the scientific community?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> In the 1970s, as a teenager, I initially aspired to be a physicist like my awesome idol, Einstein. A few years later, I realized that within my lifetime, I might be able to create an AI scientist far more intelligent than any human, capable of solving many problems I couldn’t, thus vastly amplifying my limited creativity. This realization set the course of my life.</span></p><p><span>Overall, I am a very self-driven person, learning hard lessons from experience. My best mentors have been those who allowed me to pursue my dreams without too much interference.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: Are there any entrepreneurs you like?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber</span></strong><span>: Sure. I like Elon Musk, who kindly invited me to his wonderful family reunion, and Jensen Huang, whose awesome NVIDIA GPUs my team used in 2010 to make deep learning fast enough to break benchmark records. I also like several other amazing but perhaps less famous entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><img src="https://jiazi-pc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/1721292695201" title="" alt=""></span></p><p><span>Schmidhuber met with Jensen Huang (left)</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;In previous reports from the New York Times, it’s been said that your misfortune might be being too early—publishing results years ahead of the powerful and affordable computers we now have. Do you consider your experiences unfortunate?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Not at all---had I done it later, someone else might have scooped me! Being ahead of time is great, especially in AI where compute is getting 10 times cheaper every 5 years, so a mere human lifetime is sufficient to see how it all pans out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;What kind of AGI world do you think children born after 2020 will face?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber: </span></strong><span>It will&nbsp;be awesome! Our AI&nbsp;is already helping to make human lives longer and healthier and easier, and this trend will accelerate. What's next? It’s true AGI in the physical world, not just today’s AI behind the screen. The physical challenges of the real world are far more complex than those of the virtual one. AI still has a long way to go before it can replace skilled trades like plumbers or electricians. However, there is reason to believe AI in the physical world will soon make significant strides.</span></p><p><span>A next major step will be self-replicating and self-improving societies of physical robots and other machines. We already have 3D printers that can print copies of parts of themselves. But no 3D printer can make a complete copy of itself, like a living being. To assemble a complete 3D printer, you need many other machines, for example, to take the raw material out of the ground, to refine it, to make the machines that make the machines that help make many unprintable parts of the 3D printer, to screw those parts together, and so on. Most importantly, you still need lots of people to oversee and manage all this, and to fix broken machines.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Eventually, however, there will be entire societies of clever and not-so-clever physical machines that can collectively build from scratch all the things needed to make copies of themselves, mine the raw materials they need, repair broken robots and robot factories, and so on. Basically, a machine civilisation that can make copies of itself and then, of course, improve itself. Basically, I am talking about a new form of life, about self-replicating, self-maintaining, self-improving hardware, as opposed to the already existing, self-improving, machine-learning software.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There will be enormous commercial pressure to create such life-like hardware, because it represents the ultimate form of scaling, and its owners will become very rich, because economic growth is all about scaling.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Of course, such life-like hardware won't be confined to our little biosphere. No, variants of it will soon exist on other planets, or between planets, e.g. in the asteroid belt. As I have said many times in recent decades, space is hostile to humans but friendly to suitably designed robots, and it offers many more resources than our thin layer of biosphere, which receives less than a billionth of the energy of the Sun. Through life-like, self-replicating, self-maintaining hardware, the economy of our solar system will become billions of times larger than the current tiny economy of our biosphere. And of course, the coming expansion of the AI sphere won’t be limited to our tiny solar system.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: What are the most pressing issues in AI safety and ethics today? Can AI pose threats comparable to nuclear weapons?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber: </span></strong><span>AI can indeed be weaponized, as recent conflicts involving cheap AI-driven drones have confirmed. But currently, AI does not pose new existential threats. As I have said for decades: we should be much more afraid of 60-years old technology in form of hydrogen bombs mounted on rockets, which can wipe out a big city within seconds, without any AI.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: Some believe we have no room for trial and error with AGI. What can we do now to ensure safety?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber: </span></strong><span>This is like saying: let’s not have any more children because we cannot afford trial and error; we cannot simply create yet another human baby that might become a serial killer or develop extremely dangerous AI… By educating babies and AIs in a friendly, rational, and responsible manner, we greatly increase their chances of benefiting society rather than harming it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: In 2024, what new judgments do you have about AGI?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> Since the 1970s, I’ve been saying that AI will soon become much smarter than humans, and that almost all AIs will soon be far from Earth where most of the physical resources are that they need to create even more and larger AIs. Self-driven AIs will first take over the solar system, and then the galaxy, and then within a few tens of billions of years the entire visible universe, in a way where humans cannot follow.&nbsp;I’ve been saying this for decades, since my teenager times. The only difference is that more people are listening now. In the 1970s, my mom used to say I am crazy when I explained that to her. In the 1980s, my fellow students said I am crazy. But recently, many have stopped calling me crazy because suddenly they think AGI is very close.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: Can you offer any advice to Chinese startups or young Chinese scientists?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> Sure! Study our old and recent papers and my AI Blog.</span></p><p><span>*Miss Jia, founder and CEO of Jazzyear, also contributed to the story.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>
