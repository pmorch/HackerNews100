					<p>Over the past two decades, Google has hosted two different internal platforms for predictions. Why did the first one fail — and will the other endure?</p>
				<div>
											<div><p>It’s July 2005. Google is the darling of Silicon Valley. It has just unveiled Google Maps; Gmail is still in beta. Next year it will acquire YouTube and launch Google Translate.</p><p>The week’s new hires file past a full-size dinosaur skeleton in the courtyard on the way to their first TGIF — the company’s weekly all-hands. They wear beanies with red, yellow, green, and blue colors — like the yet-to-be-designed Chrome logo — with a propeller on top. They are here to see Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both wearing shorts and plain colored t-shirts, banter about new tech.</p><p>In the first line of their Founders’ IPO letter, Page and Brin wrote “Google is not a conventional company.” They sought to provide “unbiased, accurate and free access to information.” On this Friday, Patri Friedman, the grandson of Milton Friedman, and Bo Cowgill, now an economics professor at Columbia University, are here to talk about Google’s next bet to do this: an internal prediction market called Prophit.</p><p>On stage next to Larry Page, Friedman and Cowgill announce winners from Prophit’s first quarter and show statistical results on its forecasting accuracy. Prophit was popular inside Google. Over the next three years, about 20% of all Google employees would place bets.</p><p>Two months after this presentation, <em>The </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/26/business/at-google-the-workers-are-placing-their-bets.html"><em>New York Times</em> covered Prophit</a>. They wrote about it again <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/technology/07link.html">in 2008</a>, and it became a <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=34562"><em>Harvard Business Review</em> case-study</a>. Despite the momentum, in March 2010, Prophit hit a major roadblock in its public launch as an external product. It attempted a pivot, and ultimately shut down in 2011.</p></div>

  </figure>
</div>
											<div><p>In April 2020, almost exactly 15 years after Prophit launched, and one month after employees worldwide were sent home due to COVID-19, I launched Google’s second internal prediction market, called Gleangen.<sup>

    <span id="fnref-1">

    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 By late 2022, about 8% of Google employees had placed a bet on Gleangen. The company had grown so large that 8% represented 15,000 people — ten times the number of employees that placed bets on Prophit. Gleangen sustained over 1,000 monthly traders, more than the popular forecasting platforms <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/">Metaculus</a> (where I later served as CTO) and <a href="https://manifold.markets/stats">Manifold</a> at the time.<sup>

    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
</p><p>Outside of Google, prediction markets have once again been thrust into the spotlight. Weeks before it became a mainstream view, users on sites like PredictIt and Metaculus predicted not only that President Biden would drop his reelection campaign but that <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prediction-markets-suggest-replacing">doing so would increase the Democrats’ chance of winning</a>. Over the next few months, swings in election prediction markets regularly made national news,  and despite some distortions caused by aggressive whales, the markets <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/donald-trump-win-betting-markets-prediction-websites-nailed-election-forecast?cmpid=BBD110724_MONEYSTUFF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=241107&amp;utm_campaign=moneystuff&amp;embedded-checkout=true">ultimately </a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/donald-trump-win-betting-markets-prediction-websites-nailed-election-forecast?embedded-checkout=true">performed</a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/donald-trump-win-betting-markets-prediction-websites-nailed-election-forecast?cmpid=BBD110724_MONEYSTUFF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=241107&amp;utm_campaign=moneystuff&amp;embedded-checkout=true"> well</a>. Theoretically, prediction markets are equally powerful when used by companies to anticipate events, such as predicting their competitors’ next moves.</p><p>But as Cowgill has shown, corporate prediction markets have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/82/4/1309/2607345?login=false">a mixed track record</a>, as evidenced by attempts at Google and many other companies. Why is this? What does it take to make them work? The inside story of Prophit and Gleangen, the two largest corporate prediction markets ever run, offers some lessons.</p></div>
											<p><h2>A new type of information economy</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Probably the first corporate prediction market was built in 1990 by economist Robin Hanson for employees of the doomed hypertext startup Project Xanadu. It had 18 participants, who bet on questions like whether cold fusion would be developed by 1991. The decade was dotted with other prediction market experiments, like the Iowa Electronic Markets (an online real money prediction platform established in 1988) and Hollywood Stock Exchange (a 1996 virtual market for film-related options).</p><p>Researchers like Hanson and others, such as the economist Justin Wolfers, worked out some of the implementation details from this data. Crucially, they also showed that most markets — whether operating with either real or play money — were relatively accurate, much more so than even the most accurate individuals. In 2004, the journalist James Surowjecki published the widely-read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds"><em>The Wisdom of Crowds</em></a>, detailing cases where collective judgment surpassed individual expertise. Cowgill read the book the same year, and decided to start a prediction market at Google.</p><p>The company had some key ingredients to make a market work. First, it had a culture open to experimentation. Googlers were famously permitted 20% of their working hours to experiment on new products.<sup>

    <span id="fnref-3">
        3    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 Cowgill posted his idea for “Google Decision Markets” on a message board. Engineers Ilya Kirnos, Doug Banks, and Piaw Na responded to help, and Patri Friedman joined the project a few months later.</p><p>A second ingredient was Google’s economic expertise. Hal Varian, Google’s chief economist then and now, wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Rules">the book</a> on the economics of the internet, and helped design Google’s famous ad auction system. On Hal’s suggestion, the Prophit team used the prediction market structure first <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117471">described</a> by economists at the University of Iowa and based on the Iowa Electronic Markets.<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>Prophit launched to Google employees in April 2005. Market prices were featured on the company intranet home page. It was an immediate hit.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Betting for fun and profit</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>In Google’s early days, long before it became a blue-chip stock, its offices were full of LEGOs, ball-pits, and Magic the Gathering cards. Product design mirrored office design, and Google built applications full of bright colors, easter eggs, and April Fools’ jokes.</p><p>Prophit was such a product: serious with a dash of whimsy. Markets tracked over 60% of all Google quarterly objectives, such as “How many Gmail users will there be by the end of Q2?” Some questions aimed to predict its competitors' next moves, such as “Will Apple launch a computer based on Intel's Power PC chip?” Yet one third of all markets were marked as “fun,” of interest to employees but with no clear connection to Google’s business (e.g., the quality of Star Wars Episode III or gas prices).</p><p><a href="https://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CorporatePredictionMarkets1.pdf">Cowgill</a> told me an anecdote of both the seriousness and the whimsy. A senior executive saw Prophit give a very low probability that the company would complete the hire of a new senior executive on time (filling the position had been a quarterly objective for the past six quarters). “The betting on this goal was extremely harsh. I am shocked and outraged by the lack of brown-nosing at this company,” the executive said to laughter in a company-wide meeting. But the market was the nudge the execs needed. They subsequently “made some hard decisions” to complete the hire on time.</p><p>The crowd of Googlers produced accurate predictions, spurred by competition for $10,000 of awards each quarter, plus the even-more-valuable prestige of the leaderboards. In a <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/services.google.com/en//blog_resources/google_prediction_market_paper.pdf">2009 paper</a> which analyzed the first 2.5 years of Prophit, Cowgill found that the platform demonstrated high calibration that improved over time. (It wasn’t perfect. There was an optimism bias — bettors thought positive outcomes for Google would happen more often than they actually did.<sup>

        5    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 There were also strong correlations in the bets made by people who sat within a few feet of each other.)</p><p>But that was just Prophit’s internal beta. The product was designed to launch externally, not to be an internal decision-making tool. It was meant to become Google’s next world-changing innovation in information technology.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Economists vs. the United States</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Google pioneered many now standard tech practices: on-site cafés, A/B tests, and “dogfooding,” or first releasing new products internally where they can be improved before launching to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Prophit was a logical next step in the company's mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. That included all the world’s books, all the world’s roads, and all the world’s languages — why not all the information in the heads of the world’s humans? Prediction markets offered a mechanism to systematically elicit reliable information from human judgment. Cowgill relayed to me what happened next, a previously unreported chapter in the Prophit story.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest obstacle preventing Prophit’s public launch was the inconvenient fact that online gambling was (mostly) illegal, and the laws surrounding it were not uniform across states. States attorneys general could claim Prophit fell within their jurisdiction, requiring Google to adhere to 50 different state policies.<sup>

    <span id="fnref-6">
        6    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
</p><p>Prophit, along with Google’s legal and policy teams, developed a strategy to convince a federal regulator to pre-emptively assert jurisdiction over Prophit. It was Google’s opinion that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would be the most natural and friendly regulator, in part because the CFTC had already issued a "<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/files/foia/repfoia/foirf0503b004.pdf">no action letter</a>" protecting the Iowa Electronic Markets<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-7" href="#fn-7"> -->
    <span id="fnref-7">

</sup>
 back in 1993. In May 2008, the CFTC <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/FederalRegister/e8-9981.html">published </a>a letter expressing concerns about the potential overlap between prediction markets and gambling, but left the door open for possible exemptions, and invited public comments on how to regulate such markets..</p><p>The CFTC staffed many economists, and they seemed to understand the moment. That same month, an article called <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1157679"><em>The Promise of Prediction Markets</em></a> appeared in the prestigious journal <em>Science</em>, arguing that prediction markets held too much research and decision-making potential to be fettered by government restrictions. Its authors included four Nobel laureates in economics, numerous academic proponents of markets (including Philip Tetlock, Robin Hanson, and Robert Forsythe), as well as Google’s own Hal Varian.</p><p>Google hired a lobbying firm with extensive CFTC ties. They also organized support from Yahoo! and Microsoft, where prediction markets had been popular among senior executives. The three companies, despite their rivalry in their core markets, <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/frcomment/08-004c029.pdf">jointly</a> <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/frcomment/08-004c031.pdf">backed</a> a single proposal for the CFTC to legalize prediction markets. In March 2010, Cowgill and Ilya Kirnos, another of Prophit’s creators, went to Washington to lobby this proposal to the CFTC, as well as officials in the White House and Congress.</p><p>But by the time the CFTC digested Google's proposal, the political appetite for financial deregulation had changed. The 2008 financial crisis hit its peak with the collapse of Lehman brothers in September. In the interim years, many had come to blame the crisis on the lack of oversight of new financial products. In July 2010, just a few months after Cowgill and Kirnos’s visit to Washington, the Dodd-Frank Act was passed, overhauling nearly all federal financial regulatory agencies. According to Googlers working on Prophit in DC and Mountain View, despite Silicon Valley’s organized push, the intellectual momentum for regulatory reform had died.</p></div>

  </p>
  </figure>
</div>
											<div><p>As the meetings in DC stalled, so too did progress back in Mountain View. Cowgill told me that it became hard to get resources to continue lobbying — and, crucially, engineering headcount to support the external launch. This put Prophit in limbo.&nbsp;</p><p>Although internally successful, without a path to a public launch, it underwent a surprising — if brief — pivot. Cowgill had by that point joined Hal Varian’s economics team, where he tried to implement prediction markets within different projects. One such project was a social network for Chinese users because Google Plus (Google’s attempt at a social network) was blocked there. Cowgill, together with engineers in Chinese offices, integrated Prophit’s engine to power a forecasting feature in the app. But it failed to take off, and Google later killed the project.&nbsp;</p><p>By that point, most of Prophit’s core team had moved on. Friedman left in 2008 to start the Seasteading Institute. Banks and Na left Google in 2010. Kirnos kept running markets until the last ones paid out in mid-2011 and left in 2012 for a startup that was later acquired by Twitter. Cowgill started a PhD in Economics at Berkeley. “I regret that we shut down Prophit,” he wrote to the Prophit group in 2012. “We should have treated the internal instance as a product in its own right, not as a stepping stone to going public.”</p></div>
											<p><h2>The flow of information at Waymo</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>I’d been fascinated by prediction markets since I graduated college in 2011. I read about Prophit, and I was influenced by the same intellectual momentum that had brought Cowgill and Kirnos to Washington. I joined Google in 2014, where I worked first on Google Search and then on Google Translate. In early 2018, I had been promoted twice to Senior Software Engineer, and I began looking for new opportunities.</p><p>I dug up all the code and internal emails on Prophit that I could find. Cowgill’s e-mail expressing regret for not pursuing Prophit as an internal-only app caught my attention. Why not build a new prediction market, I thought, only this time designed <em>from the beginning</em> to influence decision making inside Google?</p><p>I met with Cowgill, Friedman, and Varian. All three expressed reservations about trying again — as did my friends from other divisions, whom I would need to help me pitch Area 120, Google’s in-house incubator for full-time “20% projects,” to staff “Prophit 2.0.” And so I set the idea aside and instead found a role on the systems engineering team at the self-driving car company Waymo. But while at Waymo, I quickly found a concrete use case for a prediction market.<br>Waymo’s systems engineering team measured safety through a variety of metrics from real driving, simulated driving, and models. Yet this data was fragmented — different orgs across the 1,000 person company had different access levels, and worse, different definitions for what they were measuring.</p><p>I was working on a new metric modeling the chance of collision from a particular maneuver. I spoke with engineers about how their projects might improve safety as measured by this metric. Opinions differed widely. And this was crucial information — engineering prioritization at the highest level depended on expectations of which potential projects would most likely improve safety of various car maneuvers.</p><p>I realized I could get the most accurate assessments of the likely impact of projects by aggregating the predictions of the crowd of engineers. And I could envision how these predictions could change priorities in practice, thanks to two famous stories of goals in Waymo’s history, the two “Founder’s Challenges.”</p><p>In the first, in early 2009, Larry Page <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2020/04/in-the-drivers-seat-1000-mile-challenge/">challenged</a> what was then known as Project Chauffeur to complete 10 different autonomously driven 100-mile routes in California within two years. The team succeeded with three months to spare. Page’s second challenge, issued in 2015, was for Waymo to provide 1,000 driverless rides per week within one year. On this challenge, the company fell far short. By 2020, five years later, the company was still only completing about <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sdc-prod/v1/safety-report/Waymo-Public-Road-Safety-Performance-Data.pdf">50-200 such rides each week</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This reminded me of Cowgill’s anecdote about the senior manager who used Prophit to intervene on a failing initiative. I imagined what would have happened if the second Founder’s Challenge had had a company-wide betting pool on when the milestone would be met. Might a Waymo executive have done what the early Google executive had done — intervened when the probability of success dropped, asked bettors why the outcome was in doubt, and changed course?</p><p>I decided to build a prediction market to find out, using my team’s safety metrics as the targets to forecast. I made a prototype, onboarded employees, sourced predictions, got UX feedback, and iterated. Once I had minimal liquidity, I presented the resulting forecasts to every senior manager that would take a meeting.</p><p>In 2019, although Waymo had by then become a separate company from Google, it was in many ways still attached. It had never moved out of the warehouse it shared with Google X. It used the same HR system and the same tech stack. I even continued to use my Google laptop and Google badge.&nbsp;</p><p>In one key way, though, Waymo was not like Google. Access to data was much more restricted.</p><p>Prophit worked, in part, because of internal transparency. When a market forecast how many Gmail users would join next quarter, it was based on a value that was visible to everyone at Google. Google was famously internally transparent compared to other tech giants.</p><p>One Waymo VP, upon seeing these safety metric forecasts, said this would help communicate these metrics across company divisions. And then, to my amazement, he said this was counter to his division’s goal to <em>restrict</em> information like this. The core mechanism of prediction markets — using the wisdom of crowds — can be antithetical to the common management desire to control who knows what.<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>I failed to find any management support for the prediction market. But I had seen the potential. Less than one year after joining Waymo, I searched Google job listings for the role most aligned with forecasting, got a role on the supply chain forecasting team, and transferred back to the mothership.</p></div>

</div>
											<p><h2>The end of Google’s 20% culture</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>In early February 2020, one month after I started my new role, I saw a question on Metaculus asking if a new coronavirus <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3530/how-many-people-will-die-as-a-result-of-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-before-2021/">might lead</a> to a global pandemic. One month later, all 150,000 Alphabet employees were sent home. Demand for information surged, and management didn’t have answers. So I used my extra time in lockdown to revamp and relaunch what I was now calling Gleangen as a prediction market for all Google employees.</p><p>Early markets, bet on by thousands of employees, centered on our uncertain future: when offices would re-open in various countries, the date vaccines would be available, and how at-home and in-office work would be balanced. Several times, such markets gave high probabilities to the creation of pandemic policies long before they were actually enacted.</p><p>My main challenge in making Gleangen a useful internal tool for strategy was generating enough users, bets, and liquidity on markets about Google’s core businesses. Over the next 18 months, while working my day job in supply chain forecasting, I wrote, predicted, and resolved over a thousand such markets. I grew a mailing list and chat group, and hosted socials, unconferences, and talks. As Prophit had done, I got approval to pay out valuable prizes to complement the play-money leaderboards. I posted links to Gleangen on so many internal memes that people told me to stop. I once spent an entire weekend hanging flyers in every bathroom I could access across dozens of buildings in campuses across the Bay Area.&nbsp;</p><p>I never presented at TGIF, though Google CEO Sundar Pichai did answer a TGIF question about a Gleangen market. And while the time for puff pieces from <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> about Google had long passed, I did manage to get approval to write a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/solutions-how-tos/design-patterns-in-googles-prediction-market-on-google-cloud">public piece</a> in December 2021 that — while mostly an ad for Google Cloud — explained the basics of prediction markets, highlighted Gleangen’s over 10,000 users, and included screenshots of the interface.</p><p>Like Prophit, Gleangen only got official staffing after achieving success from its incubation during engineers’ “20% time.” It was official company policy that all Google employees in good standing could work on projects of their choosing one day per week, as long as they were for the benefit of Google. Internal job postings listed hundreds of 20% project opportunities.</p><p>But by 2020, despite no change in official policy, the concept of 20% time at Google was on life-support.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-9" href="#fn-9"> -->
    <span id="fnref-9">
        9    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 None of the three managers I had during this phase approved of me spending one day a week on Gleangen. (Neither did any of the over 20 other 20% contributors I recruited to administer the site, add features, and manage contests.) Gleangen became my full-time job in early 2022.&nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>The wisdom of the Googler crowd</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>From the beginning, my plan was to learn from Cowgill, Friedman, and Varian’s experience — and mistakes — with Prophit. “The plan we executed was to focus on having as much adoption, buzz, and usage by employees as possible,” Cowgill told me. “Google was making choices about public products based on buzz and adoption, with the mantra of ‘user growth now, monetize later.’” What they didn’t do, he said, was sell their product to decision-makers the way one might sell enterprise decision support software. “That's probably how it should be done,” he said, ”with lots of consulting and oversight of each application and client.”</p><p>So I ran pilots to produce useful forecasts for division after division, from Nest to the Quantum Computing team. While most managers were supportive, few were willing to allocate resources.</p><p>I was well aware of the known obstacles to prediction market adoption in the workplace: unwillingness to share data, the desire for plausible deniability when projects fail, the risks of market manipulation, and good old-fashioned status quo bias. But in hindsight, my almost three-year struggle before I got official staffing for Gleangen came down to poor execution on exactly what Cowgill advised: understanding client needs. I had a somewhat utopian view of the value of information. I put some, but not enough, effort into figuring out the messy details on how to operationalize the wisdom of Googlers into a valuable resource for managers.</p><p>Even in cases where managers wanted explicit probabilistic forecasts, a prediction market turned out to be a tough sell. I tried to launch an initiative to use Gleangen to augment the forecasts Google made to drive purchasing decisions of computers, power, and land for its data centers. There was a seemingly strong need for accuracy in the forecasts — too high, and Google could spend hundreds of millions of dollars overprovisioning; too low, and core Google products like Adwords could run out of resources.</p><p>Most managers of the supply chain forecasting teams accepted the premise that Gleangen would improve accuracy. But accuracy wasn’t their top priority. Supply chain forecasts were produced and used by many teams totalling hundreds of people.&nbsp; Managers were incentivized to improve the forecasting process’ transparency, adjustability, accountability, and interoperability with other systems. They didn’t stand to benefit much even if Gleangen did improve the final accuracy of the forecasts. And my initiative exposed them to risk of disrupting many of the subtler roles the process provided, such as value judgments on which parts of Google’s business should get scarce data center resources. I didn’t offer to serve their real needs as if they were enterprise customers, as Cowgill had advised.</p><p>This challenge of operationalizing the wisdom of the Googlers came to a climax when we began forecasting perhaps the most important development in Google’s recent history: large language models.</p></div>

											<div><p>Shortly after Gleangen launched in April 2020, I read OpenAI’s technical report on GPT-3. By early 2022, I was convinced that properly developing LLMs was the most important challenge Google faced. This was a chance to use collective intelligence to improve the chance of success of an important outcome.</p><p>I met with the leads of the core LLM teams inside Google Research, then called <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">LaMDA</a>. Together we devised two types of markets: technical LLM milestones and the integration of LLMs in Google products. We secured a budget to incentivize extra participation with prizes and launched the “LLM Forecasting Contest.”</p><p>Six months into the contest, OpenAI released ChatGPT. Its success sent Google’s top executives scrambling. Most employees close to the development of LLMs, and those who used LaMDA internally, were much less surprised than management. But at a company as large as Google, information — even critical information — sometimes doesn’t percolate up to the top.</p><p>This was exactly the sort of problem I’d built Gleangen to solve. But, to my dismay, I realized we hadn’t produced the information executives really needed. We asked questions of the type “Will Google integrate LLMs into Gmail by Spring 2023?” and “How many parameters will the next LaMDA model have?” Yet what executives would have wanted to know was “Will <em>Microsoft</em> integrate LLMs into <em>Outlook</em> by Spring 2023?” and “How many parameters will the next <em>GPT</em> model have?”</p><p>This turns out to be a general lesson from running a corporate prediction market. Forecasting internal progress, and acting on that information, requires solving complex operational problems and understanding the <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/">moral mazes</a> that managers face. Forecasting competitors’ progress has almost none of these problems.</p><p>It’s conceivable that many executives would have consulted Gleangen in 2022 for forecasts on Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic. This could have enshrined the wisdom of the Googler crowd as a critical source of information, giving individual employees an ability to directly influence senior management by contributing high-quality information. It could have delivered on Friedman and Cowgill’s original vision of prediction markets as part of Google’s core mission: organizing the information inside people’s heads and making it systematically useful.</p><p>We learned from this experience. Gleangen became a staffed part of Google’s Behavioral Economics team shortly after this LLM forecasting contest started. I left Google in October of 2022 to serve as the CTO of Metaculus, but as of August 2024, the team continues to refine its approach to make Gleangen a useful source of information for Google senior management.</p></div>

											<p><h2>Looking to the future</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>As <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dQhjwHA7LhfE8YpYF/prediction-markets-in-the-corporate-setting">Nuño Sempere, Misha Yagudin, and Eli Lifland wrote in 2021</a>, a successful corporate prediction market needs to cost less than the value of information it produces. I see the path forward in two improvements to this cost-benefit analysis. First, it must present leadership with more valuable information. All the examples of predictions in this article — executive hires, self-driving car safety metrics, COVID-19 workplace policies, datacenter costs, and LLM progress — could be useless or pivotal, depending on the process around it and the needs of the internal customer.</p><p>Second, AI could make the forecasts cheaper to produce. Sarah Pratt, a researcher at DeepMind, and members of the Gleangen team released a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04446">paper</a> in June which compared bettors on Gleangen to predictions from PaLM 2, an LLM developed by Google. In brief, that paper — as well as several others recently released — show AI forecasts are much better than chance, but not nearly as accurate as a human crowd, at least not yet. Their paper also highlights another way AI helps with the cost-benefit of corporate prediction markets: they increase the value of the wisdom of the human crowd by using it for evaluation, and perhaps soon the training, of AI systems.</p><p>As the economists, engineers, and researchers running corporate prediction markets improve this value proposition, they may realize the now decades-old vision of Bo Cowgill and others. They are buoyed by the popularity of real-money public markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.<sup>

 At the Manifest conference this summer, run by the prediction market Manifold, Keri Warr, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic, announced that Anthropic has launched an internal prediction market with a “focus on decision-makers.” Time will tell whether Anthropic’s employees, in concert with Claude, will produce information that helps steer the direction of the company — and if so, whether more companies will follow them.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p dir="auto"><em>LLM-powered multiagent persona simulation for imagination enhancement and business insights.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/docs/tinytroupe_stage.png"><img src="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/raw/main/docs/tinytroupe_stage.png" alt="A tiny office with tiny people doing some tiny jobs."></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>TinyTroupe</em> is an experimental Python library that allows the <strong>simulation</strong> of people with specific personalities, interests, and goals. These artificial agents - <code>TinyPerson</code>s - can listen to us and one another, reply back, and go about their lives in simulated <code>TinyWorld</code> environments. This is achieved by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, to generate realistic simulated behavior. This allow us to investigate a wide range of <strong>convincing interactions</strong> and <strong>consumer types</strong>, with <strong>highly customizable personas</strong>, under <strong>conditions of our choosing</strong>. The focus is thus on <em>understanding</em> human behavior and not on directly <em>supporting it</em> (like, say, AI assistants do) -- this results in, among other things, specialized mechanisms that make sense only in a simulation setting. Further, unlike other <em>game-like</em> LLM-based simulation approaches, TinyTroupe aims at enlightening productivity and business scenarios, thereby contributing to more successful projects and products. Here are some application ideas to <strong>enhance human imagination</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Advertisement:</strong> TinyTroupe can <strong>evaluate digital ads (e.g., Bing Ads)</strong> offline with a simulated audience before spending money on them!</li>
<li><strong>Software Testing:</strong> TinyTroupe can <strong>provide test input</strong> to systems (e.g., search engines, chatbots or copilots) and then <strong>evaluate the results</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Training and exploratory data:</strong> TinyTroupe can generate realistic <strong>synthetic data</strong> that can be later used to train models or be subject to opportunity analyses.</li>
<li><strong>Product and project management:</strong> TinyTroupe can <strong>read project or product proposals</strong> and <strong>give feedback</strong> from the perspective of <strong>specific personas</strong> (e.g., physicians, lawyers, and knowledge workers in general).</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> TinyTroupe can simulate <strong>focus groups</strong> and deliver great product feedback at a fraction of the cost!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In all of the above, and many others, we hope experimenters can <strong>gain insights</strong> about their domain of interest, and thus make better decisions.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are releasing <em>TinyTroupe</em> at a relativelly early stage, with considerable work still to be done, because we are looking for feedback and contributions to steer development in productive directions. We are particularly interested in finding new potential use cases, for instance in specific industries.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">🚧 <strong>WORK IN PROGRESS: expect frequent changes</strong>.
TinyTroupe is an ongoing research project, still under <strong>very significant development</strong> and requiring further <strong>tidying up</strong>. In particular, the API is still subject to frequent changes. Experimenting with API variations is essential to shape it correctly, but we are working to stabilize it and provide a more consistent and friendly experience over time. We appreciate your patience and feedback as we continue to improve the library.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2><a id="user-content-examples" aria-label="Permalink: Examples" href="#examples"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To get a sense of what TinyTroupe can do, here are some examples of its use. These examples are available in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples">examples/</a> folder, and you can either inspect the pre-compiled Jupyter notebooks or run them yourself locally. Notice the interactive nature of TinyTroupe experiments -- just like you use Jupyter notebooks to interact with data, you can use TinyTroupe to interact with simulated people and environments, for the purpose of gaining insights.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">Currently, simulation outputs are better visualized against dark backgrounds, so we recommend using a dark theme in your Jupyter notebook client.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧪<strong>Example 1</strong> <em>(from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples/interview_with_customer.ipynb">interview_with_customer.ipynb</a>)</em></h3><a id="user-content-example-1-from-interview_with_customeripynb" aria-label="Permalink: 🧪Example 1(from interview_with_customer.ipynb)" href="#example-1-from-interview_with_customeripynb"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Let's begin with a simple customer interview scenario, where a business consultant approaches a banker:</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/docs/example_screenshot_customer-interview-1.png"><img src="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/raw/main/docs/example_screenshot_customer-interview-1.png" alt="An example."></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">The conversation can go on for a few steps to dig deeper and deeper until the consultant is satisfied with the information gathered, for instance a concrete project idea:</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/docs/example_screenshot_customer-interview-2.png"><img src="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/raw/main/docs/example_screenshot_customer-interview-2.png" alt="An example."></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧪<strong>EXAMPLE 2</strong> <em>(from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples/advertisement_for_tv.ipynb">advertisement_for_tv.ipynb</a>)</em></h3><a id="user-content-example-2-from-advertisement_for_tvipynb" aria-label="Permalink: 🧪EXAMPLE 2(from advertisement_for_tv.ipynb)" href="#example-2-from-advertisement_for_tvipynb"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Let's evaluate some online ads options to pick the best one. Here's one example output for TV ad evaluation:</p>
<p dir="auto">

</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, instead of having to carefully read what the agents said, we can extract the choice of each agent and compute the overall preference in an automated manner:</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/docs/example_screenshot_tv-ad-2.png"><img src="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/raw/main/docs/example_screenshot_tv-ad-2.png" alt="An example."></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧪 <strong>EXAMPLES 3</strong> <em>(from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples/product_brainstorming.ipynb">product_brainstorming.ipynb</a>)</em></h3><a id="user-content--examples-3-from-product_brainstormingipynb" aria-label="Permalink: 🧪 EXAMPLES 3(from product_brainstorming.ipynb)" href="#-examples-3-from-product_brainstormingipynb"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">And here's a focus group starting to brainstorm about new AI features for Microsoft Word. Instead of interacting with each agent individually, we manipulate the environment to make them interact with each other:</p>
<p dir="auto">

</p>
<p dir="auto">After running a simulation, we can extract the results in a machine-readable manner, to reuse elsewhere (e.g., a report generator); here's what we get for the above brainstorming session:</p>
<p dir="auto">

</p>
<p dir="auto">You can find other examples in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples">examples/</a> folder.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pre-requisites</h2><a id="user-content-pre-requisites" aria-label="Permalink: Pre-requisites" href="#pre-requisites"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To run the library, you need:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Python 3.10 or higher. We'll assume you are using <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/" rel="nofollow">Anaconda</a>, but you can use other Python distributions.</li>
<li>Access to Azure OpenAI Service or Open AI GPT-4 APIs. You can get access to the Azure OpenAI Service <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and to the OpenAI API <a href="https://platform.openai.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For Azure OpenAI Service, you will need to set the <code>AZURE_OPENAI_KEY</code> and <code>AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT</code> environment variables to your API key and endpoint, respectively.</li>
<li>For OpenAI, you will need to set the <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> environment variable to your API key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By default, TinyTroupe <code>config.ini</code> is set to use some specific API, model and related parameters. You can customize these values by including your own <code>config.ini</code> file in the same folder as the program or notebook you are running. An example of a <code>config.ini</code> file is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples">examples/</a> folder.</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Important</p><p dir="auto"><strong>Content Filters</strong>: To ensure no harmful content is generated during simulations, it is strongly recommended to use content filters whenever available at the API level. In particular, <strong>if using Azure OpenAI, there's extensive support for content moderation, and we urge you to use it.</strong> For details about how to do so, please consult <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter" rel="nofollow">the corresponding Azure OpenAI documentation</a>. If content filters are in place, and an API call is rejected by them, the library will raise an exception, as it will be unable to proceed with the simulation at that point.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Currently, the officially recommended way to install the library is directly from this repository, not PyPI.</strong> You can follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">If Conda is not installed, you can get it from <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You can also use other Python distributions, but we'll assume Conda here for simplicity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Create a new Python environment:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="conda create -n tinytroupe python=3.10"><pre>conda create -n tinytroupe python=3.10</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Activate the environment:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="conda activate tinytroupe"><pre>conda activate tinytroupe</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Make sure you have eihter Azure OpenAI or OpenAI API keys set as environment variables, as described in the <a href="#pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</a> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Clone the repository, as we'll perform a local install (we <strong>will not install from PyPI</strong>):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe
cd tinytroupe"><pre>git clone https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe
<span>cd</span> tinytroupe</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Install the library <strong>from this repository, not PyPI</strong>:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can now run the examples in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples">examples/</a> folder or use TinyTroupe to create your simulations 🥳. If you want to run the examples in the
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples">examples/</a> folder or modify TinyTroupe itself, however, you should clone the repository as described below.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Local development</h3><a id="user-content-local-development" aria-label="Permalink: Local development" href="#local-development"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to modify TinyTroupe itself, you can install it in editable mode (i.e., changes to the code will be reflected immediately):</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Principles</h2><a id="user-content-principles" aria-label="Permalink: Principles" href="#principles"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Recently, we have seen LLMs used to simulate people (such as <a href="https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents">this</a>), but largely in a “game-like” setting for contemplative or entertainment purposes. There are also libraries for building multiagent systems for proble-solving and assitive AI, like <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Autogen</a> and <a href="https://docs.crewai.com/" rel="nofollow">Crew AI</a>. What if we combine these ideas and simulate people to support productivity tasks? TinyTroupe is our attempt. To do so, it follows these principles:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Programmatic</strong>: agents and environments are defined programmatically (in Python and JSON), allowing very flexible uses. They can also thus underpin other software apps!</li>
<li><strong>Analytical</strong>: meant to improve our understanding of people, users and society. Unlike entertainment applications, this is one aspect that is critical for business and productivity use cases. This is also why we recommend using Jupyter notebooks for simulations, just like one uses them for data analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Persona-based</strong>: agents are meant to be archetypical representation of people; for greater realism and control, detailed specification of such personas is encouraged: age, occupation, skills, tastes, opinions, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Multiagent</strong>: allows multiagent interaction under well-defined environmental constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Utilities-heavy</strong>: provides many mechanisms to facilitate specifications, simulations, extractions, reports, validations, etc. This is one area in which dealing with <em>simulations</em> differs significantly from <em>assistance</em> tools.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment-oriented</strong>: simulations are defined, run, analyzed and refined by an <em>experimenter</em> iteratively; suitable experimentation tools are thus provided. <em>See one of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-case-for-experiment-oriented-computing/" rel="nofollow">previous paper</a> for more on this.</em></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Together, these are meant to make TinyTroupe a powerful and flexible <strong>imagination enhancement tool</strong> for business and productivity scenarios.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Assistants vs. Simulators</h3><a id="user-content-assistants-vs-simulators" aria-label="Permalink: Assistants vs. Simulators" href="#assistants-vs-simulators"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">One common source of confusion is to think all such AI agents are meant for assiting humans. How narrow, fellow homosapiens! Have you not considered that perhaps we can simulate artificial people to understand real people? Truly, this is our aim here -- TinyTroup is meant to simulate and help understand people! To further clarify this point, consider the following differences:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project Structure</h2><a id="user-content-project-structure" aria-label="Permalink: Project Structure" href="#project-structure"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The project is structured as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>/tinytroupe</code>: contains the Python library itself. In particular:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>/tinytroupe/prompts</code>  contains the prompts used to call the LLMs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>/tests</code>: contains the unit tests for the library. You can use the <code>test.bat</code> script to run these.</li>
<li><code>/examples</code>: contains examples that show how to use the library, mainly using Jupyter notebooks (for greater readability), but also as pure Python scripts.</li>
<li><code>/data</code>: any data used by the examples or the library.</li>
<li><code>/docs</code>: documentation for the project.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using the Library</h2><a id="user-content-using-the-library" aria-label="Permalink: Using the Library" href="#using-the-library"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As any multiagent system, TinyTroupe provides two key abstractions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>TinyPerson</code>, the <em>agents</em> that have personality, receive stimuli and act upon them.</li>
<li><code>TinyWorld</code>, the <em>environment</em> in which the agents exist and interact.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Various parameters can also be customized in the <code>config.ini</code> file, notably the API type (Azure OpenAI Service or OpenAI API), the model parameters, and the logging level.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's see some examples of how to use these and also learn about other mechanisms available in the library.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TinyPerson</h3><a id="user-content-tinyperson" aria-label="Permalink: TinyPerson" href="#tinyperson"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A <code>TinyPerson</code> is a simulated person with specific personality traits, interests, and goals. As each such simulated agent progresses through its life, it receives stimuli from the environment and acts upon them. The stimuli are received through the <code>listen</code>, <code>see</code> and other similar methods, and the actions are performed through the <code>act</code> method. Convenience methods like <code>listen_and_act</code> are also provided.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each such agent contains a lot of unique details, which is the source of its realistic behavior. This, however, means that it takes significant effort to specify an agent manually. Hence, for convenience, <code>TinyTroupe</code> provide some easier ways to get started or generate new agents.</p>
<p dir="auto">To begin with, <code>tinytroupe.examples</code> contains some pre-defined agent builders that you can use. For example, <code>tinytroupe.examples.create_lisa_the_data_scientist</code> creates a <code>TinyPerson</code> that represents a data scientist called Lisa. You can use it as follows:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from tinytroupe.examples import create_lisa_the_data_scientist

lisa = create_lisa_the_data_scientist() # instantiate a Lisa from the example builder
lisa.listen_and_act(&quot;Tell me about your life.&quot;)"><pre><span>from</span> <span>tinytroupe</span>.<span>examples</span> <span>import</span> <span>create_lisa_the_data_scientist</span>

<p dir="auto"><code>TinyWorld</code> enforces very little constraints on the possible interactions. Subclasses, however, are supposed to provide more strucutred environments.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Utilities</h3><a id="user-content-utilities" aria-label="Permalink: Utilities" href="#utilities"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TinyTroupe provides a number of utilities and conveniences to help you create simulations and derive value from them. These include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>TinyPersonFactory</code>: helps you generate new <code>TinyPerson</code>s using LLMs.</li>
<li><code>TinyTool</code>: simulated tools that can be used by <code>TinyPerson</code>s.</li>
<li><code>TinyStory</code>: helps you create and manage the story told through simulations.</li>
<li><code>TinyPersonValidator</code>: helps you validate the behavior of your <code>TinyPerson</code>s.</li>
<li><code>ResultsExtractor</code> and <code>ResultsReducer</code>: extract and reduce the results of interactions between agents.</li>
<li>... and more ...</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In general, elements that represent simulated entities or complementary mechanisms are prefixed with <code>Tiny</code>, while those that are more infrastructural are not. This is to emphasize the simulated nature of the elements that are part of the simulation itself.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caching</h3><a id="user-content-caching" aria-label="Permalink: Caching" href="#caching"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Calling LLM APIs can be expensive, thus caching strategies are important to help reduce that cost.
TinyTroupe comes with two such mechanisms: one for the simulation state, another for the LLM calls themselves.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caching Simulation State</h4><a id="user-content-caching-simulation-state" aria-label="Permalink: Caching Simulation State" href="#caching-simulation-state"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Imagine you have a scenario with 10 different steps, you've worked hard in 9 steps, and now you are
just tweaking the 10th step. To properly validate your modifications, you need to rerun the whole
simulation of course. However, what's the point in re-executing the first 9, and incur the LLM cost, when you are
already satisified with them and did not modify them? For situations like this, the module <code>tinytroupe.control</code>
provide useful simulation management methods:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>control.begin("&lt;CACHE_FILE_NAME&gt;.cache.json")</code>: begins recording the state changes of a simulation, to be saved to
the specified file on disk.</li>
<li><code>control.checkpoint()</code>: saves the simulation state at this point.</li>
<li><code>control.end()</code>: terminates the simulation recording scope that had be started by <code>control.begin()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caching LLM API Calls</h4><a id="user-content-caching-llm-api-calls" aria-label="Permalink: Caching LLM API Calls" href="#caching-llm-api-calls"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is enabled preferably in the <code>config.ini</code> file, and alternativelly via the <code>openai_utils.force_api_cache()</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">LLM API caching, when enabled, works at a lower and simpler level than simulation state caching. Here,
what happens is a very straightforward: every LLM call is kept in a map from the input to the generated output;
when a new call comes and is identical to a previous one, the cached value is returned.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Config.ini</h3><a id="user-content-configini" aria-label="Permalink: Config.ini" href="#configini"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>config.ini</code> file contains various parameters that can be used to customize the behavior of the library, such as model parameters and logging level. Please pay special attention to <code>API_TYPE</code> parameter, which defines whether you are using the Azure OpenAI Service or the OpenAI API. We provide an example of a <code>config.ini</code> file, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples/config.ini">./examples/config.ini</a>, which you can use as a template for your own, or just modify to run the examples.</p>

<p dir="auto">We need all sorts of things, but we are looking mainly for new interesting use cases demonstrations, or even just domain-specific application ideas. If you are a domain expert in some area that could benefit from TinyTroupe, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Beyond that, many other aspects can be improved, such as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Memory mechanisms.</li>
<li>Data grounding mechanisms.</li>
<li>Reasoning mechanisms.</li>
<li>New environment types.</li>
<li>Interfacing with the external world.</li>
<li>... and more ...</li>

<p dir="auto">Please note that anything that you contribute might be released as open-source (under MIT license).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you would like to make a contribution, please try to follow these general guidelines:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Tiny naming convention</strong>: If you are implementing a experimenter-facing simulated element (e.g., an agent or environment type) or closely related (e.g., agent factories, or content enrichers), and it sounds good, call your new <em>XYZ</em> as <em>TinyXYZ</em> :-) On the other hand, auxiliary and infrastructural mechanisms should not start with the "Tiny" prefix. The idea is to emphasize the simulated nature of the elements that are part of the simulation itself.</li>
<li><strong>Tests:</strong> If you are writing some new mechanism, please also create at least a unit test <code>tests/unit/</code>, and if you can a functional scenario test (<code>tests/scenarios/</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrations:</strong> If you'd like to demonstrate a new scenario, please design it preferably as a new Jupyter notebook within <code>examples/</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> If you are implementing anything that is Microsoft-specific and non-confidential, please put it under a <code>.../microsoft/</code> folder.</li>

	<p><strong>Text, footage and photographs by Dr. Klaus M. Stiefel</strong></p>
<p>A long time ago, as an enthusiastic young, naive graduate student I went to a conference, which was just a few years away from its inevitable transition from a fun get-together of math nerds who loved to exchange ideas and crack jokes, into an academic business meeting where lab leaders advertised their near-completed projects to the competition.</p>
<p>Back then the conference organizers gave away funny, tongue-in-cheek awards (this would be inconceivable by now – humor!), and one of these awards was for the “most interesting hypothesis most likely to be false”. I thought this was a great award, honoring science which was daring, and which had just missed the mark by a bit. The winner that year was a sympathetic Italian scientist who had, with great enthusiasm and outstanding rhetorical fanfare, presented fancy computer-simulations of language comprehension in a brain region known to be unrelated to language processing. The researcher had missed the actual award ceremony, and I was by chance having a coffee near him and his students when someone broke the news of his newly won award to him. The otherwise so cheerful face of the bearded, portly <em>professore</em> dropped upon hearing about the “honor”. He was visibly distraught by his win! I assume that at home, where he ruled over his lab with charisma and reputation, none of his loyal students had dared to tell him that, based on all that’s known about the human brain, language processing is not happening in the Hippocampus. I remember the young me thinking that this is what scientific progress looks like: hypothesis falsification.</p>
<p><strong>The Silurian Hypothesis</strong></p>
<p>A hypothesis called “The Silurian hypothesis” wins the title of “most interesting hypothesis most likely to be false” for all of science. In brief, the hypothesis postulates that previously a species different from ours had achieved high intelligence and technological civilization on this planet. The Silurian hypothesis (named after “Silurian” aliens in the brainy British TV series “Doctor Who”) was initially proposed by two astronomers, Gavin A. Schmidt and Adam Frank, as a thought experiment, to see if it would even be feasible to detect the traces of such a hypothetical civilization which had existed many millions of years ago. Would there still be detectable changes in the sedimentation patterns if someone (not human) had built cities and military bases a hundred million years ago? Would ancient trash dumps be conserved somewhere, somehow? Would there be changes in the patterns of radioisotopes in the rocks as a result of an ancient nuclear war?</p>
<p>So, in their original paper, Schmidt &amp; Frank didn’t actually voice belief in an ancient civilization, but pondered the question if and how it would be detectable. They conclude that no ruins of ancient football stadiums, highways or housing projects would survive geological time. In contrast, unusual episodes of global warming and the presence of certain artificial radioisotopes (Plutonium-244 and Curium-247) would give an ancient civilization away. Mass extinctions could be a sign of an ancient smart, technological, fast-expanding species.</p>
<p>Actual artefacts might not persist on Earth with its plate tectonics and active atmosphere, but spacefaring ancients might have built big bases on the Moon or on Mars; there, they would have persisted much longer.</p>
<p><a title="Cuttlefish" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pacificklaus/52976050916/" data-flickr-embed="true"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52976050916_829724744e_z.jpg" alt="Cuttlefish" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p><em>Can you see me?</em></p>
<p><strong>Geological Thought Experiment versus Actual Ancient Civilizations</strong></p>
<p>But besides being an interesting nudge for geological thinking, the question if such an ancient civilization <strong><em>actually happened</em></strong>, and who would have been the species to sustain it is <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> intriguing. The proposition that this was the case, is what I consider the actual most interesting hypothesis most likely to be false, ever, by a wide margin. While Schmidt &amp; Frank didn’t consider this question, there is some really well-written science fiction discussing the question, but it hasn’t been tackled in a biologically well-informed way. This is what I’ll try to do here.</p>
<p>Probably the esteemed reader has noticed by now that I am no true believer in the Silurian hypothesis, but I like to entertain it; and while much has been written about hypothetical humanoid descendants of carnivorous dinosaurs as the bearers of the ancient civilization, I believe that it’s the cephalopods – the octopi, cuttlefish and squid- who are the most likely candidates to have reached at least some level of civilization.</p>
<p>Two somewhat different levels of ancient cephalopod civilization are worth considering. The levels are quite distinct in how realistic (or: how more or less extremely unrealistic) they are.</p>
<p>The first level is the Neolithic stage, reached by a species of cephalopod eons ago. Reaching “only” the Neolithic stage could be described as a “Silurian hypothesis light”; it’s not highly significant achievement for a species, and even such a species can significantly turn over the planet’s fauna. Even our hunter-gathering (Paleolithic) ancestors hunted a number of large animal species to extinction (you don’t have to kill every last mammoth or giant bird to do that), and our farming ancestors (before the advent of even the simple most metal tools) caused massive modifications of the fauna and florae of extensive landscapes. Some of these faunal changes might be detectable millions of years into the future.</p>
<p>Reaching the industrial or space age is much harder than reaching a stage of organized, wide-spread farming. Many of the ways of how Schmidt &amp; Frank propose an ancient civilization which was burning fossil fuels, building nuclear reactors and spaceships. This level is nothing which can easily imagined following from what’s known about cephalopod behavior, which I will rave about below. This second level is the science fiction of the science fiction; it’s in the heavyweight division of the make-believe, and in this essay, I don’t want to go there.</p>
<p><strong>Cephalopods</strong></p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that only the cephalopods are viable candidates for purveyors for an ancient civilization after plenty of reading of the scholarly literature on cephalopods<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, and also via my personal experience – I scuba dive a lot, and I do some in one of the best diving locations in the world, the central Philippines. I divide humanity into those who have seen a living cephalopod with their own eyes, and those who haven’t. Knowing about a squid from anatomical drawings in a book or from squid rings as a starter is like knowing sex only from cheap erotic novels.</p>
<p>As a scuba diver, I observe corals, sponges, sea stars, and most fishes. Squid, cuttlefish and octopi, I interact with. There is a definite two-way component in my encounters with these animals. I look at them, and then I come closer to them. They look back at me, clearly with a theory of my mind, and without any doubt gauging what I intend to do in the next seconds, and then they react: sometimes they decide to flee or hide, and in other cases they keep doing what they were up to before my arrival, or even inspect me in return. Octopi seem to be particularly curious animals.</p>

<p>These encounters are more like those of tourists from far-flung countries interacting with Austrians in the touristy spots of my home country. The tourists might not completely understand what the Austrians are thinking, when they perform their alpine folk dances, but it’s an encounter eye-to-eye, and neither tourists nor folk dancers doubt that the other side is sentient and conscious.</p>
<p>Across a vast species barrier, the situation feels very similar when interacting with a cephalopod.</p>

<p><em>A flamboyant cuttlefish, a small cephalopod found in the tropics and subtropics of the Pacific Ocean. This animal is particularly impressive with its fast skin color and pattern changes.</em></p>
<p>The scholarly literature is well in sync with my personal observations of <em>cephalopod behavior</em> being outstandingly complex (there is a great monograph with that title by Roger Hanlon and John Messenger). Cephalopods have been called “honorary vertebrates” for their complex nervous systems and sophisticated behaviors.</p>
<p>Cephalopods are among the few animals which mate in different positions (some squid do), and in some species smaller males pretend to be females, and then sneak by large, territory-owning dominant male. These “sneaker males” are often surprisingly successful in siring offspring, courtesy of their Machiavellian cleverness and deceptive behavior.</p>
<p>Cuttlefish hunt by seemingly hypnotizing crabs by generating highly psychedelic moving stripe patterns on their bodies; other cuttlefish camouflage themselves as harmless, herbivorous parrotfish to sneak up on their prey. And the master of behavioral camouflage, the mimic octopus, pretends to be alternatively a flounder (spiny), a sea snake or a lionfish (both venomous) to deter would-be predators. These animals are clever beyond belief, for animals grouped by biological taxonomists with such passive or slow creatures as clams and garden slugs.</p>

<p><em>An octopus using the discarded lid of a can as a shield to cover the entrance of its lair. Seen near Sydney, Australia.</em></p>
<p>There is even an octopus named after its tool use, the coconut octopus (<em>Amphioctopus marginatus</em>). And finally, there is a very sophisticated communication system between cephalopods, based on color and pattern changes in their skins. A large array of tiny, circular muscles contracts or relaxes, and hence shows the skin color above or below the skin musculature. This allows many species of cephalopods to change their color, and the pattern on their skins within seconds. The skin color changes are used for a variety of purposes, including camouflage and communication with conspecifics. Many species have a multitude of different patterns which they can project onto their backs, and which signal messages like “I am angry” or “I am ready to mate”.</p>

<p><em>Two male cuttlefish fight over a female (white color, on the right). These are three animals of the same species, the different patterns on their backs are instances of communication. The tiger-pattern says “aggression”.</em></p>
<p>With all of these complex behaviors in place, couldn’t it all have come together sometime, just like it did with humans fifteen thousand years ago, when ecological conditions and human ingenuity came together to spawn the Neolithic revolution. We moved from being very smart creatures who were hunting and gathering in smallish tribal groups to beings involved in organized farming, organized in much larger and more complex groups. I don’t think that taking this step is completely out of question for a particularly large-brained ancient squid. Since almost all cephalopods are carnivores, they would have been some kind of pastoralists, raising snails or clams for their consumption. This level of technological achievement is not likely, and certainly not supported by any actual evidence; however, it’s mildly realistic. The step from an octopus bringing along a coconut shell for protection to an octopus picking up snails and placing them near his lair for farming is at least feasible. The same octopus using stone tools to smash these snails is conceivable. Cephalopods living in structured societies? Squids already live in schools with strict hierarchies, with the bigger animals frequently cannibalizing the smaller ones. Imagine a time-traveling biologist, visiting the proto-human Lucy three million years ago, and the cephalopods of the Jurassic. Whom would she put her bet on to produce a civilization? The primate or the cephalopod? I am not convinced that she’s go with our ancestors.</p>

<p>In contrast, the next level, that of industrialized technology, chemistry, nuclear physics and space travel seems much more unrealistic to achieve by any squid or octopus; science fiction is rich in space-faring cephalopods or cephalopod-inspired aliens, most notably Admiral Gial Ackbar of the original Star Wars movies. However, this is a level which came late, and which does not look inevitable in hindsight, by any means, in human history. Who would have guessed when looking at European warfare in the 1066 (Battle of Hastings: large axes! A brawl with home-improvement equipment) that less than a thousand years later the same people would kill each other using satellite-guided missiles?</p>
<p>A factor which makes reaching this level even more unlikely is that experimental chemistry and physics would be harder to pull off underwater. Air is an excellent insulator of electricity, and all the hours I spent in chemistry labs as an undergraduate makes me doubt that you can pull of a successful chemical synthesis underwater. Reagents would inevitably mix with seawater; this might be a narrow-minded terrestrial-centric view of chemistry, but I suspect that more fundamental physics is at play here, making it easier to combine liquid solutions when you live in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Hence, octopus Neolithic: <strong><em>maaaaybe</em></strong>. The initial conditions are present in squid and octopi. No proof that it ever happened, but the idea does not smell like looniness, at least to some biologists (well, me). Squid space travel: almost certainly absolutely <strong><em>no</em></strong>.</p>
<p>So why are we not seeing octopus or squid societies today? Fish would eat them. Anyone who observes cephalopods underwater will notice a few striking aspects of their ecology: there are almost always fewer of them around than there are fishes. During an hour’s worth of diving on an average southeast Asian tropical coral reef, you will see hundreds to thousands of fish, but only an octopus or two, or a school of a few dozens of squid – and maybe not even that. If you don’t see an octopus, it might not be there, or it might be so well hidden to escape the eyes of hungry predatory fishes. Somehow, in most habitats, fishes massively win out against cephalopods, with many more individual fishes and many more fish species present.</p>
<p>Consequentially, to understand then when an ancient cephalopod civilization could have happened, we have to look at the evolution of cephalopods, and of that of fishes, and see how they overlap:</p>
<p><strong>So, When Do You Say Did That Happen?</strong></p>
<p>The story of cephalopod evolution is an absolutely fascinating chapter in the development of Planet Earth’s fauna. It’s also murky, and some of the fossils supposedly representing the earliest cephalopods are not easy to interpret, even by expert paleontologists who interpret ancient fossils all day.</p>
<p>Sometime in the late Cambrian, the first geological epoch with diverse animals with complex bodies, the Nautiluses evolved, primitive cephalopods with less well-developed nervous systems and larger numbers of simpler tentacles instead of the eight or ten sophisticated arms of modern octopi or squid. A few species of <em>Nautilus</em> still exist today as “living fossils”, living in deep water where they scavenge.</p>
<p>From these still somewhat primitive animals evolved the giant shelled Ammonites, and the modern cephalopods (the “Coleoids”), which include the cuttlefish, octopi, squid, and some animals closely related to squid, the belemnites, which we will encounter again. These are the animals with fast propulsion via contraction of a water-filled body cavity, fine motor control of their arms and hunting tentacles, keen senses, good memory, skin-pattern=based communication, social lives and sophisticated mating rituals.</p>
<p><a title="Nautilus" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pacificklaus/3799251083/in/photolist-6MJ9Z2-2oHj7hd-2jZgpoE-2oAe6M2-2oHjRbY-2nSozto-fHYh5N-2nSq4r3-2nSk4L3-eiiqe5-2nSnXvZ-2hBuusa-2oys7vx-2pGNsEi-2nVTu4M-2oR198E-2oQZ7Jt-fHcMk7-2nSnGqP-2p3YtQY-2oHg2w3-2pGNsN4-gBeA5R-piiHgZ-eHQ3T6-otTcnh-asF8TV-2oyuo1o-2kTGeGD-hs7aAy-dtVggH-93rskK-auXYxJ-2oQZ7pL-eiTqw9-eiMGhH-6X77XD-8KZULE-qCA7TQ-2hBtDhA-qpXC8u-oLkURf-kdmxG6-bTBzJe-Keo9qu-p9igoC-6X7eMX-fHXQzU-cAayeu-2oAVYYj" data-flickr-embed="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/2667/3799251083_34508aa500_z.jpg" alt="Nautilus" width="640" height="427"></a></p>
<p><em>A Nautilus, a cephalopod which remained from an ancient lineage. The few species of Nautilus which still exist have more bodies, with simpler eyes, and less developed nervous systems, and generally live as scavengers in deep waters. I took this picture in Palau, where the crew of the dive boat had baited it with a piece of chicken at depth, and hoisted the animal up to shallow waters, where divers could photograph them.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Cephalopod Civilization Window</strong></p>
<p>A crucial window where cephalopod civilization could have occurred is the time between when mentally high-performing cephalopods came to their own, and the time when aquatic vertebrates really took over. Modern (Teleost) fishes exploded, evolutionarily speaking, only in the late Cretaceous, the last of the three ages of the dinosaurs. These are the snappers, groupers, large wrasses and other predatory fishes which keep the octopus numbers on reefs low in this day and age.</p>
<p>Cephalopods got into their evolutionary gears earlier – the number of genera increased substantially, since the beginning of the Triassic, about 55 million years earlier than the diversification of bony fishes. That’s a long time for evolution to push a species over that last hump of intelligence and cooperation needed to attain simple farming civilization. If there ever was an ancient cephalopod civilization, my bet would be that it happened in the Jurassic.</p>
<p>Again, I think that the likelihood of squid kings ruling the Jurassic seas or of octopus knights jousting for Mesozoic reef dominance is not high, and there is no support yet in favor of it. As usual, unusual claims need especially strong support, and this support doesn’t exist yet. But the ancient cephalopod civilization is one of the poetic believes I keep for myself to remind myself of my pre-grad student, sci-fi devouring teenage self. And should modern geology proceed to univocally falsify even the light version of the cephalopod Silurian hypothesis, I’ll take it easier than the Italian professor.</p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 09:51:32 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sst.dev/blog/container-support/">https://sst.dev/blog/container-support/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42105797">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Historically, SST has primarily supported deploying serverless applications. But over the last month we’ve slowly expanded native support for containers on AWS.</p>
<lite-youtube videoid="sg4CnvoI7eg"> <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=sg4CnvoI7eg"> <span></span> </a> </lite-youtube>  
<p>This includes changes across the entire SST platform.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-components">1. Components</h3>
<p>There’s a new family of components that’ll help you build with containers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/component/aws/cluster"><code dir="auto">Cluster</code></a> &amp; <a href="https://sst.dev/docs/component/aws/service"><code dir="auto">Service</code></a></p>
<p>These help you deploy your containerized applications to AWS using ECS and Fargate.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="ts"><code><div><p><span>const </span><span>cluster</span><span> = </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>sst</span><span>.</span><span>aws</span><span>.</span><span>Cluster</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>MyCluster</span><span>"</span><span>, { </span><span>vpc</span><span> }</span><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>cluster</span><span>.</span><span>addService</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>MyService</span><span>"</span><span>, {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>loadBalancer: {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>ports: [{ listen: </span><span>"</span><span>80/http</span><span>"</span><span>, forward: </span><span>"</span><span>3000/http</span><span>"</span><span> }],</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>},</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>dev: {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>command: </span><span>"</span><span>npm run dev</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>},</span></p></div><div><p><span>});</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>In addition to configuring ECS and Fargate, this also configures <a href="https://x.com/jayair/status/1853848336538673606"><strong>service discovery</strong></a> for your applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/component/aws/vpc"><code dir="auto">Vpc</code></a></p>
<p>Container applications are usually deployed in a VPC. So this component makes it easy to create a VPC. And optionally add a bastion host or a NAT gateway.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="ts"><code><div><p><span>new</span><span> sst</span><span>.</span><span>aws</span><span>.</span><span>Vpc</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>MyVpc</span><span>"</span><span>, { bastion: </span><span>true</span><span>, nat: </span><span>"</span><span>managed</span><span>"</span><span> });</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/component/aws/postgres"><code dir="auto">Postgres</code></a>, <a href="https://sst.dev/docs/component/aws/redis"><code dir="auto">Redis</code></a>, &amp; <a href="https://sst.dev/docs/component/aws/efs"><code dir="auto">Efs</code></a></p>
<p>While these components are not specifically for containers, they’ve been designed to work well with the above <code dir="auto">Cluster</code> and <code dir="auto">Vpc</code> components.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="cost">Cost</h4>
<p>Unlike our serverless components, that are pay-per-use, these components have a more traditional pricing structure. We’ve taken special care to ensure that these components are as cost effective as possible to get started with. While still allowing you to scale with them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, AWS’ pricing pages for these services is not great. So the above components have a new <em>Cost</em> section in their docs. For example, here’s what the <a href="https://sst.dev/docs/component/aws/vpc#cost">cost of using the <code dir="auto">Vpc</code> component looks like</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://x.com/jayair/status/1851019182122652125">read more about what we’ve done here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-cli">2. CLI</h3>
<p>There are two big things we’ve done with our CLI to support containers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <code dir="auto">dev</code> prop allows you to run your application locally in a new tab in the <code dir="auto">sst dev</code> multiplexer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new <a href="https://sst.dev/docs/reference/cli#tunnel"><code dir="auto">sst tunnel</code></a> command allows your local machine to connect to resources that’ve been deployed in a VPC. This is helpful because most of the container related components need a VPC. You can <a href="https://x.com/jayair/status/1844055259729007084">check it out in action here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-console">3. Console</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sst.dev/docs/console">SST Console</a> now shows you logs for your containers. And <a href="https://sst.dev/docs/console#autodeploy">Autodeploy</a> will support running in the same VPC as your app. This will allow your deploy process to have access to all the resources in your app.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<p>We’ve updated all our tutorials to help you get started with the new containers.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/bun">Bun</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/nuxt">Nuxt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/solid">Solid</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/deno">Deno</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/hono">Hono</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/astro">Astro</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/remix">Remix</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/svelte">Svelte</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/nextjs">Next.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/drizzle">Drizzle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/prisma">Prisma</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/express">Express</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The frontends now support deploying to both serverless and containers.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<p>Over the next few weeks we’ll extend support to other languages and frameworks. Like Rails, Laravel, Python, Elixir, Go, and more.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>Ordered 2 Macbooks for $2500 from Apple (Canada). Paid for their same day delivery service which they use Uber for and it says delivered but it wasn't. Driver stole them or he delivered to the wrong person that stole them. If he actually delivered to the wrong address, I live in a high rise that does have cameras but only in the lobby which means once the Uber driver got on the elevator who's to say he didn't get the wrong unit and it's his word against mine.</p><p>

I contacted Apple and they said they would reach out to Uber and get back to me. 12 hours later I got an email from Apple saying:</p><p>

"We have completed our review with the carrier regarding your shipment and have determined that we are unable to provide a replacement or process a refund."</p><p>

I couldn't believe my eyes. Picked up the phone and called them and what they didnt tell me in the email was that I should file a police report (which ive done). They said do the police report and the police will reach out to Apple. Problem is I talked to the police and they said they dont reach out to anyone, Apple reaches out to them once I give Apple the police report number. Apple also said they came to that decision because Uber says the item shows as delivered.</p><p>

So basically I'm stressing. By reading online it looks like this has happened to others and they didn't get their money back. I'm just wondering if anyone here has been in a situation like this or can give me any advice?</p><p>

Thanks.</p><p>

------- UPDATES -------</p><p>

EDIT 1:<br>
Small update:</p><p>

Lots of people online told me to contact Tim Cook by email. Obviously not expecting him to reply but apparently he has a team that responds to these emails for situations like this. Got a call today from a nice lady that asked a couple questions and for the police report number and to forward the original email i got from Apple telling me they wouldnt help me with a refund or replacement. She said she took over the case and is looking into it and to expect a call in a day or two. She seems pretty high up the food chain..</p><p>

One thing I explained to her and to the police that came to visit me, was when someone visits/delivers anything to my building they must buzz in first. This comes through as an incoming call on my phone. I told her and the police that I will supply my login info for my phone carrier to see I had no incoming calls within hours of the supposed delivery.</p><p>

I'm confident that if this is truly looked into by a real person who wants to put in the time to find the truth than it will end in my favour.</p><p>

I appreciate all the advice i got here and will give an update once I hear from her.</p><p>

EDIT 2: Spoke with Apple Retail Executive Relations. They're not changing their decision. I get nothing back. Case closed. Trying a chargeback now. I feel sick.</p></div>

Hi. Some more info.</p><p>

i called Apple back after the last woman I spoke to said Apple has made their final decision and would not transfer me to a supervisor. I spoke with a nice gentleman who was speaking with his manager in real time and said I need to file a police report and get the Police to call Apple. Problem is the Police tell me they do not call Apple. Apple needs to call them or I need to give Apple the Police report number. Apple insists Police need to call them. Waiting on a call from a cop now.</p><p>

Aside from the one Apple employee I am absolutely shocked at how this is being treated. I own over 10k in Apple stuff and I seriously just want to get rid of it. How can someone be scammed so easy and Apple not give a crap. </p><p>

I might have to go to a store and speak with someone but I doubt any of them would be high enough in the company to have any pull.</p></div>

They do in NYC. My same-day deliveries have required ID, a signature &amp; the driver takes a photo. It has to be handed to a person. If someone other than the person who ordered it is accepting the package, you have to give their name. It is tracked via the Apple Store app the whole way with map tracking &amp; everything.</p><p>

Not sure what Canadian tracking is though.</p></div>

If you get the police report, email Tim Cook's office with a scan or photo of it. Their executive reponse team should call you back. Be sure to also include any correspondence with the Apple care team, the tracking texts from Uber, etc.</p></div>

Thank you i actually did email Tim Cook lol. Hope someone responds. The thing with Uber tho is its not like a normal Ubereats order, Appel hides all the drivers info from you, all you see is a map and once its delivered it all disappears.</p></div>

yes i did but since the transaction hasn't fully gone through yet i need to call back when it does in order to do a chargeback. This is the last resort because Apple will then ban my credit card. But I guess thats not a big deal because if they screw me there is no way Id buy another Apple product again.</p></div>

Police came and visited me today and I gave them a bunch of info. Initially they were 100% convinced I bought from a fake website since they couldn't fathom a company like Apple using Ubereats to deliver $2500 computers. They finally looked it up online and were shocked.</p><p>

I think they're going to reach out to Apple. I'm just going to give it a couple of days. I spoke with a Manager at Apple and they are escalating the investigation.</p></div>

<p>Seeing how Uber is contracted by Apple to do delivery, the onus is on Apple to assure the care, custody, and control of the items until they are delivered to the correct person (or authorized person) at the billing address. It really doesn’t matter if Uber says it was delivered, unless said company has verified proof you took delivery.  Once the charge is posted, you need to dispute it. I would also be prepared to go to small claims court.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true" aria-labelledby="file-name-id-wide file-name-id-mobile"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">For as long as I've been making videos on the <a href="https://youtube.com/@lowbyteproductions" rel="nofollow">low byte productions</a> youtube channel, I've wanted to make a series about "Networking from scratch", by which I mean building a full TCP/IP stack from the ground up on a microcontroller. It's been nearly 6 years now, and the past few days felt like as good a time as any to start.</p>
<p dir="auto">This blog entry is fairly limited in scope; On the surface, it's about how I successfully sent my first ethernet packet, but really it's a story about bugs and debugging, and some thoughts about overcoming challenges in projects.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Microcontroller</h2><a id="user-content-microcontroller" aria-label="Permalink: Microcontroller" href="#microcontroller"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The microcontroller I'm using is an STM32F401 on a nucleo devboard. This is the same setup I used in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQQsDWLRDuI&amp;list=PLP29wDx6QmW7HaCrRydOnxcy8QmW0SNdQ" rel="nofollow">Blinky to bootloader</a> series, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAfWea21ooM" rel="nofollow">3D renderer on an oscilloscope</a> video, and a bunch of others. It's an ARM Cortex-M4 that can run up to 84MHz, with 96KiB of RAM. That's enough to hold onto decent handful of packets.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ethernet</h2><a id="user-content-ethernet" aria-label="Permalink: Ethernet" href="#ethernet"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ethernet is a word that covers a surprising number of things. You might associate it with the port you plug into for wired internet, or know about the idea of ethernet <em>frames</em>. Ethernet is actually a whole family of technologies and standards (many of which are now obsolete) that encompasses the hardware involved at the physical level, various signalling formats that encode and transmit bits, the strategies for dealing with bus collisions, and the layout of frames, which contain and protect the data being sent from one place to another.</p>
<p dir="auto">Due to the complexity of the signalling involved with ethernet, a dedicated ASIC is generally used, which takes in data at the frame level, and takes care of wiggling the electrical lines in the right way over a cable (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcvElQS-hM" rel="nofollow">though there are of course exceptions</a>). For this project, I'm using the W5100 chip from Wiznet, in the form of the original Arduino Ethernet shield. Well, it's a cheap knockoff that ended up needing some rework to actually function properly, but we'll get to that.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/francisrstokes/githublog/blob/main/assets/w5100-project/shield.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/francisrstokes/githublog/raw/main/assets/w5100-project/shield.jpg"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The W5100 chip itself is pretty cool. It's essentially an ethernet ASIC with a hardware TCP/IP stack built-in. It has 4 "sockets", which can be set up to work at the TCP, UDP, IP, or "MAC Raw" levels. Since the whole point of this project is build a TCP/IP stack from scratch, I'm only making use of one socket in the MAC Raw mode, where I hand it ethernet frames, and it sends them out. The caveat is that an <em>actual</em> ethernet frame contains more than just the data; It also includes: A preamble, start of frame marker, and a 32-bit CRC. The preamble and start of frame marker are really only relevant at the electrical level, which the chip fully takes care, and the CRC is also helpfully computed by the W5100.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Problem No. 1: Shouting into the void</h2><a id="user-content-problem-no-1-shouting-into-the-void" aria-label="Permalink: Problem No. 1: Shouting into the void" href="#problem-no-1-shouting-into-the-void"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I coded up a driver to communicate with the W5100 chip. Data exchange takes place using SPI - the serial peripheral interface - which is a 4-wire signalling protocol for full duplex communication. One of the wires is for the main chip's (the microcontroller's) output, one is for the subordinate chip's (the W5100's) output, one is for the clock to which data is referenced, and the last is a "chip select" signal, which tells the subordinate chip that communication is happening. There are more details to SPI, which dictate things like if your data is referenced to the rising or falling edge of the clock, whether the clock signal idles high or low, whether bits are transferred MSB or LSB first, and how many bits occur per transfer (typically 8, or one byte).</p>
<p dir="auto">That gives you a low-level way to exchange bytes, but basically nothing else. The W5100 datasheet lays out a higher-level protocol on top of SPI to actually control the chip. In this protocol, you send commands made up of 4 bytes on the MOSI (main out, subordinate in) line:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="+--------+-----------+----------+--------+
| byte 0 | byte 1    | byte 2   | byte 3 |
+--------+-----------+----------+--------+
| op     | addr high | addr low | value  |
+--------+-----------+----------+--------+"><pre><code>+--------+-----------+----------+--------+
| byte 0 | byte 1    | byte 2   | byte 3 |
+--------+-----------+----------+--------+
| op     | addr high | addr low | value  |
+--------+-----------+----------+--------+
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The first byte specifies the operation, which is either a write (<code>0xf0</code>) or a read (<code>0x0f</code>) - anything else is invalid and should be ignored. The second and third bytes specify a 16-bit address (big-endian), and the last byte is, in the case of a write, a value to be written at that address. The W5100 transfers data out on MISO (main in, subordinate out) line at the same time, which follows this pattern:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| byte 0 | byte 1 | byte 2 | byte 3 |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  0x00  |  0x01  |  0x02  |  0x03  |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+"><pre><code>+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| byte 0 | byte 1 | byte 2 | byte 3 |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  0x00  |  0x01  |  0x02  |  0x03  |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In the case of a read operation, byte 3 actually returns the value read at the specified address.</p>
<p dir="auto">What are these addresses? Well, internally, the W5100 has its own <em>address space</em>, which has transfer and receive buffers, as well as a bunch of registers for setting up and controlling the flow of packets. For reference, it's laid out like:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="+-----------------+------------------+
| Address Range   | Function         |
+-----------------+------------------+
| 0x0000 - 0x002f | Common registers |
| 0x0030 - 0x03ff | Reserved         |
| 0x0400 - 0x07ff | Socket registers |
| 0x0800 - 0x3fff | Reserved         |
| 0x4000 - 0x5fff | TX Memory        |
| 0x6000 - 0x7fff | RX Memory        |
| 0x8000 - 0xffff | Reserved         |

<p dir="auto">My first clue that something wasn't right was that I was sending out commands on MOSI, and seeing garbage on MISO. One thing I really like about this chip is that it specifically sends back a known value every time you clock out a byte, and so it's really easy to see that something is off in the communication. I puzzled over this for a while, and realised I'd fallen into the trap that you should always avoid when doing anything embedded - I unconditionally trusted the hardware.</p>
<p dir="auto">As I mentioned earlier, The W5100 is sitting on an arduino shield - which is an addon board meant to clip directly on top of the standard but absolutely awful arduino headers. Because Arduino is so ubiquitous, this shield format has found its way onto myriad other devboards that have nothing to do with arduino, simply because it gives you an instant tie-in to readily available peripheral modules. The nucleo devboards from ST also have headers to accommodate arduino shields, but alas, this particular shield had an annoying little trick up it's sleave. You see, the arduino also has another little 6-pin header on board called the ICSP - the in-circuit serial programmer. This header can be used to reprogram Atmel chips (which the tractional arduinos use) over SPI. The designers of this shield decided to make use of that 6-pin header, and the fact that it shares the same SPI signals with those on the standard header, and routed the SPI lines to the ICSP header <strong>instead of</strong> the standard pins on the arduino header. On a proper arduino, this would be no problem, because the arduino board itself internally connects those signals. But a nucleo board doesn't have an ICSP header, so the SPI signals I was sending out were going nowhere.</p>

<p dir="auto">I realised this after probing around with a multimeter, measuring resistances between the power rails and the SPI signals. If you measure <em>infinite</em> resistance, you know there is a problem! A quick trip to the soldering station, and a few enamelled copper wires later, I had bodged my board to properly connect everything to the nucleo.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Problem No. 2: The essence of comedy</h2><a id="user-content-problem-no-2-the-essence-of-comedy" aria-label="Permalink: Problem No. 2: The essence of comedy" href="#problem-no-2-the-essence-of-comedy"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With the SPI signals actually going where they should be, I was actually communicating with the device! I had enough code written to set up the W5100 to do raw ethernet transmissions, set up the MAC address, configured the TX and RX memory segments, and finally write a simple test ethernet frame into TX memory and trigger a transmission. I connected the nucleo+shield to my laptop with a CAT5 cable, fired up wireshark, and! Nothing.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're regularly doing stuff down at the low-level, this kind of problem can be really daunting. There are no helpful (or even cryptic) error messages to investigate. No stack trace to follow. It's simply: You wiggled some electrons up and down across the wires, and it didn't do the thing you thought it would.</p>
<p dir="auto">One very useful tool to have in your belt for this kind of thing is a logic analyser, which is like an oscilloscope, but specifically made for analysing digital signals, i.e. ones that go between a logical high and low level. These devices have a number of channels - usually between 8 and 32 - and a USB connection. In the middle is some speedy magical silicon which buffers, conditions, and samples those channels at a high rate, compresses the bitstreams, and pushes them through the USB, ready to be analysed by software. The cool thing here is that you can investigate individual signals, or more usefully, groups of signals (like an entire SPI bus). In that case, the software will actually interpret the signals, and give you a display of the bytes sent in a transaction, as well as export tools for processing those same bytes as a CSV or other structured format.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have a Saleae Logic 8, which is a fairly fancy device, but you can get cheap and cheerful analysers for ~€10, which can also integrate with Saleae's Logic2 software (they're pretty iffy about working correctly and consistently, but there's always a tradeoff, right). As soon as I captured the SPI traffic flying across, I could see something was off. The first command I sent looked good, and so did the response over the MISO line. It's a software reset, and appears something like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       | byte 0 | byte 1 | byte 2 | byte 3 |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| MOSI |  0xf0  |  0x00  |  0x00  |  0x80  |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| MISO |  0x00  |  0x01  |  0x02  |  0x03  |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+"><pre><code>       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       | byte 0 | byte 1 | byte 2 | byte 3 |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| MOSI |  0xf0  |  0x00  |  0x00  |  0x80  |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| MISO |  0x00  |  0x01  |  0x02  |  0x03  |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Decoded, it's a <code>write</code> to address <code>0x0000</code>, the "Mode Register", with the most significant bit set, which triggers a software reset. You can also see that the device dutifully responded with the bytes <code>0x00</code> to <code>0x03</code>. The next command is a <code>read</code> from the same address, which is supposed to check if that same most significant bit has been cleared to 0, which indicates that the reset is complete. It looked like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       | byte 0 | byte 1 | byte 2 | byte 3 |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| MOSI |  0x0f  |  0x00  |  0x00  |  0x00  |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| MISO |  0x03  |  0xff  |  0xff  |  0xff  |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+"><pre><code>       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       | byte 0 | byte 1 | byte 2 | byte 3 |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| MOSI |  0x0f  |  0x00  |  0x00  |  0x00  |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| MISO |  0x03  |  0xff  |  0xff  |  0xff  |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Huh. The response on the MISO line is not the counting up behaviour, but instead it starts at <code>0x03</code> and then just responds forevermore with <code>0xff</code>. Not good. I pondered this one for a little while, and thankfully the little knowledge I have of digital logic, and actually building hardware on FPGAs came in clutch. The fact that the first value returned by the W5100 was <code>0x03</code>, which is the also the <em>last</em> value it returned, is a pretty big clue.</p>
<p dir="auto">Digital hardware, internally, is made up of circuits that implement useful primitives like "registers" and "flip-flops". These circuits are <em>synchronous</em> to a clock, and are able to capture/store/reset values presented to their inputs. You take these primitives, mix them together with others like multiplexers (the circuit equivalent of an if-statement), decoders, and of course logic gates, and you can build up to more complex constructions like state machines. The really important thing about all of this is that there are some pretty important timing-related constraints that need to be upheld. It takes a signal time to come out of a register, pass through a handful of logic gates/multiplexers/whatever, and then enter a new register. If, for example, the clock were to switch too fast, before the signal had made its way to the next register, the abstraction falls apart and it simply ain't gonna work.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/francisrstokes/githublog/blob/main/assets/w5100-project/with-saleae.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/francisrstokes/githublog/raw/main/assets/w5100-project/with-saleae.jpg"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">My thinking was that something like this was happening here; The W5100 didn't have enough time to do its thing, and that's why I was seeing the <em>previous</em> state of MISO (<code>0x03</code>) when the second command transaction was taking place. It probably wasn't going to be the SPI clock though, since the datasheet implies the maximum clock rate for the SPI bus is ~14MHz, and I was running way below that. Instead, I suspected that the chip select line was probably going high (i.e. being disabled) too soon, causing the chip to get into a bad state.</p>
<p dir="auto">I added a small loop to introduce a few microseconds of extra time before changing the state of the chip select line, and it worked! All of a sudden, the responses on the MISO line looked right. And further more, it seemed like the rest of the setup was also working, and I was getting sensible and sane values back from the chip when reading back configuration values I had written to it.</p>
<p dir="auto">I still haven't completely gotten to the bottom of the matter. Diligent readers will note that the datasheet does in fact contain a SPI timing diagram on page 66, but the only constraint mentioned there with regard to the chip select line was certainly being met. I should go back and try to figure out the exact bounds where things break down, but there are only a certain number of hours in the day, and right now I'd rather just progress with the project.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Problem No. 3: There's life in this packet, but not as we know it</h2><a id="user-content-problem-no-3-theres-life-in-this-packet-but-not-as-we-know-it" aria-label="Permalink: Problem No. 3: There's life in this packet, but not as we know it" href="#problem-no-3-theres-life-in-this-packet-but-not-as-we-know-it"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Of course, the first thing I did was to fire up wireshark again, and see if that packet would appear. And it did! Sort of. Well, not really.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>A</em> packet did appear, but not the one that I'd sent. Instead, at the moment the transmission command went out of the microcontroller, a raw ethernet packet, filled with garbage, and far larger than the one I had placed came out across the screen.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/francisrstokes/githublog/blob/main/assets/w5100-project/first-unsuccessful-packet.png"><img src="https://github.com/francisrstokes/githublog/raw/main/assets/w5100-project/first-unsuccessful-packet.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I'd been trying to avoid reading other peoples code related to this chip, because a lot of the fun of this kind of project, for me, comes in the exploration and discovery of trying to get the thing working from specs and datasheets alone. But at this stage, I was willing to sanity check my understanding against something known to be working properly.</p>
<p dir="auto">A little tip that a lot of very seasoned embedded developers could learn from is that, at times like this, arduino actually comes in <em>really</em> useful. Grab an arduino, install some library, write ~5 lines of code (because all the complex stuff happens under the hood), and if you get the result, you now have a gold standard working thing to compare to. It actually took me quite a lot longer to find a library that would let me transmit a raw ethernet packet, however. As it turns out, most Arduino users, who want to be able to add network connectivity to a project, do not want to do it all from scratch. The official libraries actually removed support for sending raw packets from the public API. However I managed to find a <a href="https://github.com/njh/W5100MacRaw">project on github</a> that was the minimum necessary steps to send and receive packets.</p>
<p dir="auto">I read the source, and compared against my own, and there were no immediately obvious offenders. Some of the register writes and reads occurred in a different order, some were ommitted in mine or theirs, but none of that seemed to be the problem. Normally sequence-dependent stuff like that is called out explicitly in the datasheet. Still, I changed my reads and writes to mimic theirs exactly, and for whatever reason I was still getting the garbage packet in wireshark.</p>
<p dir="auto">I decided at this point to try a different tactic. I believe in writing little tools to help guide development and debugging. This will be things like taking some low-level output, parsing it, and re-presenting it in a higher-level form. I typically write these little tools in python, and take the time to do argument parsing to properly document what comes in and what goes out. In this instance, I wanted to take the SPI capture CSV export coming the Saleae's Logic2 software, parse the bytes, and present a list of register writes and reads, with proper names, formatting, etc. The full tool is just over 200 lines of code, most of which is just a copy-paste of register names/addresses directly from the data sheet. The whole thing took me maybe one hour to put together.</p>
<p dir="auto">I took a capture of the gold-standard Arduino, as well as my garbage-producing implementation, and then passed the CSV data export of both through my tool. Running a simple diff, the problem jumped out immediately. I'll tell you now that this wasn't a glamourous bug, but then most aren't. My W5100 driver code contained a convienience function called <code>w5100_write16(u16 address, u16 value)</code>, which did two 8-bit write commands to two sequential registers. Many of the registers in the W5100 are actually 16-bit values, but the command format only allows for writing 8 bits at a time, so these values are split into high and low part. Long story short: My <code>w5100_write16()</code> function wrote to the same address twice, instead of the writing to <code>address + 1</code> for the second byte. In the processed logs from my tool, this was easy to see. The arduino looked like:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="...
5.3645086 : [w] S0_TX_WR0  [0x0424] 0x00
5.36453178: [w] S0_TX_WR1  [0x0425] 0x3c
..."><pre><code>...
5.3645086 : [w] S0_TX_WR0  [0x0424] 0x00
5.36453178: [w] S0_TX_WR1  [0x0425] 0x3c
...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And mine:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="8.45262964: [w] S0_TX_WR0  [0x0424] 0x00
8.45286726: [w] S0_TX_WR0  [0x0424] 0x3c"><pre><code>8.45262964: [w] S0_TX_WR0  [0x0424] 0x00
8.45286726: [w] S0_TX_WR0  [0x0424] 0x3c
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The details aren't important here, but this was a write to the <em>Socket 0 transmit write pointer</em> register. Remember earlier when I was talking about digital logic and state machines and abstractions breaking down etc? Well, this is actually another example of that, in a way. The W5100 expects you to read this 16 bit register (in order!), write bytes into TX memory, and then write back to this register with the new write pointer, and finally issue a socket command to <em>send</em>. By not writing the transmit write pointer in the correct order (in fact, not writing the second byte at all), and then issuing the send, I had put the chip into yet another weird and undefined state where it just did some random stuff. And of course, no errors, no stack traces - just weird effects.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/francisrstokes/githublog/blob/main/assets/w5100-project/first-actual-packet.png"><img src="https://github.com/francisrstokes/githublog/raw/main/assets/w5100-project/first-actual-packet.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I fixed the function, and my test packet showed up in full glory in wireshark. To say I was happy to see it would be an understatement.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The moral of the story?</h2><a id="user-content-the-moral-of-the-story" aria-label="Permalink: The moral of the story?" href="#the-moral-of-the-story"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">So I sent an ethernet packet. Not exactly the worlds biggest achievement when you realise how many of those are whizzing around in cables, passing through your body in the form of 2.4GHz radio waves right now, but certainly one that I was happy to call a win.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sometimes it's just fun to take the time to recount the numerous and often stupid bugs you encounter while working on a pet project - I know I love reading that from others, at least. But if I had any kind of point, it would probably be that spending the time to do things like write tools and explore the debugging space is pretty much <strong>always worth it.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Strangely, I've found that there is a not-insignificant number of people are <em>against</em> this - especially in a professional environment. I think this has something to do with the JIRA-fication of development process, where all work is divided and sub-divided, and anything that does not directly check a box and produce a deliverable is wasted effort. It's disheartening that there is a whole group of people - developers and managers alike - who do not understand or see the value in <em>exploration as part of the process</em>. Writing a tool is often just as important and impactful as writing a test - more so even, if you don't fully understand the system you're working with yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">Debugging is, at its core, a manifestation of the scientific method; You gather data, make predictions, and test those predictions with experiments. Experiments yield new data, and you update your predictions, and hopefully come out the other side with a proper understanding. Tools like the one I wrote here are kind of akin to making plots of raw data. One good plot can tell you everything you need to know about your data.</p>
<p dir="auto">The project is making more significant progress now, and the new problems and new bugs are coming in at a higher abstraction level, which are more to do with (mis)understanding RFCs, and writing multitasking code than anything else. I might write more on the project at some point, but that'll be for another day.</p>

    <h2>Welcome to the Antarctic Fire Department</h2>
    <p>The Antarctic Fire Department is proudly supporting the advancement of world science
    through	fire/rescue support services on the highest, driest, windiest, coldest, and
    ultimately harshest continent on the planet - Antarctica.</p>
	<p>Based on Ross Island, the AFD provides the United States Antarctic Program 
	with professional emergency services at McMurdo Station, Amundsen-Scott Station,
	and the United States	Air Force airfields.</p>
	<p>Antarctic Fire operations are performed where the most extreme environmental 
	conditions on earth exist - south of 60° lattitude.</p>
    <p>With the extreme temperatures and working conditions, 
	it takes a special person to work in the Antarctic environment 
	as a firefighter. As such, the AFD prides itself on having the most diverse, dedicated, 
	and resilient personnel of any fire department in the world.</p>
    
	<p>The department offers the unique opportunity to
	go where few people have gone before, or ever will go. Antarctica is one of the few 
	places on earth that remain unscathed from permanent human population/presence
	and wields a serene beauty that is beyond words.</p>
	<p>Working in Antarctica is challenging,
	but ultimately rewarding as well. While deployed, firefighters learn vital skills 
	that educate and protect them from the Antarctic environment and also help them 
	understand and preserve the pristine eco-system they work around. </p>  
	<p>Employment opportunities include short and long-term 
	positions ranging from Firefighter/EMT to Firefighter/Medic, line Lieutenant, Shift Captain, 
	and Emergency Dispatcher.</p>  
	<div><p>We welcome and invite	you to look around and 
	learn more about Antarctica, the department, life on "the ice," and the opportunity 
	of a lifetime that awaits you.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>In recent years, standing has been touted as a remedy to a sedentary lifestyle, especially for desk workers who spend long hours seated at their screens.</p><p>But a new study from researchers in Australia and the Netherlands has found standing for long periods of time might not be much better than sitting after all – and actually comes with its own life-threatening risks.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Just under seven years of data from 83,013 adults were collected as part of the UK <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Biobank">Biobank</a>, using wrist-worn devices to track their activity, sleep, and sedentary time. The amount of time individuals spent standing and sitting was matched with incidences of cardiovascular diseases – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease">coronary heart disease</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure">heart failure</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke">stroke</a> – as well as circulatory diseases – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension#Orthostatic_hypotension">low blood pressure on standing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicose_veins">varicose veins</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_venous_insufficiency">chronic venous insufficiency</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_ulcer">venous ulcers</a>.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>The researchers found no association between time spent standing and the risk of cardiovascular disease, suggesting standing desks and similar work postures might not be enough to stave off the health problems <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/around-the-world-people-are-dying-too-soon-because-they-sit-around-too-much">associated with sitting around</a>.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>University of Sydney population health scientist Matthew Ahmadi suggests this might be because many studies in support of standing were based on 'soft endpoints' like improved blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and triglyceride levels.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>His team's investigation, on the other hand, focused on 'hard clinical endpoints' – hospitalizations or death from these diseases – and found that whether people were seated or standing for the long periods of time they spent stationary didn't really make a difference to cardiovascular outcomes.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>"More time spent sitting didn't necessarily lower a person's risk of cardiovascular disease, nor did it increase the risk," Ahmadi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGuIk5KpCCQ">says</a>. "It was a null finding. But what it did do was actually increase their risk of circulatory diseases."</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Standing for more than two hours a day increased that risk by 11 percent for every extra half hour, which is bad news for retail workers and the standing desk industry.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Not that sitting is much better either: beyond 10 hours of daily sitting time, every extra hour spent on your butt increased circulatory disease risk by 26 percent.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>This suggests that a lack of walking or other movement while either sitting <em>or</em> standing could be driving the risk of orthostatic circulatory disease, the authors <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/53/6/dyae136/7822310">write</a>.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Though the study's sample size is unrivaled, it's worth noting that as an observational study the research can't prove that standing or sitting cause any of these diseases. It does, however, add to the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sitting-down-is-so-bad-for-you-even-sleeping-is-better">avalanche of research</a> on the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-12-minutes-of-intense-exercise-is-enough-to-change-biomarkers-in-your-blood">importance</a> of <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/short-bursts-of-activity-lower-your-risk-of-early-death-study-finds">moving your body</a>.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Ahmadi says the real take-home from this research is that standing, by itself, should not be considered a cure-all for the ailments of sedentary, seat-bound lifestyles.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>"Standing needs to be mixed in with other forms of activity that gets the body moving," he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGuIk5KpCCQ">says</a>.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>"We're not seeing the risk of orthostatic diseases… when someone's walking around. We're seeing it mainly when they're standing stationary, standing still, because you get that blood pooling in the lower extremities."</p><p>This research was published in the <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyae136">International Journal of Epidemiology</a>.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>If thinking about Chegg gives you PTSD to the days when you were in school, I might have some good news for you: The company known for textbook rentals and homework help is running on fumes. Chegg’s stock is down a whopping 99% since its highs in 2021, erasing $14.5 billion in value, and the company has lost half a million paid subscribers. After revenue keeps dropping quarter after quarter, there are doubts it will be able to continue paying its debts.</p> <p>Chegg should be familiar to most people who have been to college in recent years. It started out in the 2000s renting out textbooks and later expanded into online study guides, and eventually into a platform with pre-written answers to common homework questions.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the launch of ChatGPT all but annihilated Chegg’s business model. The company for years paid thousands of contractors to write answers to questions across every major subject, which is quite a labor intensive process—and there’s no guarantee they will even have the answer to your question. ChatGPT, on the other hand, has ingested pretty much the entire internet and has likely seen any history question you might throw at it.</p>

 <p>Granted, some of Chegg’s fall can be attributed to a subsiding of the pandemic lockdowns, when learning went virtual and the company needed to produce more answers. But as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2?st=6tw8JN&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">reports</a>, there does seem to be a correlation between the launch of ChatGPT and students dropping their Chegg subscriptions:</p> <blockquote> <p data-type="paragraph">Though Chegg has built its own AI products, the company is struggling to convince customers and investors it still has value in a market upended by ChatGPT.</p> <p data-type="paragraph">“It’s free, it’s instant, and you don’t really have to worry if the problem is there or not,” Jonah Tang, an M.B.A. candidate at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego, said of the advantages of using ChatGPT for homework help over Chegg.</p> <p data-type="paragraph">A survey of college students by investment bank Needham found 30% intended to use Chegg this semester, down from 38% in the spring, and 62% planned to use ChatGPT, up from 43%.</p> </blockquote> <p data-type="paragraph">It’s unclear what Chegg can do to stem the bleeding at this point. The company laid off 441 employees over the summer, a quarter of its workforce. It’s trying to target what the new CEO describes as “curious learners” by offering more comprehensive AI-assisted answers as well as live counseling.</p>

 <p data-type="paragraph">What’s perhaps most sad is that, according to the WSJ, employees actually asked for resources in 2022 to develop AI tools for automating answers in order to address the huge influx in new demand. Chegg’s leaders denied the request to start building AI tools until ChatGPT’s release, but even then some internally weren’t worried because of the chatbot’s propensity to make up incorrect answers.</p> <p data-type="paragraph">But, as with a tool like Wikipedia, students are willing to accept some risk because of the convenience. Students are told not to trust Wikipedia, but most use it anyway and head to the references section to grab citations. Of course, chatbots like ChatGPT have no concept of a subject like math; they’re just guessing the words necessary to make a sentence that sounds right. They will return answers that look <em>deceptively</em> correct but aren’t. It’s like having a calculator that’s right 50% of the time. For subjects like history, chatbots are somewhat better, but answers should be double-checked.</p>

 <p data-type="paragraph">Maybe Chegg could work harder to help people understand this? It seems like most students don’t care, though, or find that ChatGPT is good enough at sending them in the right direction, and the clock is running out for Chegg.</p>
