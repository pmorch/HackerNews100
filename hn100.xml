<p><em><b>Update: June 13, 2024:</b> Today, we are communicating an additional update on the Recall (preview) feature for Copilot+ PCs. Recall will now shift from a preview experience broadly available for Copilot+ PCs on June 18, 2024, to a preview available first in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windowsinsider/">Windows Insider Program (WIP)</a> in the coming weeks. Following receiving feedback on Recall from our Windows Insider Community, as we typically do, we plan to make Recall (preview) available for all Copilot+ PCs coming soon. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We are adjusting the release model for Recall to leverage the expertise of the Windows Insider community to ensure the experience meets our high standards for quality and security. This decision is rooted in our commitment to providing a trusted, secure and robust experience for all customers and to seek additional feedback prior to making the feature available to all Copilot+ PC users. Additionally, as we shared in our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/03/security-above-all-else-expanding-microsofts-secure-future-initiative/">May 3 blog</a>, security is our top priority at Microsoft, in line with our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/resources/secure-future-initiative">Secure Future Initiative (SFI)</a>. This is reflected in additional security protections we are providing for Recall content, including “just in time” decryption protected by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello-enhanced-sign-in-security">Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS)</a>, so Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible when the user authenticates. The development of Copilot+ PCs, Recall and Windows will continue to be guided by SFI.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>When Recall (preview) becomes available in the Windows Insider Program, we will publish a blog post with details on how to get the preview. To try Recall (preview) WIP customers will need a Copilot+ PC due to our <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/copilot-pcs-hardware-requirements-35782169-6eab-4d63-a5c5-c498c3037364">hardware requirements</a>. We look forward to hearing Windows Insider feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Today, we are sharing an update on the Recall (preview) feature for Copilot+ PCs, including more information on the set-up experience, privacy controls and additional details on our approach to security.</p>
<p>On May 20, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/05/20/introducing-copilot-pcs/">we introduced Copilot+ PCs</a>, our fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever. Copilot+ PCs have been reimagined from the inside out to deliver better performance and all new AI experiences to help you be more productive, creative and communicate more effectively. One of the new experiences exclusive to Copilot+ PCs is Recall, a new way to instantly find something you’ve previously seen on your PC. To create an explorable visual timeline, Recall periodically takes a snapshot of what appears on your screen. These images are encrypted, stored and analyzed locally, using on-device AI capabilities to understand their context. When logged into your Copilot+ PC, you can easily <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c">retrace your steps</a> visually using Recall to find things from apps, websites, images and documents that you’ve seen, operating like your own virtual and completely private “photographic memory.” You are always in control of what’s saved. You can disable saving snapshots, pause temporarily, filter applications and delete your snapshots at any time.</p>
<p>As AI becomes more prevalent, we are rearchitecting Windows to give customers and developers more choice to leverage both the cloud and the power of local processing on the device made possible by the neural processing unit (NPU). This distributed computing model offers choice for both privacy and security. All of this work will continue to be guided by our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/resources/secure-future-initiative">Secure Future Initiative (SFI)</a>.</p>
<p>Our team is driven by a relentless desire to empower people through the transformative potential of AI and we see great utility in Recall and the problem it can solve. We also know for people to get the full value out of experiences like Recall, they have to trust it. That’s why we are launching Recall in preview on Copilot+ PCs – to give customers a choice to engage with <span data-contrast="auto">the feature</span><span data-contrast="auto"> early, or not, and to give </span>us an opportunity to learn from the types of <span data-ccp-parastyle="paragraph">real world</span><span data-ccp-parastyle="paragraph"> scenario</span>s customers and the Windows community finds most useful.</p>
<h3><strong>Listening to and acting on customer feedback</strong></h3>
<p>Even before making Recall available to customers, we have heard a clear signal that we can make it easier for people to choose to enable Recall on their Copilot+ PC and improve privacy and security safeguards. With that in mind we are announcing updates that will go into effect before Recall (preview) ships to customers on June 18.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we are updating the set-up experience of Copilot+ PCs to give people a clearer choice to opt-in to saving snapshots using Recall. If you don’t proactively choose to turn it on, it will be off by default.<br>
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2024/06/OOBEAsset_1920-1024x649.png" alt="Recall user interface" width="1024" height="649"></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Second, Windows Hello enrollment is required to enable Recall. In addition, proof of presence is also required to view your timeline and search in Recall.<br>
<img decoding="async" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2024/06/Hello-1920-1024x581.png" alt="Windows Hello user interface" width="1024" height="581"></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Third, we are adding additional layers of data protection including “just in time” decryption protected by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello-enhanced-sign-in-security">Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS)</a> so Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible when the user authenticates. In addition, we encrypted the search index database.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Secure by design and secure by default</strong></h3>
<p>In line with Microsoft’s SFI principles, before the preview release of Recall to customers, we are taking steps to increase data protection. Copilot+ PCs will launch with “just in time” decryption protected by Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS), so Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible when the user authenticates. This gives an additional layer of protection to Recall data in addition to other default enabled Window Security features like SmartScreen and Defender which use advanced AI techniques to help prevent malware from accessing data like Recall.</p>
<p>We also know the best way to secure information on a PC is to secure the whole PC itself. We want to reinforce what has previously been shared from David Weston, vice president of Enterprise and OS Security, about how <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/20/new-windows-11-features-strengthen-security-to-address-evolving-cyberthreat-landscape/">Copilot+ PCs have been designed to be secure by default</a> and share additional details about our security approach. Some notable examples of security enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Copilot+ PCs will be Secured-core PCs, bringing advanced security to both commercial and consumer devices. In addition to the layers of protection in Windows 11, Secured-core PCs provide advanced firmware safeguards and dynamic root-of-trust measurement to help protect from chip to cloud.</li>
<li>Microsoft Pluton security processor will be enabled by default on all Copilot+ PCs. Pluton is a chip-to-cloud security technology – designed by Microsoft and built by silicon partners – with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> principles at the core. This helps protect credentials, identities, personal data and encryption keys, making them significantly harder to remove from the device, even if a user is tricked into installing malware or an attacker has physical possession of the PC.</li>
<li>All Copilot+ PCs will ship with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello-enhanced-sign-in-security">Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS)</a>. This provides more secure biometric sign ins and eliminates the need for a password.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Protecting your privacy on Copilot+ PCs</strong></h3>
<p>In our early internal testing, we have seen different people use Recall in the way that works best for them. Some love the way it makes remembering what they’ve seen across the web so much easier to find than reviewing their browser history. Others like the way it allows them to better review an online course or find a PowerPoint. And people are taking advantage of the controls to exclude apps they don’t want captured in snapshots, from communication apps or Teams calls, or to delete some or all their snapshots. This is why we built Recall with fine-grained controls to allow each person to customize the experience to their comfort level, ensuring your information is protected and that you are in control of when, what and how it is captured.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snapshots are stored locally.</strong> Copilot+ PCs have powerful AI that works on your device itself. No internet or cloud connections are used to store and process snapshots. Recall’s AI processing happens exclusively on your device, and your snapshots are kept safely on your local device only. Your snapshots are yours and they are not used to train the AI on Copilot+ PCs.</li>
<li><strong>Snapshots are not shared.</strong> Recall does not send your snapshots to Microsoft. Snapshots are not shared with any other companies or applications. Recall doesn’t share snapshots with other users who are signed into the same device, and per-user encryption ensures even administrators cannot view other users’ snapshots.</li>
<li><strong>You will know when Recall is saving snapshots.</strong> You’ll see Recall pinned to the taskbar when you reach your desktop. You’ll have a Recall snapshot icon on the system tray letting you know when Windows is saving snapshots.</li>
<li><strong>Digital rights managed or InPrivate browsing snapshots are not saved.</strong> Recall does not save snapshots of digital rights managed content or InPrivate browsing in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy-and-control-over-your-recall-experience-d404f672-7647-41e5-886c-a3c59680af15#:~:text=Privacy%20and%20control%20over%20your%20Recall%20experience%201,stays%20local%204%20Built-in%20security%205%20Related%20articles">supported web browsers</a>.</li>
<li><strong>You can pause, filter and delete what’s saved at any time. </strong>You’re always in control of what’s saved as a snapshot. You can disable saving snapshots, pause them temporarily, filter applications and websites from being in snapshots, and delete your snapshots at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise and customer choice. </strong>For customers using managed work devices, your IT administrator is provided the control to disable the ability to save snapshots. However, your IT administrator cannot enable saving snapshots on your behalf. The choice to enable saving snapshots is solely yours.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Empowering people with experiences they can trust</strong></h3>
<p>We are on a journey to build products and experiences that live up to our company mission to empower people and organizations to achieve more, and are driven by the critical importance of maintaining our customers’ privacy, security and trust. As we always do, we will continue to listen to and learn from our customers, including consumers, developers and enterprises, to evolve our experiences in ways that are meaningful to them.</p>
<p>We are excited for the upcoming launch of Copilot+ PCs on June 18 and for the innovative new features and benefits this entirely new category of PCs will bring. We will continue to build these new capabilities and experiences for our customers by prioritizing privacy, safety and security first. We remain grateful for the vibrant community of customers who continue to share their feedback with us.</p>

<p>The sun is on the verge of a significant event: a magnetic field reversal.&nbsp;</p><p>This phenomenon happens roughly every 11 years and marks an important stage in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/solar-cycle-frequency-prediction-facts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/solar-cycle-frequency-prediction-facts"><u>solar cycle</u></a>.

But what causes this switch in polarity, and is it dangerous? Let's take a deep look at the sun's magnetic field reversal and investigate the effects it could have on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html"><u>Earth</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/giant-sunspot-ar3664-solar-storms-aurora" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/giant-sunspot-ar3664-solar-storms-aurora"><u>How a giant sunspot unleashed solar storms that spawned global auroras that just dazzled us all</u></a></p><p>To understand the magnetic field's reversal, first, it's important to be familiar with the solar cycle. This approximately 11-year cycle of solar activity is driven by the sun's magnetic field and is indicated by the frequency and intensity of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/sunspots-formation-discovery-observations" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/sunspots-formation-discovery-observations"><u>sunspots</u></a> visible on the surface.

Known as the Hale cycle, this magnetic cycle lasts approximately 22 years, through which the sun's magnetic field reverses and then reverts to its original state, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/author/ryan-french" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/author/ryan-french"><u>Ryan French</u></a>, a solar astrophysicist and Space.com contributing writer, told Space.com.&nbsp;</p><p>During solar minimum, the sun's magnetic field is close to a dipole, with one north pole and one south pole, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/earths-magnetic-field-explained" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/earths-magnetic-field-explained"><u>Earth's magnetic field</u></a>. But as we shift toward solar maximum, "the sun's magnetic field becomes more complex, without a clear north-south pole separation," French said. By the time solar maximum passes and solar minimum arrives, the sun has returned to a dipole, albeit with a flipped polarity.&nbsp;</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SQesLi2fRyiUNYk4wTvBaW"><section><p>Sign up to our newsletter for the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!</p></section></div><p>The upcoming switch in polarity will be from the northern to southern magnetic field in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa in the Southern Hemisphere.

This is called Hale's law.&nbsp;</p><p>"The magnetic field from active regions makes its way toward the poles and eventually causes the reversal," solar physicist Todd Hoeksema, director of the Wilcox Solar Observatory at Stanford University, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/22310-sun-magnetic-field-flip-mystery.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/22310-sun-magnetic-field-flip-mystery.html"><u>previously told Space.com</u></a>.</p><p>But the exact underlying cause of such a flip in polarity remains mysterious. "That gets into the whole [solar] cycle, and wondering what that is," Stanford University solar physicist Phil Scherrer previously told Space.com. "We still don't have a really self-consistent mathematical description of what's happening. And until you can model it, you don't really understand it — it's hard to really understand it."</p><p>It really depends on where the magnetic field comes from. "Are there going to be many sunspots? And are the sunspots going to contribute to the magnetic field of the pole, or are they going to kind of cancel locally?" Hoeksema said. "That question we don't yet know how to answer."</p><h2 id="how-quickly-does-the-switch-occur-xa0-3">How quickly does the switch occur?&nbsp;</h2><p>What we do know is that the solar magnetic field flip is not instantaneous. It's a gradual transition from a dipole to a complex magnetic field, to a reversed dipole over the entire 11-year solar cycle. "In short, there is no specific 'moment' in which the sun's poles flip," French said. "It's not like the Earth, where the flip is measured by the migration of the North/South pole."&nbsp;</p><p>It generally takes a year or two for a complete reversal, but it can vary significantly. For example, the north polar field of Solar Cycle 24, which ended in December 2019, took nearly five years to reverse, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nso.edu/blog/polar-magnetic-field-reversal" target="_blank" data-url="https://nso.edu/blog/polar-magnetic-field-reversal" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>National Solar Observatory</u></a>.</p><p>The magnetic field flip is so gradual, you won't even notice when it happens. And no, however dramatic it might sound, it is not the sign of an impending apocalypse.

It’s similar to learning TypeScript. It’s worth it.</p></div><div><div><h3>Different programming style</h3></div><p>To ensure a high level of type-safety, composabilty and tree-shakability, Effect's programming style might be different from what you're used to.</p></div><div><div><h3>Extensive API surface</h3></div><p>Effect has an API for every situation. While it may take some time to learn them all, a handful of the most common ones will get you a long way.</p></div></div></div><section><div><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><div><div><h3>Can I incrementally adopt Effect?</h3><p>Yes! Adopting Effect you can start by refactoring small portions of your app, usually the ones with higher complexity, and keep going as you see fit</p></div><div><h3>Does Effect scale?</h3><p>Effect was built for production since the very beginning, we take good care of making everything as performant as possible, by providing you with better ways to deal with concurrency and great observability finding bottlenecks in your program becomes easy</p></div><div><h3>Do I have to know functional programming?</h3><p>No! While Effect makes usage of Functional Programming principles and patterns internally you can be proficient in Effect by simply using it as a smart Promise and forget that there is even a thing called Functional Programming</p></div><div><h3>The library is huge, do I have to know it all?</h3><p>No! Every module in Effect is made with a specific problem in mind that is deemed to be common enough but you don't need to know everything, in fact you can harness 80% of the productivity gain by just learning a few functions and 2-3 core modules.</p></div><div><h3>What's the minimum bundle size?</h3><p>The core of Effect is a runtime system that weights about 15k when compressed and tree-shaken, the rest scales with usage. If you end up using 100k of Effect code there is a good chance your app would have been 1Mb if not using Effect</p></div><div><h3>Any more questions?</h3><p>Feel free to reach out in our Discord

<h4>⚡️ TLDR: Assuming 100% utilization of your model <code dir="ltr">Llama-3 8B-Instruct</code> model costs about $17 dollars per 1M tokens when self hosting with EKS, vs ChatGPT with the same workload can offer $1 per 1M tokens.

<p>A question we often get is how do you scale with ChatGPT. One thing we wanted to try is to determine the cost of self hosting an open model such as Llama-3.</p>
<br>
<h5>Determining the best hardware<a href="#determining-the-best-hardware" id="determining-the-best-hardware" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h5>
<p><em>Context</em>: All tests were run on a EKS cluster. Each test was allocated the resources of the entire node, nothing else was running on that node other than system pods (prometheus, nvidia-daemon, etc.)</p>
<p>We first wanted to start small, can we run it on a single Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU? I started with AWS’s <code dir="ltr">g4dn.2xlarge</code> instance. Its specs were as follows (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">source<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>1 NVidia Tesla T4</li>
<li>32GB Memory.</li>
<li>8 vCPUs</li>
</ul>
<p>The short answer is that running either the 8B param or the 70B param version of Llama 3 did not work on this hardware. We initially tried the 70B param version of Llama 3 and constantly ran into OOM issues.
We then sobered up and tried the 8B param version. Although this time we was able to get a response, generating the response took what felt like ~10 minutes. I checked <code dir="ltr">nvidia-smi</code> and the single GPU was being used, it just wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>For context 8B vs 70B refers to the parameters in the model and generally translate to performance of the model. The advantage of the 8B param is its small size and resource footprint.</p>
<img src="https://blog.lytix.co/posts/self-hosting-llama-3/cuda-oom.png" alt="CUDA OOM">
<p>So I decided to switch to the <code dir="ltr">g4dn.16xlarge</code> instance type. The specs of that were as follows (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">source<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>4 NVidia Tesla T4s</li>
<li>192gb memory</li>
<li>48 vCPUs</li>
</ul>
<h5>Initial Implementation<a href="#initial-implementation" id="initial-implementation" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h5>
<p>My initial implementation involved trying to copy and paste the code present on the llama-3 hugging face (<a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">see<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>)</p>

<p>These results seemed a lot more promising as the response time lowered from ~10m to sub 10 seconds consistently.</p>
<img src="https://blog.lytix.co/posts/self-hosting-llama-3/inital-implementation-results.png" alt="Initial Implementation Results">
<p>I was able to get a response in a much more reasonable 5-7 seconds. At this point I wanted to start calculating the cost of this request.</p>
<p><code dir="ltr">g5dn.12xlarge</code> costs $3.912 per hour on demand (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">see<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>).</p>
<p>If we assume a full month of use, that costs:</p>

<p>I had trouble with getting the token count in hugging face so ended up using <a href="https://belladoreai.github.io/llama-tokenizer-js/example-demo/build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">llama-tokenizer-js<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> to get an approximation of tokens used.</p>
<img src="https://blog.lytix.co/posts/self-hosting-llama-3/llama-3-tokenizer-js.png" alt="Llama-3 Tokenizer JS">
<p><em><em>Note: This ended up being incorrect way of calculating the tokens used.</em></em></p>
<p>If we look at this result, we assume we used 39 tokens over ~6 seconds. Assuming Im processing tokens 24/7, extrapolating that we get:</p>

<p>With 6.5 tokens per second, over the month I can process:</p>

<p>With 16,848,000 tokens per month, every million tokens costs:</p>

<p>😵Yikes. It is not looking good. Lets compare this to what ChatGPT 3.5 can get us.</p>
<p>Looking at their <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pricing<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>, ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo charges $0.5 per 1M input token, and $1.5 per 1M output token. For sake of simplicity, assuming an average input:output ratio, that means per 1M tokens they charge $1 and thats the number to beat. Far from my $167.17.</p>
<h5>Realization Something Was Wrong<a href="#realization-something-was-wrong" id="realization-something-was-wrong" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h5>
<p>At this point I felt I was doing something wrong. Llama 3 with 8B params is hard to run, but I didn’t feel it should be this hard, especially considering I have 4 GPUs available 🤔.</p>
<p>I decided to try to use vLLM to host an API server instead of attempting to do it myself via hugging face libraries.</p>
<p>This was dead simple and just involved me installing <code dir="ltr">ray</code> and <code dir="ltr">vllm</code> via <code dir="ltr">pip3</code> and then changing my docker entry point to:</p>

<p>Specifically noting that I call <code dir="ltr">—tensor-parallel-size 4</code> to enforce that we use all 4 GPUs.</p>
<p>Using this got <em>significantly</em> better results.</p>
<img src="https://blog.lytix.co/posts/self-hosting-llama-3/significantly-better-results.png" alt="Llama-3 Tokenizer JS">
<p>In this example you can see the query took 2044ms to complete. This was also the time I realized my previous method of calculating token usage was incorrect. vLLM returned the tokens used which was perfect.</p>
<p>Going back to cost, now we can calculate tokens per second:</p>

<p>Again assuming I produce tokens 24/7, this means that I can ingest a total of:</p>

<p>Which means the cost per 1 million tokens would cost me:</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is still not below the value that ChatGPT offers, you’d lose about $17 a day 😭</p>
<h5>An Unconventional Approach<a href="#an-unconventional-approach" id="an-unconventional-approach" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h5>
<p>Instead of using AWS another approach involves self hosting the hardware as well. Even after factoring in energy, this does dramatically lower the price.</p>
<p>Assuming we want to mirror our setup in AWS, we’d need 4xNVidia Tesla T4s. You can buy them for about $700 dollars on eBay</p>
<img src="https://blog.lytix.co/posts/self-hosting-llama-3/ebay-listing.png" alt="Ebay Listing">
<p>Add in $1,000 to setup the rest of the rig and you have a final price of around:</p>

<p>If we calculate energy for this, we get about ~$50 bucks. I determined power consumption by 70W per GPU + 20W overhead:</p>
<img src="https://blog.lytix.co/posts/self-hosting-llama-3/energy-cost.png" alt="Energy Cost">
<p>After factoring in the ~$3,800 fixed cost, you have a monthly cost of ~$50 bucks, lets round up to ~$100 to factor any misc items we might have missed.</p>
<p>Re-calculating our cost per 1M tokens now:</p>

<p>Which is <strong>significantly</strong> cheaper than our ChatGPT costs.</p>
<p>Trying to determine when you’d break even, assuming you want to produce 157,075,200 tokens with ChatGPT, you’re looking at a bill of:</p>

<p>You have a fixed cost of ~$100 a month, which results in a ‘profit’ of $57. To make up your initial server cost of $3,800, you’d need about 66 months or 5.5 years to benefit from this approach.</p>
<p>Although this approach does come with negatives such as having to manage and scale your own hardware, it does seem to be possible to undercut the prices that ChatGPT offer by a significant amount in theory. In pracitice however, you'd have to evaluate how often you are utilizing your LLM, these hypotheticals all assume 100% utilization which is not realistic and would have to be tailord per use case.</p><small><time>2024</time> © lytix.ai.</small></article></div></div>]]></description>

The legislation, which was passed by Japan's upper house and will be enforced following Cabinet approval within the next eighteen months, seeks to curb the dominance of major tech firms like Apple in the smartphone market.</p>
<p>The law requires Apple to make several significant changes to its business practices. The company will have to permit third-party app stores on its devices, just like it does in the EU. App developers will be allowed to use third-party payment services. There are also provisions to allow users to change default settings via new choice screens during setup, such as for selecting a default browser.</p>
<p>Apple will be forbidden from giving its own services preferential treatment in search results without a justifiable reason. The law also prohibits the use of data acquired about competing software to benefit its own apps. Additionally, the law requires that third-party developers have access to the same features as Apple's own apps and services, such as NFC for contactless payments.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with these new regulations could lead to fines amounting to 20 percent of relevant turnover, with the figure increasing to 30 percent for repeat offenses. In a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177599/apple-google-japan-law-third-party-app-stores-competition"><em>The Verge</em></a>, Apple said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Japanese government made a number of changes to the legislation that will help protect user privacy, data security, innovation, and our intellectual property. We will continue our engagement with the JFTC during the implementation period as we remain concerned about how the law will impact Japanese consumers and the secure and private iPhone experience our users have come to expect.</p></blockquote>
<p>The law is expected to be fully implemented by the end of 2025. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> has already announced plans to bring Fortnite and its game store platform to iOS in Japan by late 2025.</p>
<p>Japan's move follows a trend of international legislative efforts aimed at regulating the dominance of major tech companies. The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the UK's Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill are similar initiatives designed to foster competition and prevent monopolistic practices. Various antitrust cases in the United States are also targeting similar issues.</p>

One such pattern is the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02122-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02122-4" data-track-category="body text link">sharp-wave</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02122-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02122-4" data-track-category="body text link"> ripple</a>, in which a large group of neurons fire with extreme synchrony, then a second large group of neurons does the same and so on, one after the other at a particular tempo. These ripples occur in a brain area called the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02211-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02211-5" data-track-category="body text link">hippocampus, which is key to memory formation</a>. The patterns are thought to facilitate communication with the neocortex, where long-term memories are later stored.</p><p>One clue to their function is that some of these ripples are accelerated re-runs of brain-activity patterns that occurred during past events.

 </article><p>Previous research<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> found that, when these ripples were disturbed, mice struggled on a memory test. And when the ripples were prolonged, their performance on the same test improved<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>, leading György Buzsáki, a systems neuroscientist at NYU Langone Health in New York City, who has been researching these bursts since the 1980s, to call the ripples a ‘cognitive biomarker’ for memory and learning.</p><p>Researchers also noticed<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup> that sharp-wave ripples tend to occur during deep sleep as well as during waking hours, and that those bursts during slumber seem to be particularly important for transforming short-term knowledge into long-term memories<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>. These links between the ripples, sleep and memory are well-documented, but there have been few studies that have directly manipulated sleep to determine how it affects these ripples, and in turn memory, Diba says.</p><h2>Wake-up call</h2><p>To understand how poor sleep affects memory, Diba and his colleagues recorded hippocampal activity in seven rats as they explored mazes over the course of several weeks. The researchers regularly disrupted the sleep of some of the animals and let others sleep at will.</p><p>To Diba’s surprise, rats that were woken up repeatedly had similar, or even higher, levels of sharp-wave-ripple activity than the rodents that got normal sleep did. But the firing of the ripples was weaker and less organized, showing a marked decrease in repetition of previous firing patterns. After the sleep-deprived animals recovered over the course of two days, re-creation of previous neural patterns rebounded, but never reached levels found in those which had normal sleep.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>This study makes clear that “memories continue to be processed after they’re experienced, and that post-experience processing is really important”, Frank says. He adds that it could explain why cramming before an exam or pulling an all-nighter might be an ineffective strategy.</p><p>It also teaches researchers an important lesson: the content of sharp-wave ripples is more important than its quantity, given that rats that got normal sleep and rats that were sleep-deprived had a similar number of ripples, he says.</p><h2>Ripple effects</h2><p>Buzsáki says that these findings square with data his group published in March<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup> that found that sharp-wave ripples that occur while an animal is awake might help to select which experiences enter long-term memory.</p><p>It’s possible, he says, that the disorganized sharp-wave ripples of sleep-deprived rats don’t allow them to effectively flag experiences for long-term memory. As a result, the animals might be unable to replay the neural firing of those experiences at a later time.</p><p>This means that sleep disruption could be used to prevent memories from entering long-term storage, which could be useful for people who have recently experienced something traumatic, such as those with post-traumatic stress disorder, Buzsáki says.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>H.264 is a video compression codec standard. It is ubiquitous - internet video, Blu-ray, phones, security cameras, drones, everything. Everything uses H.264 now.</p>
<p>H.264 is a remarkable piece of technology. It is the result of 30+ years of work with one single goal: To reduce the bandwidth required for transmission of full-motion video.</p>
<p>Technically, it is very interesting. This post will give insight into some of the details at a high level - I hope to not bore you too much with the intricacies. Also note that many of the concepts explained here apply to video compression in general, and not just H.264.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why even compress anything?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple uncompressed video file will contain an array of 2D buffers containing pixel data for each frame. So it's a 3D (2 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal) array of bytes. Each pixel takes 3 bytes to store - one byte each for the three primary colors (red, green and blue).</p>
<p>1080p @ 60 Hz = 1920x1080x60x3 =&gt; ~<strong>370 MB/sec</strong> of raw data.</p>
<p>This is next to impossible to deal with. A 50GB Blu-ray disk will only hold ~2 mins. You can't move it anywhere fast. Even SSDs have trouble dumping this straight from RAM to Disk[^1].</p>
<p>So yeah. We need compression.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why <em>H.264</em> compression?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I will answer this. But first let me show you something. Here is the Apple Homepage:</p>
<p><img src="https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/HomePage.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>I captured the screen of this home page and produced two files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/outputFrame.png">PNG screenshot of the Apple homepage</a> <strong>1015KB</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sidbala-blog/VideoH264.mp4?ref=sidbala.com">5 Second 60fps H.264 video of the same Apple homepage</a> <strong>175KB</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Eh. What? Those file sizes look switched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, they're right. The H.264 video, 300 frames long is 175KB. A single frame of that video in PNG is 1015KB.</p>
<p>It looks like we're storing 300 times the amount of data in the video. But the file size is a fifth. So H.264 would seem to be 1500x as efficient as PNG.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is this even possible? All right, what's the trick?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are very many tricks! H.264 uses all the tricks you can think of (and tons you can't think of). Let's go through the important ones.</p>
<h6 id="sheddingweight">Shedding weight</h6>
<p>Imagine you're building a car for street racing. You need to go faster. What is the first thing you do? You shed some weight. Your car weighs 3000 lbs. You throw away stuff you don't need. Those back seats? pfft. Chuck those. That subwoofer? Gone. No music for you. Air Conditioning? Yeah, ditch it. Transmission? Ye..no. Wait! We're gonna need that.</p>
<p>You remove everything except the things that matter.</p>
<p>This concept of throwing away bits you don't need to save space is called <strong>lossy</strong> compression. H.264 is a lossy codec - it throws away less important bits and only keeps the important bits.</p>
<p>PNG is a <strong>lossless</strong> codec. It means that nothing is thrown away. Bit for bit, the original source image can be recovered from a PNG encoded image.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Important bits? How does the algorithm know what bits in my frame are important?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are few obvious ways to trim out images. Maybe the top right quadrant is useless all the time. So maybe we can zero out those pixels and discard that quadrant. We would use only 3/4th of the space we need. ~2200 lbs now. Or maybe we can crop out a thick border around the edges of the frame, the important stuff is in the middle anyway. Yes, you could do these. But H.264 doesn't do this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does H.264 actually do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>H.264, like other lossy image algorithms, discards detail information. Here is a close-up of the original compared with the image post-discard.</p>
<p><img src="https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/CompressedImage-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>See how the compressed one does not show the holes in the speaker grills in the MacBook Pro? If you don't zoom in, you would even notice the difference. The image on the right weighs in at <strong>7%</strong> the size of the original - and we haven't even compressed the image in the traditional sense. Imagine your car weighed just 200 lbs!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7% wow! How do you discard detail information like that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this we need a quick math lesson.</p>
<h6 id="informationentropy">Information Entropy</h6>
<p>Now we're getting to the juicy bits! Ha puns! If you took an information theory class, you might remember information entropy. Information entropy is the number of bits required to represent some information. Note that it is not simply the size of some dataset. It is minimum number of bits that must be used to represent all the information contained in a dataset.</p>
<p>For example, if your dataset is the result of a single coin toss, you need 1 bit of entropy. If you have record two coin tosses, you'll need 2 bits. Makes sense?</p>
<p>Suppose you have some strange coin - you've tossed it 10 times, and every time it lands on heads. How would you describe this information to someone? You wouldn't say HHHHHHHHH. You would just say "10 tosses, all heads" - bam! You've just compressed some data! Easy. I saved you hours of mindfuck lectures. This is obviously an oversimplification, but you've transformed some data into another shorter representation of the same information. You've reduced data <strong>redundancy</strong>. The information entropy in this dataset has not changed - you've just converted between representations. This type of encoder is called an <strong>entropy encoder</strong> - it's a general-purpose lossless encoder that works for any type of data.</p>
<h6 id="frequencydomain">Frequency Domain</h6>
<p>Now that you understand information entropy, let's move on to transformations of data. You can represent data in some fundamental units. If you use binary, you have 0 and 1. If you use hex, you have 16 characters. You can easily transform between the two systems. They are essentially equivalent. So far so good? Ok!</p>
<p>Now, some imagination! Imagine you can transform any dataset that varies over space(or time) - something like the brightness value of an image, into a different coordinate space. So instead of x-y coordinates, let's say we have frequency coordinates. freqX and freqY are the axes now. This is called a <strong>frequency domain</strong> representation. There is another mindfuck mathematical theorem[^2] that states that you can do this for any data and you can achieve a perfect lossless transformation as long as freqX and freqY are high enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, but what the freq are freqX and freqY?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>freqX and freqY are some other set of basis units. Just like when we switch from binary to hex, we have a different fundamental unit, we're switching from the familiar X-Y to freqX and freqY. Hex 'A' looks different from binary '1010'. Both mean the same thing, but <strong>look</strong> different. So here is what our image looks like in the frequency domain:</p>
<p><img src="https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/BasicFFT-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The fine grill on that MacBook pro has a high information content in the higher frequency components of that image. Finely varying content = high frequency components. Any sort of gradual variation in the color and brightness - such as gradients are low frequency components of that image. Anything in between falls in between. So fine details = high freq. Gentle gradients = low freq. Makes sense?</p>
<p>In the frequency domain representation, the low frequency components are near the center of that image. The higher frequency components are towards of the edges of the image.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay. Kinda makes sense. But why do all this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because now, you can take that frequency domain image and then mask out the edges - discard information which will contain the information with high frequency components. Now if you convert back to your regular x-y coordinates, you'll find that the resulting image looks similar to the original but has lost some of the fine details. But now, the image only occupies a fraction of the space. By controlling how big your mask is, you can now tune precisely how detailed you want your output images to be.</p>
<p>Here is the close-up of the laptop in the home page again. Except now, there is a circular border mask that's been applied.</p>
<p><img src="https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/QuantizationHorizontalWithMasks-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The numbers represent the information entropy of that image as a fraction of the original. Even at 2%, you won't notice the difference unless you're at this zoom level. 2%! - your car now weighs 60 lbs!</p>
<p>So that's how you shed weight. This process in lossy compression is called <strong>quantization</strong>[^3].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay. Impressive, I guess. What else you got?</p>
</blockquote>
<h6 id="chromasubsampling">Chroma Subsampling.</h6>
<p>The human/eye brain system is not very good at resolving finer details in color. It can detect minor variations in brightness very easily but not color. So there must be some way to discard color information to shed even more weight.</p>
<p>In a TV signal, R+G+B color data gets transformed to Y+Cb+Cr. The Y is the luminance (essentially black and white brightness) and the Cb and Cr are the chrominance (color) components. RGB and YCbCr are equivalent in terms of information entropy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why unnecessarily complicate? RGB not good enough for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back before we had color TV, we only had the Y signal. And when color TVs just started coming along, engineers had to figure out a way to transmit RGB color along with Y. Instead of using two separate data streams, they wisely decided to encode the color information into Cb and Cr and transmit that along with the Y information. That way, BW TVs would only look at the Y component. Color TVs will, in addition, look at the chrominance components and convert to RGB internally.</p>
<p>But check out the trick: the Y component gets encoded at full resolution. The C components only at a quarter resolution. Since the eye/brain is terrible at detecting color variations, you can get away with this. By doing this, you reduce total bandwidth by one half, with very little visual difference. Half! Your car now weighs 30 lbs!</p>
<p>This process of discarding some of the color information is called <strong>Chroma Subsampling</strong>[^4]. While not specific to H.264 and has been around for decades itself, it is used almost universally.</p>
<p>Those are the big weight shedders for lossy compression. Our frames are now tiny - since we discarded most of the detail information and half of the color information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait. That's it? Can we do something more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Weight shedding is only the first step. So far we're only looking at the spatial domains within a single frame. Now it's time to explore temporal compression - where we look at a group of frames across time.</p>
<h6 id="motioncompensation">Motion compensation</h6>
<p>H.264 is a motion compensation compression standard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Motion compensation? What now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine you're watching a tennis match. The camera is fixed at a certain angle. The only thing moving is the ball back and forth. How would you encode this information? You do what you always do, right? You have a 3D array of pixels, two dimensions in space and one in time. Right?</p>
<p>Nah. Why would you? Most of the image is the same anyway. The court, the net, the crowds, all are static. The only real action is the ball moving. What if you could just have one static image of everything in the background, and then one moving image of just the ball? Wouldn't that save a lot of space? You see where I am going with this? Get it? See where I am going? Motion estimation?</p>
<p>Lame jokes aside, this is exactly what H.264 does. H.264 splits up the image into macro-blocks - typically 16x16 pixel blocks that it will use for motion estimation. It encodes one static image - typically called an <strong>I-frame</strong>(Intra frame). This is a full frame - containing all the bits it required to construct that frame. And then subsequent frames are either <strong>P-frames</strong>(predicted) or <strong>B-frames</strong>(bi-directionally predicted). P-frames are frames that will encode a motion vector for each of the macro-blocks from the previous frame. So a P-frame has to be constructed by the decoder based on previous frames. It starts with the last I-frame in the video stream and then walks through every subsequent frame - adding up the motion vector deltas as it goes along until it arrives at the current frame.</p>
<p>B-frames are even more interesting, where the prediction happens bi-directionally, both from past frames and from future frames. So you can imagine now why that Apple home page video is so well compressed. Because it's really just three I-frames in which the macro blocks are being panned around.</p>
<p>Let's say you've been playing a video on YouTube. You missed the last few seconds of dialog, so you scrub back a few seconds. Have you noticed that it doesn't instantly start playing from that timecode you just selected. It pauses for a few moments and then plays. It's already buffered those frames from the network, since you just played it, so why that pause?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah that annoys the shit out of me. Why does it do that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because you've asked the decoder to jump to some arbitrary frame, the decoder has to redo all the calculations - starting from the nearest I-frames and adding up the motion vector deltas to the frame you're on - and this is computationally expensive, and hence the brief pause. Hopefully you'll be less annoyed now, knowing it's actually doing hard work and not just sitting around just to annoy you.</p>
<p>Since you're only encoding motion vectors deltas, this technique is extremely space-efficient for any video with motion, at the cost of some computation.</p>
<p>Now we've covered both spatial and temporal compression! So far we have a shitton of space saved in Quantization. Chroma subsampling further halved the space required. On top of that, we have motion compensation that stores only 3 actual frames for the ~300 that we had in that video.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looks pretty good to me. Now what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we wrap up and seal the deal. We use a traditional lossless entropy encoder. Because why not? Let's just slap that on there for good measure.</p>
<h6 id="entropycoder">Entropy Coder</h6>
<p>The I-frames, after the lossy steps, contain redundant information. The motion vectors for each of the macro blocks in the P and B-frames - there are entire groups of them with the same values - since several macro blocks move by the same amount when the image pans in our test video.</p>
<p>An entropy encoder will take care of this redundancy. And since it is a general purpose lossless encoder, we don't have to worry about what tradeoffs it's making. We can recover all the data that goes in.</p>
<p>And, we're done! At the core of it, this is how video compression codecs like H.264 work. These are its tricks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok great! But I am curious to know how much our car weighs now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original video was captured at an odd resolution of 1232x1154. If we apply the math here, we get:</p>
<p>5 secs @ 60 fps = 1232x1154x60x3x5 =&gt; <strong>1.2 GB</strong><br>
Compressed video =&gt; <strong>175 KB</strong></p>
<p>If we apply the same ratio to our 3000 lb car, we get <strong>0.4 lbs</strong> as the final weight. 6.5 ounces!</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. It's magic!</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, I am massively oversimplifying several decades of intense research in this field. If you want to know more, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC?ref=sidbala.com">Wikipedia Page</a> is pretty descriptive.</p>

<p dir="auto">Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code. Warp takes
regular Python functions and JIT compiles them to efficient kernel code that can run on the CPU or GPU.</p>
<p dir="auto">Warp is designed for spatial computing and comes with a rich set of primitives that make it easy to write

<p dir="auto">Python version 3.9 or newer is recommended. Warp can run on x86-64 and ARMv8 CPUs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
GPU support requires a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU and driver (minimum GeForce GTX 9xx).</p>
<p dir="auto">The easiest way to install Warp is from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/warp-lang/" rel="nofollow">PyPI</a>:</p>

<p dir="auto">You can also use <code>pip install warp-lang[extras]</code> to install additional dependencies for running examples and USD-related features.</p>
<p dir="auto">The binaries hosted on PyPI are currently built with the CUDA 11.8 runtime.
We provide binaries built with the CUDA 12.5 runtime on the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp/releases">GitHub Releases</a> page.
Copy the URL of the appropriate wheel file (<code>warp-lang-{ver}+cu12-py3-none-{platform}.whl</code>) and pass it to
the <code>pip install</code> command, e.g.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp/releases/download/v1.2.0/warp_lang-1.2.0+cu12-py3-none-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl"><pre><code>pip install https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp/releases/download/v1.2.0/warp_lang-1.2.0+cu12-py3-none-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl

<p dir="auto">The <code>examples</code> directory contains a number of scripts that show how to implement different simulation methods using the Warp API. Most examples will generate USD files containing time-sampled animations (stored in the current working directory).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><blockquote><p>First published March 2013. It’s the single most effective technique I know to grab an audience’s attention. Also it’s easy to execute—write what you want to write, them switch the first two slides/paragraphs/chapters.</p></blockquote><p>[Edit: Jinghao Yan pointed out my hypocrisy. Fixed.]</p><div><p><span>Technical presos need background but background's not engaging. What's a geeky presenter to do?</span></p><p><span>I've been coaching technical presenters lately, and a couple of concepts come up with almost all of them. I figured I'd write them down so I don't necessarily have to explain them all the time. One is to use specifics and data. I'll write that later. This post explains why to start your presentation on the second slide.</span><br><span> </span><br><span>I stole this technique from Lawrence Block's outstanding Telling Lies for Fun and Profit, a book about writing fiction. He suggests drafting a story the "natural" way, with the first chapter introducing the hero and the second getting the action going, then swapping the two chapters. Now the first chapter starts with a gun pointed at the hero's head. By the end, he is teetering on a cliff about to jump into a crocodile-infested river. Just when the tension reaches a peak, we're introduced to the character but we have reason to want to get to know him.</span><br><span> </span><br><span>Technical presentations need to set some context and then present the problem to be solved. When presenters follow this order, though, the resulting presentation starts with information some listeners already know and other listeners don't have any motivation to try to understand. It's like our adventure story where we're not interested in the color of the hero's hair, at least not until he's about to become a croc-snack.</span><br><span> </span><br><span>For example, consider a presentation on optimizing a virtual machine based on just-in-time compilation (hi @kma). The background information introduces JITing, the basics of performance tuning (Pareto), and the architecture of current machines. Shockingly, applying this information in the usual way, by squeezing hot spots, often results in slower overall performance, while seemingly-benign changes can offer significant improvement.</span><br><span> </span><br><span>Applying the chapter swap technique, slide 1 would show a performance profile with a hotspot, a code change that would seem to offer improvement, and data demonstrating that not only didn't the optimization work, it made the system slower. Now we can have slides about jitting, optimization, and architecture. Listeners who already know the background are willing to sit through it to get to the solution to the mystery. Listeners who haven't covered the background are intrigued enough to concentrate.</span><br><span> </span><br><span>Programmers have a pavlovian engineering response. Pose them a problem and they'll start trying to solve it. Give them a chance to co-engineer along with your presentation by making sure the first bite gets their saliva flowing. Then you can explain the rest of the problem and your brilliant solution knowing that they are there along with you.</span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> tl;dr <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/">tracing</a> should exist in every ecosystem, and be broken out of OpenTelemetry.</p>
<p>I regularly complain about OpenTelemetry, so with an aim to be a less useless contributor, today I’m putting pen to paper. If you’re an implementor, I ask you to read this and take away the personal bias you might have towards your work, and instead look objectively at the feedback being given.</p>
<p>First, some context, if you’re clueless how you ended up here, I started Sentry. Sentry, for obvious reasons, has a stake in this “instrument your application” race. That said, with everything I’ve seen, I cannot say OpenTelemetry is the horse I want to put my money on. That’s where this conversation starts.</p>
<p>In 2015 <a href="https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko">Armin</a> and I built a spec for Distributed Tracing. Its not a hard problem, it just requires an immense amount of coordination and effort. At its core its structured events that carry two GUIDs along with them: a trace ID and a parent event ID. It is just building a tree. The harder part is stabilizing those annotations across an infinitely growing ecosystem of applications, libraries, and various services. Around the same time we were working on our spec, the folks at Lightstep were kicking things into gear. They built an open specification called OpenTracing. The goal, as far as I understand it, was to create a standard approach to instrumentation allowing vendors and customers to avoid rewriting instrumentation.</p>
<p>The goal makes sense to both versions of myself: a leader at Sentry and a developer of software.</p>
<p>Along the way OpenTracing became OpenTelemetry, merging with OpenCensus. I dont have a lot of interest in how that decision was made, or what the hypothetical goals were, but I care about the outcomes of the original goal of an open tracing standard. You see, sometime along the way, OpenTelemetry became a much wider reaching specification beyond the tracing goals. It tries to build specifications and SDKs for not only span annotations, but universal transports for logs and metrics, and who knows what else in the future. It is my personal opinion - not that of Sentry’s - that it has lost its way, and is a classic example of the failure of design by committee. Its an example of a lack of vision, and a lack of leadership.</p>
<p>Now I say that not knowing the people involved in the project, so don’t consider this an attack on the quality of their work, their desire to help the ecosystem, or anything of that matter. The way I look at it is its a bunch of individuals and corporations trying to service their own goals, with some degree of overlap. Many of them are vendors doing whatever they can to achieve PmF, begging the OpenTelemetry gods to feed them more data and customers. A lot of others are the outcasts of the Datadogs, looking to bring their instrumentation to another partner who doesn’t want to middle finger them every quarter when the earnings calls come in.</p>
<p>The problem I see it is that OpenTelemetry doesn’t have an end state that we’d all agree upon, and I personally do not believe strategic alignment nor vision are possible without being able to articulate an end state. When OpenTracing started I could <em>envision</em> what that might have been. I could see the problem that was trying to be solved. Now all I see is a standards committee, for something thats not remotely a standard, and I struggle to ever see becoming one. I stated I wanted this to be more than complaining, so I’m going to articulate a problem, a solution, and why OpenTelemetry is failing to live up to the goal I’ve stated above (which may not be their goal, but certainly reflects what our customers want).</p>
<p>Back in the early 2000s if you wanted to reasonably debug performance issues in production systems you were left with two big tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying a vendor or building a centralized APM-like solution</li>
<li>Annotating your code all over the place with span-esque data structures</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem fundamentally came down to the annotations. A lot of them were actually specific to vendor SDKs. None of that instrumentation was portable, well at least not at face value. Realistically a bunch of codemods would easily let you swap out a vendor specific set of annotations with another vendor’s, so it wasn’t as bad as people make it out to be. Fast forward however, and technology has gotten far more complicated. Everyone and their mother is running a shoddy microservice-coupled stack, creating a lot more of a challenge in debugging these production systems. Even outside of performance concerns, something as simple as a stacktrace for an error is often not enough anymore. So we needed something better. We needed the tried and true tracing techniques to become readily available to you and I.</p>
<p>Now from a vendor point of view, nothing really changed. Vendors are still responsible for ensuring that your application is well instrumented. Thats not <em>your</em> problem, at least not entirely. So vendors got together and said, you know what’d be great? We build this set of standards, rope in third parties to implement them, and solve the instrumentation angle once and for all. That’s a great goal, but practically speaking no one has really committed to that. Authors of libraries rarely instrument their code, and the upstream instrumentation (often via monkey patching) looks more or less the same as it has for 20 years.</p>
<p>On top of that, one of the goals is to make it so you, as a developer, have portable instrumentation that goes between vendors. I’m all for this goal, but if you’ve looked at the APIs and specs made available via OpenTelemetry its fairly obvious why adoption is struggling. There are <em>so many concepts</em> you have to master, and even as an experienced developer you’re going to rightly, and quickly, question why some of them are relevant to you. You as a customer almost certainly should only <em>ever</em> need to care about span instrumentation, and in some cases, forwarding baggage (particularly forwarding the trace ID). Everything else is a vendors problem, but the spec is plagued with these concepts that <em>must</em> be considered by <em>anyone</em> implementing span annotations, which is not the vendor.</p>
<p>To take it even further, OpenTelemetry is so far beyond tracing, even though it has yet to achieve traction within that original scope. Its trying to create standards for logging and metrics, neither of which exist in the context of many systems. Logs are just events - which is exactly what a span is, btw - and metrics are just abstractions out of those event properties. That is, you want to know the response time of an API endpoint? You dont rewind 20 years and increment a counter, you instead aggregate the duration of the relevant span segment. Somehow though, Logs and Metrics are still front and center. Feels like BigMonitoring trying to keep relevant personally, but I’m not going to digress on this topic much. What really matters here is one spec has amounted to many specs, so even saying “OpenTelemetry” has no real meaning.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about practicalities. Sentry wants you to have portable instrumentation. Sentry also wants you to have <em>the best data quality possible</em>. The former is pretty easy frankly, so I’m not going to focus on it, but third party instrumentation is where many systems break down. OpenTelemetry, specifically its tracing abstractions, has actually done a really good job in some ecosystems of providing baked-in instrumentation for libraries. Node.js is the one we’re going to focus on today, but its worth noting that while some ecosystems have good implementations of OpenTelemetry, its largely non-existant or sees little adoption.</p>
<p>So going back to our goal of great data quality, Sentry made the decision that we should be <em>compatible</em> with OpenTelemetry. That is, we want to support the effort of great third-party instrumentation, but thats not enough for us. We think there’s inherent value in making <em>everything</em> trace-connected. Yes, spans are great, but you know what else is great? Crash reports, Session replays, and a bunch of other kinds of telemetry that <em>we’ve all yet to realize matters</em>. Those are not spans, and they certainly arent logs or metrics. Our goal is to make that possible, but to do that, we need two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trace propagation</li>
<li>Span instrumentation (which is key to propagation)</li>
</ol>
<p>For a couple years now we’ve been experimenting with how to achieve this, how to support OpenTelemetry users, but without becoming yet another generic vendor who just accepts a log drain of junk data. That’s simply not what we want to be, and its not what we hear our 100,000+ customers needing. So we ended up with our current generation JavaScript SDK, which piggybacks on top of OpenTelemetry, ideally giving you the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is, as a customer, you should be able to do this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="typescript"><code><span><span>import</span><span> { startSpan } </span><span>from</span><span> "</span><span>@opentelemetry/sdk</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> shittyChatBot</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    startSpan</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>some.operation</span><span>"</span><span>, (</span><span>span</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>        doTheThing</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>    });</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>That is, you should be able to use a shared specification to instrument your code for portability, and third party vendors should be able to do the same. We’re in favor of that future.  Unfortunately it has not been going super well, and that is why I’m constantly complaining. I hear the complaints of our customers, I see an outcome they want, and I’m struggling to help them get to it.</p>
<p>We as a vendor have what I would simply describe as courage: we have no fear of solving whatever problem gets in our way. We don’t expect others to do our work for us, we control the ball. That means we’re willing to re-invent all instrumentation if thats what it takes, but we’d prefer not to, and we still want customers to have portability in instrumentation.</p>
<p>In particular, we have an extremely well adopted and powerful SDK, and we want our customers to be able to get both the advantages of our SDK - remember we want everything trace connected, not just whatevers in this design committee - but also not be prevented from adopting OpenTelemetry. That means what we actually want is a way to say “hey OpenTelemetry SDK, give us all the current spans in the buffer”. What we don’t want is to be forced to implement some hopeful-standardized transport protocol that may or may not solve our concerns, let alone one that requires us to adopt legacy infrastructure telemetry like logs and metrics.</p>
<p>So to do that we piggyback on the SDK, trying to use their context resolvers, baggage handlers, and most importantly, the span instrumentation code.</p>
<p>Except it doesn’t work for customers. It doesn’t work for the same reasons a lot of other things don’t work: version conflicts, specification incompatibilities, and generally speaking, code that tries to do too much. This headache also comes in regular conversation. “We’re supporting OpenTelemetry” is immediately confusing as we dont do logs, or traceless-metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Alright, enough complaining, here’s what I’d like to see.</strong></p>
<p>First, we have a tracing-focused SDK that is as lightweight as possible. That means it entirely focuses on giving customers and library authors the ability to instrument their code with span annotations. Not metrics. Not logs. Let that be a different spec’s problem. That API probably continues to look similar to today:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="typescript"><code><span><span>import</span><span> { startSpan } </span><span>from</span><span> "</span><span>tracing</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> shittyChatBot</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    startSpan</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>some.operation</span><span>"</span><span>, (</span><span>span</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>        doTheThing</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>    });</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Second, that code, as much as possible, does not add to your runtime performance or bundle size <em>unless</em> you’ve opted in to a method of collection. That collection should not be a wire protocol, but an application interface. For example, you should still be able to wire up an OpenTelemetry collector as you do today:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="typescript"><code><span><span>import</span><span> { newDomainSpecificCollector } </span><span>from</span><span> "</span><span>@opentelemtry/api</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>newDomainSpecificCollector</span><span>({</span></span>
<span><span>    endpoint</span><span>:</span><span> "</span><span>http://not.sentry/otel-ingest</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>});</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Lastly, all those other non-tracing concerns? Put them whenever you want, but just like the transport protocols, take them out of the core.</p>
<p>If this were to happen, Sentry could then <em>completely ignore</em> the OpenTelemetry wire protocols, collectors, and everything else that frankly doesn’t matter to our customers or our product. That means something would have to be exposed to handle it:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="typescript"><code><span><span>import</span><span> { onSpanFinish } </span><span>from</span><span> "</span><span>tracing</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { collectSpan } </span><span>from</span><span> "</span><span>@sentry/node</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>onSpanFinish.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(collectSpan);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Thats it. Thats my proposal. I’m sure I’m glossing over a bunch of things, but I’m not trying for academic correctness. Consider this feedback to the “OpenTelemetry Head of Product”, from a customer who would love to use and recommend your product, but cannot.</p>
<p>The world I’m describing is a world Sentry would get behind both as an implementor, and as a financier. I’d love to go to our board and tell them we need to alocate $10m in funding to support library authors implementing and maintaining a true standard, one adopted across the board, but today we cannot make that bet. So instead we are continuing to hedge our bet on us having to maintain instrumentation, and the OpenTelemetry committee somehow becoming successful. Maybe thats fine, but it mostly seems like a big distraction that doesnt help our customers.</p>
<p>I want to close with one last point: its ok that people have problems they want to solve, and its ok that they work as a group to solve them, but you’re not going to see adoption of a product if its solving problems that someone doesn’t have. Sentry does not have the problem of “extracting metrics from AWS CloudWatch”, and I would encourage implementors to stop conflating concerns that are not tightly coupled to the problem being addressed.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things OpenTelemetry tries to do, some it does well, but in general is plagued by too many opinions, and too many goals. Maybe bring back OpenTracing?</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>Just months after Neil Armstrong’s historic moonwalk, <a href="https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/">Jim Storer</a>, a Lexington High School student in Massachusetts, wrote the first <a href="https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander.html">Lunar Landing</a> game. By 1973, it <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/_Books/101_BASIC_Computer_Games_Mar75.pdf">had become</a> “by far and away the single most popular computer game.” A simple text game, you pilot a moon lander, aiming for a gentle touch down on the moon. All motion is vertical and you decide every 10 simulated seconds how much fuel to burn.</p>



<p>I recently explored the optimal fuel burn schedule to land as gently as possible and with maximum remaining fuel. Surprisingly, the theoretical best strategy didn’t work. The game falsely thinks the lander doesn’t touch down on the surface when in fact it does. Digging in, I was amazed by the sophisticated physics and numerical computing in the game. Eventually I found a bug: a missing “divide by two” that had seemingly gone unnoticed for nearly 55 years.</p>



<h2>Landing with Maximum Fuel</h2>



<p>To use the least fuel while landing, you need to land in the shortest time possible. Initially you maximize your speed by keeping your engine off, then at the last possible second you burn full throttle, reducing your speed to zero just as you touch the surface. The Kerbal Space Program community calls this a “suicide burn”, since getting the timing right is hard and it leaves no room for error.</p>



<p>With some trial and error and a bit of (manual) binary search, you can find the schedule that just barely has you landing.  You burn nothing for 70 seconds, then 164.31426784 lbs/sec for the next 10 seconds, then the max 200 lbs/sec after that:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="656" data-permalink="https://martincmartin.com/2024/06/14/how-i-found-a-55-year-old-bug-in-the-first-lunar-lander-game/lunarlanderoriginallands/" data-orig-file="https://martincmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lunarlanderoriginallands.png" data-orig-size="1120,694" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="LunarLanderOriginalLands" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://martincmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lunarlanderoriginallands.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://martincmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lunarlanderoriginallands.png?w=640" width="1120" height="694" src="https://martincmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lunarlanderoriginallands.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>The game considers a perfect landing to be less than 1 MPH, but here we land at over 3.5 MPH and are told we “could be better.”  Yet burn even 0.00000001 more lbs/sec, and you miss the surface entirely, ascending at 114 MPH:</p>

<p>How did we go from a hard landing to not landing at all, without a soft landing in between?</p>



<h2>Physics Simulation: One Smart Kid</h2>



<p>I expected to see the simple Euler integration that’s common in video games even today.  That’s where you compute the forces at the start of each time step, then use <em>F=ma</em> to compute the acceleration, then assume the acceleration is constant over a time step of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\Delta t"> seconds:</p>

<p>Because the mass is changing over the timestep, the acceleration will change too, so assuming it’s constant is only approximate.  But surprisingly, Jim used the exact solution, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a>, with a Taylor series expansion for the logarithm. He also used some algebra to simplify it and reduce the amount of round off error.  Very impressive for a high school senior in 1969.  When I asked him about it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I was skilled at calculus at the time and familiar with concepts like a Taylor series, but also my recollection is that my father, who was a physicist, helped me in the derivation of the equations.” – Jim Storer, personal communication</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rocket equation is what gives rise to the suicide burn being optimal, and the five terms he uses of the Taylor series, where the argument is at most 0.1212, makes it accurate to over six decimal places. So that’s not the problem we’re looking for.</p>



<h2>Assumptions Go Out The Window When We Hit The Ground</h2>



<p>The rocket equation works well until you hit the ground. In general, collisions between solid objects is a really hard part of dynamics engines, and what separates the great ones from the good ones, as I discovered when contributing to <a href="https://www.ode.org/">Open Dynamics Engine</a> as a postdoc at MIT.</p>



<p>And this is where the Lunar Landing Game faces its biggest challenge. Imagine the lander descending at the start of a 10-second turn but ascending by the end. Simply verifying that it’s above the surface at both points isn’t enough. It might have dipped below the surface somewhere in between. When this happens, the program has to rewind and examine an earlier moment.</p>



<p>An obvious place is to look at the lowest point of the trajectory, where the velocity is zero. For the rocket equation, it turns out, there’s no closed form expression for that lowest point that involves only basic mathematical functions.<sup data-fn="636f2ae6-d817-49bc-a1ca-6c07b4cee9c6"><a href="#636f2ae6-d817-49bc-a1ca-6c07b4cee9c6" id="636f2ae6-d817-49bc-a1ca-6c07b4cee9c6-link">1</a></sup> So instead, we can use the physicists favourite technique, and take only the first few terms of the Taylor series. If you use only the first two terms of the logarithm, the problem simplifies to a quadratic equation and you can use the good old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula">quadratic formula</a> from high school. And the approximation should be pretty good over the space of a 10 second turn, accurate to within 0.1% or so.</p>



<p>But that’s not what Jim did. His formula has a square root in the denominator, not the numerator. It also had an error 30 times bigger.</p>

<p>What could he possibly be doing? I stared at this for a long time, wracking my brain for any other approach to approximate the bottom of the trajectory that would still only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root. Taking only the first term of the logarithm would give an approximation worse than the quadratic, but wouldn’t involve a square root. Taking a third term and we need to solve a cubic, which in general would need a lot more code and in our case it doesn’t seem to be of any special form that has a simple solution<sup data-fn="809751a5-4c07-42d1-9eb3-892e999bd451"><a href="#809751a5-4c07-42d1-9eb3-892e999bd451" id="809751a5-4c07-42d1-9eb3-892e999bd451-link">2</a></sup>. There are many approximations to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\log(x)">, but the non-Taylor ones involve advanced functions like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Ex&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Ex&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Ex&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="x^x"> that are hard to invert.</p>



<p>Until I looked a little more closely at his square root. It’s of the form:</p>


<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B+%5Cleft%28+%5Cdfrac%7Bb%7D%7B2%7D+%5Cright%29+%5E2+-+a+c%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B+%5Cleft%28+%5Cdfrac%7Bb%7D%7B2%7D+%5Cright%29+%5E2+-+a+c%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B+%5Cleft%28+%5Cdfrac%7Bb%7D%7B2%7D+%5Cright%29+%5E2+-+a+c%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\sqrt{ \left( \dfrac{b}{2} \right) ^2 - a c} "></p>



<p>Which looks a awful lot like the quadratic formula where we’ve divided by 4 inside the square root. It <em>has to</em> be related. But why is it in the denominator? Did he find a quadratic in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="1/t"> ? No, because <em>t</em> can be very close to zero, so his formula would need to be approximated over a wide range of very large values, and a quadratic isn’t good for that. Did he make a quadratic approximation to log, <em>then</em> substitute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3D1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3D1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3D1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="T=1/t">, solve for <em>T</em>, then substitute back? Playing around with that, I re-discovered an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula#Square_root_in_the_denominator">alternate form</a> of the quadratic formula with the square root on the bottom! And indeed, this matches the formula in Jim’s code.</p>



<p>I don’t know why 18 year old Jim was using the alternate form. Perhaps he re-derived the quadratic formula rather than looking it up, and ended up deriving that form. Perhaps he was worried about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_cancellation">catastrophic cancellation</a> and wanted a form where he’d add positive numbers, rather than subtract them.<sup data-fn="2e932716-93ea-4b84-b03e-a6fb66e4764b"><a href="#2e932716-93ea-4b84-b03e-a6fb66e4764b" id="2e932716-93ea-4b84-b03e-a6fb66e4764b-link">3</a></sup></p>



<h2>Let’s Double Check The Derivation</h2>



<p>But if his formula is equivalent, then why is the approximation error 30 times higher? Deriving the formula ourselves, we get:</p>


<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BLet+%7D+W+%5Cequiv+%5Cdfrac%7B1+-+%5Cfrac%7BMG%7D%7BZK%7D%7D%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BLet+%7D+W+%5Cequiv+%5Cdfrac%7B1+-+%5Cfrac%7BMG%7D%7BZK%7D%7D%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BLet+%7D+W+%5Cequiv+%5Cdfrac%7B1+-+%5Cfrac%7BMG%7D%7BZK%7D%7D%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\text{Let } W \equiv \dfrac{1 - \frac{MG}{ZK}}{2}"></p>

<p>Which is identical to Jim’s code, except … he’s missing the 2 in the denominator inside the square root! It was probably a simple error, either when deriving the formula or typing it into the computer.  After all, the computer algebra system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma">MACSYMA</a> had only started a year before, and wouldn’t be available at a high school, so he would have had to do everything using pencil and paper.</p>



<p>With this bug, he consistently <em>under</em>estimates the time to the lowest point. He compensates for this two ways: adding 0.05 sec, and then re-estimating from his new, closer location. And this explains why it misses the time of landing: the first estimate is while the lander is above the surface and still descending, then the second one is after reaching the bottom and ascending again, which takes less than 0.05 sec.</p>



<p>If we add the missing factor of two and remove the 0.05, what happens? Now the best we can do with a suicide burn is:</p>

<p>Our velocity is down to 1.66 MPH, almost three quarters of the way to the perfect landing at 1 MPH.  It’s not perfect because w’re still only using the first two terms of the Taylor series.  Also, once you’ve decided your lowest point is under the surface, you then need to find the time where you first hit the surface, which involves a similar approximation.  Another iteration would help, although with the bug fixed we <em>over</em>estimate the time, so we’d need to go back in time, which might mean we have to pick the other solution to the quadratic. You could simplify that by using only a single term from the Taylor series, and is what’s done in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton’s method</a>. You could then stop when the magnitude of the velocity is below some threshold, and use the altitude there to decide whether or not you landed.  But this is all more work, and the game was fun to play as it is, so why complicate the code?</p>



<p>It’s also possible to land gently, you just need to end your 14th turn with a low altitude and velocity, and then use low thrust in your 15th turn, landing somewhere after 150 seconds.  It’s just the theoretical full-thrust-on-landing suicide burn, that takes around 148 seconds, that eludes us.</p>



<h2>CAPCOM We’re <a href="https://youtu.be/BHIo6qwJarI?t=45s">Go</a> For Powered Descent</h2>



<p>Overall, this is very impressive work for an 18 year hold high school student in 1969 on a PDP-8.  This was long before Computer Science was taught in high school.  The numerical computing aspects, such as iteratively improving the estimate using Newton’s method or worrying about catastrophic cancellation, weren’t well known back then.  I didn’t learn them until I was studying for a Ph.D. in robotics.</p>



<p>It is also surprising that, as far as I can tell, this bug has been there for almost 55 years and nobody has noticed it before.  That’s probably because, even with the bug, it was a fun game, both difficult and possible to land gently.&nbsp; The quest to not just win, but find the optimal strategy, can certainly lead to trying to understand small discrepancies.  I suspect everybody else was just happy to play the game and have fun.</p>

<p>In the conversation about how to protect and improve brain health, exercise is always at the top of the list. This is because consistent research shows that people who move their bodies are at lower risk for brain issues like <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression" title="Psychology Today looks at depression" hreflang="en-US">depression</a> and Alzheimer’s disease. By and large, the focus of this conversation is on walking, jogging, and potentially lower-impact movements like tai chi and yoga. In fact, aerobic exercises like these are more widely prescribed by clinicians. But research shows us we need to consider weightlifting more strongly for our brain health.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll be discussing some of the science backing the idea that weightlifting, or resistance training, can have specific and marked benefits to brain health. To get us started, let’s just explore a few of the studied benefits of weightlifting for brain health.</p>
<ol><li>People who engage in resistance training tend to have better brain health.</li>
<li>Healthy people who start weightlifting can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20101012/">improve</a> their brain function, and this benefit is likely to be more pronounced in the elderly.</li>
<li>People with <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mild-cognitive-impairment" title="Psychology Today looks at cognitive decline" hreflang="en-US">cognitive decline</a> had better <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognition" title="Psychology Today looks at cognition" hreflang="en-US">cognition</a> after starting resistance training.</li>
<li>Resistance training may help <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10745562/">decrease</a> depressive symptoms.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is notable stuff. And to be clear, there is <em>no pharmaceutical</em><strong> </strong>currently on the market that can achieve this combination of benefits. And of course, there’s lots of other research showing the benefit of weight training for almost every other chronic health issue (for example, a recent <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/13/755">meta-analysis</a> in the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em> concluded that “muscle-strengthening activities were inversely associated with the risk of all-cause mortality and major non-communicable diseases including CVD, total cancer, diabetes and lung cancer.”</p>

<p>Personally, I believe this data is more than sufficient to recommend that everyone at least consider adding weights to their exercise routine. But what’s at play here as it relates specifically to the brain benefits? There are at least two major pathways at play.</p>
<p><strong>1. Weight training helps regulate metabolic balance. </strong>Several years ago, researchers at Brown University proposed that Alzheimer’s <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dementia" title="Psychology Today looks at dementia" hreflang="en-US">dementia</a> could be considered “type 3 diabetes,” due to a series of metabolic alterations seen in the brains of people with this condition. Namely, research suggests that as we age, and especially in people with Alzheimer’s disease, there is a drop-off in the brain’s ability to access and use glucose. Additional work shows that people with metabolic dysfunction are at higher risk for developing dementia and depression.</p>

<p>This is serious stuff. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751991821001911">A 2022 meta-analysis</a> found the odds for depression in people with type 2 diabetes to be 77 percent higher than those with normal blood sugar. Similarly, a recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7746331/">Mendelian analysis</a> found that having a higher fasting blood sugar was linked to a higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Mechanistically, there are two major connections between brain health and blood sugar worthy of consideration. First, high variability in blood sugar levels and prolonged high blood sugar may both be damaging to the brain through a host of pathways including inflammation. Second, long-term imbalances in blood sugar may come alongside an issue called <em>insulin resistance</em>, which means that our cells (potentially including our brain cells) have more trouble getting the glucose they need.</p>

<p>What do we know about the specifics of the link between blood sugar balance and resistance training?</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1056872720303664">A single bout</a> of resistance training has been shown to lower glucose and insulin levels for up to 24 and 18 hours, respectively.</li>
<li>Resistance training helps lower 3-month blood sugar (HbA1c) measurements in those at risk for developing type 2 diabetes based on a <a href="https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-021-00321-x">2021 meta-analysis</a>.</li>
<li>Resistance training has been found to improve blood sugar regulation and insulin requirements in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/pregnancy" title="Psychology Today looks at pregnant" hreflang="en-US">pregnant</a> women with gestational diabetes in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266613820302114">2020 meta-analysis</a>.</li>
<li>Resistance training improves insulin sensitivity in the elderly based on a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1728869X21000307">2021</a> meta-analysis published in the <em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-exercise-science-and-fitness" title="Go to Journal of Exercise Science &amp; Fitness on ScienceDirect">Journal of Exercise Science and Fitness</a></em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Weight training helps promote immune balance. </strong>In the wake of the pandemic, more people than ever appreciate the importance of immune health to overall wellness. In addition, there’s been a groundswell of interest around the idea of chronic inflammation as a central driver of disease. One of the most important breakthroughs in research around the benefit of weight training concerns the immune system. Specifically, it relates to molecules called myokines, which are tiny signals produced by muscles that can enter and impact the brain.</p>

<p>While the research around myokines is still pretty new, the overall idea is simple: resistance training alters levels of a host of chemicals produced by the muscles that may have beneficial effects on the brain. Some of the best-studied myokines include brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and irisin. Many of these and other myokines are believed to directly and indirectly affect the brain’s immune system for the better. Notably, BDNF is strongly tied to the process of <em>neuroplasticity</em>, and is known to help strengthen connections between our brain cells and even help us generate new ones.</p>

  </div>

<p>In a more straightforward sense, resistance training has been linked to better immune balance and lower inflammation. For example, people with more muscle mass <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163720303202">tend</a> to have lower levels of inflammation. Similarly, stronger grip and knee extension abilities correlate with lower levels of inflammatory markers.</p>

<h2>The Best Way to Capitalize on the Benefits of Resistance Training</h2>
<p>Like everything else in long-term health promotion, brain health strategies should be designed with the goal of sustainability; that means avoiding injury and creating habits that you’ll enjoy for months to years. Here are some great tips on resistance training for better overall and brain health:</p>

<ul><li>Start light and build your way up. While heavy weights can be great, you can get an excellent workout with lighter weights. Similarly, you don’t have to lift for hours to get brain benefits. Even doing a few minutes of resistance training a day may benefit you.</li>
<li>Consider getting help: If you haven’t done much weight training, consider working with a trainer to learn the ropes and establish a routine that fits your needs</li>
<li>Classes can be great motivators. There’s robust data suggesting that spending time with others boosts the brain, so combining this with weights could be an excellent double benefit to your cognition. This could be anything from a session at your local gym to following along with an online instructor to CrossFit.</li>
<li>Consider resistance bands. Resistance bands are an excellent way to do resistance training anywhere and to customize it to your needs. They’ve been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6383082/">shown</a> to be effective at building muscle, and have been <a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jgs.14526">linked</a> to better mood.</li>
<li>Listen to your body! Having personally injured myself while weight training a number of times, I can’t <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress" title="Psychology Today looks at stress" hreflang="en-US">stress</a> enough the importance of paying <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention" title="Psychology Today looks at attention" hreflang="en-US">attention</a> to your body while you lift and modifying your routine accordingly. If something hurts in a bad way, listen!</li>
<li>Don’t skip the legs! Your legs contain the largest muscles in your body. If you’re looking to get the biggest effect of resistance training, you definitely want to engage your legs. Leg presses, squats, and leg extensions/curls are some of my favorites. </li>
<li>Consider the nutritional aspects. <a href="https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12986-016-0124-8">Research</a> shows that getting adequate protein is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1525861012001788">key</a> to muscle growth. If you’re new to resistance training, you may need to up your protein intake. Ideal protein intake varies by person and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/motivation" title="Psychology Today looks at goals" hreflang="en-US">goals</a>, but some data suggests that we also should be consuming more protein as we age to offset age-related muscle loss. Additionally, there’s good research supporting the role of creatine supplementation for brain and muscle health at around 3-5 grams a day.</li>

Dabei seien Millionen an Geldern geflossen, die aus der sogenannten THG-Quote stammten.  </p><p>„Seit August 2023 gibt es erhebliche Betrugsvorwürfe gegen Klimaschutzprojekte in China, welche zur Anrechnung auf die Treibhausgasminderungsquote genutzt werden“, sagte Daniel Rinkert (SPD) in einem Plenum des Umweltausschusses am Mittwoch. „In der heutigen Sitzung wurde das Thema ausführlich diskutiert und Vorwürfe ausgeräumt.“</p><p>Die Betrugsanschuldigungen bei den Upstream-Emission-Reduction-Projekten – kurz UER-Projekte – seien laut Parlamentarier erheblich und verlangten eine konsequente Aufklärung. Laut Umweltbundesamt stehen aktuell 40 von 60 Projekten in China unter einem Betrugsverdacht. „Das ist Wirtschaftskriminalität im großen Umfang“, sagte Rinkert. „Es ist mehr als offensichtlich, dass bei diesen Projekten keine Kontrolle auf anspruchsvollem Niveau sichergestellt werden kann. Daher wird die Förderung dieser Projekte auch durch die Bundesregierung Ende 2024 eingestellt. Die entsprechende Verordnung wurde am 8. Juni im Kabinett verabschiedet.“</p><h2>Umweltministerium will mit Auswärtigem Amt deutsche Kontrollen in China durchdrücken</h2><p>Das Bundesumweltministerium und das Umweltbundesamt hätten damit „sehr deutlich gemacht“, dass die zuständigen Stellen in Deutschland frühzeitig eine „vollumfängliche Aufklärung“ eingeleitet haben. „In aufwendigen Prüfungsschritten wird seit den ersten aufkommenden Betrugsvorwürfen jedes einzelne Projekt untersucht und überprüft“, betonte Rinkert.&nbsp; Die in diesem Zusammenhang immer wieder vorgebrachten Vorwürfe der Tatenlosigkeit der zuständigen Stellen hätten sich damit als haltlos herausgestellt. „Die Union sollte die Vorwürfe daher nicht wiederholen und Nebelkerzen werfen. Sie sollte vielmehr die Bundesregierung bei der Aufklärung unterstützen“, sagte Rinkert.</p><p>Gemeinsam mit dem Auswärtigen Amt dränge das Umweltministerium nun die chinesische Regierung dazu, eine unabhängige deutsche Kontrollmission in China zuzulassen. Nur dadurch könne ein vollumfänglicher Einblick in die Situation vor Ort gewonnen werden. „Für dieses Vorgehen gibt es die volle Unterstützung der SPD-Bundestagsfraktion“, sagte Rinkert zum Schluss.</p><h2>Millionen-Betrug in China: Haben Konzerne die deutschen Klimaschutzmaßnahmen unterwandert?</h2><p><strong>Erstmeldung vom 11. Juni: </strong>Berlin – Der Image-Schaden für den deutschen Klimaschutz dürfte fast schwerer wiegen, als die verlorenen Milliarden an Euros. Nagelneue Ölförderungsanlagen in China sollen angeblich CO₂ einsparen. Gebaut von internationalen Großkonzernen zur „grüneren“ Gewinnung von Öl. Die Bauvorhaben ermöglicht jeder, der in Deutschland tankt. Denn als Nutzer:in von fossilen Brennstoffen zahlt man beim Tanken Klima-Abgaben über die „Treibhausgasminderungsquote“ – kurz THG-Quote. Das Problem: Wahrscheinlich gibt es diese neuen und sauberen Anlagen in <a href="https://www.merkur.de/politik/china/" title="China" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;China&quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:18,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}">China</a> gar nicht, wie Recherchen von <em>ZDF frontal</em> ergaben. Und anscheinend ist es auch nicht möglich für das Umweltministerium des Bundes, den Betrugsvorwürfen effektiv nachzugehen, wie die <em>Welt</em> berichtet.</p><p>Doch von Anfang an: Verstrickt in den Skandal sind anscheinend mehrere Ölmultis, die die Anlagen angeblich gebaut haben. Die meisten dieser Projekte sollen auf den Öl- und Gasfeldern der Provinz Xinjang entstanden sein. Für die Konzerne ein lukratives Geschäft mit dem Handel von Umwelt-Zertifikaten. Denn für jede eingesparte Tonne Kohlendioxid konnten die Unternehmen bis zu 400 Euro in Deutschland kassieren. Viele Projekte waren nach Recherchen von „ZDF Frontal“ aber nur vorgetäuscht. </p><figure><p><img src="https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBBG.jpg" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBb9.jpg 448w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OB73.jpg 768w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBBG.jpg 1100w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OB7d.jpg 1408w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBPH.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 769px) 768px, 100vw" height="733" width="1100" alt="Eigentlich sollten mit der Umlage Öl- und Gasbohrungen vor allem in China finanziert werden, die umweltfreundlicher als die gewöhnliche Förderung sind.

Zuletzt im April meldete sich ein chinesischer Öl- und Gaskonzern von selbst bei dem von Steffi Lemke (Grüne) geführten Umweltministerium und erklärte deutlich, dass von Betrugsfällen auszugehen ist. „Wir vermuten, dass es eine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit gibt, dass Dokumente gefälscht wurden und wir bitten dringend, dass Ihre Behörde dazu ermittelt“, teilte der chinesische Konzern dem Ministerium mit. Dieses wimmelte wohl ab, wie die <em>Welt</em> berichtet. Deutsche Prüfstellen haben anscheinend einige Daten der Anlagen des chinesischen Unternehmens geändert und ohne dessen Zustimmung verwendet. Das Ziel war, möglichst hohe CO₂-Einsparungen in Deutschland geltend zu machen. Allein in diesem offenbar gefälschten Projekt ging es laut <em>ZDF</em> um eine Million Tonnen Kohlendioxid, die angeblich eingespart wurden – der Marktwert: etwa 180 Millionen Euro.</p><p>Ein weiteres Beispiel: Deutsche Autofahrerinnen und Autofahrer zahlten mit ihrer Klima-Abgabe vermutlich rund 80 Millionen Euro für ein<a href="https://www.fr.de/thema/klima-sti162637/" title="Klima" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Klimaschutzprojekt&quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:25,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}"> Klimaschutzprojekt</a> in der chinesischen Provinz der unterdrückten Uiguren. Am Ende stand dort laut <em>Welt</em> lediglich ein Hühnerstall. Recherchen deutscher Bioenergie-Unternehmen bestätigten den Vorfall.</p><p>Es existieren wohl mindestens 60 weitere und ähnlich gelagerte Verdachtsfälle in China. Der Schaden könnte sich auf mehr als 4,5 Milliarden Euro belaufen, wie das <em>Hauptstadtbüro Bioenergie</em> schätzt. Beim Hauptstadtbüro Bioenergie handelt es sich um eine Vertretung der Branche in Berlin.</p><p>Der Kern des vermutlichen Betrugs liegt in den Klimaschutzauflagen für Öl-Konzerne. Sie sind gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet, die von etwa Benzin und Diesel verursachten Emissionen jährlich zu senken. Die Kennzahlen dafür legt die Bundesregierung fest. Dabei reicht es nicht mehr, biologische Anteile in die Kraftstoffe zu mischen. Da so die Quoten nicht mehr erfüllt werden können.</p><h2>Behörden können zur Kontrolle der Klimaschutz-Projekte nicht in China einreisen</h2><p>Ein anderer vom Gesetzgeber vorgesehener Weg zur Einhaltung der THG-Quote ist die Möglichkeit, als Alternative im Ausland CO₂-Sparmaßnahmen zu finanzieren. Bei der Öl- und Gasförderung gibt es verschiedene technische Möglichkeiten, die Emissionen zu drücken. Mit der Reduzierung dieser sogenannten „Upstream-Emissionen“ – kurz UER – dürfen Konzerne seit 2020 ein Fünftel ihrer THG-Quoten erfüllen. Um die UER zu bestimmen, wird eine mögliche Menge an Emissionen der „grünen Anlage“ mit dem Wert verglichen, der entstünde, wenn die Förderungsanlagen nicht mit einem Projekt zur Minderung der Abgase gebaut worden wäre. Der Wert wird dabei über genormte Grundsätze nach ISO 14065 ermittelt. </p><p>Ölkonzerne können aber auch Zertifikate kaufen, die für eine Klimaschutz-Investition in eine Raffinerie oder andere Förderanlage stehen. Die Ausgaben für alle Vorhaben werden auf den Kraftstoffpreis an der Tankstelle umgelegt.</p><p>Das <a href="https://www.fr.de/politik/tbl-china-klimapolitik-treibhausgas-emissionen-co2-klimawandel-cop-28-entwicklungsland-zr-92405505.html" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle genehmigten &quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:33,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}">Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle genehmigten </a>75 dieser UER-Projekte – fast ausschließlich in China. Und das, obwohl weitere Hinweise dafür sprachen, besser nicht dort zu investieren. Denn China lässt unabhängige Kontrollen im eigenen Land nicht zu. Peking verweigert entsprechenden Prüfer:innen die Einreise.</p><p>„Das Ausmaß des Betrugs am Klimaschutz ist verheerend. Mehr als 7,6 Millionen Tonnen angeblicher CO₂-Einsparung hat es real nie gegeben. Das können wir jetzt nicht einfach mit einem Achselzucken abtun“, sagte Sandra Rostek dazu in einem Statement. Sie ist Leiterin des Hauptstadtbüros Bioenergie. „Hinweisgeber aus der Branche wurden von den Behörden abgewimmelt – noch vor wenigen Wochen wurden offenkundig gefälschte Projekte durchgewunken. Wir hoffen, dass vor dem Hintergrund der Recherche-Ergebnisse des <em>ZDF</em> die verantwortlichen Behörden endlich aufwachen.“</p><p>Was Rostek mit dem „Durchwinken“ meint, ist die anscheinend unzureichende Prüfung der Bauvorhaben durch das Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle. Über Satellitenbilder wäre einfach zu erkennen gewesen, dass einige der eingereichten chinesischen Vorhaben schon vor dem eigentlichen Baustart existiert haben. Dazu würden die Anlagen in keiner Weise den Vorgaben als UER-Projekt gerecht, wie das <em>ZDF</em> herausfand.</p><figure><p><img src="https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullkBG.jpg" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullkb9.jpg 448w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullk73.jpg 768w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullkBG.jpg 1100w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullk7d.jpg 1408w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullkPH.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 769px) 768px, 100vw" height="733" width="1100" alt="In ihrem Ministerium soll es massive Fehler in der Zulassung von Emissions-Projekten gegeben haben: Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke"></p><figcaption>In ihrem Ministerium soll es massive Fehler in der Zulassung von Emissions-Projekten gegeben haben: Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke (Grüne). ©&nbsp;Kay Nietfeld/dpa</figcaption></figure><h2>Möglicher Milliarden-Betrug: Verbraucherschützer, Opposition und Verbände üben Kritik</h2><p>„Durch <a href="https://www.op-online.de/offenbach/sieben-gasversorger-aus-der-region-nach-recherche-des-netzwerks-correctiv-unter-druck-93048646.html" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;fehlerhafte Zertifizierungen und schlampige Kontrollen&quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:39,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}">fehlerhafte Zertifizierungen und schlampige Kontrollen</a> deutscher Behörden ist nicht nur ein horrender finanzieller Schaden entstanden, sondern auch ein massiver Vertrauensverlust in Klimaschutzprojekte im Ausland“, kritisiert Anja Weisgerber, klimapolitische Sprecherin der Union den Vorfall im Bundestag.</p><p>Die THG-Quoten an sich sind dadurch laut <em>ADAC </em><a href="https://www.fr.de/wirtschaft/ablasshandel-fuers-klima-greenwashing-co2-kompensation-93020231.html" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;kaum aussagekräftig&quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:41,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}">kaum aussagekräftig</a>.

Two companies, who should really be compliments, consistently try to one-up and out-position each other. A few months ago with the launch of Llama 3, Meta launched </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/meta-ai/" rel="">Meta AI</a><span>, which is generally available and rolling out to Meta’s 3 billion users. Meta AI is much more general. It is trying to be a chatbot, entertainment, and an information store. Its competition includes ChatGPT and all the other places people can go for this information. Meta AI should really be integrated next to ChatGPT into operating system features, but this is very unlikely.</span></p><p>Apple’s new features will be rolled out on its newest devices (e.g. iPhone 15 Pro and later, M1 Macs and later), which eventually can reach all of their 2 billion users as well. It presents a very different view of what AI is to the general public. Apple is framing what they built as being fundamentally different from ChatGPT, Claude, Meta AI, Gemini results, etc., and it is probably right.</p><p><span>While the many features they announced are interesting, and I will be upgrading my phone this cycle to try them out, they have an extremely high variance on how well they’ll land in the final product (e.g. how </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/" rel="">Microsoft Recall needed substantial updates post announcement</a><span> due to security issues). Photo generation, decent on-device generation, better Siri, textual Siri, webpage summaries, etc. all will serve different audiences.

Given the amount of AI products that are announced and never delivered, passing the bar on technical capabilities via clear communications with the ML community is important for independent monitoring of the performance of top labs (i.e. what I, and many investors, ML nerds, etc. all try to do).

In summary, Apple foundation models focus on personalization (alignment strategies), performance (core models), and size (on-device strategies). Only the last one is orthogonal from other developers out there, but it surely added substantial constraints that inspired the other two. </span></p><p>There are a lot of details in the blog post about their models, covering everything from safety to summarization to email completion. At the end of the day, most of these evaluations are extremely opaque, so I’m leaning on a lot of trust in the company's reputation and general context to make predictions on the actual quality of their models.</p><p>The most central figure to my analysis is the Apple human evaluation versus other top language models. This evaluation likely favors Apple by at least a few percentage points. The things they’re training these models for are explicitly different than what ChatGPT is — otherwise, why would Apple have the option to send any prompts to other services? These models are about things that iPhone users already could use AI for. Regardless, the scores are still solid enough to make a strong case.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png" width="1456" height="629" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:629,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:212746,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>We can see that the on-device model, which is about 3 billion parameters, performs very well versus other models out there. Models like </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/gemma-google-ships-it" rel="">Gemma</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/phi-3-and-arctic-llms" rel="">Phi 3</a><span> are more research or marketing artifacts than models central to future business strategy, so Apple really ought to be crushing models here.</span></p><p>Apple’s Server Model is where things get a little more interesting. The models they’re comparing to, except GPT-4, mostly are considered B-tier by the community. This looks like 2 years after the release of GPT-4, Apple has approximately trained an original GPT-4 level model. This is likely not their ceiling, but the sweet spot they found with respect to their costs — again, the hardest tasks will be offloaded. Beating models like DBRX and Mixtral 8x22B is not trivial, yet it is where Apple should be. To beat the current GPT-4-Turbo, Apple likely needed to invest way more money than would be worth it (e.g. Meta’s GenAI / Metaverse level spending). It was reported that Apple “used a host of licensed content to train and fine-tune their models” like many big tech peers.</p><p><span>There are lots of noteworthy privacy features in the handling of the server model — </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web" rel="">secure enclave</a><span>, secure boot, encryption, no persistent storage, etc. — the combination of which Apple is going to make public so security researchers can verify their claims of privacy. Apple is serving this model entirely on its own infrastructure, which is likely the only way this level of privacy could be achieved (so Google may be able to do something similar if they want to too).</span></p><p>I wasn’t expecting to write about this, but Apple buried a revealing paragraph about fine-tuning techniques. in their foundation model blog post (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p><span>We find that data quality is essential to model success, so we utilize a hybrid data strategy in our training pipeline, incorporating both human-annotated and synthetic data, and conduct thorough data curation and filtering procedures. We have developed two novel algorithms in post-training: (1) a </span><strong>rejection sampling fine-tuning algorithm with teacher committee</strong><span>, and (2) a reinforcement learning from human feedback </span><strong>(RLHF) algorithm with mirror descent policy optimization</strong><span> and a </span><strong>leave-one-out advantage estimator</strong><span>. We find that these two algorithms lead to significant improvement in the model’s instruction-following quality.</span></p></blockquote><p>The bookends of this paragraph are pretty standard — use all the quality data you can get (human and synthetic) and the right algorithm, and you’ll get great performance out of your model. The algorithmic details are interesting because they are so specific with respect to existing literature.</p><p><span>First, rejection sampling with the teacher committee looks like an extension of the rejection sampling approach that was used for Llama 2, Llama 3, Qwen 2, and more models. </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06657" rel="">Rejection sampling</a><span> is a simple idea to generate completions from your model, rank them by a reward model (trained separately), and then use the language modeling loss again to fine-tune your model on the top texts. The new thing introduced is a “teacher committee,” which is very likely to be building on the extensive work that has been appearing around using </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09244" rel="">reward model ensembles</a><span> (or </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12187" rel="">merging</a><span>) to </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16635" rel="">improve performance</a><span>. Ensembles, in principle, improve performance by giving a more robust and or calibrated reward signal.</span></p><p><span>The second algorithm is far more interesting (and technical, so bear with me). They put a direct reference to an older RL algorithm that never really got a ton of traction (e.g. it isn’t implemented in most popular RL libraries) and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09814" rel="">mirror descent policy optimization</a><span> (MDPO). This algorithm is similar to </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347" rel="">proximal policy optimization</a><span> (PPO), the algorithm you hear about a lot when people discuss RLHF, but solves the problem in a different way. PPO, and its predecessor </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477" rel="">TRPO</a><span>, optimize what they call a “surrogate objective” that looks like maximizing a value with respect to a constraint on a “trust region.” Instead of a constraint, MDPO looks like a penalty (and there are many other details). </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/putting_rl_back_in_rlhf_with_rloo" rel="">Leave-one-out error</a><span> is likely an implementation detail of that algorithm that is grounded broadly in ML theory.</span></p><p>The MDPO offers some great intuitions on how the algorithms relate to each other, and how parts of them may impact current RLHF approaches. Let’s start with a comparison of PPO and TRPO, from the paper (additions mine):</p><blockquote><p>PPO takes a more relaxed approach [than TRPO] and updates its policies by solving an unconstrained optimization problem in which the ratio of the new to old policies is clipped to remain bounded.</p></blockquote><p>This, though, can result in some numerical issues in practice.</p><blockquote><p><span>This phenomenon, which has been reported in (</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07940" rel="">Wang et al., 2019</a><span>) and (</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12729" rel="">Engstrom et al., 2020</a><span>), shows that clipping in PPO does not prevent the policy ratios to go out of bound, but it only reduces its probability. This means that despite using clipping, PPO does not guarantee that the trust-region constraint is always satisfied. In fact, recent results, including those in (Engstrom et al., 2020) and our experiments in Section 5.3, show that most of the improved performance exhibited by PPO is due to code-level optimization techniques, such as learning rate annealing, observation and reward normalization, and in particular, the use of generalized advantage estimation (GAE).</span></p></blockquote><p>This is essentially saying that PPO works due to implementation tricks and not exactly due to its designed objective, which MDPO tries to fix. The key differences between MDPO and PPO are that:</p><ul><li><p>MDPO updates are on the “entire dataset” rather than batches. With this, MDPO can be run in an on-policy and an off-policy manner.</p></li><li><p>MDPO uses a different scheduling of KL distance (which may not exist in the RLHF version relative to the original paper).</p></li><li><p><span>MDPO uses opposite direction of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence" rel="">KL</a><span>. The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence is a directional measure of distance between two distributions that is not symmetric. PPO does KL distance the old policy to the new policy and MDPO the opposite. Intuitively, this is a change between information gain and loss of the policy, where one direction penalizes the loss of high-probability tokens and the other penalizes the creation of new behaviors. MDPO, being the latter, could potentially explore better.</span></p></li></ul><p>The key takeaway is that seeing new algorithms for RLHF is exciting because it is very unlikely that the current PPO implementations are actually optimal for our final goals, so this will encourage more experimentation across the industry.</p><p><span>Realistically, all the details aside, Apple is most likely to innovate here due to their deep company culture of creating </span><em>personal</em><span> products. I’m excited to keep tabs on what they build, as true personalization is a large blindspot in the RLHF literature and discourse.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.interconnects.ai/p/apple-intelligence?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/apple-intelligence?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>Apple has done a ton of things to put all of this together on their devices. They figured out how to train great models that use just the right amount of memory with quantization, how to train many adapters that work with different apps or styles, how to get fast latency speeds, and much more they didn’t talk about. This is very serious ML system engineering of a different flavor than large models and large request count handling.</p><p><span>This on-device stage relies on a lot of groundwork that Apple has built in the past, such as </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents" rel="">App Intents</a><span>, which is a standard way for apps to expose their functionality to automation apps and Siri. Apple has successfully trained a small language model to speak the same functional language. In the WWDC keynote, Apple explained that they focused on fine-tuning specific models for specific tasks, which is likely the 12 categories of applications they will be supporting when this launches.</span></p><p>Apple fine-tuned a batch of adapters for the small model that are loaded into memory when the prompt is detected to need them. What I’m not sure about is how the multi-app sequences showcased in the keynote are handled. When Apple Intelligence is asked “Can I make it to my daughter’s play in time,” the example Craig used, are each of the adapters loaded sequentially, or are they applied and mixed together? This sort of technical magic I don’t expect to get an answer to, but represents a serious investment, especially with the high-quality bar that Apple has.</p><p><span>It’s extremely validating for the local model community that a model that takes only 1 GB of memory to load when quantized, and another 3.2GB to run inference for can do so much. As Apple expands the memory footprint of their devices to accommodate a larger AI narrative, they have easy performance to gain by just dropping the quantization levels a bit.

Being able to say “Yes, super powerful AI can be folded into many compelling stories around the future of humanity, but it is also a technology that we use today,” will go a long way in policy circles.</span></p><p><strong>Housekeeping</strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Audio of this post is available (soon) in </span><a href="https://podcast.interconnects.ai/" rel="">podcast</a><span> form or on </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@interconnects" rel="">YouTube</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>My real podcast is at </span><a href="http://retortai.com/" rel="">retortai.com</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><em>Paid subscriber Discord access in email footer.</em></p></li><li><p><span>Referrals → paid sub: Use the </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/leaderboard" rel="">Interconnects Leaderboard</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Student discounts in </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/about" rel="">About page</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

The price of building material and construction labor can fluctuate, sure, but not by enough to explain the massive surge in housing costs.

This is a strong incentive to build useful stuff instead of just squatting and sucking up rent, or holding the land out of use and waiting for its value to go up.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Note that Land Value Tax behaves differently from a conventional </span><em>Property Tax</em><span>. Property taxes tax both the land </span><em>and</em><span> its improvements, and can lead to perverse incentives (such as punishing you for building stuff, and rewarding you for keeping it vacant). The key is to tax the land and </span><em>only</em><span> the land.</span></p><p><span>But why just land? Because assets that are truly "land-like" are special - they gatekeep access to core features and/or economic privileges, and </span><em>you can't make any more of them</em><span>.

There are constructs that look and behave a lot like land. But this is an illusion and the details of how land is implemented matter immensely.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Rent</strong><span>: The mechanic of players renting to other players is rather rare in traditional games, but is becoming particularly popular in blockchain games. A common purpose of such a feature is to offer a way for players to engage with the economy when crucial assets have very high prices. Of course, those high prices are themselves often a symptom of a virtual world designed as a financial vehicle first and a game second. But suffice it to say, some games let you rent assets to other players, with the return of the asset upon expiry of the contract enforced by software rather than courts of law.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Taxes</strong><span>: Virtual worlds tend to use faucet-and-drain economies where digital assets can be created and destroyed on whim. Virtual taxes generally act as yet another arbitrary sink, often in service of a player incentive. Much of real-world concerns about levying taxes to pay for communal services barely apply.</span></p></li></ul><p>It is easy to just assume that everyone knows what “land” is. But in virtual worlds these need to be recreated from first principles. Certain assumptions become design choices. Is land finite? In the real world, that’s obviously true. In the virtual world, it is a choice. And how does “location” work? In the real world we take Euclidean geometry and conventional physics for granted – you can’t be in two places at once, you can’t instantly warp from one location to another, etc., but these need not be so in a virtual world.</p><p>With all that properly understood, let’s talk about how to actually implement a digital Land Value Tax in a virtual world.</p><p>There are four basic steps to implementing a digital Land Value Tax policy:</p><ol><li><p>Identify “land-like assets”</p></li><li><p>Separate “improvements” from “land”</p></li><li><p>Discover the full market value of land (ideally as both rental income and as selling value)</p></li><li><p>Levy a Land Value Tax that captures 85-100% of land rents</p></li></ol><p>There are a few other baseline requirements that your virtual world must first fulfill for this to work, of course:</p><ol><li><p>Land must be tradeable</p></li><li><p>There must be some kind of currency to levy the tax in</p></li></ol><p><span>Keep in mind that if </span><em>you</em><span> don’t make land tradeable, or provide some sort of currency for your economy, players may simply provide both features themselves. If land cannot be formally traded between accounts in-game, players will form a black market to buy, sell, and trade accounts out-of-game, or provide services that do whatever it takes to move an asset from one account and into another one. And if you don’t provide an official currency, players will find some other commodity in game to stand in for one and use that.</span></p><p>Your first step should be to evaluate your design and identify land-like assets. But what is a “land-like asset”? Generally speaking it’s any thing you can own that fulfills three requirements:</p><ol><li><p><span>Is </span><strong>strictly scarce</strong><span> and </span><strong>cannot be produced</strong></p></li><li><p><span>Is </span><strong>necessary for production or gameplay</strong></p></li><li><p><span>Is </span><strong>more or less valuable because of its location</strong></p></li></ol><p>(Also, it goes without saying that the asset must have a significant degree of persistence and be identifiable to the community – if it’s ephemeral or highly instanced it’s not a good candidate for a land-like asset)</p><p><span>The asset must be something that players cannot make. It needs to be essentially finite in supply, pre-provided by the developers themselves as part of “the world,” and come with the </span><em>expectation that only a certain amount of it will be provided</em><span>.</span></p><p>Occasional expansions in the land supply weaken this property but don’t necessarily break it.

Taking our network graph from before, let's say each node represents a piece of land, the size of the node represents the market value of its "inherent" developer-provided resources and affordances, and lines connecting nodes represent travel connections. Let's say owning a plot entitles you to everything it produces as well as to charge a fee for people and goods to move across it.</p><p>Which one of these nodes is most valuable?

This is a textbook example of a digital land-like asset, despite the thematic set dressing of a “factory.”</span></p></div><p>Much of the value generated in a virtual world is social capital. We often think of value in terms of ‘stuff’ but in a virtual economy assets are mostly illusionary. What isn’t an illusion is our relative relationships inside the virtual world with other human beings. They are real, we are real and we care deeply about our standing with others.</p><div><p><span>Land-like assets have adjacency to those other people. They help codify and mediate relationships, status and social support.</span></p><p><span>If you look carefully, you can track large portions of location value to social network adjacencies with either strong benefits or lowered costs. To consider Manhattan again, the land is primarily valuable because of the proximity to all the people here and the services they provide.

In </span><em>CQXII</em><span>, resources are gathered from land, and all structures must be built on land. This makes access to land “necessary for production” because without land you can’t participate in major parts of the game. Finally, the location of the land matters. As other players regularly gather in particular locations, land closer to those settlements will become more valuable. This is due to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration" rel="">agglomeration effect</a><span>. </span><em>CQXII</em><span> land is a fully land-like asset, and thus a prime asset for speculators that will yield the greatest returns.</span></p><p><span>These are tradeable deeds granted by in-game authorities and are similar to real-world </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_medallion" rel="">taxi medallions</a><span>. Players who wish to engage in certain economic activities such as building temples or brewing potions must first obtain the respective permit from the priest’s guild or the witch’s guild. Each guild issues only a fixed number of permits, but within its own category, one permit is as good as any other. In this sense permits are non-unique and thus “fungible.” Permits are necessary for production because the game will literally not allow you to do certain things without the right permit in your inventory. Permits have many properties in common with land in that they gate-keep access to the economy: an enterprising witch doesn’t have to brew her own potions, she can let an apprentice operate under her permit and charge the apprentice rent for the privilege. However, permits aren’t tied to a particular location and thus don’t obtain locational value the same way land does. They’re somewhat land-like, but not all the way there. There will be speculative interest in permits, but not as much as in land.</span></p><p><span>Unicorns are a special kind of mount in </span><em>CQXII</em><span>. They aren’t necessary for production, but they are very nice to have because they are swift, loyal, and impervious to all forms of harm. Only 10,000 unicorns exist on any given server, and the developers have sworn to never create any more. Since Unicorns aren’t tied to a particular location, they don’t obtain locational value. The only way unicorns are “land-like” is that they are scarce in supply. But because they aren’t truly necessary for production, it’s not a big deal if you don’t own a unicorn. There is some speculative interest in holding unicorns due to their scarcity. That said, in the long term most of the value of bids will be based on their inherent utility, given that unicorn ownership doesn’t gatekeep participation in the economy itself.</span></p><p>Horses are a common type of mount. They are very useful and nice to have, but they aren’t necessary for production, they aren’t scarce, and they don’t obtain locational value. If you want to buy a horse all you have to do is go to your local horse breeder and buy one. And if that particular breeder won’t sell you one, another one will. Worst case scenario, you can just go out into the wild and try to tame a wild stallion yourself. Horses have little speculative interest because owning one doesn’t grant you any real leverage over anybody else; their value is entirely derived from their utility.</p><p>The next step is to distinguish between land-like assets and “improvements” that have been made to or built upon them. In the real world the most typical example of an “improvement” is a building, but technically speaking anything that makes land more valuable that comes from applying labor or capital counts as an improvement. Plowing a field, irrigating it, or planting an orchard on it all count as improvements. In the context of a game both “upgrades” and “buildings” count as “improvements.”</p><p><span>If your game does </span><em>not </em><span>include any features whereby players may “improve” on land-like-assets, then there is nothing to be done here. In that case, all you need to do is ensure that there is a healthy sale and/or rental market so that you can derive land purchase prices and rental income directly from observation. If there are improvement mechanisms (such as building construction), then you must take special care in your implementation to make it as easy as possible to separate the market value of improvements from the market value of unimproved land.</span></p><p>In the real world, separating land from improvements is a complex but feasible task. You should therefore be able to implement a Land Value Tax in almost any kind of online multiplayer game with much less difficulty than in the real world. There are, however, certain choices that could make your job easier.</p><p>If you take good care to log all market transactions from the game’s first day of operation, you give yourself a huge advantage that would make real-world assessors green with envy. Having complete and comprehensive data makes any numerical estimation method much more powerful. This assumes of course that your economy is healthy and is not pushing a large volume of transactions off onto a black market that is invisible to you.</p><p>The greatest affordance we have in the digital world is that we can, in principle, move any player-created structure or improvement anywhere we want. We may still wish to constrain players’ ability to do this themselves, but the point is that the power is available to the game developers. It is perfectly feasible to let the player pluck the house off a plot of land, stuff it in their inventory, and sell the land bare.</p><p><span>In the real world, most houses can’t be trivially moved from one spot to another, and even then no two houses are </span><em>exactly </em><span>alike – especially considering varying amounts of wear and tear. In the digital world it is perfectly plausible for certain structures to be perfectly interchangeable commodities, and degradation of virtual goods doesn’t exist unless you explicitly implement it. This makes it much easier to assess the value of improvements as there is less variation to consider between assets.</span></p><p>In order to levy a Land Value Tax, we must first assess the value of land. And what do we mean by “land value?” There’s two different kinds:</p><ol><li><p><span>Land </span><em>selling</em><span> value</span></p></li><li><p><span>Recurring land </span><em>income</em></p></li></ol><div><p><span>Land income drives land selling value (aka land price), not the other way around. The amount someone is willing to pay for land is the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp" rel="">net present value </a><span>of the recurring income the land generates – the amount of money you expect the land to produce over some time horizon, adjusted for how patient you are. This income can be literal monetary income, benefits the land provides that someone is willing to pay money for, or a mix of both.</span></p><p><span>In any case, whether you’re assessing selling value or income, all assessments are based on a simple algebraic equation:</span></p></div><p><em><strong>T = I + L</strong></em><br><em><strong>T</strong><span>otal Market Value </span><strong>= </strong><span>(</span><strong>I</strong><span>mprovements Value) + (</span><strong>L</strong><span>and Value)</span></em></p><p>If you know any two of these values, you can derive the third, known as the “residual.”</p><div><p><span>But we must also take care to assess at </span><em>full market value. </em><span>Full market value specifically means the value an asset would obtain in the market under “fair and unconstrained” conditions. As a counter-example, if your dad sells you a valuable plot of land for $1, he’s intentionally selling it for less than full market value; he’s essentially giving you a gift. So we should exclude any such non-"arm’s length" transactions as a basis for assessments.</span></p><p><span>The goal is to discover the full market selling value of every land parcel in our virtual world. We have three main ways we can do this:</span></p></div><ol><li><p>Assessment</p></li><li><p>Short-term leases with auctions</p></li><li><p><span>Harberger taxes</span><br><span>a. Modified Harberger Taxes</span><br><span>b. Blood Taxes</span></p></li></ol><p><span>In the real world, property assessors use a variety of complex methods for estimating the value of land separately from that of buildings, typically something like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_regression" rel="">hedonic regression</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the digital world, we can just accept separate bids on the land and the improvements for any given property in the game, and thus generate cleanly separated valuations directly from the market. Any player may offer to buy </span><em>just the land</em><span> or </span><em>just the improvements</em><span>. If the land alone is sold, the improvements are stuffed into the owner’s inventory. If the improvements are sold, they go into the buyer’s inventory and the owner’s land becomes bare.</span></p><p>This allows you to collect true market data about how players value land and improvements separately.</p><p><span>To estimate the value of assets that have not had recent market transactions, you compare those to recently sold comparable properties in the area, making adjustments for differences. In practice you can automate this procedure with either a linear regression model or a machine learning model that uses a dataset built from your observed market transactions and the properties of your assets (with location being a highly salient property). You will want to ensure that your model not only has predictive value for the hold-out set of data you use to evaluate the model during training, but also that it </span><em>actually accurately predicts the value of future transactions</em><span>.</span></p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><p>Good price discovery</p></li><li><p>Can be retrofitted into an existing land economy</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Requires you to do math and book-keeping</p></li></ul><p>There are other ways to perform price discovery of land-like assets for the purposes of levying an LVT, or even replacing LVT with a different kind of policy that achieves many of the same goals. Let’s look at those next.</p><p>In this model the “government” (ie the developer) “owns” the actual title to all the land in the game, and simply leases it out. Every player becomes a de-facto tenant and must renew their lease at the end of the rental term.</p><p><span>At the end of the rental term, the land goes up for auction, and the player who wins the auction becomes the next holder of the land. There are many, many, kinds of auctions, but a popular one for this sort of purpose is the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction" rel="">Vickrey Auction</a><span> – all bids are secret, the winner is whoever gives the highest bid, and the price the winner pays is the amount of the </span><em>second highest</em><span> bid. The advantage of this kind of auction is that each bidder is incentivized to bid the maximum amount the asset is actually worth to them, without worrying about what others are likely to bid. This is because if the bidder wins the auction, they will not pay the amount of their own bid, but the lower amount bid by whoever came in second place. In the event that there is only one bidder, that person wins the auction regardless of what they bid, the "next highest bid" is zero, and the asset may be had for free.</span></p><p>Although it is essential that bids are kept secret from other bidders, the game developer can and should access that information for purposes of price discovery. Once the auction has been conducted we have three things: 1) a willing buyer, 2) a winning market price, and 3) a range of bids.</p><p>The downside to this approach is that it’s more aggressive than an LVT. Land Value Taxes are an ongoing signal to the player to make the best use of their land or sell it to someone who will, but the choice is still ultimately theirs. When a short-term lease expires, the owner could lose the land simply by losing the auction. Also, land income values cannot be reassessed by this method on any more frequent time interval than the term of the lease itself, whereas the traditional methods could (in theory) reassess values on any schedule.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><p>Simple to implement</p></li><li><p>Excellent price discovery</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Exposes the landowner to the risk of a forced sale at the end of the auction term</p></li><li><p>Harder to retrofit into an existing game, best implemented from the start</p></li></ul><div><p><span>This method was popularized by the book </span><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177502/radical-markets" rel="">Radical Markets</a><span>. In this system everyone self-assesses the value of their own property. They just come up with a number and write it down, that’s the value of their property. In our case, we would only need to have players do this for land-like assets.</span></p><p><span>Two crucial things happen next:</span></p></div><ol><li><p>Players pay taxes based on that valuation</p></li><li><p><em>Anyone </em><span>has the right to purchase the asset for that valuation in a forced sale</span></p></li></ol><p>This unusual method is supposed to balance incentives: you have an incentive to not value your item too high to avoid paying taxes, but you also have an incentive to not value your item too low lest it be bought off of you. Ideally a rational player will be forced to discover the true market value of their asset in this way. A price that is not so high you can’t bear to pay the taxes, but is not so low that you’d be unwilling to take that much money in exchange for it.</p><p>To put it another way:</p><p>Most people would accept an offer to buy their house for a billion dollars, but not for 1 dollar.</p><div><p><span>Most people would be glad to pay an annual X% tax on 1 dollar, but not on a billion dollars.</span></p><p><span>The entire idea of Harberger taxes is to find the sweet spot in the middle of that range, for every piece of property. This could be one way for getting players themselves to conduct price discovery for land-like assets.</span></p><p><span>There are downsides. For one, it assumes a certain level of sophistication on the user’s behalf. One can easily imagine novice players under- or over- pricing assets and running into trouble. There could also be innocent mistakes with huge consequences such as misplacing a decimal point or a zero. If you try to ameliorate this with some auto-populated default value, players will probably heavily gravitate towards it, defeating the point of the self-assessment.</span></p><p><span>This method can also force the current landowner off the property with little notice and no recourse, which is a huge issue and likely makes it a non-starter for many virtual worlds.</span></p><p><span>There </span><em>are</em><span> proposed ways to modify Harberger Tax schemes to get around the abrupt forced sale problem, but they make the implementation even more complex.</span></p></div><p><span>In classic Harberger taxes, if a buyer is willing to pay more than the valuation, they get it right away. In a modified version proposed by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FabricioNakata/status/1434081416778682374" rel="">Fabricio Nakata</a><span>, you instead make the prospective buyer put their offer money into an escrow account (this is an implementation detail that the game developer would manage). The owner may then decide to either accept the offer or reject it.</span></p><p>If they reject the offer, the property’s valuation immediately rises to match the value of the rejected offer, and the rejected buyer is rewarded with a bounty – an amount equal to the additional tax that will now be levied because of the increased valuation (for e.g. 1-2 months or whatever the appropriate duration of time is). If the owner of the property wants their assessment lowered, they may do so by changing their self-valuation, but must put money in a “bounty bond” account that is sufficient to pay out the bounty if someone comes along and offers a higher price for the property and the owner chooses to reject it.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><p>Excellent price discovery</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Exposes the landowner to forced sales (in classic Harberger)</p></li><li><p>Larger complexity burden (in modified Harberger)</p></li><li><p>Punishes simple mistakes and unsophisticated players</p></li></ul><p>There’s another way to modify the concept of Harberger Taxes, specifically in the context of video games, which we call “Blood Taxes.”</p><div><p><span>If you squint, Harberger Taxes look a little bit like balancing the costs of attacking and defending territory, only with money instead of weapons. The player wants to invest a certain amount in “defense” to protect their land, but not so much that they consume more resources than the land is worth, defeating the point of holding it in the first place. Since we’re talking about video games here, there’s no reason you couldn’t implement such a system with actual attacking and actual defending.</span></p><p><span>Redirecting a portion of land income to building fortifications and garrisoning defenders is akin to paying taxes, and funding an invading army to seize the land is akin to offering a buyout price. Since it is typically much cheaper to defend something than to attack it, the attacker must spend proportionately more to seize the land than it costs for the defender to protect it. The attacker is willing to do this because the ultimate prize is the recurring income of the land. If the attacker can push the defender to the point where all their income is gobbled up by defense spending, the defender may even choose to simply abandon the territory rather than keep up the fight.</span></p><p><span>The “price” here is ultimately paid in “blood” rather than in money, and the “taxes” aren’t collected by anyone, but this is a video game where taxes often just go straight into a sink, so there’s not much difference on that score.</span></p><p><span>Naively, “blood taxes” are more akin to a </span><em>property </em><span>tax rather than a land tax, because if invaders can capture improvements built by the defenders, that could serve to increase the price attackers are willing to pay and that defenders must respond to. To make sure blood taxes only fall on land, one would need to modify the gameplay such that improvements cannot be seized by an invading army, only the bare land. There are two ways to do this. One is to instantly raze all improvements on conquered land (a hefty transaction cost to the “seller” that imposes significant deadweight loss). Another way would be to pluck the vanquished defender’s castle off the land, stick it in the defender’s pocket as a consolation prize, and send them on their way. Giving defeated players some portion of the value of their destroyed base is a fairly common mechanic already, so this fits in.</span></p><p><span>Virtual world economies are driven by faucets and drains and must constantly sink value to stave off the ever-present specter of runaway inflation, so this particular implementation isn’t as outlandish as it first appears.</span></p><p><span>The biggest limitation to blood taxes is that the thematic set dressing and PVP framing is not appropriate for every type of game and should thus not be regarded as a universal solution.</span></p><p><span>Pros:</span></p></div><ul><li><p>No worrying about market transactions and taxes, just let people fight</p></li><li><p>Don't bore players to death with tax policy, just kill them to death</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Needs modification otherwise it’s just a property tax</p></li><li><p>Exposes the landowner to straight-up violent conquest</p></li><li><p>Inefficiency of war causes “assessment errors” for both attackers and defenders</p></li><li><p>Requires a battle and conquest mechanic</p></li><li><p>Changing the battle system could have unintended economic consequences</p></li></ul><p>Every game is different so we can't point to any specific price discovery solution as universally appropriate. But generally speaking we rank them in this order:</p><ol><li><p>Short-term leases</p></li><li><p>Assessment</p></li><li><p>Harberger Taxes</p></li></ol><p>Short-term leases with Vickrey auctions are simple and give you direct access to land income market values, but they can be harder to retrofit into existing games.</p><p>Assessment can work well and can be used to drop an LVT policy into an existing game, but you'll need to do some math and carefully track transaction records.</p><p>Harberger Taxes are interesting and theoretically brilliant, but are probably a hard sell to players and raise UX concerns.</p><p>That said, all of these are excellent candidates, and you should evaluate all of the choices and make the right decision for your particular game. Even better, get your game economist to run a controlled A/B experiment. If you do, write to us and tell us the results!</p><div><p><span>Okay, so we’ve identified the land-like assets, we’ve separated land from improvements, and we’ve accurately assessed the full market selling value of all the land. What’s next?</span></p><p><span>The next step is to actually levy the tax. Decide on a time interval (say, once a month), pick a tax rate to apply, and then charge landowners the tax. If someone doesn’t pay their tax, the land is confiscated and sold at auction to the public (throw in a grace period if you feel like, it's your virtual world).</span></p></div><p><span>Orthodox Georgism proposes a tax rate of 85-100% on the </span><em>recurring rental income </em><span>generated by land. The basic idea is that the </span><strong>selling price of land should approach zero</strong><span>. Let that be your north star: if land still has a large selling price, your LVT is too low. If land is being abandoned and players have to be paid to hold it (the selling price is negative), then your LVT is too high.</span></p><p>Wait! That’s weird!</p><p>If we levy a Land Value Tax, and we get it exactly right, and the price of the land goes to zero, and we base the tax on the land value, which is now zero… isn’t there a problem here?</p><p>This is a common point of confusion, but it's actually not that hard to disentangle it. First let's nail down some precise terms:</p><p><strong>Land Selling Value</strong><span>, refers to the actual selling price of land in the market, which “prices in” any taxes the holder of the land has to pay.</span></p><div><p><strong>Land Income</strong><span>, is the market value of the recurring benefit that the land itself produces. </span><em>It is land income that drives land selling value, not the other way around. </em><span>Land Income is </span><em>unchanged</em><span> by Land Value Tax. The land’s productivity doesn’t go down. But the Land Selling Value </span><em>does</em><span> change.</span></p><p><span>Bear with us while we step through some math and explain. Here's the formula for Land Selling Value:</span></p></div><p><em><strong>S = (I - T) / D</strong></em></p><div><p><em><span>Land </span><strong>S</strong><span>elling Value = (Land </span><strong>I</strong><span>ncome - Land </span><strong>T</strong><span>axes) / </span><strong>D</strong><span>iscount Rate</span></em></p><p><strong>Discount Rate</strong><span> represents how much one values a dollar today versus a dollar tomorrow. Even if some land could theoretically generate an infinite amount of benefits if I held on to it forever, I'm not going to live that long. I care about my investment's value tomorrow, and next year, and maybe even over the next few decades, but I don't care about it's value in 5,000 years. The less patient I am, the higher my discount rate, and the less I'm willing to pay for the same piece of income-generating land.</span></p></div><p>Here are some example calculations using a 5% annual discount rate, showing how a change in land taxes affects the selling value:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png" width="1028" height="331" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:331,&quot;width&quot;:1028,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27348,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><div><p><span>What this example hopefully makes clear is that </span><strong>LVT is a tax on the recurring land income</strong><em><strong>, </strong></em><strong>not the selling price</strong><span>. We are not proposing a recurring tax anywhere close to the actual full purchase price of a plot of land.</span></p><p><span>If your game has a rental mechanic then you should have lots of transaction records for the rental price of land. This should allow you to build a model that gives you an accurate assessed rental income value for every piece of land. Tax that at 85-100%, and adjust accordingly until you observe that the land’s selling price is approximately zero. You don’t need to get it perfect, in fact it’s preferable to undershoot the Land Value Tax by a little bit just to be safe (hence the 85% lower bound).</span></p></div><p><span>Evidence suggests you can see good results even without a perfectly calibrated 100% LVT. Economist Ramin Shokrizade, with no formal knowledge of Georgist theory, </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-i-used-eve-online-to-predict-the-great-recession" rel="">fixed </a><em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-i-used-eve-online-to-predict-the-great-recession" rel="">EVE Online</a></em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-i-used-eve-online-to-predict-the-great-recession" rel="">’s land recession</a><span> simply by directing CCP Games to assess a “high enough” holding fee to land-like spaceship factories, which had the effect of dissuading speculators.</span></p><p>But what if you don’t have a rental mechanic or only have selling values in your transaction logs? In that case you’ll need to work out the land income indirectly.</p><p>The capitalization rate is the ratio between the selling price of land and how much income it generates for the owner. If you have a rental mechanic, you can calculate this ratio easily. But if you don’t, you’ll need to measure income in another way, such as assessing the market value of all the resources and other benefits that a player generates over a unit of time by holding the land.</p><p>For context, in the real world annual capitalization rates tend to be somewhere between 3-10% of the selling value of land. If you have absolutely no idea what an appropriate capitalization rate for your virtual world is, start by guessing somewhere in the 3-10% range, observe what happens to the selling price of land, and adjust up or down accordingly. Remember – your goal is to get the selling price of land to approach zero without going negative.</p><p>If you are levying a full 100% LVT, then the tax rate and the capitalization rate will be the same. If you are levying an 85% LVT, then the tax rate will be 85% of the capitalization rate.</p><p>Here are some examples of how land selling price and land rental income relate to the capitalization rate:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png" width="1032" height="382" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:382,&quot;width&quot;:1032,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27535,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Note that in the real world capitalization rates tend to vary both by location and by property type (commercial vs. residential, urban vs. rural, etc) and we would expect to see similar results in the digital world.

Look at the price of land in the market. If it’s close to zero, you’re doing a good job. If it’s a lot more than zero, there’s still a lot of uncollected land income. And if it’s </span><em>less</em><span> than zero, meaning you have to </span><em>pay</em><span> people to get them to willingly hold land, you’re taxing it too much. And if the land selling price is exactly zero, you’re doing great, leave the tax rate unchanged.</span></p><p><span>The key is that </span><em>land income </em><span>is unaffected by LVT. The land’s fundamental productivity doesn’t change if you tax it, but </span><em>who </em><span>is collecting that same amount of land income does. You have the privilege of observing both the amount that you, the “government,” are collecting, as well as what any tenants are being charged. From these two figures you can always know the total amount. It’s on this basis that you can calculate the full untaxed market value of the land.</span></p><p><span>That said, you can also just guess, and then iteratively adjust the land taxes until the market responds with land prices approaching zero, knowing this signals that your tax rates are appropriate. What’s the land income for a parcel of land whose price has been driven to exactly 0?

What are we gonna do we do with it? Well, first it depends what kind of money you raised.</span></p></div><p><span>Most traditional MMO’s that lack “real money” economies will simply delete the money raised by an LVT. This is for two reasons: 1) the in-game currency is useless for funding real world development costs, and 2) the primary economic challenge of traditional MMO’s is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflation" rel="">MUDflation</a><span>, where endgame players accumulate lots of money with nothing to sink it in, flooding the market with currency and driving down the market price of high-end items. Given that housing is a traditional end-game “money sink” mechanic, LVT is a natural solution to this problem.</span></p><p><span>By “real money” we mean a game in which you can cash </span><em>out </em><span>virtual currency for real world currency through any number of intermediaries (black markets, crypto, paypal, banks, etc). There are plenty of systems in which you can only cash </span><em>in</em><span> real money (Steam Wallets are a good example), and these don't count.</span></p><div><p><span>If your economy runs on “real money,” two things change.</span></p><p><span>The first is you are much more vulnerable to having criminals use your game for money laundering and your players become valuable targets for account theft, but that is beyond the scope of this particular paper.</span></p></div><p>The second thing that changes is that the same currency players use to trade in-game could also obtain real world value for you, the developer. What can you do with the money?</p><ol><li><p><strong>Keep it. </strong><span>Because why not?</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Employee bonuses. </strong><span>Give it to your employees, they deserve it.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Reinvest it.</strong><span> </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George_theorem" rel="">The Henry George Theorem</a><span>, derived by Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, predicts that spending on “pure public goods” causes land values to rise proportionately, and other research suggests that a partial effect holds for other kinds of public spending. A real-money LVT game could use the stimulating effects of LVT on user generated content, and the tendency of “public spending” by the developer on new features to soak into land values, and set up a self-funding flywheel.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Universal Basic Income.</strong><span> Henry George was an early proponent of what we now call UBI, called a “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen's_dividend" rel="">Citizen’s Dividend</a><span>” in his time. You take the taxes collected by LVT and share them out equally among your players. In this way your player base, which is one of the key things that makes your game grow in value, are at least partially compensated for the value they are creating. In the digital world this immediately throws up some red flags about who gets to count as a player. You will have to avoid the problem of people signing up under 10 different accounts to get multiple UBI payments.</span></p></li></ol><p>If you're building a virtual world that includes land-like assets, you need to be careful about perverse incentives that can attract land speculators who will suck all the fun out of your game and crash your in-game economy.</p><p>To fix this, you must identify land-like assets, separate the value of "improvements" from that of "land," measure the selling value and/or recurring income of the land, and then levy a Land Value Tax that captures 85-100% of the land income. This creates a "use it or lose it" holding fee that properly aligns incentives, ensuring that only people who want to use land-like assets for their actual intended purpose will hold onto them.</p><p>But a few questions still linger.</p><div><p><span>The good news is that, having exhaustively investigated Blockchain and NFT technology, we conclude that there is nothing in current practice (and very little in theory) that can be done in games with these technologies that cannot be accomplished just as easily (or more easily) with conventional solutions.</span></p><p><span>So if you’re making a Blockchain or NFT game, anything in this policy paper should be just as applicable, with the exception that you are in a worse position for adjudicating disputes as you lack the power to reverse fraudulent transactions and </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=axie%20infinity%20hack" rel="">hacks</a><span> that occur on an immutable blockchain. Also, the high valuations currently chasing blockchain games will also give you a much more aggressive set of financially motivated bad actors to contend with.</span></p><p><span>Good luck!</span></p></div><p><span>Yes, you certainly can. If land supply can increase as necessary, that makes it less scarce, which makes the asset less "land-like" economically speaking. This is </span><em><a href="https://secondlife.com/" rel="">Second Life</a></em><span>'s approach to land, more or less.</span></p><p><span>But creating more land isn't always a solution. Maybe your server cost structure has limits, so you can't just spin up tons of new housing blocks (as is commonly alleged about </span><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em><span>).</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, it's hard to escape the agglomeration effect. Land has value for three reasons: location, location, location. This comes from proximity to centers of economic activity, valuable resources, and most importantly, people. So even on an infinite plane, some locations will always be more valuable than others. America has plenty of empty land, but a patch of desert is no replacement for New York City. Likewise, </span><em>Ultima Online</em><span> has plenty of servers, but there's no replacement for the Atlantic shard.</span></p><p><span>This is the case for a lot of blockchain games like </span><em><a href="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/p/0c8f89fe-cf3f-4809-9eba-4fe050405ca5/decentraland.org/" rel="">Decentraland</a></em><span>, </span><em><a href="https://axieinfinity.com/" rel="">Axie Infinity</a></em><span>, and </span><em><a href="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/p/0c8f89fe-cf3f-4809-9eba-4fe050405ca5/sandbox.game/en/" rel="">The Sandbox</a></em><span>, who have sold millions of dollars worth of land in advance of most (or any) of their land-based features coming online.</span></p><p>We're sorry to say this, but you might be hosed.</p><p>When you pre-sell land, you attract a certain class of investor who expects a return on that asset. And because you've used both the metaphor and the mechanics of land from the real world, they're expecting it will play out the same way: buy land when it's cheap, wait for people to move in and start building stuff, and see the investment rise in value.</p><p>When the predictable land crisis hits, you are faced with two terrible choices:</p><p><span>1. Protect land scarcity, angering the landless and cutting off user growth, OR</span><br><span>2. Make concessions to the landless, sparking a landowner revolt</span></p><p><span>There's signs of the second one starting to bubble in the Axie Infinity community as we speak, it wasn't hard to find responses like these in the wake of a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOZN61kdnBI" rel="">Q&amp;A about their upcoming land gameplay</a><span>:</span></p><p><span>We don't envy anyone who has painted themselves into this corner</span><em>. </em><span>Our best advice to everyone else is to not put yourself there in the first place.</span></p><p>Building a virtual world is no easy task, but by George, you can do this.</p><p>And Land Value Tax can help.</p><p><em><span>Originally published on </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/land-value-tax-in-online-games-and-virtual-worlds-a-how-to-guide" rel="">Game Developer</a><span> by Lars Doucet and Dan Cook</span></em></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>
