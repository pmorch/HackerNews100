Federal hiring freezes, budget constraints, and shifting political priorities mean that many agencies are cutting back.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AG37!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AG37!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AG37!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AG37!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AG37!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AG37!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png" width="562" height="428.525" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:671,&quot;width&quot;:880,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:562,&quot;bytes&quot;:57016,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.chrisbrunet.com/i/174414048?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AG37!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AG37!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AG37!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AG37!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b54d146-152a-48d6-8fc2-50692298146c_880x671.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>International organizations once served as the safety net for economists who missed out on academia or Washington.

Not all, but many tech companies are actively downsizing and laying off tons of workers with tech experience that you have to compete against. And few firms will really care about causal inference and any other data analytics jobs can be filled by data science masters grads with deeper programming skills and cheaper salary expectations. Not to mention there is a focus on developing and using AI these days and your intro to machine learning class isn’t going to cut it.’’</p><p>— Anonymous economist</p></div><p>The only seemingly stable landing spot left for economists is in banking and finance, but even here hiring is stagnant and remains well below its pre-pandemic trend.

The AI earned a “D” (this was 2 years ago), but soon enough, we all know it will be smart enough to earn an A. The technology is improving rapidly, and universities know it, and so does the private sector.

Each step was wrong, and each was delivered with smug certainty. Ordinary people—who watched their rent, groceries, and gas bills skyrocket—saw a profession more invested in protecting Democratic policy narratives than in telling the truth. The result is a self-inflicted torching of trust.</p><p>The answer is no. An economics PhD is no longer an investment. It is a gamble with terrible odds. A handful of winners still exist, almost all of them minted at Harvard, MIT, Princeton, or Chicago. For everyone else, the degree is a trap: six or more years of grinding work that too often ends with being overeducated, underpaid, and locked out of the profession you trained to join.</p><div><p>‘‘My advice is to do something other than go for a Ph.D in economics … In hindsight, my decision to go to graduate school was a mistake.

From there, though, his piece becomes more distinctive and interesting, exploring the social dynamics and internal hierarchies of the profession. His conclusion is bleak for the discipline itself, but notably optimistic about the future of Substack:</span></p><blockquote><p>Do I think the PhD job market will bounce back?</p><p><span>Prognosticating too eagerly is a good way to land yourself a place in the Irving Fisher Hall of Forever Being Remembered For Having Said One Stupid Thing.</span><a href="https://www.global-developments.org/p/twilight-of-the-econs#footnote-4-170289520" rel=""><sup>4</sup></a><span> A 16% fall in jobs, while devastating, is not yet apocalyptic.

But for things to get better requires a causal mechanism. Reinstating science and academic funding would require either Republicans to reverse their stance on the value of higher education, or for Democrats to win back the Senate. I don’t have a great sense of if either will happen.</span><a href="https://www.global-developments.org/p/twilight-of-the-econs#footnote-5-170289520" rel=""><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>In this case, prediction may be less important than preparation. Placement chairs need to own up to the harshness of the labor market, and urge job market candidates to start prepping non-academic options. (Better yet, admissions chairs should consider paring back cohort sizes.) Candidates who would like a proper job after graduating should be networking, hard. And candidates resolutely committed to academia should steel themselves for long hibernations as post docs, to wait out the coming storm.</p><p>On second thought, I will venture one dark prediction, for at least the near future.</p><p><strong>We’re going to see a lot more Substacks.</strong></p></blockquote><p>The wager, then, is that the future of intellectual life will be increasingly decentralized. Platforms like Substack are already siphoning off the kind of energy and analysis that once flowed into journals or policy shops.</p><p>As for the economics profession, the only real fix would be radical: every PhD program would have to coordinate and act like a cartel to slash admissions to dramatically reduce supply. Without that discipline, the system will keep flooding the market with useless doctorates, a Ponzi scheme destined to collapse under its own weight.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.chrisbrunet.com/p/the-collapse-of-the-econ-phd-job?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.chrisbrunet.com/p/the-collapse-of-the-econ-phd-job?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.chrisbrunet.com/p/the-collapse-of-the-econ-phd-job/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.chrisbrunet.com/p/the-collapse-of-the-econ-phd-job/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

The GPT-5 upgrade for ChatGPT was a dud — an industry-wide embarrassment for arguably the most-hyped product in AI history, one that (<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-does-gpt-5-work/"><u>as I revealed a few months ago</u></a>) costs more to operate than its predecessor, not because of any inherent capability upgrade, but how it actually processes the prompts its user provides — and now it's unclear what it is that this company <em>does.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Does it make hardware?

Is it going to lease you GPUs to use for your own AI projects?<a href="https://openai.com/index/expanding-economic-opportunity-with-ai/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Is it going to certify you as an AI expert</u></a>? Notice how I've listed a whole bunch of stuff that <em>isn't ChatGPT,</em> which will,<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-says-business-will-burn-115-billion-2029?ref=wheresyoured.at&amp;rc=kz8jh3"> <u>if you look at The Information's reporting</u></a> of its projections, remain the vast majority of its revenue until 2027, at which point "agents" and "new products including free user monetization" will magically kick in.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wheresyoured.at/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-05f160ec-b9a5-4412-bf31-f46fe3822519.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="509" height="452"></figure><h2 id="openai-is-a-boring-and-bad-business"><strong>OpenAI Is A Boring (and Bad) Business</strong></h2><p>In reality, OpenAI is an extremely boring (and bad!) software business. It makes the majority of its revenue selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, and apparently had<a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/640894/chatgpt-has-hit-20-million-paid-subscribers?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>20 million paid subscribers</u></a> (as of April) and<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/openai-raise-chatgpt-users.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>5 million business subscribers</u></a> (as of August,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-to-argue-with-an-ai-booster/#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20a%20hint%20though%3A"> <u>though 500,000 of them are Cal State University seats paid at $2.50 a month</u></a>).</p><p>It also loses incredibly large amounts of money.</p><h3 id="openais-pathetic-api-sales-have-effectively-turned-it-into-any-other-ai-startup"><strong>OpenAI's Pathetic API Sales Have Effectively Turned It Into Any Other AI Startup</strong></h3><p>Yes, I realize that OpenAI also sells access to its API, but as you can see from the chart above, it is making a <em>teeny tiny sliver</em> of revenue from it in 2025, though I will also add that this chart has a little bit of green for "agent" revenue, which means it's very likely bullshit.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/deep-impact/#:~:text=OpenAI%20is%20as,these%20tasks%20yourself.%22"> <u>Operator, OpenAI's so-called agent, is barely functional</u></a>, and I have no idea how anyone would even begin to charge money for it outside of "please try my broken product."</p><p>In any case, API sales appear to be a very, very small part of OpenAI's revenue stream, and that heavily suggests a lack of interest in integrating its models at scale.</p><p>Worse still, this effectively turns OpenAI <em>into an AI startup.</em></p><p>Think about it: if OpenAI can't make the majority of its money through "innovating" in the development of large language models (LLMs), then it’s just another company plugging LLMs into its software. While ChatGPT may be a very popular product, it is, by definition (and in its name!) a GPT wrapper, with the few differences being that OpenAI pays its own immediate costs, has the people necessary to continue improving its own models, and also continually makes promises to convince people it’s <strong><em>anything other than just another AI startup.</em></strong></p><p>In fact, the only<em> real</em> difference is the amount of money backing it. Otherwise, OpenAI could be literally any foundation model company, and with a lack of real innovation within those models, it’s just another startup trying to find ways to monetize generative AI,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/why-everybody-is-losing-money-on-ai/"> <u>an industry that only ever seems to lose money</u></a>.</p><p>As a result, we should start <em>evaluating </em>OpenAI as just another AI startup, as its promises do not appear to mesh with any coherent strategy, other than "<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-onetrillion/"><u>we need $1 trillion dollars</u></a>." There does not seem to be much of a plan on a day-to-day basis, nor does there seem to be one about <em>what </em>OpenAI should be, other than that OpenAI will be a consumer hardware, consumer software, enterprise SaaS and data center operator, as well as running a social network.</p><p>As I've discussed<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-fried/#:~:text=Despite%20what%20fantasists"> <u>many</u></a><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/godot-isnt-making-it/#:~:text=data%20(April).-,I%20shared%20concerns,-in%20July%20that"> <u>times</u></a>, LLMs are inherently flawed due to their probabilistic nature."Hallucinations" — when a model authoritatively states something is true when it isn't (or takes an action that seems the most likely course of action, even if it isn't the right one) — are a "<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/4059383/openai-admits-ai-hallucinations-are-mathematically-inevitable-not-just-engineering-flaws.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>mathematically inevitable</u></a>" according to OpenAI's own research feature of the technology, meaning that there is <em>no fixing their most glaring, obvious problem</em>, even with "perfect data."</p><p>I'd wager the reason OpenAI is so eager to build out so much capacity while leaking so many diverse business lines is an attempt to get away from a dark truth: that when you peel away the hype, ChatGPT is a wrapper, every product it makes is a wrapper, <em>and OpenAI is pretty fucking terrible at making products.</em></p><p>Today I'm going to walk you through a fairly unique position: that OpenAI is just another boring AI startup lacking any meaningful product roadmap or strategy, using the press as a tool to pump its bags while very rarely delivering on what it’s promised. It is a company with massive amounts of cash, industrial backing, and brand recognition, and otherwise is, much like its customers, desperately trying to work out how to make money selling products built on top of Large Language Models.</p><p>OpenAI lives and dies on its mythology as the center of innovation in the world of AI, yet reality is so much more mediocre. Its revenue growth is slowing, its products are commoditized, its models are hardly state-of-the-art,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-case-against-generative-ai/"> <u>the overall generative AI industry has lost its sheen</u></a>, and its killer app is a mythology that has converted a handful of very rich people and very few others.</p><p>OpenAI spent,<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-first-half-results-4-3-billion-sales-2-5-billion-cash-burn?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>according to The Information</u></a>, 150% ($6.7 billion in costs) of its H1 2025 revenue ($4.3 billion) on research and development, producing<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-does-gpt-5-work/"> <u>the deeply-underwhelming GPT-5</u></a> and Sora 2, an app that I estimate costs it upwards of $5 for each video generation,<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>based on Azure's published rates for the first Sora model</u></a>, though it's my belief that these rates are unprofitable, all so that it can gain a few more users.</p><p>To be clear, R&amp;D is good, and useful, and in my experience, the companies that spend deeply on this tend to be the ones that do well. The reason why Huawei has managed to outpace its American rivals in several key areas — like automotive technology and telecommunications — is because it <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250902/5g/huawei-spending?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>spends around a quarter of its revenue</u></a> on developing new technologies and entering new markets, rather than stock buybacks and dividends.</p><p>The difference is that said R&amp;D spending is both sustainable and useful, and has led to Huawei becoming much a stronger business, even <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/05/21/2019-10616/addition-of-entities-to-the-entity-list?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>as it languishes on a Treasury Department entity list that effectively cuts it off from US-made or US-origin parts or IP</u></a>. Considering that OpenAI’s R&amp;D spending <em>was 38.28% of its cash-on-hand</em> by the end of the period (totalling $17.5bn, which we’ll get to later), and what we’ve seen as a result, it’s hard to describe it as <em>either</em> sustainable <em>or</em> useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI isn't <em>innovative,</em> it’s <em>exploitative, </em>a giant multi-billion dollar grift attempting to hide how deeply <em>unexciting</em> it is, and how nonsensical it is to continue backing it<em>.</em> Sam Altman is an excellent operator, capable of spreading his mediocre, half-baked mantras about<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/politico.com/post/3m25ob7qipc2s?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>how 2025 was the year AI got smarter than us</u></a>, or<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-ai-infrastructure-1-gw-per-week-stargate-2025-9?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>how we'll be building 1GW data centers each week</u></a> (something that, by my estimations, takes 2.5 years), taking advantage of how many people in the media, markets and global governments don't know a fucking <em>thing</em> about anything.</p><p>OpenAI is&nbsp; also getting desperate.</p><p>Beneath the surface of the media hype and trillion-dollar promises is a company struggling to maintain relevance, its entire existence built on top of hype and mythology.</p><p>And at this rate, I believe it’s going to miss its 2025 revenue projections, all while burning billions more than anyone has anticipated.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/microsoft_maia_dc/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/microsoft_maia_dc/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45463642">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft buys a lot of GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD. But moving forward, Redmond's leaders want to shift the majority of its AI workloads from GPUs to its own homegrown accelerators.</p>
<p>The software titan is rather late to the custom silicon party. While Amazon and Google have been building custom CPUs and AI accelerators for years, Microsoft only <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/11/15/microsoft-holds-chip-makers-feet-to-the-fire-with-homegrown-cpu-and-ai-chips/">revealed</a> its Maia AI accelerators in late 2023.</p>
<p>Driving the transition is a focus on performance per dollar, which for a hyperscale cloud provider is arguably the only metric that really matters. Speaking during a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/microsoft-wants-to-mainly-use-its-own-ai-chips-in-the-future.html">fireside</a> chat moderated by CNBC on Wednesday, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott said that up to this point, Nvidia has offered the best price-performance, but he's willing to entertain anything in order to meet demand.</p>

    

<p>Going forward, Scott suggested Microsoft hopes to use its homegrown chips for the majority of its datacenter workloads.</p>

        


        

<p>When asked, "Is the longer term idea to have mainly Microsoft silicon in the data center?" Scott responded, "Yeah, absolutely."</p>
<p>Later, he told CNBC, "It's about the entire system design. It's the networks and cooling, and you want to be able to have the freedom to make decisions that you need to make in order to really optimize your compute for the workload."</p>

        

<p>With its first in-house AI accelerator, the Maia 100, Microsoft was able to free up GPU capacity by shifting OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to its own silicon back in 2023. However, with just 800 teraFLOPS of BF16 performance, 64GB of HBM2e, and 1.8TB/s of memory bandwidth, the chip fell well short of competing GPUs from Nvidia and AMD.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/27/alibaba_ai_drive/">Alibaba unveils $53B global AI plan – but it will need GPUs to back it up</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/11/nvidias_graceblackwell_drives_arms_cpu/">Arm wrestles away 25% share of server market thanks to Nvidia's home-grown CPUs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/11/sipearl_rhea1_reference_design/">SiPearl ships reference node design for Rhea1 high-spec Arm chip</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/01/arm_datacenter_cpu_market/">Arm reckons it'll own 50% of the datacenter by year's end</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft is <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-scales-back-ambitions-ai-chips-overcome-delays">reportedly</a> in the process of bringing a second-generation Maia accelerator to market next year that will no doubt offer more competitive compute, memory, and interconnect performance.</p>
<p>But while we may see a change in the mix of GPUs to AI ASICs in Microsoft data centers moving forward, they're unlikely to replace Nvidia and AMD's chips entirely.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Google and Amazon have deployed tens of thousands of their TPUs and Trainium accelerators. While these chips have helped them secure some high-profile customer wins, Anthropic for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/04/project_rainier_deep_dive/">example</a>, these chips are more often used to accelerate the company's own in-house workloads.</p>
<p>As such, we continue to see large-scale Nvidia and AMD GPU deployments on these cloud platforms, in part because customers still want them.</p>

        

<p>It should be noted that AI accelerators aren't the only custom chips Microsoft has been working on. Redmond also has its own CPU called <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/microsoft-wants-to-mainly-use-its-own-ai-chips-in-the-future.html">Cobalt</a> and a whole host of platform security silicon <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/microsoft_silicon_security/">designed</a> to accelerate cryptography and safeguard key exchanges across its vast datacenter domains. ®</p>

</p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-dXZrtT99" data-typeid="37955882" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="J"><p><span>The Faroe Islands are like the child that Denmark and Iceland had, but forgot to tell the world about. This group of eighteen small islands receives the least amount of sunshine in the world per year. Constant rain and heavy winds have always battered these lands.</span></p><p><span>Politically part of Denmark (for now) but fiercely independent in spirit, the Faroes exist in their own bubble of Nordic culture. Here, sheep outnumber humans two to one, villages of colorful houses cling to clifftops like they're holding on for dear life, and the weather can shift from apocalyptic storms to sunny calm in the space of an hour.</span></p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-KLNM5hjr" data-typeid="37955962" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="F"><div><p><span>Situated between Iceland, Norway and Scotland, the Faroes face the brunt of the North Atlantic weather system. Constant storms and crashing waves have sculpted the volcanic rock over millions of years into some of the most jaw-dropping (and vertigo-inducing) coastlines on Earth. These towering basalt cliffs can reach heights of over 400 meters, dropping straight into churning seas below.</span></p><p><span>What's most striking is how abruptly the land stops. </span><span>There are no sandy beaches or gentle slopes here—the islands simply plunge headfirst into the Atlantic. One step you're on grass-covered clifftops, the next you're staring down hundreds of meters of sheer volcanic rock to where waves explode against the base far below.</span></p></div><p><span>The weather here is unpredictable, and changes faster than you can put your raincoat on—one minute you're in thick fog, the next you're hit with winds and piercing rain that'll knock you sideways, then suddenly the clouds part to reveal views that'll make your camera work overtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-ZH7xXVtm" data-typeid="37956016" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="qd"><div><p><span>Meet the true locals of the Faroes. These wooly sheep have been roaming the islands for over a thousand years, and they outnumber people on the islands. They couldn't care less about your hiking plans and will casually block paths or graze on the edge of 200-meter cliffs like it's the most natural thing in the world.</span></p><p><span id="yui_3_8_0_1_1751237474731_12967">Faroe's name comes from a combination of </span><span>fær</span><span> (sheep) and </span><span>eyjar</span><span> (islands).&nbsp;</span></p></div><p><span> Unlike their farm-bound cousins elsewhere, Faroese sheep roam completely free across the islands, somehow always managing to find the most photogenic spots for an impromptu rest.&nbsp;</span><span>This fellow right&nbsp; here is the only one that gave me any sort of attention. Otherwise, they are all busy grazing on all the grass they could ever ask for.</span></p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-sXQLR85m" data-typeid="37956238" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="R"><p><span>Why fight the landscape? For over a millennium, islanders have been topping their huts with birch bark and soil and let the grass grow wild. They act as insulation, and the thick roots are an excellent waterproof seal against the weather.</span></p><p><span>The grass grows quickly and does need tending every once in a while. In typical Faroese fashion, the solution is simple: put a sheep on top for an afternoon.</span></p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-MvFwhQxs" data-typeid="37956265" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="xx"><p><span>On the northern tip of Kalsoy lies the Kallur lighthouse. Like most regions on the islands, the land is privately owned. Hiking usually incurs a modest fee paid at the trailhead to the land owners, and the rest is up to you. Trails are just sheep paths, worn smooth by countless hooves over years rather than any official trail maintenance.</span></p><p><span>There are no guardrails, no warning signs, and definitely no liability waivers - just you, the weather, and whatever route the sheep decided made sense. The approach to Kallur is particularly gnarly, following a knife-edge ridge with steep drops on both sides before reaching the lighthouse perched dramatically on sea cliffs.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-vP2j2prb" data-typeid="37956732" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="B9"><p><span>In </span><span>No Time To Die (2021)</span><span>, </span><span>Daniel Craig's James Bond meets his end at the villain's lair, which happened to be here on Kalsoy. The Faroese then followed through with the obvious next step.</span></p>

<p dir="auto">Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never "overflow" onto an adjacent monitor.</p>
<p dir="auto">Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there's always one empty workspace present all the way down.</p>
<p dir="auto">The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.</p>

<p dir="auto">Also check out this video from Brodie Robertson that showcases a lot of the niri functionality: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeYx2exm04M" rel="nofollow">Niri Is My New Favorite Wayland Compositor</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Status</h2><a id="user-content-status" aria-label="Permalink: Status" href="#status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#niri:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">Matrix channel</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://yalter.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html" rel="nofollow">Getting Started</a> page.
Have your <a href="https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar">waybar</a>s and <a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel" rel="nofollow">fuzzel</a>s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out <a href="https://github.com/Vortriz/awesome-niri">awesome-niri</a>, a list of niri-related links and projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some points you may have questions about:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Multi-monitor</strong>: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.</li>
<li><strong>Fractional scaling</strong>: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.</li>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong>: seems to work fine.</li>
<li><strong>Floating windows</strong>: yes, starting from niri 25.01.</li>
<li><strong>Input devices</strong>: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use <a href="https://opentabletdriver.net/" rel="nofollow">OpenTabletDriver</a>.
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.</li>
<li><strong>Wlr protocols</strong>: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on <a href="https://wayland.app/" rel="nofollow">wayland.app</a> at the bottom of each protocol's page.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I've seen someone use it fine on an Eee&nbsp;PC&nbsp;900 from&nbsp;2008, of all things.</li>
<li><strong>Xwayland</strong>: <a href="https://yalter.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite" rel="nofollow">integrated</a> via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.</li>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Inspiration</h2><a id="user-content-inspiration" aria-label="Permalink: Inspiration" href="#inspiration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Niri is heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a> which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell's global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The way we consume content on the internet is increasingly driven by walled-garden platforms and black-box feed algorithms. This shift is making our media diets miserable. Ironically, a solution to the problem predates algorithmic feeds, social media and other forms of informational junk food. It is called RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and it is beautiful.</p><p>RSS is just a format that defines how websites can publish updates (articles, posts, episodes, and so on) in a standard feed that you can subscribe to using an RSS reader (or aggregator). Don’t worry if this sounds extremely uninteresting to you; there aren’t many people that get excited about format specifications; the beauty of RSS is in its simplicity. Any content management system or blog platform supports RSS out of the box, and often enables it by default. As a result, a large portion of the content on the internet is available to you in feeds that you can tap into. But this time, you’re in full control of what you’re receiving, and the feeds are purely reverse chronological bliss. Coincidentally, you might already be using RSS without even knowing, because the whole podcasting world <a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/business-of-podcasting/podcasts-need-an-rss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runs on RSS</a>.</p><p>There are many amazing articles about the utility and elegance of RSS, and I do not think the world needs another, so I will spare you and instead focus on my personal experience and tips. If you are interested in a deeper dive, I highly recommend Molly White’s article <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curate your own newspaper with RSS</a>. It is a convincing, well-written article that you can also listen to in Molly’s own voice if you wish to.</p><h2 id="broken-distribution-models">Broken distribution models</h2><p>Here’s a little story about the promise of social media. In 2011, my <a href="https://somnusaeternus.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">band</a> was getting a little more serious and preparing to record our first album. Facebook was rapidly growing all over the world, so I created an account - mostly to manage my band’s Facebook page. Back then, social media (and Facebook in particular) felt very different: vibrant and full of promise for the brave new future of web 2.0. I looked up all my favorite bands so that every time they put out an album or tour near me, I wouldn’t miss it. Many bands either lacked proper websites or rarely updated them in a useful way, so this felt like the perfect use case for Facebook.</p><p>It didn’t take long for me to start seeing the cracks. As Facebook would push for more engagement, some bands would flood their pages with multiple posts per day, especially if they were touring or had a new release coming up. Others would be more restrained, but then their posts would often be lost in the feed. There was no way to opt in only for a certain type of updates from my followed pages, and the increasingly algorithmic feed would simply prioritize posts by engagement. I realized that I wouldn’t be able to get just the <strong>important</strong> updates; instead, I’d get a wild mish-mash of engagement-bait that I wasn’t willing to work my way through. And don’t get me started about how over time, page owners had to pay to promote their posts to get any reach on the platform - that is simply extortion.</p><p>I no longer use Facebook (or any similar social media for that matter) for many reasons, though algorithmic feeds are at the top of the list. Algorithms on social media are very unlikely to be written with your best interest in mind: The goal of social media is to keep you glued to the feed for as long as possible. It optimizes for the most time spent, for engagement, for serving the most ads. It will not necessarily optimize for keeping you well informed, showing you balanced opinions, giving you control or even showing you all the information you’d like. The misalignment of incentives has become very apparent in the last few years, but the problem goes deeper. Any type of curation (because algorithmic feeds are simply curation machines) will never be flexible enough to account for every person’s needs. The story we are sold with algorithmic curation is that it adapts to everyone’s taste and interests, but that’s only true until the interests of the advertisers enter the picture.</p><p>My RSS journey starting many moons ago with Opera and Thunderbird, continued with Google Reader (RIP) and <a href="https://www.theoldreader.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Old Reader</a>, and finally led me to running my own instance of <a href="https://www.freshrss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshRSS</a>. However, in the last year, I have read most of the content from my RSS feeds on my phone via the <a href="https://github.com/seazon/FeedMe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FeedMe</a> app. I find that it scratches the itch of unlocking your phone and wanting to see something novel (probably gravitating towards social media). On the upside, it feeds me only articles and media that a) I have picked upfront and nothing more, b) is typically longer-form and more thoughtful than your typical social media posts.</p><p>Also, unlike algorithmic feeds, it allows me to pick what category of my interests I am in the mood for. If I’m in the mood for something lighter, I can just look into my “Fun” folder to check out new stuff from <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Oatmeal</a> or <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xkcd</a>. If I feel like reading something more thoughtful, I’d dive into my “Reads” folder for <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Marginalian</a> or <a href="https://sentiers.media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sentiers</a>. Feeling like catching up on the newest AI research? I can browse the latest research papers from <a href="https://arxiv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arXiv</a> that have specific keywords in the abstracts (such as prompt injection). Or I could just browse everything at once to see what piques my interest. I am the master of what information I consume, how and in what order, and no one can take that away from me by rearranging my feed or tweaking the algorithm.</p><p>One of the many small advantages is the consistency of the interface and the lack of distractions when reading. Modern browsers support reader modes, but you need to enter the mode manually and some pages might not be displayed correctly. I don’t have any attention problems (that I know of), but reading articles on certain newspaper sites feels like a cruel joke: the text of the article is often drowned by ads, suggested articles, polls, and other visual smog. Not a pleasant reading experience. Your RSS reader always uses the same font, font size, screen real estate and never shows anything but the article itself.</p><p>The focused, reductive nature of RSS readers means you don’t get the full website experience, but that is arguably for the better in a lot of cases. We already mentioned the lack of suggested articles with engagement bait that could easily draw you in, but another notable omission is the comments section. It is very easy to slip into the comments section at the bottom of an article and spend far too much time reading those. You can still do that in an RSS reader by opening the article in your browser, scrolling down to the comments and diving in. At least in my case, that is a safe amount of friction to prevent me from doing it most of the time. Less is more!</p><h2 id="tips-to-get-you-going">Tips to get you going</h2><ul><li>Many of the websites you open regularly, follow on social media or get a newsletter from, likely have an RSS feed. Look out for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Feed-icon.svg#/media/File:Feed-icon.svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSS icon</a> or the words RSS or feed. There are also tools like <a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/tools/feed-finder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lighthouse</a> that can sniff out the feed for you. That said, my experience is that simply adding the homepage URL of the website into an aggregator usually works.</li><li>Remember my frustration with Facebook as a source of news for new music releases? Turns out there is a much better free solution called <a href="https://muspy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muspy</a>, where you enter all your favorite artists and it will notify you of their new releases. And guess what? You either get notified via email, or you use your personal RSS feed. Highly recommended!</li><li>Start easy with something like <a href="https://www.theoldreader.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Old Reader</a> or <a href="https://feedly.com/news-reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedly</a> - both offer relatively generous free tiers. And if you outgrow them or want to try something else, you simply export an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OPML</a> file with all your feeds and import them into your new RSS solution. This is the upside of open standards: freedom, ownership, and portability.</li><li>Once you have more than 5-10 feeds, start putting them into folders/categories. No need to overthink it, but doing this will help you be more selective about the content you read if you’re in a specific mood.</li><li>RSS readers can be great when traveling or whenever your internet connection might be down or spotty. You can set up your RSS client in a way that automatically fetches new content, so when you board the plane and go dark, you can still read through the already downloaded articles.

<p>From <a href="https://awsm.nz/digital-id-the-new-chains-of-capitalist-surveillance/">https://awsm.nz/digital-id-the-new-chains-of-capitalist-surveillance/</a></p>



<p>The world is entering an era where identity is no longer a matter of personal relationships, lived experience, or even paperwork. Increasingly, it is reduced to biometric scans, algorithmic verification, and digital tokens. Across the globe, governments and corporations are rolling out digital identification systems, facial recognition passports, biometric driver’s licences, app-based vaccine passes, QR-coded welfare access, and unified digital wallets. The language that accompanies these projects is familiar – efficiency, convenience, modernisation, inclusion. We are told that digital ID will make life easier, reduce fraud, and open new opportunities.</p>



<p>The reality, however, is far more sinister. Identification has never been neutral, it has always been a weapon of power, wielded by states and capitalists to monitor, control, and discipline populations. From passports to colonial passbooks, from welfare cards to border regimes, the apparatus of identification has always been tied to domination. Digital ID is simply the latest iteration of this long history, but with a scale and sophistication that makes its dangers even more profound. Far from liberating us, it is forging new chains and binding us more tightly to systems of surveillance, exclusion, and exploitation.</p>



<p><strong>Identification as Domination</strong></p>



<p>To grasp what digital ID represents, we must situate it within the longer history of identification as a tool of authority. The passport, now normalised as a necessary object of travel, was originally a way for states to restrict movement. In medieval Europe, peasants and serfs required written permission to leave their estates. Colonial regimes across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific perfected these systems of control, forcing indigenous people to carry passes while settlers roamed unhindered. In apartheid South Africa, the “pass laws” criminalised Black South Africans for existing outside their assigned zones, reducing life itself to a bureaucratic calculation of permission.</p>



<p>Identification has never been about protecting the individual; it has been about protecting property relations. States have needed to know who people are in order to tax them, conscript them, and deny them rights. Employers demanded papers to guarantee that workers were legally exploitable. Landlords used identification to screen tenants, banks to gate-keep credit, police to track dissenters. The notion of “identity” under capitalism has always been bound up with surveillance and discipline.</p>



<p>Digital ID does not break from this tradition but it intensifies it. What once required a physical stamp or signature now demands a biometric scan or QR code. Where once a police officer demanded to see your papers, now an algorithm silently determines your access. The shift is not from control to freedom, but from analogue domination to digital domination.</p>



<p><strong>The Logic of Digital ID</strong></p>



<p>Behind the rhetoric of convenience lies the hard logic of capital and the state. Digital ID is not being built for us, it is being built to extend the power of those who already govern our lives.</p>



<p>At its core, digital ID represents the enclosure of access. Increasingly, the essentials of life, healthcare, housing, employment, welfare, travel, are gated behind digital checkpoints. Without the correct identification, people are excluded. This transforms existence itself into a series of permissions, each mediated by algorithmic verification. Access to food, shelter, or work becomes conditional on whether a machine recognises your fingerprint or face.</p>



<p>It also expands surveillance capitalism. Every scan, swipe, or login generates data. This data is stored, tracked, and monetised. Digital ID reduces human beings to data streams, feeding the profits of corporations like Microsoft, Mastercard, and Accenture, companies deeply embedded in global ID initiatives. Far from empowering individuals, digital ID empowers corporations by turning our lives into commodities to be sold.</p>



<p>Digital ID also disciplines labour. By tying welfare payments, work permits, or banking access to digital identity, states and corporations acquire powerful new tools to coerce populations. In India, the Aadhaar biometric system has left millions excluded from rations and pensions when fingerprints failed to scan, producing not efficiency but hunger. Migrant workers across the world are increasingly monitored through digital verification, making precarious labour even more vulnerable.</p>



<p>Perhaps most insidiously, digital ID normalises surveillance itself. By embedding digital checkpoints into daily life, whether entering a building, logging into a service, or accessing healthcare, surveillance becomes routine. What once might have provoked outrage becomes ordinary. Control does not need to be imposed violently when it is integrated seamlessly into the everyday functions of existence.</p>



<p>The consequences of digital ID are not abstract. Around the world, its implementation reveals the sharp edges of exclusion and control.</p>



<p>As already mentioned India’s Aadhaar project, the largest biometric ID system in history, covers over a billion people. It was presented as a means of reducing corruption and expanding access to welfare. In reality, it has excluded millions of poor and rural people from food rations and pensions because their fingerprints did not register. Reports have documented starvation deaths when families were denied grain for lack of proper authentication. For the poor, the system is not convenience, it is a death sentence.</p>



<p>In Europe, digital ID takes a different but equally insidious form. The EU is developing a unified “digital identity wallet” for banking, healthcare, and travel, promoted as freedom for citizens. At the same time, the Eurodac database stores the fingerprints of asylum seekers to enforce deportations and prevent secondary movement. Digital ID here is double-edged, advertised as seamless mobility for the privileged, but functioning as chains for migrants.</p>



<p>Across Africa, the World Bank and multinational corporations are funding digital ID projects under the guise of “financial inclusion.” Tied to mobile money systems, these IDs are less about inclusion than about expanding debt markets and integrating populations into circuits of extraction. They replicate colonial practices where identification was a prerequisite for resource exploitation and labour discipline.</p>



<p>In settler-colonial states like New Zealand and Australia, digital driver’s licences and facial recognition technologies are being trialled under the language of security and convenience. But both countries maintain extensive databases of their populations, and both have long histories of surveillance and repression against indigenous peoples and political activists. Digital ID here strengthens existing patterns of racialised and political control, embedding them in everyday transactions.</p>



<p><strong>The Role of the State</strong></p>



<p>For anarchists, it is no surprise that the state is at the centre of these developments. The state has never been a neutral provider of services. It is a machinery of class rule, designed to enforce property relations and maintain hierarchy. Digital ID offers the state new levels of efficiency in population management. Welfare can be rationed through digital checkpoints, ensuring that only the “deserving” poor receive aid. Policing is strengthened through biometric databases, making dissent and protest more dangerous. Borders become omnipresent, extending into every workplace, clinic, and street corner. Even the ritual of voting is increasingly tied to digital verification, further legitimising the state’s hold.</p>



<p>But the state does not act alone. The infrastructure of digital ID is outsourced to corporations, tech giants and consultancy firms whose profits depend on extracting and selling data. ID2020, the flagship global digital ID initiative, is a partnership between Microsoft, Accenture, Gavi, and Mastercard. This fusion of state power and corporate capital creates a techno-bureaucratic regime that is incredibly difficult to resist at the level of the individual. It is not simply your government demanding your data, it is a web of global corporations embedding control into the infrastructure of daily life.</p>



<p><strong>Resistance and Its Possibilities</strong></p>



<p>And yet, systems of domination are never total. The chains of digital ID can be resisted, but the struggle requires collective defiance. Individuals cannot simply opt out when access to food, housing, or healthcare is increasingly contingent on digital verification. Resistance must be social, coordinated, and rooted in solidarity.</p>



<p>It begins with exposing the lie of convenience. The marketing of digital ID depends on people believing it is in their interests. By revealing its function as surveillance, exclusion, and profit-making, we can puncture the narrative that it is a neutral technological advance. Convenience is the sugar that coats the poison pill.</p>



<p>Resistance also means standing with those most affected by exclusion. When people are denied access to food or healthcare because a machine rejects them, solidarity demands that communities step in. Mutual aid networks, food distribution, and grassroots healthcare can undermine the state’s monopoly on survival. By caring for each other without demanding documents, communities demonstrate the possibility of life beyond identification.</p>



<p>Direct action has its place as well. Surveillance infrastructure can be disrupted, whether through physical sabotage, digital hacktivism, or leaks that expose the collusion of states and corporations. Every act that slows the expansion of digital ID chips away at its inevitability.</p>



<p>Perhaps most crucially, resistance means refusing to internalise the normalisation of surveillance. We must continue to feel anger each time a new checkpoint is introduced, each time a new biometric system is trialled, each time a new database is constructed. The greatest victory of power is not when it controls us, but when it convinces us that control is natural.</p>



<p>Digital ID is not a neutral innovation. It is the frontier of capitalist surveillance and state control. It deepens exploitation, excludes the vulnerable, and integrates every aspect of life into the machinery of profit and domination. Identification has always been a tool of authority, from medieval passes to apartheid laws, and digital ID is the most sophisticated form yet.</p>



<p>The ruling class wants us to believe digital ID is inevitable. But inevitability is the language of power. Systems of domination can be resisted, sabotaged, dismantled. The struggle against digital ID is not about nostalgia for the days of paper documents; it is about defending the very possibility of living without being constantly monitored, verified, and reduced to data.</p>



<p>What is at stake is not simply privacy, but freedom itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://blender.org/">Blender</a> 4.5 LTS <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-5/">was released</a>
on July 15, 2025, and will be supported through 2027. This is the last
feature release of the 3D graphics-creation suite's 4.x series; it
includes quality-of-life improvements, including work to bring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan">Vulkan</a> backend up to
par with the default OpenGL backend. With 4.5 released, Blender
developers are turning their attention toward Blender 5.0, planned for
release later this year. It will introduce substantial changes,
particularly in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/introduction.html">Geometry
Nodes</a> system, a central feature of Blender's procedural
workflows.</p>

<h4>Brief introduction</h4>

<p>Blender is an open-source creative application released under the GPLv3.
The <a href="https://www.blender.org/foundation/">Blender Foundation</a>
stewards development, with significant funding from the <a href="https://fund.blender.org/">Blender Development Fund</a> as well
as backing from individual contributors and industry sponsors. Its
code is primarily written in C and <span>C++</span>,
with Python used extensively for scripting and add-ons.</p>

<p>While Blender is often known as a 3D modeling and animation tool,
it has grown into a comprehensive open-source suite for digital
content creation. Alongside powerful 3D tools, it features
compositing, <a href="https://www.blender.org/features/video-editing/">nonlinear
video editing</a>, and 2D animation in 3D space. This integrated suite
of tools enables designers, animators, and other creators to work with
a single application across their digital pipeline. Blender also
provides access to its core functions through <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/controls/nodes/introduction.html">Nodes</a>,
a visual programming system that enables procedural workflows for
complex operations. The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/grease_pencil/introduction.html">Grease
Pencil tool</a>, also accessible through the Geometry Nodes system, is
used for 2D animation, cut-out animation, motion graphics, and more. Blender's procedural systems rely heavily
on these node-based graphical interfaces, and the 4.5 LTS focuses on
their continued evolution. These systems enable fully non-destructive
workflows, preserving all original data at every stage of the editing
process.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Blender strives to be compatible with visual-effects (VFX) industry
standards through alignment with the <a href="https://vfxplatform.com/">VFX Reference Platform</a>, which is
updated annually. This allows Blender to be run on the same systems as
other VFX software, as well as share files with them. 4.5 brings <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/136540">a
slew of library updates</a> to maintain alignment with the reference
platform.</p>

<h4>A solid foundation</h4>

<p>Historically, Blender has relied
on <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> for drawing its user
interface and powering its 3D-display capabilities. However, efforts
are underway to modernize this aspect of its core functionality
by <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/gpu/">abstracting
away the rendering backend</a>, bringing support for running on additional
graphics APIs, including Vulkan
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_%28API%29">Apple's
Metal API</a>. The Vulkan API is a
low-overhead, cross-platform standard that allows applications like
Blender to communicate more directly with GPU hardware than OpenGL. Being the
final feature release of the 4.x series, this LTS brings a critical
step in the maturity of
the <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/eevee/#vulkan">Vulkan
backend</a>. Though still not enabled by default due to multiple
outstanding issues, it now rivals the OpenGL backend in both features
and performance.</p>

<p>Vulkan is built on a <a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/17_Multithreading.html">parallel-execution model</a>, allowing applications to send multiple commands
to the GPU simultaneously, while OpenGL relies on a sequential
model. Vulkan's execution model makes better use of the increased number
of cores found in modern GPUs. This is a <a href="https://code.blender.org/2023/10/vulkan-project-update/">crucial
step</a> toward smoother viewport performance and more responsive
interaction with complex scenes.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/eevee/#limitations">known
limitations</a> still blocking the new backend from being adopted as
the default. Notably, large meshes with 100-million vertices or
more are not yet supported, resulting in poor performance on the
Vulkan backend for virtual reality and other high-mesh-count
applications. Future driver updates may address some of these
issues.</p>

<p>The viewport in Blender is an interactive view space where 3D
scenes are displayed and constructed. Rendering converts 3D scenes
into 2D images or video, producing the final output with Blender's
built-in engines or third-party renderers. Rendering can also be
performed without the graphical interface by running Blender in
headless mode, both on individual systems and at scale on render
farms. The viewport and rendering upgrades in Blender 4.5 extend
beyond the improvements to its Vulkan backend. Specifically, work
continues
on <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/eevee/introduction.html">EEVEE</a>,
the realtime rendering engine built for rapid, interactive rendering
on modern GPUs. EEVEE 2.0, also known as EEVEE Next, receives several
critical improvements focused on stability and visual
accuracy. Shadows now render more smoothly thanks to the addition
of <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/81c00bf272f22dc732b0fc8c9d7db39c5f916a07">shadow
terminator normal bias</a>. This is an area where EEVEE has struggled
to match other renderers, including Blender's
own <a href="https://www.cycles-renderer.org/">Cycles rendering
engine</a>.</p>

<p>Two settings control shadow termination bias: "Geometry Offset" and "Shading
Offset", <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/render/cycles/object_settings/object_data.html#shading">found
in the "Shading" tab</a> of the "Object Properties" panel. This gives
artists greater control over the position and angle of
shadows. However, due to the difficulties of creating shadows that work
equally well for all projects, the default for these settings is
"no bias". These visual improvements coincide with fixes for rendering
problems such as <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/b01cdf7df2ba62c66cf0fce4521d65afa46acf52">light
leaking from large light sources</a>. Light leaking is a phenomenon
where light incorrectly passes through or around solid objects,
creating unrealistic bright spots in the rendered scene. Overall,
these changes aim to bring EEVEE Next closer to parity with other
renderers.</p>

<p>Beyond rendering quality, this LTS release delivers 
improvements to workflow fluidity. Texture loading, shader
compilation, and startup times all contribute to overall performance
and user experience, and all
three <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/eevee/#performance">have
been improved</a>. Textures are now loaded
using <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/1d638c0f5e8b90c41fec92147d9fcd286aec015c">a
deferred, multithreaded process</a>, resulting in more than double the
speed of the previous method. This change introduces a small CPU
overhead due to loading textures before redrawing the viewport, but
the cost is not significant enough to severely impact performance.</p>

<p>Shaders
are <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/1c47e31367b78a770d8ad5452d2e80cab5b51e94">also
now compiled in parallel</a>. Crucially, this
optimization is independent of the viewport backend in use, whether
Vulkan or OpenGL, translating to immediate benefits from these core
improvements. That said,
a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/preferences/system.html#:~:text=Shader%20Compilation-,method,-Defines%20the%20method">new
preference</a> allows users to revert to sub-process shader
calculation, if desired, which is faster but consumes more RAM. Additionally, by skipping unnecessary shading
steps during viewport initialization, startup times have been improved
significantly.</p>

<p>With ongoing efforts to improve the workspace, users can
now <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/properties_editor.html#:~:text=Visible-,tabs,-Allows%20hiding%20specific">control
which tabs are visible</a> in the Properties Editor through the
right-click pop-up
menu. The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/asset_browser.html">Asset
Browser</a>, used for importing and organizing assets (including
scenes, 3D objects, textures, and more), has been
continually refined throughout the 4.x series. In 4.5 LTS, it receives
some key usability enhancements, particularly in how assets are
displayed, such as wrapping long lines used for asset labels, and
making it easier to create thumbnails for assets.</p>

<h4>Nodes, Grease Pencil, and modeling polish</h4>

<p>Rather than focusing solely on fixes
and <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/geometry_nodes/#performance">performance
gains</a>, this cycle emphasized tighter
integration between the various node systems in Blender. The result is
that <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/shader_editor.html">Shader
Nodes</a>, <a href="http://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/compositor.html">Compositor
Nodes</a>,
and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/geometry_node.html">Geometry
Nodes</a> (including Grease Pencil Nodes) now share more capabilities
and have a more consistent workflow.</p>

<p>The common nodes (including mathematical operations)
and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/render/materials/legacy_textures/introduction.html">procedural
textures</a> available with Shader Nodes and Geometry Nodes
are <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/0a80f470f8">now
available</a> for use in the Compositor. This change enables effects
such as procedurally generated visual noise or cloudiness applied to
an image or video during post-processing. Common nodes can be copied
across Shader and Geometry Node setups, further aligning node logic
and capability design across the toolset. In Geometry Nodes, the new
"Set Mesh Normal" node grants artists direct control over custom
normals, which are perpendicular vectors that are used to represent
the orientation of a surface. By allowing users to define normals via
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/fields.html">Fields</a>,
Blender provides <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/mesh/write/set_mesh_normal.html">fine-grained
procedural controls</a> for surface shading. For instance, an animator
could drive this node with a value to simulate a material seamlessly
transitioning from a soft, smooth surface to a rough, hard-edged one,
all without the need for manually editing the mesh.</p>

<p>In
4.5, <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/point_cloud/index.html">Point
Clouds</a> debut
as <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/75717">a
new object type</a>, accessible from the "Add" menu in the viewport or
through various Geometry Nodes. Point Clouds represent objects as a
group of points in 3D space and have long been used in scientific and
industrial 3D scanning. According to the Blender <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/objects/pointcloud/#point-cloud-object">developer
documentation on Point Clouds</a>, this new object
type supports motion graphics, physics simulations (including particle systems),
granular materials (such as sand and gravel), and 3D scanning. To this
end, Blender
includes <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/modeling/point_cloud/tools.html">comprehensive
tools</a>
and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/modeling/point_cloud/editing.html">editable
object attributes</a>, including standard transformations like
rotation and scale. It
also <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/objects/pointcloud/#rendering">maintains
high rendering performance</a> through EEVEE and Cycles, putting point
clouds on par with meshes.</p>

<h4>Looking ahead</h4>

<p>With 4.5 LTS out the door, the Blender developers have shifted
focus to 5.0, the next major release, which is now
under active development. As the beginning of a new, feature-breaking series,
5.0 <a href="https://cgcookie.com/posts/blender-5-0-release-what-do-we-know-and-what-to-look-forward-to">introduces</a>
significant refinements and modernized workflows without abandoning the
<a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/2.80/ui/">user
interface paradigm established by Blender 2.80</a> in 2019. The <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/">release
notes</a> outline several key features planned for the release. Among
these improvements is the ability to <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/ba3eaf3a841388a6e5e44677662be4bffd787e04">mark
scenes as assets</a>, allowing entire scenes with their contents and
setup to be pulled directly into the visual scene editor using the asset browser.</p>

<p>The Grease Pencil
tool in 5.0 <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/f7a000345201f259b94e754341d1b4925c25e8d1">supports</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur_%28media%29">motion
blur</a> effect, controlled by the new "Motion Blur Steps" setting in
the "Grease Pencil" render panel. Linux users now benefit from <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/140277">HDR
support in the viewport</a> on Wayland when using the Vulkan
backend. Additionally, <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/59a759b98d1">a
change to the <tt>.blend</tt> file format to handle larger content</a>
allows Blender to store meshes with
more than a few hundred million vertices. This feature <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/core/#large-buffers-in-blend-files">required
a change</a> to the file structure of the <tt>.blend</tt> file format, meaning
that files created in version 5.0 are incompatible with Blender 4.4
and prior releases, but can be loaded in 4.5 LTS. While the new format
supports meshes with hundreds of millions of vertices, working with
such files still demands powerful hardware, specifically large amounts
of system RAM and GPU memory.</p>

<p>Blender
5.0 <a href="https://devtalk.blender.org/t/gsoc-2025-edit-mesh-mirror-improvements/40369">improves
symmetry</a> in Edit Mode by ensuring mirrored operations no longer
fail or produce inconsistent
results. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping">UV
mapping</a>, the process of unfolding the surface of a 3D model onto a
2D image for applying textures, sees improvements in Blender 5.0
thanks to improved synchronization. This change ensures selections
remain aligned between the viewport and the UV Editor. Blender 5.0
finally resolves this longstanding limitation.</p>

<p dir="auto">FyneDesk is an easy to use Linux/Unix desktop environment following material design.
It is built using the <a href="https://fyne.io/" rel="nofollow">Fyne</a> toolkit and is designed to be
easy to use as well as easy to develop. We use the Go language and welcome
any contributions or feedback for the project.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Wu5k0xZOI" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/01f8520a2c32c022283a1311aea9b453f092192a8f0327e2d9ec7d22309af00f/68747470733a2f2f696d672e796f75747562652e636f6d2f76692f38325775356b30785a4f492f302e6a7067" alt="FyneDesk v0.4" data-canonical-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/82Wu5k0xZOI/0.jpg"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h2><a id="user-content-dependencies" aria-label="Permalink: Dependencies" href="#dependencies"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiling</h3><a id="user-content-compiling" aria-label="Permalink: Compiling" href="#compiling"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Compiling requires the same dependencies as Fyne. See the <a href="https://developer.fyne.io/started/" rel="nofollow">Getting Started</a> documentation for installation steps.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running</h3><a id="user-content-running" aria-label="Permalink: Running" href="#running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For a full desktop experience you will also need the following external tools installed:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>arandr</code> for modifying display settings</li>
<li><code>xbacklight</code> or <code>brightnessctl</code> for laptop brightness</li>
<li><code>connman-gtk</code> is currently used for configuring Wi-Fi network settings</li>
<li><code>compton</code> for compositor support</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The desktop does work without the runtime dependencies but the experience will be degraded.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started</h2><a id="user-content-getting-started" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started" href="#getting-started"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Using standard Go tools you can install FyneDesk using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk"><pre><code>go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will add <code>fynedesk</code> to your $GOPATH (usually ~/go/bin).
You can now run the app in "preview" mode like any other Fyne app.
Doing so is not running a window manager, to do so requires another few steps:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setting up as a desktop environment</h3><a id="user-content-setting-up-as-a-desktop-environment" aria-label="Permalink: Setting up as a desktop environment" href="#setting-up-as-a-desktop-environment"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To use this as your main desktop you can run the following commands to set up
fynedesk as a selectable desktop option in your login manager (such as LightDM for example):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk
cd fynedesk
make
sudo make install"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk
cd fynedesk
make
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can now log out and see that it is in your desktop selection list at login.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Debugging a window manager</h3><a id="user-content-debugging-a-window-manager" aria-label="Permalink: Debugging a window manager" href="#debugging-a-window-manager"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can also run the window manager components in an embedded X window for testing.
You will need the <code>Xephyr</code> tool installed for your platform (often installed as part of Xorg).
Once it is present you can use the following command from the same directory as above:</p>

<p dir="auto">It should look like this:</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/FyshOS/fynedesk/blob/master/desktop-dark-current.png"><img src="https://github.com/FyshOS/fynedesk/raw/master/desktop-dark-current.png" alt="Fyne Desktop - Dark"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">If you run the command when there is a window manager running, or on
an operating system that does not support window managers (Windows or
macOS) then the app will start in UI test mode.
When loaded in this way you can run all of the features except the
controlling of windows - they will load on your main desktop.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Runner</h2><a id="user-content-runner" aria-label="Permalink: Runner" href="#runner"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A desktop needs to be rock solid, and whilst we are working hard to get there,
any alpha or beta software can run into unexpected issues.
For that reason, we have included a <code>fynedesk_runner</code> utility that can help
manage unexpected events. If you start the desktop using the runner, then
if a crash occurs, it will normally recover where it left off with no loss
of data in your applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using standard Go tools you can install the runner using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk_runner"><pre><code>go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk_runner

			Honestly, I think Apple really needs to simplify the iPhone for the elderly. I know there are accessibility modes, but you don’t want to have to go through all that and spend hours trying to customize the phone. Also, the whole phone setup process needs to be delayed; having to go through it for an hour puts them off from even wanting to bother. I first set the phones up to make accounts, but it turns out none of them could understand how to unlock the phone. Entering a passcode was a nightmare because they kept forgetting it, even though it was a birthday they knew, lol.</p><p>

So, I tried Touch ID and Face ID, and that was even more complicated and kept erroring out. Then, the Siri thing kept popping up on the phones with Touch ID, despite turning it off, and the whole swiping from the button kept making the screen go down to the bottom half. :/ There were too many apps; all they wanted was the phone app, but it doesn’t default to the keypad, which was too much for them to find.</p><p>


The phones are too fiddly now, and pressing random things as they try to hold the phone meant the phone got lost in a sea of opening stuff up. So, I tried the assistive access, but why isn’t this an option from the get-go? It asks you the age of setup; why not have a 65+ or something for a senior mode?</p><p>


They don’t need passcodes, accounts, and a sea of information. It’s insane, and it’s insane how fiddly these phones are. I never noticed because I’m used to it, but for these people with hands that barely move, the fake Touch ID button and the swiping from the bottom on Face ID phones seem to be the worst! I think having a proper physical button, like iPhones used to have, would have been superior. The one complaint about the fake button was that it didn’t feel like a real button, so they couldn’t gauge it.</p><p>


I left there achieving nothing because they couldn’t figure out their old Nokia phones. The unlock thing on the keypad was too difficult, and if I turned that off, they kept dialing 999 in their pockets for some reason. That’s why I was there: they were calling emergency services 100 times a day, lol.</p><p>


I think what I’ve realized is that I need to go back with flip phones that answer and hang up when you open and close them. However, the two I tried before didn’t act like that, and they had too many features. I really thought I could make the iPhone simple, but NOPE!</p><p>


Apple should work on their phones to make them more accessible and less fiddly, without having to go through a sea of menus.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://wjgilmore.com/articles/10000-pushups">https://wjgilmore.com/articles/10000-pushups</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45456188">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-mdx-content="true"><p>Headed into 2025 I was fat, out of shape, and lazy. My three young children were running circles around me, and I was increasingly concerned not only about my health in general but about the kind of example I was setting for them. My (very) sedentary job in front of a laptop wasn't helping, nor was the fact that my favorite hobby in the world outside of work is, well, sitting in front of the laptop.</p>
<p>Adding to the general anxiety was the fact I had spent the last two years watching my parents struggle with devastating health issues. My parents had me in their early 20's, so all said they really weren't that much older than I am. My thoughts regularly turned into worry that I'd eventually wind up with my own serious health problems if I didn't get my act together.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something about it, but what? Past attempts to go to a gym weren't successful, and I <em>really</em> did not want to drive any more than I already do serving alongside my wife as a kid taxi. Also, having made half-hearted attempts in the past to get into shape (Orange Theory, P90X, etc) and winding up spending less time exercising than researching the minutiae of max VO2, bicycle construction, and fasting benefits, I knew I had to keep things simple.</p>
<p>While on a post-Christmas family vacation down in Florida I concluded it made sense to set a goal that could help me get into better shape but which also could be completed in small chunks over a long period of time. It was also important that I could do the workout at any point in the day and even in my office if necessary. And thus began the quest to complete 10,000 pushups in one year. Almost 10 months later, this harebrained goal and the many positive effects that came from it changed my life in ways I never imagined.</p>
<h2>January, 2025 - The Pushup Tracker</h2>
<p>While still in Florida I fired up a Google Sheet and added two columns to it: Date and Pushups. And on January 1, 2025 I dropped down and knocked out 30. Well not 30 in a row, mind you. I never could have done that on day 1. It was more like 10, 10, 5, 5 or something like that. Then I wrote it down. On January 2 I upped my game a bit, doing 35 and again immediately logged into the sheet and wrote it down again.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, the reward very much became the opportunity to open that sheet. Can't write the pushup number down if I didn't do the pushups, right? I didn't want to break the chain (although you'll later see I did in fact break the chain plenty of times in the months ahead) and so in the first 31 days I did pushups on 24 of 31 days, logging 1,018 in total and averaging 32.84 per day.</p>
<p>I even worked up the motivation to run on a treadmill one day in January, logging 2.17 miles in 30 minutes on January 14, 2025. Other than that run and pushups, according to my spreadsheet I did no other notable exercise that month.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was also in January that I stopped eating fast food of any type, and as of the day of this writing I've not reversed course on this decision. Long story short we were driving back from <a href="https://codemash.org/">https://codemash.org/</a> and pulled through a McDonalds. I had at that point been eating McDonalds all of my life; nothing over the top mind you, but probably twice a month at least for as long as I can remember. Anyway, the food that day was rancid. Legitimately nauseating. I have no idea why it was that way but I was so turned off that right there and then I swore I'd never touch it again. Coincidentally, over this past weekend I was on a walk and reflecting on some of what I'd been writing in this blog post, and my thoughts turned towards diet. When was the last time you heard somebody (including yourself) say they feel better after eating fast food? We all know the answer to this question: never. This stuff is not food and I feel so much better staying away from this poison.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>February, 2025 - Winter Blues Set In</h2>
<p>Whether it was due to the winter blues or that shiny New Year's resolution already starting to fade, I only logged 848 pushups on 21 of 28 days in February. But I definitely seemed to be getting stronger, averaging 44.63 pushups on those days, and  managed to log a daily high of 117 pushups on February 9, 2025. By the end of February I had logged 1,876 pushups. According to my spreadsheet I also managed to lift weights on February 1, 4, and 10. I have a pretty basic weight set in the basement and although I can't recall the specifics, I was probably standing around listening to CNBC on my phone most of the time.</p>
<h2>March, 2025 - Will the Sun Ever Shine Again?</h2>
<p>I'm not going to sugarcoat it; March was bad, real bad. I only logged 206 pushups on 9 days, averaging 22.9 pushups on those days. It's unclear to me why I'd tailed off so much other than to imagine old man winter was really starting to weigh on me by that point. Even so, those 206 pushups took me to a total of 2,082 pushups for the year.</p>
<h2>April, 2025 - The Sun is Shining Again</h2>
<p>In April my pace picked back up along with the improving weather and increasing sunlight. I completed 375 pushups on 13 days, averaging 28.84 pushups on those days. However I also managed to lift weights on six days in April, went on a run on April 14, and even gave fasting a go for a 28 hour period between April 2-April 3 (not sure I'll do that again).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another lifestyle change unexpectedly happened in April: I basically quit drinking alcohol, wine in particular. This decision was a pretty simple one because as I've gotten older, the hangovers have gotten worse, and my sleep quality has gotten much worse, anytime I drank more than 1-2 drinks. As of this writing (September 28, 2025) I've had maybe 2-3 glasses of wine in almost 5 months. My new alcoholic drink of choice when I feel like having something? Miller Lite. It has low calories, low alcohol content, and you can buy a 12 pack for as much as one bottle of wine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding 375 pushups to the pile took me to a total of 2,457 pushups for 2025.</p>
<h2>May, 2025 - Can I Do a Split?</h2>
<p>Likely due to fear I was going to enter yet another summer rocking the "dad bod", my exercise intensity soared in May. I completed 1,281 pushups over 25 days, averaging 51.24 pushups on those days. On five of those days I completed more than 100 pushups, and on May 18 completed a YTD single day high of 150.</p>
<p>I also became mildly obsessed with the idea of doing a split. While browsing Libby as I love to do at night, I found the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Even-Stiffest-People-Can-Splits/dp/1635651786">Even the Stiffest People Can Do the Splits</a>. The cover showed the author smiling and doing a full split, and I thought well if Eiko says even stiff people can do it then maybe I can too.</p>
<p><img alt="Even the Stiffest People Can Do the Splits" loading="lazy" width="293" height="304" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsplits-book.4dcd7165.png&amp;w=384&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsplits-book.4dcd7165.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsplits-book.4dcd7165.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>Over the course of May I did the splits workout 15 times, and undoubtedly became far more flexible although I never did quite reach a complete split. This continued into June and early July however for reasons I'll explain in a moment I stopped doing the regiment out of fear I'd get hurt. However, to this day I stretch daily and of all the different exercise routines I've tried this year I think aggressive stretching has perhaps had the most ROI of them all.</p>
<p>On May 15 I ran a 5K with my daughter (well she sped ahead of me after mile 1), completing it in 32:50. Not too bad considering according to my log I ran exactly four times in 2025.</p>
<p>Headed into June I had completed a grand total of 3,738 pushups.</p>
<h2>June, 2025 and Doing Pushups at Versailles</h2>
<p>June is where things really started to get exciting. Every year <a href="https://xenon.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xenon Partners</a> runs a friendly intercontinental pushup contest. "Friendly" is a relative term considering I work with numerous combat veterans, retired members of the United States and Australian military services, and a former Mr. Australia contestant. I also spent some time in France with the family, attending the 24 Hours of Le Mans race (amazing btw) and sightseeing around the country, meaning I had to fit pushups in whenever possible, including at Versailles:</p>
<p><img alt="Doing pushups at the Palace of Versailles" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fversailles.43c53bb4.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fversailles.43c53bb4.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fversailles.43c53bb4.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>In June my output soared to 2,014 pushups, and despite all of the traveling managed to do pushups on 24 of 30 days, averaging 91.55 pushups per day. I also set multiple PRs in June, doing 205 pushups on June 1, 222 on June 15, and then 300 on June 27. As of June 30 I had completed a total of 5,752 pushups.</p>
<h2>July, 2025 and the 5/15/500 Race</h2>
<p>Upon returning from Europe I got the bright idea to organize a race called the 5/15/500 Challenge. This involved running 5 miles, biking 15 miles, and then completing 500 body weight exercises. Nevermind that I'd run maybe four times in 2025 and hadn't been on my bike once. Many of my neighbors joined the fun, and we even had t-shirts printed for the occasion. Of course, <a href="https://dumbolympics-absurd-website-antics.lovable.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I also created a website</a>. I did this because I figured having an artificially imposed deadline was going to force me to exercise more often. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p><img alt="My birthday race" loading="lazy" width="1595" height="921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F515500.faa31dc5.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F515500.faa31dc5.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F515500.faa31dc5.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>In July I completed 2,002 pushups, ran 48.88 miles, and biked 28.99 miles (this includes the race day numbers). The heat throughout the month was often unbearable, but I pushed through all the same knowing July 26 (race day) was coming up quick. During this period I also really began to dial in my diet, eating little more than fruit, eggs (lots of eggs), chicken, rice, and salad (lots of salad). It was during this period and August that my body began to change. I became noticeably larger and more muscular, and incredibly my abs began to show.</p>
<p>In this photo I'm completing race pushup #500. Don't judge the form, it was almost 90 degrees and the exhaustion was real from having already completed the run and bike segments. That said if you squint in the right light you can see I actually have muscles due to all the pushups and running!</p>

<p>It was around this time that I went down a major rabbit hole regarding microplastics. A successful techie named Nat Friedman funded a study that looked into the prevalency of microplastics in food, vitamins, and other products, and published the results <a href="https://www.plasticlist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I'm not going to call out any products by name here (although I should because they are poisoning us), but take a moment to open this site in a new tab and search for <em>protein</em> for a glimpse into how you are being poisoned every time you take a bite of so-called health food. After spending a few weeks researching this topic I radically changed my diet and eliminated all of this nonsense. If you <em>really</em> want to go down a rabbit hole, look into the relationship between chocolate-infused health products and heavy metals.</p>

<h2>August, 2025 - Bought a Running Watch</h2>
<p>In August I did exactly 1,000 pushups, and threw in 190 body weight squats just for fun. 525 of these pushups were completed in a single day (August 16) thanks to my neighbor, friend, and fellow 5/15/500 contestant Charlie having the bright idea that we should knock out what was originally supposed to be 400 pushups during our sons' soccer game. Of course, our competitive spirit got the best of us and I quit at 525 while Charlie pushed on to 600. I'll get him the next time!</p>
<p>The running sessions continued throughout August, with 37.48 miles completed. I started taking running much more seriously at this point because I signed up for the October 19 Columbus 1/2 Marathon. I've run 1/2 marathons before (poorly - my last finish time was 3:05) so I know what I'm getting into here, but this time around I want to actually finish at what I deem to be a respectable time which is around 2:20 (10:40/mile pace). Of course, in order to train for this I needed to know what pace I'm running in the first place, and so I bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092RCLKHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garmin Forerunner 55</a> watch with GPS.</p>
<p>As mentioned before my proclivity for going down research rabbit holes hasn't really helped my previous attempts to get into shape so I chose this watch because compared to other watches it is relatively spartan in terms of features. Above all else I wanted a watch that can accurately track my running distance, pace, and route and so far I am so, so happy with this purchase. It is perfect, and the battery life is amazing.</p>
<p>On August 2 I received the watch and later that day took my son and his friend up to a local (Alum Creek) mountain bike park and while they were riding I decided to run the trails. I wound up running 4.69 miles on very hilly and bumpy trails, and paid for it dearly over the next week due to terrible foot and knee pain.</p>
<p>On August 21 I ran my first training 10K, completing it in 1:12:28. According to my fancy watch I completed the first 5K in 39:11 but then sped up and completed the second 5K in 33:11.</p>
<p>On August 25 I repeated the route, this time completing the 10K in 1:05:41. On August 28 I did it a third time, completing it in 1:02:47. Progress!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I brought some help to the the August 25 and 28 10K training runs: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DP6ZWWC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GU packs</a>. In July I read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Swim-Bike-Bonk-Confessions-Triathlete/dp/1493059378/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swim, Bike, Bonk: Confessions of a Reluctant Triathlete</a>, by Will McGough. In this hilarious recounting of training and competing in an Ironman triathlon, the author mentions using these mysterious "gel" pack, of which the most popular is known as a "GU pack". I subsequently picked up a few at the local Walmart and can confirm they unquestionably gave me a boost on these long runs. Now anytime I plan on running a 10K or longer I put one in my running pouch and open it 5K into the route.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With another 1,000 pushups in the book my YTD output sat at 8,754 on August 31.</p>
<p>Much better endurance aside, the most obvious visible outcome of the last few months is my clothes no longer fit. My polo shirts are so baggy they look like tents, and my t-shirts are too small because I'm so much more... muscular? What in the hell is going on? This seems to be working!</p>
<h2>September, 2025 - I am a Beast</h2>
<p>With 8,754 pushups complete, I only had 1,246 to go and concluded I'd meet the milestone in September. With the 1/2 marathon around the corner my running workouts picked up and I set multiple PRs, including a 29:51 5K PR on September 8, followed by another 28:10 5K PR on September 11.</p>
<p>On September 17 I got one of the biggest motivational boosts possible. I was in Chicago for a quarterly meeting, and one of the fellow board members who I've seen in person once every 3 months (but not 3 months ago because we were on the France trip) walked up to me and introduced himself. I stared back at him completely puzzled, and watched him walk away to greet the person next to me. He suddenly wheeled around with a look of shock on his face and said something to the effect of "Holy shit! I didn't even recognize you! You look amazing!".</p>
<p>On September 21 I completed the 10,000th pushup in unceremonious fashion on my living room floor:</p>
<p><img alt="Pushup number 10,000 in the books" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F10002.a6a6af52.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F10002.a6a6af52.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F10002.a6a6af52.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>On September 24 I gobbled up a GU pack and headed outside feeling like I could tear a phone book in half. My goal was to shatter the previous 28:10 5K record, and I was on track to do exactly that, running the first 2.1 kilometers in 18 minutes flat. Then out of nowhere I felt this terrible pain in my left calf and came to an immediate stop. It wasn't until September 29 that I could comfortably run again, and even then I only ran 1 mile because I'm terrified of a nagging injury setting me back for the October 19 1/2 marathon.</p>
<p>In September I added 1,501 pushups to the pile, bringing the YTD total to 10,245.</p>
<h2>October and Beyond</h2>
<p>Today is October 1, 2025 and the pushups continue. The aforementioned 1/2 marathon is on October 19, and my neighbor Charlie and I have already agreed to walk/run a full marathon (around our neighborhood) on November 29. Although it's almost 80 degrees today, in past years we've seen snow by the end of the month so I'm thinking about getting one of those fancy stationary bikes or maybe even a treadmill so I can keep this party going over the winter.</p>
<h2>My Diet</h2>
<p>In recent months I have started to look so different that friends have asked me for some diet details. As mentioned, I no longer eat fast food, nor overconsume alcohol. But I've also almost completely cut out processed foods, eating them only very sparingly. A few months ago I did manage to go down the microplastics and heavy metals rabbit hole, and now spend some time researching anything that I plan on eating on a regular basis. Believe me, a lot of the food you think is healthy is pure garbage.</p>
<p>Every morning I eat one of two things: either a gigantic fruit smoothie or four scrambled eggs and a salad. I do not deviate from this, only very occasionally eating some protein-powder pancakes made by my wife. My smoothie consists of milk, greek yogurt, 1.5 scoops of Optimum Nutrition protein powder, a huge scoop (probably two cups) of frozen organic berries, and an entire banana:</p>
<p><img alt="My morning smoothie" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsmoothie.467ebf50.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsmoothie.467ebf50.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsmoothie.467ebf50.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>Here is the typical scrambled eggs and salad breakfast:</p>
<p><img alt="Eggs and salad" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Feggs.544b1751.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Feggs.544b1751.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Feggs.544b1751.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>For lunch I eat some combination of chicken, rice, tuna, and salad. I almost never deviate from this. For dinner I eat whatever my wife decides to make, which is always healthy. Obviously we occasionally go out and I'll eat some garbage like wings or pizza, but this is pretty rare compared to the past. I also take a few vitamins and creatine daily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier in this post I mentioned researching the prevalency of microplastics, heavy metals, and other poison in food. This is particularly problematic in ironically protein powder, protein bars, protein shakes, etc. I settled on Optimum Nutrition because it is one of the few powders on the market that has been tested by numerous third-parties, including <a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org/protein-powder-v2-category-tested-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Clean Label Project</a>. It's pretty expensive compared to other products, but I'm happy to pay in order to avoid ingesting this garbage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some Analytics</h2>
<p>Despite getting myself into incredibly good shape relative to the past, this wasn't really that hard. On 105 of 274 days (38.3%) I did no pushups at all. On 142 of 274 (51.8%) days I did between 1 and 100 pushups. On just 26 of 274 (9.4%) days did I do more than 100 pushups, and on only 8 of 274 (2.9%) days did I do 200 or greater. Interestingly, although I have no hard data to back this up I feel like my strength soared in the 67 days following the 5/15/500 race (July 26). Following that date I did more than 100 pushups on 11 days (16.4% of the days), and became noticeably more muscular. Here's a chart showing the pushup volume throughout the year:</p>

<p>Headed into October, I feel like a million dollars and plan on continuing these off-the-wall exercise quests for the rest of my (hopefully long) life. I obviously have no idea what I'm doing, but am happy to answer any questions and help motivate you to get in the best shape of your life.

Where’s the fun unless you have to sweat a little as you struggle to recall whether this particular word is one where “‘i’ before ‘e’ except after ‘c’” doesn’t apply?</p><p>In short, English has a complicated writing system.</p><p><span>I’ve written about the origin of some of this complexity before, blaming everyone from </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/why-english-doesnt-use-accents" rel="">the French</a><span> to </span><a href="https://colingorrie.substack.com/p/the-lost-letters-of-the-english-alphabet" rel="">stingy printers</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-invention-that-ruined-english" rel="">late medieval yuppies</a><span>. But I’ve not yet plumbed the depths of this complexity. To do so, I will need to tell you the story of </span><strong>yogh</strong><span>,</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-1-172153870" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> an obscure medieval letter whose rise and fall allows us to peer into this abyss.</span></p><p>But like an Icelandic family saga, we begin not with the story of yogh, but with the story of its parent. So allow me to introduce you to the letter ‘g,’ which, as you’ll soon see, is a complicated letter in its own right, dating back to Old English.</p><p>It starts with the shape of the letter. When modern editors print Old English today, they print nice, modern-looking ‘g’s — that is, the ones we use today, with an open or closed loop on the bottom, depending on the typeface.</p><p><span>This modern form of ‘g’ is called the </span><strong>Carolingian</strong><span> </span><strong>‘g.’</strong><span> It had its origin in the Carolingian minuscule, the script used by the scribes of the Carolingian Renaissance, the great revival of learning which flourished in the vast realm of Charlemagne (reigned 768–814).</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-2-172153870" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p><span>But Old English scribes didn’t write their </span><em>g</em><span>-sounds with a Carolingian ‘g.’ The Old English letter ‘g’ was written in a form called the </span><strong>insular</strong><span> </span><strong>‘g.’</strong><span> Here’s what it looked like: ‘ᵹ.’ It’s like a mix between a ‘z’ and a ‘3.’</span></p><p><span>Let’s see it in action. When the first lines of </span><em>Beowulf</em><span> are written in a modern edition, they look like this:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Hwæt, we Gardena in geardagum</span><br><span>þeodcyninga þrym gefrunon,</span></em></p><p>‘How we have heard of the glory of the kings of the spear-Danes in days of old’ </p><p><span>(</span><em>Beowulf </em><span>1–2)</span></p></blockquote><p>But in the manuscript, they’re written like this:</p><blockquote><p><em><span>HǷÆT ǷE GARDE</span><br><span>na in</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>ear da</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>um þeod cynin</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>a</span><br><span>þrym </span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>efrunon</span></em></p><p><em>London, British Library, Cotton MS Vitellius A XV, f. 132r.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now, there’s clearly lots of other weird stuff going on in the manuscript, but focus on how the ‘g’ is represented. While the majuscule (capital) ‘G’ in ‘gardena’ is spelled more like a modern ‘g,’ all the others are insular ‘ᵹ.’</p><p><span>Interestingly, the Anglo-Saxons </span><em>did</em><span> use the Carolingian ‘g’ — just not for Old English. They used it when writing Latin, at least after the late 10th century.

But they were very different from the way they had written Old English, especially in the ‘g’ department.</p><p>But that wasn’t so much of an issue, since these Norman-trained scribes, and those of the generations that came after them, didn’t write much English at all. In fact, writing in English of any kind was very scarce up until the end of the 12th century.</p><p>Over the course of that tumultuous — and, for English, silent — century, the language had changed a great deal. All the scribes trained in the old, Anglo-Saxon traditions were long dead, so when a new generation of scribes turned their attention once again to English, they had to devise some new strategies for writing it.</p><p>And this, after a surprisingly long delay, is where we first meet the star of today’s issue: ‘ȝ,’ also known as yogh. </p><p><span>Yogh is descended from a variant form of the old insular ‘ᵹ.’ But, while the insular ‘ᵹ’ was thought of as the same letter as the Carolingian ‘g’ in Anglo-Saxon times, the yogh ‘ȝ’ of the 12th century was an </span><em>entirely different letter</em><span> from the Carolingian-derived ‘g.’</span></p><p><span>And, stranger still, ‘ȝ’ was used to write two completely different sounds in Middle English, the form of English spoken from around 1100–1450: the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound as in </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>oung </span></em><span>or </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>esterday</span></em><span>, and another sound that English has lost altogether.</span></p><p><span>The other sound that ‘ȝ’ once spelled is the “harsh” or “guttural” sound made in the back of the mouth, which you hear in Scots </span><em><span>lo</span><strong>ch</strong></em><strong> </strong><span>or German </span><em><span>Ba</span><strong>ch</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-4-172153870" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> This sound is actually the reason for the most famous bit of English spelling chaos: the sometimes-silent, sometimes-not sequence ‘gh’ that you see in </span><em><span>lau</span><strong>gh</strong></em><span>, </span><em><span>cou</span><strong>gh</strong></em><strong>,</strong><em><span> ni</span><strong>gh</strong><span>t</span></em><span>, and </span><em><span>dau</span><strong>gh</strong><span>ter</span></em><span>.

So perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that we too have a very yogh-like situation with two of our letters: ‘c’ and — wait for it — ‘g.’</p><p><span>Each of these regularly represents two not particularly similar sounds. The letter ‘c’ sometimes represents a </span><em>k</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>c</strong><span>at</span></em><span>, and sometimes an </span><em>s</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>c</strong><span>ity</span></em><span>. The letter ‘g’ is similar: sometimes it writes a true </span><em>g</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ood</span></em><span>, but other times, what it represents is a </span><em>j</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>em</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>If these sounds seem similar to you, pay attention to your tongue as you make each one: the </span><em>k</em><span>-sound and the true </span><em>g-</em><span>sound are made with the back of your tongue hitting against your soft palate. The </span><em>s</em><span>-sound and the ‘j’ sound are made in slightly different places, but in both cases, they use the tip of your tongue coming up against (or close to) just behind your upper teeth.</span></p><p><span>Each of our two double-sounding letters, ‘c’ and ‘g,’ has two variants, which are made at completely different ends of the mouth. This is how yogh worked too: it had one variant made at the back of the mouth (the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound) and the other made towards the front (that’s the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound).</span></p><p><span>There’s actually a good linguistic reason why this pattern keeps happening. It’s a sound change called </span><strong>palatalization</strong><span>: this happens when a sound made towards the back of the mouth, like a </span><em>k</em><span>- or </span><em>g</em><span>-sound, gets pulled forward because it’s next to another sound made at the front of the mouth. Often, these front-of-the-mouth sounds are vowels.</span></p><p><span>In Old English, these front-of-the-mouth vowels (</span><strong>front vowels</strong><span> for short) included the ones spelled ‘i’ and ‘e,’ which sounded like the vowels in </span><em><span>b</span><strong>ee</strong><span> </span></em><span>and </span><em><span>b</span><strong>ay</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-5-172153870" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> Sometime in the deep prehistory of the English language, the ‘g’ sound got pulled forward in the mouth to sound like ‘y’ whenever it was next to these front vowels.</span></p><p><span>But when it came time to spell these ‘y’ sounds in the Latin alphabet, they still seemed to the Anglo-Saxon scribes to be versions of ‘g’ sounds. So they spelled them ‘ᵹ’ just like they spelled other ‘g’ sounds. This is why, when you read Old English, you can often replace ‘ᵹ’ (or ‘g’ in modern editions) with ‘y’ and get recognizable Modern English words: </span><em><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>ear</span></em><span> is </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>ear</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>dæ</span><strong>ᵹ</strong></em><span> is </span><em>day</em><span>, </span><em><span>we</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span> </span></em><span>is </span><em><span>wa</span><strong>y</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-6-172153870" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><p>A process like this happened in the ancestor of French too, just slightly differently. Instead of the ‘g’ being pulled forward into a ‘y’ sound before ‘i’ and ‘e,’ it got pulled forward into a ‘j’ sound. </p><p><span>This is why the Modern English ‘g’ represents two sounds, one before the letters ‘i’ and ‘e’, and the other before the other letters. It’s because we took our spelling conventions from how the Norman scribes wrote their language, which was an old form of French.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-7-172153870" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p><span>While the Norman scribes, and the later English scribes they trained, were used to the letter ‘g’ writing two different sounds, neither was a </span><em>y</em><span>-sound. They needed another letter for that, and they found one: the old insular ‘ᵹ,’ or rather, its descendant, the yogh ‘ȝ.’</span></p><p><span>So that’s why ‘ȝ’ spelled a ‘y’ sound. To understand why ‘ȝ’ also spelled that vanished ‘gh’ sound, however, we need to go back into the distant history of English, long before it was ever written down. Actually, long before there even </span><em>was</em><span> an English. </span></p><p>Back then, there was just one single language, which would later split into English, Dutch, German, Swedish, and all the other Germanic languages.</p><p><span>In this Proto-Germanic language (as it’s called today), the sound that would become the English </span><em>g</em><span>-sound — which the Anglo-Saxons would later spell ‘ᵹ’ — was not the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound we have today in words like </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ood</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>ba</span><strong>g</strong></em><span>. That came later.</span></p><p><span>Instead, the Proto-Germanic ancestor of words like </span><em>good</em><span> had a sound very similar to the later Middle English </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound at the start.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-8-172153870" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span><span> Only later would English harden that </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound into the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound we know today. But this only happened in certain places in the word, especially at the start. At the end of the word, the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound remained. In Old English, both versions were spelled the same: ‘ᵹ.’</span></p><p><span>This means that ‘ᵹ’ actually had </span><strong>three</strong><span> pronunciations in Old English, not two: the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound (next to front vowels), the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound (at the start of words), and the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound (in the middle of words). So when those Norman-trained scribes turned their attention to writing English in the 12th century, they had no problem writing the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound at the start of words with ‘g.’</span></p><p><span>But when they wanted to write the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound, they ran into the same problem they had in writing the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound. They didn’t have a good way to write the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound, which didn’t exist in French at the time, so they pressed yogh into service again.</span></p><p>And that’s why yogh has two sounds, each of which corresponds to a pronunciation of the Old English letter ‘ᵹ’ that the French scribal tradition couldn’t accept writing with ‘g.’</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1813179,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/i/172153870?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>View of the City of Edinburgh</em><span> (ca. 1822), Alexander Nasmyth</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>When you’re reading Middle English, it can get a bit confusing: Which kind of yogh is which?</p><p><span>Look at this line from </span><em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Þa</span><strong>ȝ</strong><span> </span><strong>ȝ</strong><span>e </span><strong>ȝ</strong><span>ourself be talenttyf, to take hit to yourseluen,</span></em><br><span>‘Though you yourself are eager to accept it [a challenge] personally,’ (</span><em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em><span> 350)</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In this line, the first yogh makes the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound, while the second and third represent </span><em>y</em><span>-sounds. But you just have to know the words in order to figure that out.</span></p><p><span>As inconvenient as this confusion is for us </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-case-for-middle-english" rel="">modern readers of Middle English</a><span>, that isn’t the reason yogh disappeared from the English language. The fate of yogh was sealed by a conspiracy of factors.</span></p><p><span>One is that yogh was never the only alternative for writing the sounds it wrote. The </span><em>y</em><span>-sound could also be written in the way the French wrote it, that is, ‘i’ or ‘y.’ The latter is the spelling that English ended up using for this sound, hence </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>ourself </span></em><span>instead of </span><em><strong>ȝ</strong><span>ourself</span></em><span>. The </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound could also be written ‘h,’ ‘ȝh,’ or ‘gh.’ The last of these, of course, is what English ended up adopting.</span></p><p><span>But the death blow dealt to yogh was the printing press. The earliest printing press in England was a Flemish import, as were the typefaces. But the yogh letter was unique to English, and like the </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-lost-letters-of-the-english-alphabet" rel="">other letters unique to English</a><span>, it would be expensive to print. And, as we just saw, there were ready alternatives, so yogh disappeared without a trace… from English.</span></p><p><span>In Scotland, on the other hand, it stuck around for longer. Scots used the combination ‘lȝ’ to represent an ‘ly’ sequence like we have in </span><em><span>mi</span><strong>lli</strong><span>on,</span></em><span> and ‘nȝ’ to represent either the ‘ny’ sequence like in </span><em><span>ca</span><strong>ny</strong><span>on,</span></em><span> or an ‘ng’ sound like in </span><em><span>si</span><strong>ng</strong><span>er</span></em><span>. </span></p><p>And Scottish printers were more eager to keep it than English printers were. So they took advantage of the visual similarity between ‘ȝ’ and ‘z’ — most forms of cursive writing in English still write ‘z’ like ‘ȝ’ — to write their yoghs with ‘z’s.</p><p><span>You still see the results of this substitution, ‘lz’ and ‘nz,’ in certain Scottish names. But the ‘z’ has led them to be pronounced in ways that have nothing to do with their traditional forms. So </span><em>Menzies</em><span> and </span><em>Mackenzie</em><span> were meant to spell things that sounded more like </span><em>Mingus</em><span> and </span><em>Mackenyie</em><span>.</span></p><p>And that’s how one single letter of the Middle English alphabet ended up being pronounced like ‘y,’ ‘gh,’ or even eventually like ‘z.’ I warned you it would be complicated. </p><p>But the journey through the history of yogh has allowed us to peer down some interesting side alleys of the history of writing, from Carolingian scribal practices to the compromises of Scottish printers.</p><p>I don’t lament the loss of yogh myself, not nearly as much as I lament the fate of other lost letters. But if the cause of yogh is one ȝou fancy taking up ȝourself, there’s nothing standing in ȝour waȝ (it’s included in many modern fonts), althouȝ I can imagine hiȝer causes to aspire to.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>tldr from Jeremy:</strong> “How to Solve it With Code” is a course in iterative problem solving, and a platform (‘Solveit’) to make that easier. The course shows how to use AI in small doses to help learn as you build, but doesn’t rely on AI at all – you can totally avoid AI if you prefer. The approach we teach is based on decades of research and practice from Eric Ries and I, the founders of Answer.AI. It’s basically the opposite of “vibe coding”; it’s all about small steps, deep understanding, and deep reflection. We wrote the platform because we didn’t find anything else sufficient for doing work the “solveit way”, so we made something for ourselves, and then decided to make it available more widely. You can follow the approach without using our platform, although it won’t be as smooth an experience.</p>
<p>The platform combines elements of all these: ChatGPT; Jupyter Notebook + nbdev; Bits of vscode/cursor (we embed the same Monaco editor and add similar optional AI and non-AI autocompletion); a VPS (you get your own persistent full VPS running Linux with a URL you can share for public running applications); Claude Code (all the same tools are available); a persistent terminal. Then there’s some bits added that don’t exist elsewhere AFAIK: something like MCP, but way simpler, where any Python function can be instantly used as an AI tool; the ability to refer directly to any live Python variable in AI context (but optional, so it doesn’t eat up your context window); full metaprogramming of the environment (you can through code or AI tools modify the environment itself or the dialog); context editing (you can – and should – directly edit AI responses instead of tell the AI it’s wrong); collaborative notebook coding (multiple people can edit the dialog, run code, etc, and all see live updates).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a strange time to be a programmer. It’s easier than ever to get started, but also easier than ever to let AI steer you into a situation where you’re overwhelmed by code you don’t understand. We’ve got an antidote that we’ve been using ourselves with 1000 preview users for the last year. It’s changed our lives at Answer.AI, and <a href="https://solve.it.com/testimonials">hundreds of our users</a> say the same thing. Now we’re ready to share it with you. <a href="https://solve.it.com/">Signups are open</a>, and will remain so until October 20th. Over five weeks, we’ll give you a taste of how our new approach and platform, “Solveit”, can be applied to everything from programming challenges, web development, and system administration to learning, writing, business, and more.</p>
<p>OK, let’s explain what on earth we’re talking about!…</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Jeremy Howard (co-founder of fast.ai, Answer.AI, Kaggle, Fastmail, creator of the first LLM…) and I ran a small trial course titled “How To Solve It With Code”. The response was so overwhelming that we had to close signups after just one day. 1000 keen beans joined us for a deep dive into our general approach to solving problems. The first few lessons were taught via the vehicle of the ‘Advent of Code’ programming challenges and run in a new, purpose-built tool called <strong>solveit</strong>. As the course progressed, we had lots of fun exploring web development, AI, business, writing and more. And the solveit tool became an extremely useful test-bed for ideas around AI-assisted coding, learning and exploration.</p>
<p>In the year since, we’ve continued to refine and expand both the process and the platform. We now basically live in the solveit platform. We do all our sysadmin work in it (Solveit itself is hosted on a new horizontally scalable multi-server platform we built and run entirely using Solveit!), host production apps in it (e.g all students in the course can use a Discord AI bot “Discord Buddy” that’s running inside a Solveit dialog!), develop most of our software in it, our legal team does contract drafting in it, we iterate on GUIs in it, and in fact we do the vast majority of our day to day work of all kinds in it.</p>

</div>
<p>From October 20th for five weeks, Jeremy and I will show you how to use the solveit approach, and give you full access to the platform that powers it (and you’ll have the option to continute to access the lessons and platform afterwards too). Also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries">Eric Ries</a> will join us for lessons about building startups that don’t just make money, but that stick to your vision for how you want to impact the world. You’ll be amongst the first people in the world to have the opportunity to read his new unreleased book.</p>
<p>But what IS “the solveit approach”? It isn’t some new AI thing, but actually is based on ideas that are at least 80 years old… To learn more, read on, or watch this video Jeremy and I recorded a few weeks ago.</p>

<section id="inspiration-from-polya">
<h2 data-anchor-id="inspiration-from-polya">Inspiration from Polya</h2>
<p>George Polya was a Hungarian mathematician who wrote the influential book “How to Solve It” in 1945. In it, he shares his philosophies on education (focus on active learning, heuristic thinking, and careful questioning to guide students towards discovering answers for themselves) and outlines a four-step problem-solving framework:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Understand the Problem: identify what you’re being asked to do; restate the problem</li>
<li>Devise a Plan: draw on similar problems; break down into manageable parts; consider working backward; simplify the problem</li>
<li>Carry Out the Plan: verify each step</li>
<li>Look Back and Reflect: consider alternatives; extract lessons learned</li>
</ol>
<p>He was focused on mathematics, but as Jeremy and I realized, these ideas translate far beyond maths! It turns out that it actually works great for coding, writing, reading, learning…</p>
<p>Of course, you can often just have AI code and write for you. But <em>should</em> you?</p>
<p>In most cases, we argue the answer is “no”.</p>
<p>There’s a myriad of problems waiting for you if you go down that path: - If you didn’t know the foundations of how to do it before, you don’t now either. You’ve learned nothing - If you keep working this way, you build up more and more code you don’t understand, creating technical and understanding debt that will eventually become crippling - You won’t be building up a foundation to solve harder tasks that neither humans nor AI can one-shot. So you’re limiting yourself to only solving problems that everyone else can trivially solve too. This is not a recipe for personal or organizational success!</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you build a discipline of always working to improve your understanding and expertise, you’ll discover that something delightful and amazing happens. Each time you tackle a task, you’ll find it’s a little easier than the last one. These improvements in understanding and capability will multiply, and you’ll find that your own skills develop even faster than AI improves. You’ll focus on using AI to help you dramatically increase your own productivity and abilities, instead of focusing on helping the AI improve its productivity and abilities!</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="application-to-coding-iterative-exploratory-coding-in-notebook-like-environments.">Application to Coding: iterative, exploratory coding in notebook-like environments.</h2>
<p>Let’s consider a quick example of coding the solveit way (without even any AI yet). For 2024’s Advent of Code, Day 1’s solution involves comparing two lists, sorted by value (there’s a whole backstory involving elves, which you can <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1">read if you like</a>). Let’s imagine we’ve considered the problem, and are now focused on a small sub-task: extracting the first (sorted) list. We start with the sample data provided:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">x <span>=</span> <span>'3   4</span><span>\n</span><span>4   3</span><span>\n</span><span>2   5</span><span>\n</span><span>1   3</span><span>\n</span><span>3   9</span><span>\n</span><span>3   3'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Our plan might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split into a list of lines</li>
<li>Grab the first number from each line</li>
<li>Sort</li>
</ul>
<p>After thinking through the plan, we begin working on individual steps. We aim to write no more than a few lines of code at a time, with each piece giving some useful output that you can use to <strong>verify</strong> that you’re on the right track:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">lines <span>=</span> x.splitlines()</span>
<span id="cb2-2">lines</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> [<span>'3   4'</span>, <span>'4   3'</span>, <span>'2   5'</span>, <span>'1   3'</span>, <span>'3   9'</span>, <span>'3   3'</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we build up a list comprehension to get the first elements. We might start with <code>[o for o in lines]</code> and then add bits one at a time, inspecting the output, building up to:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1">l1 <span>=</span> [<span>int</span>(o.split()[<span>0</span>]) <span>for</span> o <span>in</span> lines]</span>
<span id="cb3-2">l1</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>3</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now sorting:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>sorted</span>(l1)</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we’ve run all the pieces individually, and checked that the outputs are what we’d expect, we can stack them together into a function:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>def</span> get_list(x):</span>
<span id="cb5-2">    lines <span>=</span> x.splitlines()</span>
<span id="cb5-3">    l1 <span>=</span> [<span>int</span>(o.split()[<span>0</span>]) <span>for</span> o <span>in</span> lines]</span>
<span id="cb5-4">    <span>return</span> <span>sorted</span>(l1)</span>
<span id="cb5-5">get_list(x)</span>
<span id="cb5-6"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, you’d reflect on the solution, think back to the larger plan, perhaps ask yourself if there are better ways you could do it. You may be thinking that this is far too much work for <code>sorted(int(line.split()[0]) for line in x.splitlines())</code> – as your skill increases you can tailor the level of granularity, but the idea remains the same: working on small pieces of code, checking the outputs, only combining them into larger functions once you’ve tried them individually, and constantly reflecting back on the larger goal.</p>
<p>(We’ll come back to this shortly – but also consider for a moment how integrated AI can fit into the above process. Any time you don’t know how to do something, you can ask for help with just that one little step. Any time you don’t understand how something works, or why it doesn’t, you can have AI help you with that exact piece.)</p>

<section id="the-power-of-fast-feedback-loops">
<h2 data-anchor-id="the-power-of-fast-feedback-loops">The Power of Fast Feedback Loops</h2>
<p>The superpower that this kind of live, iterative coding gives you is near-instant feedback loops. Instead of building your giant app, waiting for the code to upload, clicking through to a website and then checking a debug console for errors – you’re inspecting the output of a chunk of code and seeing if it matches what you expected. It’s still possible to make mistakes and miss edge cases, but it is a LOT easier to catch most mistakes early when you code in this way.</p>
<p>This idea of setting things up so that you get feedback as soon as possible pops up again and again. Our cofounder Eric Ries talks about this in his book ‘The Lean Startup’, where getting feedback from customers is valuable for quick iteration on product or business ideas. Kaggle pros talk about the importance of fast evals – if you can test an idea in 5 minutes, you can try a lot more ideas than you could if each experiment requires 12 hours of model training.</p>

<section id="ai-shared-context-is-key">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ai-shared-context-is-key">AI: Shared Context is Key</h2>
<p>So far so good – sounds like we’re describing the style of exploratory/literate programming taught in the fast.ai course, and used with tools like NBDev. Aren’t we in a new era though? Where is the AI?!</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that by building code in this way, with planning, notes and tests mixed in with the source code, you’re also building the perfect context for an AI to help with the code too. Solveit can see everything you can see. We’ve discovered that this actually transforms “AI+Human” capabilities in ways that surprised even us.</p>
<p>It’s become a key foundation of all our work at Answer.AI now: the AI should be able to see everything exactly as the human does, and vice versa, and both human and AI must be able to use the same tools. This makes the AI a true iterative partner to bounce ideas off, try experiments, and learn together with.</p>
<p>You can also feed additional context to Solveit by referencing specific variables, or having it use its built-in search and URL-reading tools. And any python function becomes a tool that you can ask solveit to use, making it easy to give it everything it needs to fetch more context or take “agentic” actions to give better responses.</p>
<div>

<p>This idea of having an AI that can see everything that you can see, in a shared environment, is put to good use in our beloved <a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-12-05-introducing-shell-sage.html">shell sage</a> tool too!</p>

<section id="ai-dialog-engineering-keeps-context-useful">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ai-dialog-engineering-keeps-context-useful">AI: Dialog Engineering Keeps Context Useful</h2>
<p>One issue with current chat-based models is that once they go off the rails, it’s hard to get back on track. The model is now modelling a language sequence that involves the AI making mistakes – and more mistakes are likely to follow! If you’ve used language models much, then you’ve no doubt experienced this problem many times.</p>
<p>There is an interesting mathematical reason that this occurs. The vast majority of language model training is entirely about getting a neural network to predict the next word in a sentence – they are <em>auto-regressive</em>. Although they are later fine-tuned to do more than this, they are still at their heart really wanting to predict the next word of a sentence. In the documents used for training, there are plenty of examples of poor-quality reasoning and mistakes.Therefore, once an AI sees some mistakes in a chat, the most likely next tokens are going to be mistakes as well. That means that every time you are correcting the AI, you are making it more likely for the AI to give bad responses in the future!</p>
<p>Because solveit dialogs are fluid and editable, it’s much easier to go back and edit/remove mistakes, dead ends, and unrelated explorations. You can even edit past AI responses, to steer it into the kinds of behaviour you’d prefer. Combine this with the ability to easily hide messages from the AI or to pin messages to keep them in context even as the dialog grows beyond the context window and starts to be truncated, and you have a recipe for continued AI helpfulness as time goes on. We’ve been talking about this as “dialog engineering” for a <a href="https://youtu.be/qO-YqJm0Q1U?si=j7JLf0yk_hmOrWzY&amp;t=3689">long time</a> – and it really is key to having AI work sessions that <strong>improve</strong> as time goes on, rather than degrading.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all useful for humans too! The discipline of keeping things tidy, using (collapsible) headings to organise sections, writing notes on what you’re doing or aiming for, and even past questions+answers with the AI all make it a pleasure to pick back up old work.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="building-an-app-for-collaboration-not-replacement">Building an App for Collaboration not Replacement</h2>
<p>One thing is still (intentionally) hard in solveit though, and that is getting the AI to actually write all of your code in a hands-off way. We’ve made various choices to gently push towards the human remaining in control. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solveit defaults to code inputs</li>
<li>AI outputs code in fenced blocks, but these are not added to your code or run until you choose to do so. There are shortcuts to add them, but this extra step encourages you to read + refactor before mindlessly running</li>
<li>In ‘Learning’ mode especially, the AI will gently guide you to writing small steps rather than providing a big chunk of code, unless you really specifically ask it to do so.</li>
<li>In ‘Learning’ mode, the AI ‘ghost text’ auto-complete suggestions don’t show unless you trigger them with a keyboard shortcut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the choice to have the editor be fairly small and down at the bottom emphasizes that this is a REPL/dialog, optimised for building small, understandable pieces. It’s entirely possible to practice the solveit approach in other tools, but we’ve also found that a combination of these intentional choices and the extra affordances for dialog engineering rapidly feel indispensible.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-trajectory">
<h2 data-anchor-id="learning-trajectory">Learning Trajectory</h2>
<p>This brings us back to a foundational piece of the solveit approach: a learning mindset. It’s great that we can ask AI to fill in the gaps of our knowledge, or to save some time with fiddly pieces like matplotlib plots or library-specific boilerplate. But when the AI suggests something you don’t know, it is important not to skip it and move on – otherwise that new piece will never be something you learn!</p>
<p>We try to build the discipline to stop and explore anytime something like this comes up. Fortunately, it’s really easy to do this – you can add new messages trying out whatever new thing the AI has shown you, asking how it works, getting demo code, and poking it until you’re satisfied. And then the evidence of that side-quest can be collapsed below a heading (for later ref) or deleted, leaving you back in the main flow but with a new piece of knowledge in your brain.</p>
<p>Like many programmers, I’ve had my share of existential worries given the rapid rise in AI’s coding ability. What if AI keeps getting better and better, to the point where there’s little point for the average person actually learning to master any of these skills? If you assume your coding skills stay static, and imagine the AI continuing to get better, you may feel kinda bleak. The thing is, skill doesn’t have to be static! And as both you and the AI you’re carefully using get better, you will learn faster and be able to accomplish more and more.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="mastery-requires-deliberate-practice">Mastery Requires Deliberate Practice</h2>
<p>This is all hard work. It’s like exercise, or practicing a musical instrument. And like any pursuit of mastery, I don’t know that it’s for everyone.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Chinese scientists have genetically engineered stem cells capable of rejuvenating the health, including the cognition, of aged macaque</p><div>
<p>Key Points:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>“Super stem cells” improve the memory of monkeys while protecting against neurodegeneration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The super stem cells prevent age-related bone loss while rejuvenating over 50% of the 61 tissues analyzed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Treatment with stem cells reduces inflammation and senescent cells (cells that accumulate to promote aging).</li>
</ul>



<p>While small in number, our adult stem cells play a crucial role in regenerating our lost or damaged tissues, rebuilding our body cell by cell. However, with age, our bodies become riddled with inflammation, hardly providing an environment capable of keeping our stem cells healthy. Eventually, our stem cells lose their regenerative capacity, contributing to degenerative aging.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Fox, O, Three&nbsp;</h2>



<p><em>Hydra</em> are a genus of immortal beings that live forever in freshwater environments like lakes and ponds. What scientists have called “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01143.x">nothing but an active stem cell community</a>,” <em>Hydra</em> can escape death by infinitely regenerating. Their stem cells can continuously proliferate and renew by producing FoxO, a protein they share with humans.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="808" height="476" src="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra.jpeg 808w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra-300x177.jpeg 300w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra-768x452.jpeg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px"><figcaption>(Image: <a href="https://www.aip.org/inside-science/how-hydra-regrow-their-heads">aip.org</a>) <strong>The Immortal Hydra.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In humans, the FoxO protein, specifically the FoxO3 isoform, responds to cellular stress by binding to DNA and turning genes on and off. These genes are involved in numerous cellular processes that promote healthy aging and extended lifespan. This is why the FoxO3 protein’s corresponding gene, <em>FOXO3</em>, is considered a longevity gene.</p>





<h2>Experimenting with SRCs&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As FoxO3 assists cells in resisting stressful environments, such as inflamed tissue, Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers engineered human stem cells to have enhanced FoxO3 activity. As published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2825%2900571-9"><em>Cell</em></a>, these senescence-resistant stem cells (SRCs) were designed to exhibit greater resistance to age-related stress. To test this, cynomolgus monkeys, also known as crab-eating macaques, were first stratified into four groups based on age:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>A1: 3-5 years (approximately equivalent to 9-15 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>A2: 10-12 years (approximately equivalent to 30-36 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>A3: 16-19 years (approximately equivalent to 48-57 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>A4: 19-23 years (approximately equivalent to 57-69 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<p>The oldest of the monkeys, the A4 group, were the focus of the study and were subdivided into three groups. One group was injected with saline (salt and water), another group with normal stem cells, and the third with SRCs. The aged monkeys were injected every two weeks for 44 weeks, approximately equivalent to the duration of three human years. On safety, there were no serious adverse events, such as immune system rejection or tumor growth.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="730" height="1024" src="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monkey_Groups-730x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monkey_Groups-730x1024.jpg 730w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monkey_Groups-214x300.jpg 214w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monkey_Groups-768x1078.jpg 768w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monkey_Groups-1095x1536.jpg 1095w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monkey_Groups-1460x2048.jpg 1460w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monkey_Groups-1568x2200.jpg 1568w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monkey_Groups-scaled.jpg 1825w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px"><figcaption>(<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2825%2900571-9">Lei et al., 2025</a>) <strong>Experimental Setup.</strong> Aged monkeys (A4) were injected with either saline (Vehicle), normal/wild-type stem cells (WTCs), or senescence-resistant stem cells (SRCs). The WTCs are human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) harboring two copies of normal/wild-type <em>FOXO3 </em>(<em>FOXO3</em><sup>+/+</sup>), while the SRCs are edited. The genetically edited <em>FOXO3</em> gene (<em>FOXO3</em><sup>2SA/2SA</sup>) produces a modified FoxO3 protein that stays in the nucleus of cells to increase the transcriptional activity of protective genes. &nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>SRCs Improve Cognition&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After 44 weeks of biweekly injections, a suite of biological indices was measured from the aged monkeys to assess whether SRCs slow down biological aging. One of these indices was memory retention. To assess memory, the researchers conducted a common experiment called the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this experiment, each monkey was trained to retrieve food located <em>outside</em> of one of two identical boxes. During the test session, after each monkey was trained, food was placed next to one of the boxes to keep it hidden. Subsequently, a flap was placed in front of the monkey to block the boxes from view. Three seconds later, when the flap was reopened, each monkey had to remember which of the two boxes contained the food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remarkably, the monkeys injected with SRCs remembered the location of the food with higher accuracy than the monkeys injected with saline. Moreover, the monkeys injected with normal stem cells exhibited the same level of accuracy as the monkeys injected with saline. These findings suggest that SRCs, and not normal stem cells, improve the memory of aged monkeys.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="330" src="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cognition-1024x330.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cognition-1024x330.jpg 1024w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cognition-300x97.jpg 300w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cognition-768x248.jpg 768w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cognition-1536x496.jpg 1536w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cognition-2048x661.jpg 2048w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cognition-1568x506.jpg 1568w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>(<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2825%2900571-9">Lei et al., 2025</a>) <strong>SRCs Improve Memory.</strong> <em>Left:</em> The experimental sequence. <em>Right:</em> Aged monkeys (A4) injected with SRCs (green) exhibit significantly higher (*) accuracy on the WGTA than those injected with saline (black). The difference in accuracy between the saline-injected (black) and normal/wild-type stem cell-injected (blue) monkeys was not significant (ns).</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, MRI-based structural analysis showed that treatment with SRCs mitigated age-related brain shrinkage. MRI-based experiments also revealed that brain connectivity was restored to that of young (A1 group) monkeys. Namely, the structural connectivity between seven brain regions, including those important for working memory (prefrontal cortex), was rejuvenated with SRC treatment. Overall, these findings suggest that SRC injections improve memory by protecting against neurodegeneration.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SRCs Rejuvenate Many Organs and Tissues</h2>



<p>In addition to the brain, the Academy researchers found that SRC treatment rejuvenated multiple organs and tissues. This is important because the rejuvenation of a given organ or tissue could lead to the reduced risk of its corresponding age-related chronic diseases. For example, the rejuvenating effects of SRCs on the brain could reduce the risk of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One common age-related disease is osteoporosis, characterized by brittle and weak bones that make patients more prone to fractures and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10338097/">deadly falls</a>. Using an X-ray imaging technique called micro-CT, the researchers found evidence for the reversal of age-related bone loss. Namely, while the aged monkeys treated with saline exhibited dental bone loss, the aged monkeys treated with SRCs had teeth more similar to those of young monkeys.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="519" src="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bone-1024x519.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bone-1024x519.jpg 1024w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bone-300x152.jpg 300w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bone-768x390.jpg 768w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bone-1536x779.jpg 1536w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bone-2048x1039.jpg 2048w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bone-1568x795.jpg 1568w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>(<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2825%2900571-9">Lei et al., 2025</a>) <strong>SRCs Improve Oral Bone Health.</strong> Compared to young monkeys (A1-Ctrl), aged monkeys (A4-Ctrl) exhibit significant bone loss. However, aged monkeys treated with wild-type stem cells (A4-WTC) show less bone loss, while aged monkeys treated with SRCs (A4-SRC) show even less bone loss.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To conduct a body-wide assessment, the researchers measured the up- and down-regulation of genes from 10 systems and 61 tissues. Elevations and reductions in gene activation reflect the function (or dysfunction) of cells, tissues, and organ systems. With that said, SRC treatment was shown to rejuvenate over 50% of the tissues examined, with maximal rejuvenation achieved in areas like the hippocampus (the memory consolidation center of the brain), fallopian tubes, and colon. In contrast, the regular stem cells rejuvenated about 30% of the tissues examined.</p>

Treatment with wild-type stem cells (WTC) rescued 31.15% of genes, while SRCs rescued 54.10% of genes altered by aging.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Confirming some of the rejuvenating effects inferred by the gene experiments, the researchers also observed structural changes to various organs and tissues from aged monkeys treated with SRCs. For example, the vascularity of the lung and heart was improved while the thickening of the aorta was reduced. Neurons had longer projections and fewer proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., beta-amyloid and phosphorylated-tau), and the kidney and brain showed less mineralization [abnormal mineral (usually calcium) deposits].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SRCs Reduce Cellular Senescence and Inflammation</h2>



<p>Modern scientists have begun to unravel the underlying causes of aging by identifying commonalities between age-related diseases at the cellular level. Two of the most prominent purported underlying causes of aging are chronic inflammation and <a href="https://www.nad.com/news/what-are-senescent-cells-and-how-do-they-drive-aging">senescent cells</a>. With age, senescent cells accumulate throughout the body, promoting inflammation by secreting pro-inflammatory molecules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminating senescent cells, which can be achieved through genetic manipulation or compounds called senolytics, ameliorates age-related diseases and even extends the lifespan of model organisms. Now, the Academy researchers demonstrate that SRCs reduce senescent cells, measured using a blue dye called SA-β-Gal, in multiple organs, including the brain, heart, and lungs. Along those lines, SRC treatment also reduced markers of inflammation and other underlying causes of aging, like DNA damage.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="626" src="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-1024x626.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-1024x626.jpg 1024w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-300x183.jpg 300w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-768x470.jpg 768w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-1536x939.jpg 1536w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-2048x1253.jpg 2048w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-1568x959.jpg 1568w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>(<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2825%2900571-9">Lei et al., 2025</a>) <strong>SRCs Eliminate Senescent Cells.</strong> Senescent cells are indicated by SA-β-Gal dye (light blue) and arrows. In the lung and brain, the number of senescent cells in aged monkeys treated with SRCs (green) was similar to that of young monkeys (pink). Moreover, compared to saline-treated aged monkeys (black), wild-type stem cell-treated aged monkeys (blue) exhibited less senescence in the lungs but not the brain, suggesting normal stem cells affect the lung but not the brain.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Stem Cells Make Sense&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When it comes to combating degenerative aging, it makes sense that regenerative stem cells are a promising solution. In fact, one of the <a href="https://www.nad.com/news/hallmarks-of-aging-reversed-therapy">underlying causes of aging</a> is stem cell exhaustion, whereby stem cells lose their regenerative capacity. While normal stem cells have anti-aging effects, as shown by the Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers, they are not protected against stressors like age-related inflammation. This explains why SRCs provide enhanced regenerative capacity (they withstand the harsh microenvironments induced by aging and cellular senescence).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As no serious safety concerns were raised during the study, it would seem that SRCs are well tolerated. However, the long-term effects of the SRC treatment will need further evaluation. The primary concern with injecting stem cells into the bloodstream is that they can trigger the spread of cancer almost anywhere in the body. Nevertheless, the SRCs possess tumor suppression properties, suggesting they may not induce tumor growth. If this ends up being true, we may soon see SRCs being tested in humans.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><span>TL;DR:</span><span> We tried OKRs, they created more ceremony than clarity. Our solution: Problem Driven Development, a 4-day quarterly process focused on identifying problems (not solutions), prioritizing as a team, and committing publicly. It's kept us shipping at velocity even as we've scaled to 1.7M+ users.</span></p><p><span>For most of my friends and colleagues at mature software companies, there are usually three ways for an item of work to get put on the board to eventually be done.</span></p><ol><li><span>There is a giant ceremony that determines what gets done by a grab bag of metrics.</span></li><li><span>A deal gets blocked by a missing feature, and the engineering team scrambles jets to eliminate the blocker.</span></li><li><span>Founder feels like we have to build something.</span></li></ol><p><span>Thats not to say that every company is a disorganized mess or a bureaucratic hell scape but, I have never met any engineer who said: “Wow, I just love my company planning process.” </span></p><p><span>These words are seldom spoken in the english language. </span></p><p><span>Railway, was fast approaching 1. and 2. at the same time. </span></p><p><span>Despite us using excellent tools (shoutout Linear) planning is much as a cultural phenomena as well as an interesting engineering problem. From our perspective, we would finalize the features and the requirements what we would want to build once every 3 months and then at times get blindsided every now and then from a new business priority or an incident. Especially now serving 1.7M+ customers, we have to aggregate our taste, feedback, and opportunities and make a roadmap that will get us everything we ever wanted.</span></p><p><span>This was an issue.</span></p><p><span>Why write about something that you would read in Rand’s? It’s Q4 for those who celebrate, and we felt that reigniting the agile vs. waterfall armistice needed to be torn up. (Besides, we’re blogging like it’s 2005.)</span></p><p><span>…and we have spent the better part of 18 months to improve our planning so that we finally get to a process that is not bad, and if you’d like, you can steal it, so that you can deliver excellent products.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#why-is-most-planning-bad,-you-say"><h2><span>Why is most planning bad, you say?</span></h2></a></p><p><span>Mike Tyson asked about his fight plan against Evander Holyfield responded with; “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”</span></p><p><span>And that quote ever since would be used out of context to fight the implementation of Objectives, Key Results across the world. At Railway, we aren’t Anti-Planning, we are Anti-Bad-Planning and as such, we used to avoid a lot of it because we always felt that a bad process is massively negative to the status quo. However, we did get to the point where we needed to finally harness the collective attention spans of the company and work towards a goal.</span></p><p><span>Railway at the time was (and is) a vision led company. We fundamentally believe that most infrastructure boilerplate shouldn’t exist so that you can work on what matters. Back in ‘21, we went from a world where we could do our work in weeks, to work that required us to think in months. I implemented a somewhat lighter form of SAFE which splits work between “sprints”, which were short pieces of work, then initiatives which helped grouped “epics” which are long running work-streams to deliver a feature. </span></p><p><span>Despite us having a strong founder, we still wanted the ability to have employees bring projects that they would be excited to work on. </span></p><p><span>As with most young companies, we found quickly that new work would come in and unseat the old work and we would begin anew. </span></p><p><span>So then we turned to OKRs.</span></p><p><span>We thought that having some long term objectives will help us focus the company.</span></p><p><span>We implemented them faithfully, we all read the John Doer book. …and it worked… somewhat. </span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#okrs-and-software;-water-and-vinegar"><h2><span>OKRs and software; water and vinegar</span></h2></a></p><p><span>We can make this a whole blog post on OKRs.

Its why they belong at their primary birthplace, the factory. Objectives work when you have something binary or “limited”, like a product existing… or not. Or a product meeting a benchmark… or not. It’s easy to rally a team around them and conquer the world. </span></p><p><span>Where OKRs start to falter, are when you need to use them to prioritize work to meet a “unlimited” objective. Like: “Increase conversion rate of landing page”</span></p><p><span>OKRheads will notice that’s a particularly weak objective, however, teaching an entire organization to all of a sudden be great goal setters, which is what OKRs require you to do made it difficult for engineers to 1) bring them and then 2) plan work around them. Which leads to the first big issue of OKRs- which is that it really depends on the human psychology of the team. Engineers straddle the line between concrete numbers such as uptime, and more creative endeavors such as figuring out how to get a feature implemented right. Whenever the work enters the creative realm, the wheels come off.</span></p><p><span>Which is why outside of the factory, OKRs are great for Sales. You set a number, you get alignment on hitting that number, and then you pick up the phone, email, or LinkedIn until you hit it. The psychology of an account executive matches the planning process.</span></p><p><span>Where OKRs work great, is for alignment. If you are able to set great goals and if you wanted to prescribe a bunch of work toward said goal. …and most startups reach for the High Output Management book (which I love) because there is the lack of alignment between different orgs at a startup. Which is to say, I don’t shame any company reaching for them, the same way newborns have the palmar grasp reflex. We yearn for the alignment.</span></p><p><span>The second big issue for OKRs is that they are, by design, inflexible, once you commit to them. If you spend a week or two planning for them for the year or quarter, and you are midway through realizing that the “KR” part is incorrect, thats a one way door. </span></p><p><span>So we felt pressure into making sure that the OKRs were indeed correct. Which is where you enter the issues of the performative aspects of planning. It felt “mature” for Railway to be having these discussions, even though… it wasn’t productive.</span></p><p><span>At Railway, we would spend a significant amount of time discussing what is a valid OKR, only for us to realize we were two days into the planning process and we’ve yet to decide what we should build for the OKR. </span></p><p><span>This is when Christian, our Head of Operations had an answer for us.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#good-ole-projects"><h2><span>Good Ole Projects</span></h2></a></p><p><span>Instead of crowd sourcing the OKRs from the company and bubbling them up per function Jake and Christian would work on some top level guidance that would provide a macro view of our finances, priorities, and strategy that we have to keep in mind. </span></p><p><span>We then have a Hex dashboard with topline metrics from different sides of the product and business. From a GTM perspective, it’s engagement, signups, and revenue. From an Engineering perspective, it’s support tickets, uptime, and feature performance. </span></p><p><span>This data would give us a “theme”. (You may have seen them in our launch weeks.)</span></p><p><span>Whenever someone goes on Central Station and requests a feature, depending on how large the work is, that usually determines if that request becomes a “Project”. </span></p><p><span>Then around the start of 2024, Christian spun up a Notion DB, and punched in a simple template for each new entry.</span></p><div><p><img alt=""

decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span>Railway at this point and time was organized into three sections of the business. Product Engineering which delivers features and value to our customers via the UI and terminal. Platform which supports the product with the Infrastructure and the APIs to control that Infrastructure. Then Logistics, which is a synthetic team which includes the Support, Marketing, and Sales function working to be the voice of the customer. </span></p><p><span>We would then fill out a “Project Candidate” and then go to bat on trying to figure out if was a priority that tied to the “theme” that was presented. </span></p><p><span>If something is a P0: it’s an existential company risk, we MUST deliver it.</span></p><p><span>Then, a P1: something we need to deliver for this quarter</span></p><p><span>Lastly, P2: a nice to have.</span></p><p><span>This worked well until some cracks formed.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#99-problems"><h2><span>99 Problems</span></h2></a></p><p><span>At the start of this new process, our team was small enough to list maybe 50 project candidates, discuss as a group and then be on with it but with 200. Spending all day on a call with your co-workers to discuss if something was worth it isn’t the best use of time. </span></p><p><span>Second, Project Candidates would sometimes have full on fleshed out RFC style sections where the author would have a solution ready to go. When a candidate got deprioritized, it’s understandable why someone would feel not great about their hard effort not being reciprocated. </span></p><p><span>Third, to deal with the larger amount of project candidates and additional sources of project candidates, we would set up additional meetings before the planning week that would eat into our engineering cycles. Not that we want to squeeze every engineer for what they are worth, but these negotiation calls would take longer than the main call sometimes. Worse even, was that we would completely reset the board quarter after quarter. </span></p><p><span>Lastly, which was starting to be a bigger issue, was that having Project Candidates being a bottom up process was great when the people who knew that work they needed to do can fit the whole work-stream in their head. But… we were about to embark on a multi-quarter effort that would span all parts of the business to deliver Railway Metal. This system was not great for uncovering planning gaps that required attention from a different team.</span></p><p><span>(With that said, we did ship some really good software thanks to this planning process.)</span></p><p><span>However, Jake, the team, aren’t ones to sit on their laurels so we refined it until we have our current process. </span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#%E2%80%A6and-a-process-ain%E2%80%99t-one."><h2><span>…and a process ain’t one.</span></h2></a></p><p><span>So we flipped the project system on it’s head. </span></p><p><span>Instead, we practice what I call: “Problem Driven Development”</span></p><p><span>Rather than spending a loaded amount of time picking feedback items from our feedback systems, and spending a loaded amount of time on trying to flesh out requirements. We collect problems on a continuous process that begins in earnest on the Friday before our planning week.</span></p><p><span>We stopped asking people to propose solutions and started asking them to articulate problems. </span><span>No more half-baked RFCs that people felt attached to. No more solution-first thinking that locked us into approaches before we understood what we were solving. Just clear problem statements.</span></p><p><span>Here's what a problem looks like in our system:</span></p><p><span>Problem Title:</span><span> "Users can't debug failed deployments without SSHing into containers"</span></p><p><span>Notice what's missing? Any mention of </span><span>how</span><span> we'd solve it. That comes later, after we've committed to solving the problem. Then we turned the two week ceremony into a lightning 4 day sprint.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#the-four-day-process"><h2><span>The Four-Day Process</span></h2></a></p><p><span>After the problems are listed and filled out fully, each team on </span><span>Day 1</span><span> enters problems on their own. If a problem isn't fleshed out, it's put in the Parking Lot and we kindly nudge the idea person to fill the template.</span></p><p><span>By the time we get into a room together, everyone's had time to process what's on the board.</span></p><p><span>Then on </span><span>Day 2,</span><span> the planning captain will have a closed session with the team (with spectators from other teams) to put a best guess priority from P0, P1, and P2. If we find that a problem is contentious or requires an external dependency, we mark it so the day after, we can discuss it.</span></p><p><span>By having each team prioritize independently first, we avoid the tragedy of the commons where everything becomes P0 because someone shouted loudest on the call. Platform can look at their problems and say "yes, API reliability is more important than API versioning right now" without having to negotiate with Product in real-time.</span></p><p><span>(We have spent countless hours talking about difficult questions on a call when we have been able to diffuse rough conversations ahead of time.)</span></p><p><span>On </span><span>Day 3</span><span>, we get to a 95 percent certainty on the priorities listed and tie break the dependencies. We also confirm that we have the capacity and staffing to deal with the problems listed on the board. If not, we add a problem for hiring for a specific role.</span></p><p><span>This is where cross-team dependencies surface naturally. When Platform marks "Multi-mount volumes" as P1 and Product marks "HA DBs" as P1, we can see that one blocks the other. We're not discovering this mid-quarter when someone's already three weeks into building the wrong thing.</span></p><p><span>The capacity check is crucial too. We look at people's current commitments, oncall rotations, and whether anyone's about to take parental leave. If we have eight P1 problems and capacity for five, we have an honest conversation about what drops to P2 or what we need to hire for.</span></p><p><span>Then lastly, </span><span>Day 4</span><span>, commitment. Everyone looks at the whole list, mention final objections if we should be working on something that we aren't— or vice versa. After we confirm priorities, we assign problems to people by giving them a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual).</span></p><p><span>Then, we look into each other's eyes, as much as anyone can on a video call, and commit.</span></p><p><span>After the starting gun is off, we then write RFCs on problems to see how we can best solve them which eventually become Linear tickets.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#steal-this-process"><h2><span>Steal This Process</span></h2></a></p><p><span>We're working on open-sourcing our Notion templates because honestly, this isn't rocket science. It's just:</span></p><ol><li><span>Cataloguing your problems, not solutions</span></li><li><span>Let teams prioritize independently before negotiating</span></li><li><span>Front-load the hard conversations</span></li><li><span>Commit publicly</span></li><li><span>Then, </span><span>and only then</span><span>, figure out how to solve it</span></li></ol><p><span>But the real hard part was building a culture where people feel safe bringing up problems without having to defend their pet solutions.</span></p><p><span>Keep process to a minimum, focus on performance of shipping, not performative work.</span></p><p><span>And like any good product, our planning process will keep evolving. Maybe in six months we'll realize Problem Driven Development has its own cracks. </span><span>Theres always plenty to do on planning and I think we generally know how it’ll need to evolve, but we try to take small steps from cycle to cycle.  </span><span> If that happens, we'll write another blog post about what we learned and what we changed.</span></p><p><span>Until then, we're shipping.</span></p></section></div>]]></description>
