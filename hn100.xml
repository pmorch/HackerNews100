		<p><strong>This post takes a look at the experiences of political activists in East Germany (GDR) who had to deal with Stasi informants and infiltration before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.</strong><span id="more-473"></span><br>
The invasive spying and disorientation tactics used by the East German secret police (<b>Stasi</b>) meant there were significantly fewer possibilities for civil disobedience and direct action than political grassroots activists have today in places such as Western Europe and North America. Nevertheless political activists in East Germany managed to start a grassroots revolution in 1989.</p>
<p><em>This text is based on interviews with people who were politically active in East German times, and reflects their experiences. Those familiar with how police spies have been used, for example in Britain may recognise the tactics used by both contemporary secret police and GDR activists.</em></p>

<h3>East German opposition and activism</h3>
<p>Because non-state organisations were prohibited in the GDR, networking and co-ordination between activists was informal: independent groups and networks stayed in contact through newsletters and the exchange of campaign materials, and there was a mix of local and regionally co-ordinated covert and open actions.</p>
<p>Activists in the GDR also campaigned on issues that will feel familiar to many campaigners today: anti-nuclear and peace issues, challenging economic paradigms of growth and consumption at any cost; resistance to an undemocratic state and its activities; propagating and practising sustainable choices versus exploitation of environment and animals. There was a strong emphasis on DIY culture with egalitarian, equitable principles – politically most activists in the GDR in the 1980s self-defined as socialist or anarchist.</p>

<p>Between 1945 and 1990 Germany was (to simplify a little) divided in two – <strong>West Germany</strong>, integrated into NATO and Western markets, and <strong>East Germany</strong> (German Democratic Republic: <strong>GDR</strong>), in the Soviet dominated Eastern Bloc.</p>
<p>The <strong>Stasi</strong> (<em>Ministerium für Staatssicherheit</em>) was the East German secret police, and that country had the highest proportion of informants and secret police in history: 1 in 60 people were involved by 1989.</p></div></div>
<h3>The Stasi and <em>Zersetzung</em></h3>
<p>After the East German popular uprising of June 1953 (suppressed by Soviet troops) the government gave the Stasi the task of systematic surveillance and prevention of unrest in the population. Initially this took the form of brutal physical repression: imprisonment and physical abuse (including torture) by police and secret police. But this changed during the 1970s when the GDR became more interested in gaining a positive international image, and the repression of activists became more subtle. The Stasi redefined the military term <b>Zersetzung</b> (<i>attrition </i>or<i> corrosion</i>) to name their harassment tactics: the aim was to disrupt the working of groups and the lives of individuals to such a degree that their activism became ineffective, or more preferably, ceased altogether.</p>
<p>The aim of the <i>Zersetzung</i> was to ‘switch off’ the group by rendering it ineffective, with an interim goal of hindering any positive media or public exposure. The usual ways to switch groups off were to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>create conflict between members</b> – particularly useful subjects for sowing discord were those of a philosophical or political nature, money and personal (sexual) relations;</li>
<li><b>hinder and sabotage activities</b> by the use of one or more infiltrators, who would agree to do tasks, but not get round to doing them, lose materials and equipment, repeatedly request changes and further edits of materials to slow down production, attempt to divert the group into more harmless activities etc;</li>
<li><b>isolate the groups</b> from other activists, eg by spreading rumours regarding unacceptable behaviour and political views etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of tactics in any particular case was based on extensive psychological profiling and intelligence on the group members, particularly: who plays what role, who fulfills what kind of task; what are relationships within the group like, who hangs out with whom.</p>
<p>Informants (IM: <i>Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter</i>) were the usual way to gain information on a group and were also used to implement the plans to incapacitate a group and sabotage its activities. In activist circles the informants were almost never Stasi or police officers, but were usually existing members of the groups who had been pressured, persuaded or blackmailed into helping the Stasi. Alternatively,a suitable outsider would be recruited to infiltrate the group.</p>
<div id=""><p>How did the Stasi persuade people to become informants?</p><div>
<ul>
<li>Appeals to patriotism</li>
<li>Cash or material reward</li>
<li>Blackmail (eg offers of immunity from threatened prosecution)</li>
<li>Making the mission sound like an exciting adventure</li></ul></div></div>

<h3>Zersetzung of individuals</h3>
<p>As in the case of groups, the <i>Zersetzung</i> of individuals had the aim of ‘switching off’ that person’s efficacy by undermining their confidence and their belief in the value of their activities. The Stasi did not usually care whether an individual was switched off through disillusionment, fear, burn-out or mental illness: all outcomes were acceptable, and people’s mental health and social standing during or after an operation were of no concern to the officers involved.</p>
<div id=""><p>Worrying about informants</p><p>The Stasi made little secret of the fact that they used informants, and in fact deliberately helped spread rumours about informants. This was the cheapest and most efficient way to incapacitate individuals and groups.</p></div>
<p>The <i>Zersetzung </i>of individuals was usually carried out by systematically undermining the target’s quality of life (both socially and in the workplace) with the intention of simply destroying the target’s confidence. The tactics took various forms, such as spreading slanderous rumours, causing trouble at work etc. Rumours and information (such as about unacceptable political viewpoints, inappropriate behaviour, the possibility they may be an informant etc) that were passed on to work colleagues, bosses and social circles might be based on true facts, but were often plausible untruths that were difficult or impossible to refute.</p>
<p>The first stage of <i>Zersetzung </i>was a comprehensive evaluation of state-held data and information, eg medical records, school reports, police records, intelligence reports, searches of target’s residence. At this point they were looking for any weak points (social, emotional or physical) that could be used to put pressure on the target, eg extra-marital affairs, criminal records, alcoholism, drug use, differences between the target and their group (eg age, class, clothing styles) that could be exploited to socially isolate them.</p>
<p>After this a detailed <i>Zersetzung </i>strategy was drawn up: What was the specific aim?<i> </i>What tactics should be used to exploit the target’s personal situation and character traits? What was the timescale?</p>
<p>The next stage was often to supplement covert surveillance with overt observation in order to communicate to the target that they were of interest to the Stasi and to create a sense of insecurity and paranoia. Tactics included questioning, repeated stop and searches, strange noises on telephone lines, conspicuous visits to the workplace so that bosses and colleagues were aware of the police interest etc.</p>
<p>The final stages entailed psychological and physical harassment: moving things around at home (<i>one morning the alarm clock goes off at 5am instead of 7am, and the socks are in the wrong drawer, there’s no coffee left&nbsp;…</i>); damage to bikes and vehicles (eg slashing tyres); the spreading of rumours as mentioned above; ordering goods and making appointments in target’s name etc.</p>
<p>Families were often used as leverage against activists at this stage – either as a method of blackmail (eg family members subjected to oppression as a way of putting indirect pressure on the activist), or persuasion (“your daughter will land in deep trouble if she remains involved in that group, can’t you make her see sense? It’s her career at stake&nbsp;…”). </p>
<p>Physical harassment often included repeated arrests, physical attacks on the street (eg by plain clothes officers), or abuse and assault could be incited by the rumours that had been spread (eg bullying at work, avoidance by neighbours).</p>
<h3>How effective was the Stasi?</h3>
<h4>1) Paralysing individuals and groups</h4>
<figure id="attachment_4350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4350"><a href="https://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/couple.gif"><img decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20262%20300'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/couple-262x300.gif" alt="A couple embracing, while one takes notes behind the other's back" width="262" height="300" data-srcset="https://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/couple-262x300.gif 262w, https://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/couple-894x1024.gif 894w, https://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/couple-768x880.gif 768w" data-sizes="auto, (max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4350">A couple embracing, while one takes notes behind the other’s back</figcaption></figure>
<p>The militarily organised Stasi simply couldn’t understand how many activist groups functioned without leaders and hierarchies. They often mistook informal hierarchies (caused for example by differences in empowerment levels or dominant behaviour patterns) for organisational structure – they would target those who talked the most, or took on the most tasks, and didn’t realise that even if these individuals were ‘switched off’, the rest of the group could continue to function and wouldn’t necessarily fall apart.</p>
<p>The dedication of groups was also often underestimated – even if an informant successfully sabotaged a group’s activities, the group would rarely be completely disheartened, but would try all the harder to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>The tactics of <i>Zersetzung</i> had a significant control function, if you were engaged in (or merely suspected of) activities that the Stasi didn’t like then repression was a way to punish you (not unlike the commonly used extra-judicial punishment practiced by the police in Britain today: the threat of ASBOs, severe bail conditions, the requirement to repeatedly answer bail etc).</p>
<p>The human cost of <i>Zersetzung </i>is hard to quantify – many GDR activists are still suffering from burnout, trauma and chronic mental health issues as a result of being targeted: on a personal level the Stasi was frighteningly effective.</p>
<h4>2) Gathering and using intelligence</h4>
<p>Informants weren’t just deployed to sabotage group activities and implement <i>Zersetzung</i> plans, but also to gather intelligence on individuals and groups (around 160km worth of Stasi archives survived the end of the GDR). Most intelligence was used to evaluate relationships and activities (which then led to an extension of intelligence gathering to previously untargeted individuals and groups), and as a basis for planning <i>Zersetzung</i> operations. Obviously plans for actions and activities were also reported, but these were acted upon only in rare and serious cases – if intelligence were used to disrupt the activities in any obvious way then suspicion could be drawn to the informant.</p>
<p>Intelligence from surveillance and the use of informants was rarely used to actually gain evidence for a prosecution – the Stasi desperately needed the huge amount of information it was processing in order to justify its own existence (along with the salaries and expenses of its officers and staff). If anything, this made the Stasi more dangerous to activists – the Stasi’s dependency on gathering intelligence and mounting operations made the surveillance, <i>Zersetzung</i> and sabotage more likely to happen, along with the associated human cost.</p>
<p>Informants were regularly found out – mostly because of poor preparation (at one infamous meeting, several rather conspicuous figures all introduced themselves with the same name), and chance (eg groups who came across evidence that an informant was passing information to the Stasi). But it is significant that most informants were only discovered after 1989 when the Stasi files were opened.</p>
<h3>Dealing with <em>Zersetzung</em></h3>

<p>Many people succumbed to pressure from the Stasi and other security forces, often because of mental health difficulties (brought about by the pressure) or through a process that was commonly called ‘inner migration’: giving up political and social beliefs, following the path of least resistance and ceasing oppositional activity.</p>
<p>On the other hand resistance to <i>Zersetzung </i>was remarkably commonplace, and activists found ways to remain both healthy and active. When East German activists talk today about how they managed to continue their activism, the same points come up again and again. These are summarised below.</p>
<p><b>Support from friends and other activists</b> was essential – a circle of close friends who shared an understanding of the political and policing situation was probably the most effective way to counter the Stasi. With such friends activists could talk openly about fears, suspicions and needs – they could work out ways to deal with the pressure. They spent time with these friends doing non-activism related activities which helped to build trust in the group. This helped them to know that if things got bad for them, they could both trust their friends, and be trusted by them; they would be there if help and support were needed. As a group they would make plans for possible situations – for example, who would take care of the children in case of arrest or even imprisonment, or who could provide a ‘safe house’ if somebody was being shadowed and needed a break.</p>
<p>On a wider level the <b>solidarity between groups</b> was an important factor in their survival and freedom to remain active: those groups that had strong relationships with others around the country were generally subject to less repression. In later years, particularly in East Berlin, even when repression happened, widespread solidarity actions and concerted efforts to gain publicity led to quick results (arrested or imprisoned individuals released, the work of the group allowed to resume etc). On the other hand, those groups that weren’t so well networked (usually those in small towns and rural areas where they might be the only activists) were easy pickings for the Stasi – at times whole regions of the country were ‘cleansed’ of grassroots activism.</p>
<p><b>Groups openly discussed the possibility of surveillance and intervention</b>. The groups would aim to work out what oppression measures they might be subject to (currently and in future) and think of ways they could deal with them. The hard bit was not to get lost in paranoia (particularly since there was a good chance that the group already had an informant present!), nor to be naïve or ignorant about the possibilities, but to find a middle ground of sensible measures that would, if needed, help, while not bogging the group down in extensive security measures that would just hinder the work of the group.</p>
<p>Part of working out the level of threat from the Stasi, and how to deal with it, was to consider the way the group worked, and how open the group was to newcomers. It is tempting to think that preparing and carrying out actions in the utmost secrecy would be the best defence against an opponent like the Stasi, but of the groups we know about which worked covertly in the GDR, all were subject to brutal <i>Zersetzung </i>measures, while those working openly were often subject ‘only’ to surveillance and sabotage by informants, but could nevertheless carry on their activities to a greater or lesser extent. When open groups were subject to extraordinary repression levels, they were in a good position to mobilise support from other groups and interest from West German media. (It’s difficult to draw conclusions though – generally only those from open groups are willing to speak of their experiences, and any covert group that might have survived would be, by definition, hard to find out about.) Working openly also did not preclude the need to work secretly at times, particularly when planning an action or dealing with sensitive issues, and steps would often be taken to avoid surveillance.</p>
<p><b>If a group identified an individual as a possible informant</b> they might have decided not to take any obvious initial action. An immediate reaction would be to assess whether there might be any merit in the suspicions rather than to spread rumours. The usual way of dealing with the situation would be for a few trusted individuals to discreetly research the suspect. Backgrounds would be checked (are there any family members? Do they exist? Has anyone else from the group spoken to them? What about friendships outside the group? Did the suspect actually work where they said they did? Are they familiar with the town they say they grew up in? etc) This worked well enough for informants who had been provided with a cover story and infiltrated into the group by the Stasi, but couldn’t provide clear results if the informant was a ‘real’ person who had been turned.</p>
<p>By making notes of behaviour patterns and movements of a suspect the group might think they were finding evidence of Stasi involvement, but equally, they might be framing an innocent individual. Discovering reports to handling officers would be a clear sign. But if an individual were guilty only of losing materials and not getting round to completing agreed tasks, it could not be simply assumed that they were an informant or saboteur – no matter how regularly it might happen! In other words, groups needed to be extremely careful when they thought they might have discovered an informant – it was all too easy to start a witch hunt against innocents, something that would easily paralyse groups and individuals and play right into the hands of the Stasi.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It is easy to get lost in analysing the techniques the Stasi used, and the more you look into it, the more frightening it gets. But it’s worth mentioning that, in our assessment, the grassroots opposition movements made the biggest contribution to the revolution that started in East Germany in autumn 1989 – despite the horrifying levels of repression and surveillance that they had faced for decades. Quite simply, the Stasi failed to predict the events of that year, and once things had started, their <i>Zersetzung</i> tactics became ineffective.</p>

						   <p>A new study found that a gene recently recognized as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease is actually a cause of it, due to its previously unknown secondary function. Researchers at the University of California San Diego used artificial intelligence to help both unravel this mystery of Alzheimer’s disease and discover a potential treatment that obstructs the gene’s moonlighting role.</p>

<p>The research team published their results on April 23 in the journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.03.045">Cell</a>.</p>

<p>About one in nine people aged 65 and older has Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia. While some particular genes, when mutated, can lead to Alzheimer’s, that connection only accounts for a small percentage of all Alzheimer’s patients. The vast majority of patients do not have a mutation in a known disease-causing gene; instead, they have “spontaneous” Alzheimer’s, and the causes for that are unclear.</p>

<p>Discovering those causes could ultimately improve medical care.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, treatment options for Alzheimer’s disease are very limited. And treatment responses are not outstanding at this moment,” said study senior author Sheng Zhong, a professor in the Shu Chien-Gene Lay Department of Bioengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.</p>

<p>So Zhong and his team took a closer look at phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which they had previously <a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/discovery-of-new-biomarker-in-blood-could-lead-to-early-test-for-alzheimers-disease">discovered as a potential blood biomarker</a> for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. In a follow-up study, they later found that <a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/study-of-promising-alzheimers-marker-in-blood-prompts-warning-about-brain-boosting-supplements">expression levels of the PHGDH gene directly correlated</a> with changes in the brain in Alzheimer’s disease; in other words, the higher the levels of protein and RNA produced by the PHGDH gene, the more advanced the disease. That correlation has since been verified in multiple cohorts from different medical centers, according to Zhong.</p>

<p>Intrigued by this reproducible correlation, the research team decided to investigate in this latest study whether there was a causal effect. Using mice and human brain organoids, the researchers found that altering the amounts of PHGDH expression had consequential effects on Alzheimer’s disease: lower levels corresponded to less disease progression, whereas increasing the levels led to more disease advancement. Thus, the researchers established that PHGDH is indeed a causal gene to spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>In further support of that finding, the researchers determined—with the help of AI—that PHGDH plays a previously undiscovered role: it triggers a pathway that disrupts how cells in the brain turn genes on and off. And such a disturbance can cause issues, like the development of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<h3>Moonlighting role</h3>

<p>PHGDH creates an enzyme key for the production of serine, an essential amino acid and a neurotransmitter. Because PHGDH’s enzymatic activity was its only known role, the researchers hypothesized that its metabolic function must be connected to an Alzheimer’s outcome. However, all their experiments designed to prove so failed.</p>

										<p>“At that time, our study hit a wall, and we didn’t have a clue of what mechanism it is,” said Zhong.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/music-map-reveals-some-brain-cells-age-faster-and-are-more-prevalent-in-alzheimers">another Alzheimer’s project</a> in his lab, which did not focus on PHGDH, changed all this. A year ago, that project revealed a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease: a widespread imbalance in the brain in the process where cells control which genes are turned on and off to carry out their specific roles.</p>

<p>The researchers were curious if PHGDH had an unknown regulatory role in that process, and they turned to modern AI for help.</p>

<p>With AI, they could visualize the three-dimensional structure of the PHGDH protein. Within that structure, they discovered that the protein has a substructure that is very similar to a known DNA-binding domain in a class of known transcription factors. The similarity is solely in the structure and not in the protein sequence.&gt;</p>

<p>Zhong said, “It really demanded modern AI to formulate the three-dimensional structure very precisely to make this discovery.”</p>

<p>After discovering the substructure, the team then demonstrated that with it, the protein can activate two critical target genes. That throws off the delicate balance, leading to several problems and eventually the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. In other words, PHGDH has a previously unknown role, independent of its enzymatic function, that through a novel pathway leads to spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>That ties back to the team’s earlier studies: the PHGDH gene produced more proteins in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients compared to the control brains, and those increased amounts of the protein in the brain triggered the imbalance. While everyone has the PHGDH gene, the difference comes down to the expression level of the gene, or how many proteins are made by it.</p>

<h3>Treatment option</h3>

<p>Now that the researchers uncovered the mechanism, they wanted to figure out how to intervene and thus possibly identify a therapeutic candidate, which could help target the disease.</p>

<p>While many current treatments focus on treating the abnormal buildup of the sticky protein called beta-amyloid in the brain, some studies suggest that treating those plaques may be ineffective: essentially by that stage of accumulation, treatment is too late. But the critical pathway discovered in this study is upstream, so preventing this pathway can reduce amyloid plaque formation in the first place.</p>

										<p>Given that PHGDH is such an important enzyme, there are past studies on its possible inhibitors. One small molecule, known as NCT-503, stood out to the researchers because it is not quite effective at impeding PHGDH’s enzymatic activity (the production of serine), which they did not want to change. NCT-503 is also able to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier, which is a desirable characteristic.</p>

<p><span><span>They turned to AI again for three-dimensional visualization and modeling. They found that NCT-503 can access that DNA-binding substructure of PHGDH, thanks to a binding pocket. With more testing, they saw that NCT-503 does indeed inhibit PHGDH’s regulatory role.</span></span><they access="" again="" ai="" and="" can="" dna-binding="" for="" found="" modeling.="" nct-503="" of="" phgdh="" substructure="" that="" they="" three-dimensional="" to="" turned="" visualization=""> </they></p>

<p>When the researchers tested NCT-503 in two mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, they saw that it significantly alleviated Alzheimer’s progression. The treated mice demonstrated substantial improvement in their memory and anxiety tests. These tests were chosen because Alzheimer’s patients suffer from cognitive decline and increased anxiety.</p>

<p>The researchers do acknowledge limitations of their study. One being that there is no perfect animal model for spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease. They could test NCT-503 only in the mouse models that are available, which are those with mutations in those known disease-causing genes.</p>

<p>Still, the results are promising, according to Zhong.</p>

<p>“Now there is a therapeutic candidate with demonstrated efficacy that has the potential of being further developed into clinical tests,” said Zhong. “There may be entirely new classes of small molecules that can potentially be leveraged for development into future therapeutics.”</p>

<p>An advantage of small molecules is that they could even be administered orally, he added, unlike the current treatments that require infusions.</p>

<p>The next steps will be to optimize the compound and subject it to FDA IND-enabling studies.</p>

Because plugins are WASM, they can be written in various languages such as Rust, Go, TypeScript etc. Plugins can also act as libraries, which is possible because of WebAssembly Components (a great piece of software!) -- so you can dynamically call functions from other plugins within your agent, and you get type support for your chosen language too (with codegen via WASM Components tooling).</p><p>More recently, I've been working on an SSH server for agents. The idea is that you can add public keys to your custom agent and then SSH into it to talk to it easily from terminal.</p><p>If this sounds interesting, feel free to join our Discord!

Currently, there is one way to do it. The client querying the agent receives JSON-encoded values that are returned from plugin function calls made by the agent. These values are received alongside the agent token response stream (via SSE). So plugins can essentially emit events that the client can forward to the UI application, such as to click a button etc. The limitation with this is that there is no built-in way to send a success/error status back, it's one way only. It works well for actions that are infallible such as simple UI actions.</p><p>The client here would also need a way to interact with the target program of course, e.g. from a JavaScript browser you can click buttons and manipulate the DOM, or from a VSCode Plugin you can interact with the editor etc.</p><p>It's definitely something that can be improved though! I've been thinking about some type of MCP interoperability that could maybe assist with this.</p></div></td></tr>

Category Theory, as mathematicians look at it, is an extremely abstract field. If you want to do pure math related stuff in Category Theory, and only then, I would say important prereqs are Abstract Algebra and Topology. I believe the motivation for Category theory lies in Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Topology, but you definitely don't need to be an expert on these to learn it.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I recently started working on a fishing journal/log kind of app. I got that idea last year when returning from fishing with dad, that it would be nice if we could track what we caught each time we went fishing, where we went, and to track some details (water and wea details). There apps that already do that, and one could also use Excel or just paper notebook, so I'm making this mainly for us and his friends to use. It's still early, but I'd like to add groups so you can exchange messages or catches with your friends, add stats allowing you to see for example at what time and where you caught most fish, or using which lure or bait. The app is in Serbian though, but here's a link if you want to check it out: <a href="https://buckaros.com/" rel="nofollow">https://buckaros.com</a></p>

It's a lightweight Go binary that monitors the Nomad events stream and triggers actions based on configurable providers.</p><p>A few examples of what it can currently do:</p><p>- Automated data backup: Listens for Nomad job events and spawns auxiliary jobs to back up data from services like PostgreSQL or Redis to your storage backend based on job meta tags. The provider for this is not limited to backups, as it allows users to define their custom job and ACL templates, and expected tags. So it can potentially run anything based on the job registration and de-registration events.</p><p>- Cross-namespace service discovery: Provides a lightweight DNS server that acts as a single source of truth for services across all namespaces, solving Nomad's limitation of namespace-bound services. Works as a drop-in resolver for HAProxy, Nginx, etc.</p><p>- Event-driven task execution: Allows defining custom actions triggered by specific Nomad events; perfect for file transfers, notifications, or kicking off dependent processes without manual intervention. This provider takes in a user-defined shell script and executes it as a nomad job based on any nomad event trigger the user defines in the configuration.</p><p>Damon uses a provider-based architecture, making it extensible for different use cases. You can define your own providers with custom tags, job templates, and event triggers. There's also go-plugin support (though not recommended for production) for runtime extension.</p><p>I built this to eliminate the mundane operational tasks our team kept putting off. It's already saving us significant time and reducing gruntwork in our clusters.</p><p>Check out the repository[1] if you're interested in automating your Nomad operations. I'd love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions about implementation or potential use cases!</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://github.com/Thunderbottom/damon">https://github.com/Thunderbottom/damon</a></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Honestly a little bit hesitant to say anything yet. There are a few more features to add, and a whole lot more work to be done to showcase just how cool it is. But the short version is, I'm working on a sort of meta-pico8, a game maker for WebGL2 2d pixel art games (e.g. 320x180 games like Animal Well) that runs in the browser, but one that's firstly collaborative, so that we can all build it together. And some of the coolest features are the based around that. For example, I got arbitrary imports of user code working <i>in the browser</i>, so all you have to do is create an account, add a JS file, and other people can import it as if it were a built-in module, and it <i>just works</i>. Plus the SDK I ended up making is simple, and the API is clean, and there's a few innovations in the GUI layer that I'm excited to share. I wish I could explain just how cool this is.</p>

Each step relies on the output of the last step, and the workflow framework is engineering to be declarative, testable, and versioned. Similar to GitHub actions, but for *anything*.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>I have an angel and a devil sitting atop each shoulder. The angel says, "Just code for fun! What you make can be just for your enjoyment and that's --" the devil interjects, "not enough to get ahead, loser. If you're not coding your next startup then how're you gunna get rich? Coding for fun? Pfft, sounds like the fast lane to being poor."</p>
<p>Since I was a kid I've always gravitated toward computers. First sucked in via computer games, then Lego NXT Robots, then turtles, then high school Java, and finally a college degree. It always starts off as some form of play, and before I know it I've learned something new. At 8 years old, I played Age of Empires III only to get suckered into learning how to fix the install on Windows. In 6th grade I built a Lego machine gun using the Lego NXT robotics and learned how to program using blocks. In 8th grade I used turtles to make cool designs. </p>
<p>But I also grew up consuming hustle porn. I loved reading Wired and Entreprenuer magazine and dreamed of being on the cover. For 2 years in highschool I so desperately wanted to attend Babson College to enroll in their entreprenuership program. I watched an Amazon Prime knockoff of Silicon Valley called <em>Betas</em> and unironically wanted to be like the "visionary" social media startup founder who was founding yet another doomed social media platform. Now I'm on Twitter/X &amp; Hacker News, which of course mainline these capitalist ideals straight to my brain.</p>
<p>So I've cultivated the angel, and the devil. The angel motivated by curiosity, a sincere desire to learn and improve, and most of all have fun. The devil motivated by power, money, status.</p>
<p>I constantly find the devil on my shoulder trying to convince me to start a new side hustle. Starting a new monetizable side project is like a latent addiction. Giving in feels like relapsing. The angel says don't worry about some side hustle, just do well in your day job and code for fun as a hobby. But the devil keeps telling me that you can "be your own boss" and "earn what you're worth". </p>
<p>In a perfect world, I could listen to the angel and solely get by having fun and working on things I enjoy. But if I didn't listen to the devil from time to time, I wouldn't stay up to date with the latest technologies, and as a result I wouldn't be able to pay my bills.</p>
<p>Typically, the devil is associated with worldly material things, whereas angels are associated with high ideals, such as curiosity, enlightenment, and purity. Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world, so the devil on my shoulder will never be vanquished. Which means that instead, this will always be a story of managing the devil, and learning when and when not to listen to him. </p>
<p>I've learned now, that I can no longer force myself to work on things that I don't like forever, since I will burn out. As I mature, I am better honing perception for when and when not to give in to the devil's call to build something for profit. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>This is the story of how I found one of my favorite iOS vulnerabilities so far. It’s one of my favorites because of how simple it was to implement an exploit for it. There’s also the fact that it uses a legacy public API that’s still relied upon by many components of Apple’s operating systems, and that many developers have never heard of.</p><h2>Darwin Notifications</h2><p>Most iOS developers are likely used to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter?language=objc">NSNotificationCenter</a>, and most Mac developers are also likely used to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/distributednotificationcenter?language=objc">NSDistributedNotificationCenter</a>. The former only works within a single process, the latter allows simple notifications to be exchanged between processes, with the option to include a string with additional data to be transmitted alongside the notification.</p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/darwinnotify/darwin-notification-api">Darwin notifications</a> are even simpler, as they’re a part of the CoreOS layer. They provide a low-level mechanism for simple message exchange between processes on Apple’s operating systems. Instead of objects or strings, each notification may have a <code>state</code> associated with it, which is a <code>UInt64</code>, and typically is only used to indicate a boolean <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> by specifying <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</p><p>A simple use case for the API would be for a process that just wants to notify other processes about a given event, in which case it can call the <code>notify_post</code> function, which takes a string that’s usually a reverse DNS value like <code>com.apple.springboard.toggleLockScreen</code>.</p><p>Processes interested in receiving such a notification can register by using the <code>notify_register_dispatch</code> function, which will invoke a block on a given queue any time another process posts the notification with the specified name.</p><p>A process that’s interested in posting a Darwin notification with a state has to first register a handle for it, which can be done by calling the <code>notify_register_check</code> function, which takes the name of the notification and the pointer to an <code>Int32</code>, which is where the function returns a token that can be used to call <code>notify_set_state</code>, which also takes a <code>UInt64</code> value for the state.</p><p>Via the same <code>notify_register_check</code> mechanism, a process that wants to get the state of a notification can call <code>notify_get_state</code> to get its current state. This allows Darwin notifications to be used for certain types of events, but also hold some state that any process on the system can query at any given time.</p><h2>The Vulnerability</h2><p>Any process on Apple’s operating systems — including iOS — can register to be notified about any Darwin notification, from within its sandbox, without the need for special entitlements. This makes sense given that some system frameworks used by third-party apps rely on Darwin notifications for important functionality.</p><p>Given that the amount of data transferred through them is very limited, Darwin notifications are not a significant risk for sensitive data leaks, even though the API is public, and sandboxed apps can register for notifications.</p><p>However, just as any process on the system can register to <strong>receive</strong> Darwin notifications, the same is true for <strong>sending</strong> them.</p><p>To summarize, Darwin notifications:</p><ul><li>Require no special privileges for receiving</li><li>Require no special privileges for <strong>sending</strong></li><li>Are available as public API</li><li>Have no mechanism for <strong>verifying the sender</strong></li></ul><p>Considering these properties, I began to wonder if there were places on iOS using Darwin notifications for powerful operations that could potentially be exploited as a denial-of-service attack from within a sandboxed app.</p><p>You’re reading this blog post, so I’ve already spoiled it: the answer was “yes”.</p><h2>Proof of Concept: EvilNotify</h2><p>With that question in mind, I grabbed a fresh copy of the iOS root filesystem — one of the early iOS 18 betas at the time, I think — and began looking for processes that used <code>notify_register_dispatch</code> and <code>notify_check</code>.</p><p>I quickly found a bunch of them, and made a test app called “EvilNotify” that I could use for testing.</p><p>Unfortunately, I no longer have a vulnerable device I could use to record a proper on-device video, but the iOS Simulator demo above shows most of what the proof of concept was able to do. Some of them don’t work in the Simulator, so I couldn’t demo them in the video.</p><p>You can see a hint at the end of the video of what the ultimate denial of service was, but let me mention all the other things it was capable of doing. Keep in mind, all of them would affect the entire system, even if the user force-quit the app.</p><ul><li>Cause the “liquid detection” icon to show up in the status bar</li><li>Trigger the Display Port connection status to show up in the Dynamic Island</li><li>Block system-wide gestures for pulling down Control Center, Notification Center, and Lock Screen</li><li>Force the system to disregard Wi-Fi and use the cellular connection instead</li><li>Lock the screen</li><li>Trigger a “data transfer in progress” UI that prevented the device from being used until the user cancelled it</li><li>Simulate the device entering and leaving Find My’s “Lost Mode”, triggering an Apple ID password dialog prompt to re-enable Apple Pay</li><li>Trigger device entering a “restore in progress” mode</li></ul><h2>“Restore in Progress”</h2><p>Since I was looking for a denial-of-service attack, this last one seemed to be the most promising, as there was no way out of it other than by tapping the “Restart” button, which would always cause the device to reboot.</p><p>It was also quite neat, since it consisted of a single line of code:</p><pre><code><span>notify_post</span>(<span>"com.apple.MobileSync.BackupAgent.RestoreStarted"</span>)
</code></pre><p>That’s it! That single line of code was enough to make the device enter “Restore in Progress”. The operation would inevitably fail after a timeout since the device was not actually being restored, for which the only remedy was tapping the “Restart” button, which would then reboot the device.</p><p>Looking into the binaries, SpringBoard was observing that notification to trigger the UI. The notification is triggered when the device is being restored from a local backup via a connected computer, but as established before, any process could send the notification and trick the system into entering that mode.</p><h2>Denial of Service: VeryEvilNotify</h2><p>Now that I had a Darwin notification with the potential of becoming a denial of service, I just had to figure out a way to trigger it repeatedly across device reboots.</p><p>At first, this sounded quite tricky, since apps on iOS have very limited opportunities for background processing, and quite a few APIs with side effects are prevented from working when an app is not in the foreground. The latter I found out would not be a problem, as I could verify that <code>notify_post</code> worked even when the app was not in the foreground.</p><p>As for being able to post the notification again and again as the device rebooted multiple times, I wasn’t so sure, but I had a hunch that an app extension would be the most likely to succeed.</p><p>Some types of third-party app extensions may run before first unlock on iOS devices, so I decided to try a type of app extension I’m quite familiar with, and created a widget extension, in a new app that I called “VeryEvilNotify”.</p><p>Widget extensions are periodically woken up in the background by iOS. They have a limited amount of time for generating snapshots and timelines, which the system then displays in various places, including the Lock Screen, Home Screen, Notification Center, and Control Center.</p><p>Because of how widespread the use of widgets is on the system, when a new app that includes a widget extension is installed and launched, the system is very eager to execute its widget extension. That gets an app’s widgets ready for the user to pick and add to the various supported placements.</p><p>A widget extension is ultimately just a process that can run code, so I added the aforementioned line of code to my widget extension. I had configured the extension to include every possible type of widget, just to make it as likely as possible that iOS would execute it as quickly as possible.</p><p>There’s a problem though: widget extensions produce placeholders, snapshots, and timelines, which are then cached by the system in order to preserve resources. These extensions are not running in the background all the time, and even if the extension requests very frequent updates, the system will enforce a time budget and delay updates if the extension attempts to request them too frequently.</p><p>To circumvent that, I decided to try making my widget extension always crash shortly after running the <code>notify_post</code> function, which I did by calling Swift’s <code>fatalError()</code> function in every extension point method of its <code>TimelineProvider</code>.</p><p>The call to <code>notify_post</code> was made as part of the entry point of the extension, before handing off execution to the extension runtime:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> WidgetKit
<span>import</span> SwiftUI
<span>import</span> notify

<span>struct</span> VeryEvilWidgetBundle: <span>WidgetBundle</span> {
    <span>var</span> body: <span>some</span> <span>Widget</span> {
        <span>VeryEvilWidget</span>()
        <span>if #available</span>(iOS <span>18</span>, *) {
            <span>VeryEvilWidgetControl</span>()
        }
    }
}

<span>/// Override extension entry point to ensure the exploit code is always run whenever
/// our extension gets woken up by the system.</span>
<span>@main
struct</span> VeryEvilWidgetEntryPoint {
    <span>static func</span> main() {
        <span>notify_post</span>(<span>"com.apple.MobileSync.BackupAgent.RestoreStarted"</span>)

        <span>VeryEvilWidgetBundle</span>.<span>main</span>()
    }
}
</code></pre><p>With that widget extension in place, as soon as I installed the VeryEvilNotify app on my security research device, the “Restore in Progress” UI was shown, then failed with a prompt to restart the system.</p><p>After restarting, as soon as SpringBoard was initialized, the extension would be woken up by the system, since it had failed to produce any widget entries before, which would then start the process all over again.</p><p>The result is a device that’s soft-bricked, requiring a device erase and restore from backup. I suspect that if the app ended up in the backup and the device was restored from it, the bug would eventually be triggered again, making it even more effective as a denial of service.</p><p>My theory was that iOS would have some sort of retry mechanism when a widget extension crashes, which would obviously have some sort of throttling mechanism. I still think that’s true, but something about the timing of the extension crashing and the restore starting then failing probably prevented such a mechanism from working.</p><p>Satisfied with my proof of concept, I reported the issue to Apple.</p><h2>Timeline</h2><p>Below is a summarized timeline of events for this vulnerability report. There were additional status updates via automated messages from Apple’s security reports system that I have not included for brevity.</p><ul><li>June 26, 2024: initial report sent to Apple</li><li>September 27, 2024: got a message from Apple informing me that mitigation was in progress</li><li>January 28, 2025: issue flagged as resolved and bounty eligibility confirmed</li><li>March 11, 2025: bug assigned CVE-2025-24091, <a href="https://support.apple.com/122066">addressed in iOS/iPadOS 18.3</a></li><li>Bug bounty amount: US$17,500</li></ul><p>Even though the CVE has already been assigned and Apple has provided a link where the advisory and credit are supposed to be published, that hasn’t happened yet. I’ve been informed that it will be published soon, but you can read the advisory below in case it hasn’t been published yet by the time this post goes out.</p><figure>

CVEs are unique IDs used to uniquely identify vulnerabilites. The following describes the impact and description of this issue. Impact - An app may be able to cause a denial-of-service. Description - An app could impersonate system notifications. Sensitive notifications now require restricted entitlements.">
    </picture>
</figure><p>Notice how the advisory mentions that “sensitive notifications now require restricted entitlements”, hinting at what the mitigation was. You can read more about that in the following section.</p><h2>Mitigation</h2><p>As mentioned by Apple in the advisory, sending sensitive Darwin notifications now requires the sending process to possess restricted entitlements. It’s not a single entitlement that just allows posting any sensitive notification, but a prefix entitlement in the form of <code>com.apple.private.darwin-notification.restrict-post.&lt;notification&gt;</code>.</p><p>From what I could gather from a brief look into the disassembly, what causes a notification to be “restricted” is the prefix <code>com.apple.private.restrict-post.</code> in the name of the notification.</p><p>For example, the <code>com.apple.MobileBackup.BackupAgent.RestoreStarted</code> notification is now posted as <code>com.apple.private.restrict-post.MobileBackup.BackupAgent.RestoreStarted</code>, which causes <code>notifyd</code> to verify that the posting process has the <code>com.apple.private.darwin-notification.restrict-post.MobileBackup.BackupAgent.RestoreStarted</code> entitlement before it allows the notification to be posted.</p><p>Processes observing the notification will also be using its new name with the <code>com.apple.private.restrict-post</code> prefix, thus preventing any random unentitled app or process from posting a notification that can have serious side effects on the system.</p><p>I didn’t have the opportunity to bisect numerous older iOS releases to find the exact version where this mechanism was introduced, but thanks to <a href="https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw-diffs">ipsw-diffs</a>, it appears that the entitlement first showed up in <a href="https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw-diffs/blob/fee5b3c8c18e4639e74677dd3cc1fa80203e64f6/18_2_22C5109p__vs_18_2_22C5125e/Entitlements.md?plain=1#L2336">iOS 18.2 build 22C5125e</a>, AKA iOS 18.2 beta 2.</p><p>The first adopters were <code>backupd</code>, <code>BackupAgent2</code>, and <code>UserEventAgent</code>, all gaining entitlements related to notifying the system about device restores, mitigating the most egregious exploit presented in my proof of concept.</p><p>Throughout the various iOS 18 betas and releases, more and more processes began adopting the new entitlement for restricted notifications, and with the release of iOS 18.3, all issues demonstrated in my PoC were addressed.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

	looking only for low pages.
  </li><li>Added a helper to check if memory has been freed for a given
	request to improve speed of the page daemon loop.
  </li><li>Started accounting for in-flight pages being written to disk when
	the page daemon is computing page shortage.

  </li><li>Adjusted the ptrace interface to properly support
	single-threaded continue and make it possible to use breakpoints in
	multi-threaded processes in gdb.
  </li><li>Add <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ptrace.2">ptrace(2)</a>
	commands used to read/write the XSAVE area of a traced process.
  </li><li>Correctly honored the count optional argument of the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> break command,
	ensuring execution does not stop until the breakpoint is hit at least
	that many times.
  </li><li>Taught <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> how to
	disassemble endbr64.
  </li><li>Moved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dt.4">dt(4)</a> to using
	a ringbuffer per CPU.
  </li><li>Added 'socket' refcnt type to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dt.4">dt(4)</a>.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/btrace.8">btrace(8)</a>
	support additional interval/profile units (hz, us, ms, s).

	regular keys if set to 0.
  </li><li>Implement <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bus_dma.9">bus_dma(9)</a> bounce buffering
	for raw memory.
  </li><li>Started ignoring sub-nodes of non-functional nodes in the ACPI
	tree walk to fix double and triple attachments of the same PCIe root
	bridges.

  </li><li>Suspend/Hibernate Support
  <ul>
  <li>Ensured all
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/apm.8">hibernate</a>
    data is written inside the allocated chunk of swap.

  </li><li>Corrected
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/apm.8">hibernate</a>
    error detection during RLE writes.
  </li><li>Ensured
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/apm.8">hibernate</a>
    fails when I/O or memory allocation errors occur.
  </li></ul>

  </li><li>Bugfixes
  <ul>

  </li><li>Reworked how processes are stopped because of a signal. Now
	multithreaded processes can be reliably stopped and continued. This
	should fix problems seen in golang, mpv and in our regress tests.
  </li><li>Fix possible races of changes to the per-process unveil
	data structures by either pledge() [removing all path promises] or
	unveil() [adding new paths], against namei() inspecting in other

  </li><li>Made `video_filtops' MP-safe.
  </li><li>Run TCP output and TCP timers in parallel.
    <ul>
    <li>TCP <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/send.2">send(2)</a>

    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Unlocked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/accept.2">accept(2)</a> for TCP sockets.
  </li><li>Started using shared net lock when calling <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/shutdown.2">shutdown(2)</a> on internet

  </li></ul>

</li><li>Direct Rendering Manager and graphics drivers
  <ul>
  <li>Updated <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/drm.4">drm(4)</a>
      to Linux 6.12.21.
  </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/drm.4">amdgpu(4)</a>: Added kernel

      support for Arrow Lake.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>VMM/VMD improvements
  <ul>
  <li>Added an IPI for executing INVEPT to flush EPT on remote CPUs, a
	first step toward allowing guest memory not to be wired by UVM.
  </li><li>Implemented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/psp.4">psp(4)</a>
	shutdown command and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ioctl.2">ioctl(2)</a> PSP_IOC_SHUTDOWN,

  </li><li>Started using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acpipci.4">acpipci(4)</a> on
	hypervisors. If the hypervisor cpuid bit is set, use acpipci to attach
	PCI busses. As virtualization is not that old, we can assume that in
	VMs we don't need the quirk for old, broken ACPI.  This solves
	problems with PCI BAR access and recent SeaBIOS versions on QEMU.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Various new userland features:
  <ul>
  <li>Numerous changes to make the
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/imsg_init.3">imsg</a> API
	stricter and better, which were followed
	by adapting all applications across the tree.
  </li><li>Allow the user to provide an alternative perfpolicy when on
	battery, extending the semantics of hw.perfpolicy to provide two
	buttons to specify desired behavior. This gives users more flexibility
	in setting the performance when AC-powered vs. battery powered.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/calendar.1">calendar(1)</a> use the
	environment variable RECIPIENT_EMAIL for sending mails to.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/security.8">security(8)</a>
	use GMT rather than the local timezone when checking for changes in
	device nodes and setuid files. Avoids false positives when changing
	timezones.
  </li><li>Added a new variable PASSWDSKIP that can be set in
	/etc/daily.local to prevent <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/security.8">security(8)</a> from
	complaining about specific accounts that have no password. This is
	typically used for services like anoncvs and gotd.
  </li><li>Added [-f file] to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.8">sysctl(8)</a> to apply
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.conf.5">sysctl.conf(5)</a>
	in one go, and started using it in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a> instead of a parser implemented in ksh.
  </li><li>Added support for read/write of xmm/ymm registers to
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lldb.1">lldb(1)</a>.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Various bugfixes and tweaks in userland:
  <ul>
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wsconscfg.8">wsconscfg(8)</a> -g option
	to get the index of the current virtual terminal.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getgrouplist.3">getgrouplist(3)</a>
	always return the total number of groups found.
  </li><li>Ignore extra groups that don't fit in the buffer passed to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getgrouplist.3">getgrouplist(3)</a>,
	providing only the kernel maximum of sixteen groups.
  </li><li>Prevent <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/newsyslog.8">newsyslog(8)</a> from running
	through time checks when an entry needs to be rotated based on size.
  </li><li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ps.1">ps(1)</a> to print
	the session id (PID of the session leader) instead of a pointer with
	display argument 'sess'.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cu.1">cu(1)</a>, map ucom
	unit number to cuaU number using the same scheme MAKEDEV uses, fixing
	problems with ucom units &gt; 10.
  </li><li>Made CPU frequencies human-readable with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/systat.1">systat(1)</a> sensors -h.
  </li><li>Fixed a bug where <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getty.8">getty(8)</a> dx flag was
	supposed to set decctlq, but was setting ixany instead.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a> run <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ldconfig.8">ldconfig(8)</a> after each
	updateset if the list of shared libraries was changed.
  </li><li>Corrected behavior of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sed.1">sed(1)</a> c command to match
	POSIX.
  </li><li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>
	-fzero-call-used-regs aware of the register used by
	retguard. QEMU is using -fzero-call-used-regs, causing a crash.
  </li><li>Disk partition information is now saved by
	  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/security.8">security(8).</a>
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/security.8">security(8)</a>
	ignore <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/quota.1">quota(1)</a> files
	and all subdirectories of /var/mail when checking the ownership and
	mode of mailboxes.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg-config.1">pkg-config(1)</a> support
	for relocatable .pc files.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.1">mandoc(1)</a> "-T html"
	and "-T markdown" output translate ".%R RFC &lt;number&gt;" to a
	hyperlink to rfc-editor.org.
  </li><li>Support decimal fractions like "0.25i" in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/roff.7">roff(7)</a> scaled widths
	and arithmetic operations in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tbl.7">tbl(7)</a> column widths,
	as needed for some manual pages written with DocBook.
  </li><li>When <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/syslogd.8">syslogd(8)</a>
	acting as logserver with TLS (-S) and
	client-certificates are used for authentication (-K), use the CN from
	the client's certificate as hostname.
  </li><li>Adjusted the alignment when
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/df.1">df(1)</a> prints inode columns.
	This makes
	'df -hi' on systems with large partitions easier on the eyes.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/test.1">test(1)</a> use
	timespeccmp() and st_mtim instead of comparing st_mtime to fix

  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/qcpon.4">qcpon(4)</a> query hardware for the button state to detect release even if the press event is missed, and to signal wakeup when the button is pressed.
  </li><li>Made qcscm(4) attach at acpi(4). This lets Qualcomm machines which use qcscm(4) access EFI variables in ACPI mode. Some arm64 machines, like the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge can be successfully installed with this change.
  </li><li>Fixed support for AMD 600 series <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ahci.4">ahci(4)</a> controller.
  </li><li>Introduce a pckbc@acpi driver attachment that is use instead of pckbc@isa when an interrupt configuration is incompatible with legacy ISA. This unbreaks, among other things, the keyboards in various Chromebooks.
  </li><li>Implemented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rkpmic.4">rkpmic(4)</a> power down if the PMIC is marked as the system power controller in the device tree.

  </li></ul>

</li><li>New or improved network hardware support:
  <ul>
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ice.4">ice(4)</a>, a driver for Intel E810 Ethernet (1Gb/10Gb/25Gb/50Gb/100Gb) devices.

  </li></ul>

</li><li>Installer, upgrade and bootloader improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>On the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/macppc.html">macppc</a>
	architecture, make ofwboot sync instruction cache before entering
	kernel, preventing a potential boot failure.
<!-- installboot -->
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a>
	install a copy of the UEFI bootloader in /efi/openbsd on the EFI
	system partition, allowing creation of boot options for the firmware
	boot manager other OSes will leave alone.
  </li><li>Only install a second copy of the bootloader if the EFI
	System Partition is at least 1MB to avoid filling up the tiny ESPs we
	used to create a few releases ago.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a> only
	set BootOrder if our boot option isn't already part of it. This means
	sysupgrade (or reinstalls) will no longer set OpenBSD as the default
	OS if users change the boot order by some other means.  Fresh installs
	will still make OpenBSD the default OS.
  </li><li>Added a -c option <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a> that
	sets up the machine to boot from the specified disk, used on arm64 and
	amd64 with UEFI and GPT.
<!-- sysupgrade -->
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> -R #.#
	to try to use a specific release version rather than the immediate
	+0.1.
  </li><li>Provided a mechanism for getting required keys to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> older
	machines, providing a new set of keybundles signed by older keys to
	allow sysupgrade to securely and automatically download the required
	key.
  </li><li>Added firmware keys to the signify key bundles. <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> will now
	extract the firmware key also, allowing fw_update fetch the most
	up-to-date firmware before upgrading.
  </li><li>Added support to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> to
	perform a sysupgrade from a fileset stored on a filesystem. This is
	convenient for offline machines.
<!-- fw_update -->
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> -a mean
	all when downloading or installing, not just deleting.
  </li><li>Allowed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> to
	download firmware without root.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> -l flag to
	list drivers or files.
  </li><li>Added -D option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> for using
	a different dmesg for driver detection.
<!-- installer proper -->
  </li><li>Reworked the "Default IPv6 router?" question in the installer to
	behave like the other questions.
  </li><li>On amd64 with ACPI &gt;= 5, assume that the installer booted in
	UEFI mode and default to using a GUID Partition Table (GPT).
  </li><li>Make IPv6 link-local scope identifiers in "HTTP Server?" answers work in the installer.
<!-- updates/sysmerge -->
  </li><li>On updates using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>, added
	options to interactive <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff(1)</a> merge for choosing
	both sides of a diff.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Security improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Added sshd-auth to the binaries that relink at boot.
  </li><li>Split the user authentication code from the sshd-session binary
	into a separate sshd-auth binary. This will be executed by
	sshd-session to complete the user authentication phase of the protocol
	only.  Splitting this code into a separate binary ensures that the
	crucial pre-authentication attack surface has an entirely disjoint
	address space from the code used for the rest of the connection.
  </li><li>Unveiled <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mountd.8">mountd(8)</a>
	privileged child's write to/create of
	mountdtab file, and drop exec permission.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>New features in the network stack:
  <ul>
  <li>Added an AF_FRAME socket domain and an IFT_ETHER protocol family
	under it, allowing userland to use sockets to send and receive
	Ethernet frames.
  </li><li>Added tunneldf support to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sec.4">sec(4)</a>.
  </li><li>Added use of Toeplitz hash for UDP and IPv6 TCP output, giving an
	improvement in traffic distribution over the queues and 20%
	performance increase with UDP send on v4/v6 and TCP send on v6 without
	pf.
  </li><li>Implemented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tun.4">tun(4)</a>
	network offloads between the kernel and userland and introduced a new
	TUNSCAP ioctl .
  </li><li>Implement a per-thread route cache by implementing a thread
	local memory (struct netstack) that gets passed down the network
	stack. For consecutive packets it can reuse the route to the same
	destination.
  </li></ul>

  </li><li>Further changes and bugfixes in the network stack:
  <ul>
  <li>Replaced rwlock with iterator in UDP input multicast loop, preventing a potential kernel crash.
  </li><li>Ensure that the correct address family is used in ip_deliver()
	for enqueuing a packet, fixing a problem with tunneling of different
	address families.
  </li><li>Let LLDP packets fall through to being handled on the port
	interfaces for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/aggr.4">aggr(4)</a> as mandated by the standard.
  </li><li>Enabled multiqueue for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vio.4">vio(4)</a>.
  </li><li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pppoe.4">pppoe(4)</a> data
	packets go through if_vinput instead of the pppoeinq, improving
	throughput and possibly reducing packet loss.
  </li><li>Fixed out-of-band data in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/somove.9">somove(9)</a> socket splicing.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4">wg(4)</a> logging of IP addresses of remote endpoints.
  </li><li>Limited receive queue of loopback interfaces with 8192 packets,
	preventing unlimited queues from reaching mbuf limits and making
	network unusable on some architectures.
  </li><li>Fixed TCP checksum for IPv6 packets with extension headers.
  </li><li>Fixed incorrect ICMP error translation in af-to NAT, making
	traceroute6 behind af-to to provide meaningful information.
  </li><li>Fixed a 24-year old bug where various checks for broadcast
	packets were mistakenly skipped, allowing one to send broadcast
	packets without the SO_BROADCAST option.
  </li><li>Prevented installation of path MTU routes for IPsec transport mode SAs.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>The following changes were made to the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> firewall:
  <ul>
  <li>Allowed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a>
	specification of interface and queue bandwidths greater than ~4Gbit.
  </li><li>Fixed inpcb leak in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/divert.4">divert(4)</a> attach.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Routing daemons and other userland network programs saw the following improvements:
<ul>
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
	"natt" option that forces negotiation of nat-t (and udpencap).
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/radiusd.8">radiusd(8)</a> log the username when rejecting by ipcp.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a> vxlan
	"[-]endpoint" command, to remove a tunnel endpoint of a MAC address.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a> scan display
	wpa3.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump.8">tcpdump(8)</a> print PPPoE tags as hex dumps.
  </li><li>Improved lldp output of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump.8">tcpdump(8)</a>.
  </li><li>Added support for client certificates to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a> -v show the account URI from the Location header sent by the server in response to the newAccount API call.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a> always print account URI on first creation of an account key.
  </li><li>Added TLS support to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpbench.1">tcpbench(1)</a>.
  </li><li>Started taking into account how long the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ntpd.8">ntpd(8)</a> DNS probe takes
	before deciding to punt.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.8">unwind(8)</a>
	block list wildcard support using block list entries starting with '.'.
  </li><li>Implemented zoneversion EDNS option (RFC 9660) in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dig.1">dig(1)</a>.
  </li><li>Adjusted rDNS lifetime to RFC 8106 default (minimum) value in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rad.8">rad(8)</a>.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nfsd.8">nfsd(8)</a> default to UDP when using only -n.
  </li><li>Implemented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iscsid.8">iscsid(8)</a> handling of
	HeaderDigest and DataDigest params.
  </li><li>Made iscsid send out all the values for session and connection
	params for each login stage, keeping control of what is selected,
	making it possible to connect to a lio target.
  </li><li>Respect checksum offloading in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay.8">dhcrelay(8)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay6.8">dhcrelay6(8)</a>.
  </li><li>Respect checksum offloading for incoming UDP in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.8">dhcpd(8)</a>.

  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>Fixed few imprecisions in
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/forward.5">forward(5)</a>
	    with regard to where and when <code>|</code> and
	    <code>:include:</code> are disallowed.
	</li><li>Fixed the connect filter request documentation in
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd-filters.7">smtpd-filters(7)</a>.
	</li><li>Proper handling of permanent failures in
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mail.lmtp.8">mail.lmtp(8)</a>,
	    previously all failures were considered temporary and so delivery
	    was attempted again.
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
  <li>Cache the Adj-RIB-Out for sessions that have not been down for
      more than 1h. This significantly improves synchronisation time
      of peers that flap.
  </li><li>Implement RFC 8538: Notification Message Support for
      BGP Graceful Restart.
  </li><li>Add support for RFC 8654, extended messages.
  </li><li>In bgplgd add additional endpoints to query the Adj-RIB-In and
      Adj-RIB-Out.
  </li><li>Bump internal message size limit to 128k and handle up to 10 000
      ASPA SPAS entries as suggested in draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile.
  </li><li>Various improvements to the ibuf API including a new reader API
      which is used to make all message parsing in bgpd memory safe.
  </li><li>Added support for IPsec and TCP MD5 to RTR sessions.
  </li><li>Improve default multiproto capability announcement selection.
      The default MP capability is only set if no other capability is
      configured on the neighbor.
  </li><li>The `reject as-set` configuration option now defaults to yes.
      Route announcements with AS_SET segments in the AS_PATH Attribute
      will be rejected. See draft-ietf-idr-deprecate-as-set-confed-set
      for more information.
  </li><li>The RFC 8654 Extended Message configuration changed from
      "announce extended (yes|no|enforce)" to
      "announce extended message (yes|no|enforce)"
  </li><li>RFC 8950 - Extended nexthop encoding support in the RIB.
  </li><li>Preliminary support for EVPN in the RIB.
  </li><li>When "transparent-as yes" is set, well-known BGP communities are
      passed on according to RFC 7947. This means that IX Route Servers
      transparently pass through NO_EXPORT, NO_ADVERTISE, etc.
  </li><li>Make the example bgpd.conf work out of the box with 4byte ASN.
  </li></ul>

  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a>,
  <ul>
  <li>The generated BIRD config file was reworked. BIRD versions 1.x are no
  longer supported and the -T option to customize the ROA table name was
  removed. The config file now includes the ASPA-set by default and is
  therefore only compatible with BIRD 2.16 and later. If compatibility
  with older BIRD versions is required, the ASPA-set can be excluded
  with the -A flag. Operators should delete any remaining bird1v4 and
  bird1v6 output files.
  </li><li>Validated ROA payloads from AS0 TALs are by default excluded from the
  output files as they are not recommended for automatic filtering of
  BGP routes. This precaution can be overridden with the new -0 flag.
  </li><li>Various improvements to the ibuf API, including a new reader API
  which is used to make all message parsing in rpki-client memory safe.
  </li><li>Warn about gaps in manifest issuance. Such gaps can appear for example
  if rpki-client isn't run frequently enough, if there are issues with
  an RFC 8181 publication server or if there is an operational error on
  the side of the CA.
  </li><li>Work around a backward compatibility break accidentally introduced
  in OpenSSL 3.4.0, which resulted in all RPKI signed objects being
  rejected. Earlier and later versions of OpenSSL are not affected.
  </li><li>Improved validity period checking in file mode. The product's lifetime
  and the expiration time of the signature path are now taken into
  account.
  </li><li>Better cleanup in case of a fallback from RRDP to RSYNC. In rare
  circumstances, files were moved to the wrong place in the cache.
  </li><li>rpki-client now includes arin.tal which is no longer
  <a href="https://www.arin.net/announcements/20250116-tal/">legally encumbered</a>.
  </li><li>rpki-client reports Certification Authorities that do not meaningfully
  participate in the RPKI as non-functional CAs. By definition, a CA is
  non-functional if there is no currently valid Manifest. The number of
  such CAs is printed at the end of each run and more detailed information
  is available in the JSON (-j) and ometrics (-m) output.
  </li><li>Fix a problem where incorrect internal RRDP state handling in
  rpki-client could lead to a denial of service.
  </li><li>Termination of rsync child processes with SIGTERM is no longer treated as
  an error if rpki-client has sent this signal. This only affects openrsync.
  </li><li>Do not exit filemode with an error if a .gbr or a .tak object contains
  control characters in its UTF-8 strings. Instead, only warn and emit a

</li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> improvements and bug fixes:
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed grey color in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>.
  </li><li>Added a way to make the preview larger in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> tree mode.
  </li><li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> problems with pasted text being interpreted as extended keys.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> only use default-shell for popups, returning to /bin/sh for run-shell, if-shell and #().
  </li><li>Added MSYSTEM to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> default update-environment.
  </li><li>Added copy-mode-position-format to configure the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> position indicator.
  </li><li>Added -y flag to disable <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> confirmation prompts in modes.
  </li><li>Reworked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> copy mode commands ("send-keys -X") to parse the arguments so that flags may be detected properly rather than just looking for strings ("-O" and so on). Also added -C and -P flags to the copy commands. -C prevents the commands from sending the text to the clipboard and -P prevents them from adding the text as a paste buffer.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> prompt-cursor-colour and prompt-cursor-style to set the style of the cursor in the command prompt and remove the emulated cursor.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> initial-repeat-time option to allow the first repeat time to be increased and later reduced.
  </li><li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> sixel_support format variable which is 1 if SIXEL is supported (always 0 on OpenBSD).
  </li><li>Allow control characters prefixed with C-v to be entered at the tmux.1 command prompt.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> support for a scrollbar at the side of each pane using new options pane-scrollbars, pane-scrollbars-positions and pane-scrollbars-styles.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> option to control the input buffer size.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> scrollbar mouse support.
  </li><li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> no-detach-on-destroy client option, useful for control mode clients.
  </li><li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> scrollbar style parameters width and pad.
  </li><li>Added copy-mode-position-style and copy-mode-selection-style options to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>.
  </li><li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> option allowing users to override the width of individual Unicode codepoints.
  </li><li>Fixed mouse_hyperlink format in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> copy mode.
  </li><li>Added S-Up and S-Down to move windows in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> tree mode.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> correctly skip wide characters in hyperlinks.
  </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> only align panes and windows, not sessions.

      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OPENSSL_init_crypto.3">OPENSSL_init_crypto(3)</a>.
      It has no effect since LibreSSL doesn't call
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/atexit.3">atexit(3)</a>.
    </li><li>Elliptic curve parameters are only accepted if they encode a
      built-in curve.
    </li><li>EC_METHOD is no longer public and the API exposing it has been
      removed.  This includes
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-7.6/EC_GROUP_new.3">EC_GROUP_new(3)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-7.6/EC_GFp_mont_method.3">EC_GFp_mont_method(3)</a>,

    </li><li>All elliptic curves over fields with less than 224 bits and a
      few more were removed from the built-in curves. This includes
      all WTLS curves and P-192.
    </li><li>It is no longer necessary to set RSA_FLAG_SIGN_VER to use the
      sign and verify handlers set with
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/RSA_meth_set_sign.3">RSA_meth_set_{sign,verify}</a>.
    </li><li>Removed the -C option to generate "C code" from the
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1">openssl(1)</a>

    </li><li>const corrected
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/UI_OpenSSL.3">UI_OpenSSL(3)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_MONT_CTX_copy.3">BN_MONT_CTX_copy(3)</a>.
    </li><li>Support OPENSSL_NO_FILENAMES.
    </li><li>Support SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION and SSL_OP_ALLOW_CLIENT_RENEGOTIATION.
    </li><li>Export PKCS12_key_gen_uni() again.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>New features
    <ul>
    <li>libtls has a new
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_peer_cert_common_name.3">tls_peer_cert_common_name(3)</a> API call to retrieve
      the peer's common name without having to inspect the PEM.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Bug fixes

    </li><li>Fixed a few memory leaks in legacy code.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Documentation
    <ul>
    <li>The remaining undocumented public
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/evp.3">EVP</a> API is now documented.
    </li><li>Reorganization of existing documentation for clarity and accuracy.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Testing and proactive security
    <ul>
    <li>Improved regress coverage of the EC code.
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>

</li><li>OpenSSH 10.0
  <ul>
  <li>Security fixes
    <ul>

      <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
      fix the DisableForwarding directive, which was failing
      to disable X11 forwarding and agent forwarding as documented.
      X11 forwarding is disabled by default in the server and agent
      forwarding is off by default in the client.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Potentially incompatible changes
    <ul>
    <li>This release removes support for the weak DSA signature
    algorithm, completing the deprecation process that began in
    2015 (when DSA was disabled by default) and repeatedly warned
    over the last 12 months.

    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: pass "ControlMaster
    no" to ssh when invoked by scp &amp; sftp. This disables implicit
    session creation by these tools when ControlMaster was set to yes/auto
    by configuration, which some users found surprising. This change will
    not prevent scp/sftp from using an existing multiplexing session if
    one had already been created.

    </li><li>This release has the version number 10.0 and announces itself as
    "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_10.0". Software that naively matches versions using
    patterns like "OpenSSH_1*" may be confused by this.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: this
     release removes the code responsible for the user authentication
     phase of the protocol from the per- connection sshd-session binary to
     a new sshd-auth binary.  Splitting this code into a separate binary
     ensures that the crucial pre-authentication attack surface has an
     entirely disjoint address space from the code used for the rest
     of the connection. It also yields a small runtime memory saving as
     the authentication code will be unloaded after the authentication
     phase completes. This change should be largely invisible to users,
     though some log messages may now come from "sshd-auth" instead of
     "sshd-session". Downstream distributors of OpenSSH will need to
     package the sshd-auth binary.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: this
      release disables finite field (a.k.a modp) Diffie-Hellman key
      exchange in sshd by default. Specifically, this removes the
      "diffie-hellman-group*" and "diffie-hellman-group-exchange-*"
      methods from the default KEXAlgorithms list. The client is unchanged
      and continues to support these methods by default. Finite field
      Diffie Hellman is slow and computationally expensive for the same
      security level as Elliptic Curve DH or PQ key agreement while
      offering no redeeming advantages. ECDH has been specified for
      the SSH protocol for 15 years and some form of ECDH has been the
      default key exchange in OpenSSH for the last 14 years.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: this
      release removes the implicit fallback to compiled- in groups for
      Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange KEX when the moduli file exists
      but does not contain moduli within the client- requested range.
      The fallback behaviour remains for the case where the moduli file
      does not exist at all. This allows administrators more explicit
      control over which DH groups will be selected, but can lead to
      connection failures if the moduli file is edited incorrectly.

    </li></ul>

  </li><li>New features
    <ul>

     <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: the hybrid
     post-quantum algorithm mlkem768x25519-sha256
     is now used by default for key agreement. This algorithm is considered
     to be safe against attack by quantum computers, is guaranteed to
     be no less strong than the popular curve25519-sha256 algorithm,
     has been standardised by NIST and is considerably faster than the
     previous default.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: prefer AES-GCM
     to AES-CTR mode when selecting a cipher for the connection. The
     default cipher preference list is now ChaCha20/Poly1305, AES-GCM
     (128/256) followed by AES-CTR (128/192/256).

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add %-token
     and environment variable expansion to the ssh_config SetEnv directive.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow %-token
     and environment variable expansion in the ssh_config User directive,
     with the exception of %r and %C which would be self-referential.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add "Match version"
     support to ssh_config and sshd_config. Allows matching on the local
     version of OpenSSH, e.g. "Match version OpenSSH_10.*".

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add support
     for "Match sessiontype" to ssh_config.  Allows matching on the type of
     session initially requested, either "shell" for interactive sessions,
     "exec" for command execution sessions, "subsystem" for subsystem
     requests, such as sftp, or "none" for transport/forwarding-only
     sessions.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add support
     for "Match command ..." support to ssh_config, allowing matching on
     the remote command as specified on the command-line.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow 'Match
     tagged ""' and 'Match command ""' to match empty tag and command
     values respectively.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: allow
     glob(3) patterns to be used in sshd_config AuthorizedKeysFile and
     AuthorizedPrincipalsFile directives.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: support the
     VersionAddendum in the client, mirroring the option of the same name
     in the server.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: the
     agent will now delete all loaded keys when signaled with SIGUSR1. This
     allows deletion of keys without having access to $SSH_AUTH_SOCK.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
     support FIDO tokens that return no attestation data, e.g. recent
     WinHello.

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>: add
     a "-Owebsafe-allow=..." option to allow the default FIDO application
     ID allow-list to be overridden.

     </li><li>Add a work-in-progress tool to verify FIDO attestation blobs
     that ssh-keygen can optionally write when enrolling FIDO keys.
     This tool is available under regress/misc/ssh-verify-attestation
     for experimentation but is not installed by "make install".

     </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
     allow "-" as output file for moduli screening.

    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Bugfixes
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: remove
      assumption that the sshd_config and any configs
      it includes can fit in a (possibly enlarged) socket buffer.  Previously
      it was possible to create a sufficiently large configuration
      that could cause sshd to fail to accept any connection. <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> will now actively
      manage sending its config to the sshd-session sub-process.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: don't start
      the ObscureKeystrokeTiming mitigations if there has been traffic
      on a X11 forwarding channel recently.  Should fix X11 forwarding
      performance problems when this setting is enabled.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: prohibit the
      comma character in hostnames accepted, but allow an underscore as
      the first character in a hostname.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: set
      high-water when resuming a "put". Prevents bogus "server reordered
      acks" debug message.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix regression in
      openssh-9.8, which would fail to accept "Match criteria=argument" as
      well as the documented "Match criteria argument" syntax in ssh_config
      and sshd_config.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix a number possible
      NULL dereference bugs, including Coverity CIDs 405019 and 477813.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix
      PerSourcePenalty incorrectly using "crash" penalty when LoginGraceTime
      was exceeded.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix "Match
      invalid-user" from incorrectly being activated in initial configuration
      pass when no other predicates were present on the match line

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix debug
      logging of user specific delay.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: improve
      debug logging across sub-process boundaries.
      Previously some log messages were lost early in the sshd-auth and
      sshd-session processes' life.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: require
      control-escape character sequences passed via the '-e ^x' command-line
      to be exactly two characters long. Avoids one byte out-of-bounds read
      if ssh is invoked as "ssh -e^ ..."

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: prevent integer
      overflow in X11 port handling.  These are theoretically possible if
      the admin misconfigured X11DisplayOffset or the user misconfigures
      their own $DISPLAY, but don't happen in normal operation.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
      don't mess up ssh-keygen -l output when the file contains CR
      characters.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
      add rate limits to logging of connections dropped by
      PerSourcePenalties. Previously these could be noisy in logs.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: fix argument
      of "Compression" directive in ssh -G config dump, which regressed
      in openssh-9.8.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix a
      corner-case triggered by UpdateHostKeys when sshd refuses to accept
      the signature returned by an agent holding host keys during the hostkey
      rotation sub-protocol. This situation could occur in situations where
      a PKCS#11 smartcard that lacked support for particular signature
      algorithms was used to store host keys.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
      when using RSA keys to sign messages with "ssh-keygen -Y", select
      the signature algorithm based on the requested hash algorithm
      ("-Ohashalg=xxx"). This allows using something other than the default
      of rsa-sha2-512, which may not be supported on all signing backends,
      e.g. some smartcards only support SHA256.

      </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1">ssh-keyscan(1)</a>:
      fix ML-KEM768x25519 KEX on big-endian systems.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.6 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the

<section id="sourcecode">
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<section id="ports">
<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
</p><p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_7</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
</p><p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.7 release will be made available if problems arise.
</p><p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.

At first glance, they might seem like little more than a collection of dates and accomplishments. But for me, they’ve become a wellspring of creativity — each one a glimpse into a life I never would’ve imagined. And as decades of creativity research suggest, the most original ideas often come from the most unlikely sources.</p><p>That’s why one popular piece of advice for boosting creativity is to learn something new every day. But here’s the catch: This only works if that new information is <em>very different</em> from what’s already in your head. This is where most of our modern habits fall short. Internet searches, for instance, give you information that’s related to what you already know, or information that you’re already interested in. So, how do you escape that loop and stumble upon something unexpected, something you didn’t even know to look for? The obituaries, obviously — but I’ll come back to that.</p><p>In February, I <a href="https://sawyerpodcast.com/yoed-kenett-the-associations-of-the-creative-mind" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">interviewed Yoed Kenett</a>, who studies high-level cognition and creativity, for my podcast “The Science of Creativity.” His research shows that creativity thrives on making connections between very different concepts. The core idea is simple: Our ability to create relies on prior knowledge, and our creative potential increases when that knowledge is organized into conceptual networks that help us search for, connect, and generate new ideas — what Kenett calls a “Google of the mind.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>The greater the distance between two ideas, the more original and surprising their combination tends to be.</p></blockquote></figure><p>This research goes back to the 1960s, when psychologist Sarnoff Mednick was studying patterns of thought in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was exploring the idea that highly creative individuals might share certain associative patterns with those diagnosed with schizophrenia, namely, the tendency to make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. In <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1963-06161-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a classic 1962 experiment</a>, Mednick asked participants to say the first word that came to mind when they heard a prompt like <em>table</em>. Less creative participants tended to respond with obvious associations like <em>chair</em> or <em>leg</em>. The more creative participants gave those answers, too, but they also came up with more surprising ones, like <em>food</em> or even <em>mouse</em>.</p><p>Mednick’s observations led him to propose that highly creative people have a different kind of memory structure — one that holds a wider range of ideas and forges more unexpected connections between them. He called his theory <em>the associative theory of creativity</em>. His research showed that creative ideas are more likely to emerge from combinations of concepts that are further apart in the mind’s conceptual network. The greater the distance between two ideas, the more original and surprising their combination tends to be. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30667235/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">More recent research</a>, by Kenett and others, confirms these observations.</p><p>Some of the best-known stories of invention come from unexpected associations. Velcro, for example, <a href="https://invention.si.edu/invention-stories/george-de-mestral-velcror-inventor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">was invented</a> when George de Mestral was walking his hairy sheepdog through a field of burr-covered plants. It’s notoriously difficult to remove burrs from an animal’s hair, which means the animal is going to carry seeds a far distance, allowing the plant to spread more successfully. De Mestral took out a magnifying glass and saw very tiny hooks that clung to the dog’s hair. Then he made the distant connection: The burr’s mechanism, designed by nature to spread seeds, could be used to make a clothing fastener. There’s no shortage of other surprising inventions that began with distant connections: <a href="https://www.invent.org/blog/trends-stem/who-invented-post-it-notes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Post-It notes</a>, the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-eighteen-accidental-scientific-discoveries-changed-the-world" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">X-ray</a>, <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/is-discovery-inevitable-or-serendipitous/">shatterproof glass</a>, <a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/social-science/how-some-inventions-had-the-funniest-origin-stories.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the microwave oven</a>, <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/toys/silly-putty/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">silly putty</a>, <a href="https://www.mddionline.com/cardiovascular/the-surprising-history-behind-an-extremely-common-cardiovascular-medical-device" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">heart stents</a>.</p><p>The psychologist Dedre Gentner <a href="https://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/papers/wisniewski%26Gentner_1991.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">also found</a> that the more conceptually distant two ideas are, the more creative their combination tends to be. For instance, she found that if you ask 100 people to imagine a chair combined with a table — two closely related items — most of them will picture something like a school desk. It’s an obvious match within the category of furniture. But if you asked 100 people to imagine a chair combined with a pony — very distant concepts — the results are far more varied and surprising: A chair you sit on while grooming a pony, one that a pony sits in, one shaped like a pony’s head, or one covered in fur.</p><p>Gentner calls this <em>property mapping</em> — when people borrow attributes like texture or shape from one concept and apply them to another. It’s a kind of remote association, and clearly more creative than imagining a standard school desk. But Gentner identified something even more powerful: <em>structure mapping</em>. This happens when you transfer the <em>relational structure</em> of one concept to another. Say you combine “pony” and “chair” and picture a chair shaped like a pony — that’s still property mapping, just more elaborate. But if you imagine a <em>small</em> chair, you’ve made a bigger leap. That’s structure mapping: drawing on the idea that a pony is smaller than a horse, and applying that relationship to redefine the size of a chair. These kinds of mappings — especially when the underlying relations are abstract or non-obvious — tend to produce the most original and surprising combinations.</p><p>You can strengthen your ability to make remote associations by exposing yourself to a wider variety of information, especially from conceptually different domains. Most of us stick to what we know. We don’t normally encounter distant concepts in everyday life, so stretching our minds into unfamiliar territory takes some effort.</p><hr><p>Which brings me back to obituaries. I’m not talking about the half-page write-ups of celebrities or politicians. I mean the small-print obituaries in the <em>New York Times</em> Sunday edition — the ones squeezed into eight columns on a single page, paid for by friends and family. These people aren’t famous. But their lives, described lovingly and vividly by those who knew them best, are often more surprising than any headline obituary. And they’re an ideal way to boost your creativity.</p><p>It’s important to read all of the obituaries on Sunday. If you filter your reading by only choosing people who are like you, then you won’t be absorbing the most different, surprising new information.</p><p>Here are two that I read one Sunday morning recently:</p><p><strong>Berta Escurra</strong> was born in 1924 in San Pedro de Lloc, Peru. She was a follower of British writer and spiritual thinker Rodney Collin when he moved to Mexico City in 1948. In 1963, she moved to New York City and founded the Spanish International Network (SIN) with Rene Anselmo. SIN was the first TV network in the U.S. to broadcast entirely in Spanish. Anselmo later went on to found PanAmSat, the world’s first private international satellite system.</p><p><strong>Norton Garfinkle</strong> died on March 20, 2025 at the age of 94. Garfinkle was a professor at Amherst College and a serial entrepreneur. He founded a company that detected land mines for the U.S. and foreign governments. He invented a news database search algorithm and sold it to Reuters. He developed PLAX, the first pre-brushing dental rinse. He started Electronic Retailing Systems, which provided self-checkout systems to supermarkets. He started a company that published <em>Lamaze Parent Magazine</em>.</p><p>See what I mean about being interesting? You’ve probably never heard of either of them. (I hadn’t.) But reading their stories introduces you to a mix of fields — broadcasting, aerospace, esotericism, oral hygiene, database design, prenatal publishing — that you’d rarely, if ever, encounter all in one place. It’s exactly the kind of conceptually distant material that helps fuel creative thinking.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Start by reading the obituaries slowly, without searching for a big idea.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Here’s how you can use the obituaries to enhance your creative cognition.</p><p>First, start by reading them slowly, without searching for a big idea. Let the details wash over you — the places lived, the professions practiced, the odd hobbies pursued. Notice what sticks.</p><p>It’s not just about learning new facts, of course — it’s about asking questions. Why was a British mystic in Mexico City? How did Spanish-language television evolve in the U.S.? What led someone to invent PLAX or build search tools for financial news decades before Google? Even if you don’t find all the answers, just posing the questions helps you flex the creative muscle that thrives on curiosity and connection.</p><p>Will any of the life stories you read cause you to have a surprising, creative insight? No one can say. But<strong> </strong>research shows that <em>distant analogies</em> often lead to creative breakthroughs, often in unexpected ways. What you’re doing is filling up your brain with a range of very different cognitive material.</p><p>In every person’s life story, there’s always a narrative, always a deeper principle at work. How did a woman from Peru get to Scotland, Mexico City, and then New York?

<p>You dial into your Zoom meeting while sitting on a moving train. Your mobile device (i.e., User Equipment, UE) must seamlessly switch towers as you go in and out of range. This concept, called <strong>mobility,</strong> remains a central requirement for mobile networks, but it’s also a central security vulnerability.</p>



<p>You see, you may have just been hacked while leisurely zooming on said train – and you’d never know it.</p>



<p>The GSM (better known as 2G) protocol has <strong>a security vulnerability that exposes a user’s personal identifier (IMSI) in the clear, allowing for attribution and geolocation.</strong> This vulnerability is also in the UMTS (a.k.a. 3G) spec, and in the LTE (4G) spec. While the vulnerability was finally addressed in NR (5G), it’s imperfect and remains an exploitable 5G network vulnerability… and my favorite cybersecurity topic.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll introduce this long-standing security exploit, known as an IMSI catcher, discuss some high-level technical aspects regarding 2G–4G IMSI catchers, then finish with 5G security improvements and the possibility of 5G IMSI catchers.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-an-imsi">What is an IMSI?</h2>



<p>Every account on a cellular network has a unique identifier to connect a SIM card to a credit card, and that identifier is called the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI, pronounced “IM-zee”). This number contains 3 pieces of information: the Mobile Country Code (MCC) of the issuing network operator, the Mobile Network Code (MNC) of the issuing network operator, and a unique number that only exists for that SIM card. The IMSI is ultimately used to make sure you paid your bill and that you’re allowed to register onto a network.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-an-imsi-catcher">What is an IMSI catcher?</h2>



<p>An IMSI catcher is a tool that collects cellular signals and decodes packets to access and save off the IMSI. There are two types of IMSI catchers: <strong>active and passive.</strong></p>

<h3 id="h-active-imsi-catcher">Active IMSI Catcher</h3>



<p>Also known as a cell station simulator or rogue base station, an active IMSI catcher is the more effective of the two. The downside is that it requires RF transmission, which violates FCC laws (and international equivalents) and is detectable.</p>

<h3 id="h-passive-imsi-catcher">Passive IMSI Catcher</h3>



<p>This type requires a lot more planning and may not yield as many IMSIs. However, it’s undetectable (from an RF perspective) and reflects a true account of the network without interference.</p>



<p>To use an analogy, <strong>active</strong> IMSI catchers are like standing outside of the grocery store with an official-looking outfit and asking for people’s licenses to write down the number; it may work until someone with a badge shows up. </p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong>passive</strong> IMSI catchers are like sitting behind the one-way glass by the checkout counter and taking a photo of everyone’s licenses when they open their wallets – difficult to detect and not illegal because it’s in plain sight (probably… I’m not a lawyer and this isn’t legal advice).</p>











<h2 id="h-how-does-an-imsi-catcher-work">How does an IMSI catcher work?</h2>



<p><em>(NB: The remainder of this article refers exclusively to passive IMSI catchers.) </em></p>



<p>A UE (User Equipment, like your smartphone) is constantly performing selection, reselection, and registration procedures to maintain mobility and access to the cellular network. These processes are extremely complicated at the technical level, yet conceptually they’re very simple.</p>



<ol>
<li>After selecting a cell tower, based on measurements and control information, the UE sends a request to attach to a cell tower.</li>



<li>If the UE is allowed to attach, the cell tower and UE go back and forth a few times to negotiate some parameters, finalizing with the UE sending its IMSI.</li>



<li>The cell tower starts a new back-and-forth with the network to establish whether or not the IMSI is valid, active, and paid.</li>



<li>If the UE is allowed on the network, the cell tower initiates the authentication process, and everything from here on out is encrypted.</li>
</ol>



<p>This would be the end of the story, were it not for mobility. Again, mobility is a feature, as well as a network vulnerability. Every time the UE switches to another tower, it must repeat the registration process. (Ok, not EVERY time, but every time that the UE is in IDLE mode, which is most of the time. Handover is a whole other discussion.)</p>



<p>To minimize the number of times a UE registers using an unencrypted IMSI, the network issues a Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI, pronounced “TIM-zee”). The TMSI is issued over an encrypted connection and associated with the IMSI on the network side. For the sake of this article, we’ll consider the TMSI to be an unexploitable solution (…it’s not).</p>



<p>There are 3 ways to catch an IMSI: </p>



<p>LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! </p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the technical aspects of developing a passive IMSI catcher are complicated. (If you’re interested in this topic, send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@zetier.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hello@zetier.com</a>.) The simplified explanation is this: sometimes phones send IMSIs in cleartext, and if you’re collecting at the right place and right time, you’ll catch them. Conversely, even if you have the perfect IMSI catcher, but you’re in the wrong location, you’ll never catch an IMSI.</p>











<h2 id="h-so-where-do-you-catch-an-imsi">So, where do you catch an IMSI?</h2>



<p>In the 2G and 3G protocols, IMSIs are sent in the clear under 3 conditions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Initial attach</li>



<li>Crossing a Location Area Code (LAC) boundary <em>(NB: Depending on the system configuration, TMSIs can be shared between LACs)</em></li>



<li>Location Update Request (LUR)</li>
</ol>



<p>In addition, these protocols utilize spectrum around the downlink center frequency for Radio Resource Control (RRC), meaning a radio only needs to tune to a single frequency to get the downlink and uplink for these particular messages – which is very convenient. However, my favorite thing about the ever-dwindling 2G/3G towers is that the initial attach procedure includes inter-RAT (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_access_technology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radio Access Technology</a>) reselection. This means you can grab an IMSI in any LTE dead zone where a UE falls back to 2G or 3G.</p>



<p>4G is much less convenient: the uplink and downlink channels are necessary, and they must be partially synchronized. This is ultimately a technical issue that can be overcome with computing power. Furthermore, the initial attach is really the only viable option for reliably grabbing IMSIs, yet it’s extremely unreliable. 4G IMSIs can be found on PLMN borders (e.g., country borders, airports, roaming boundaries) and older RAT borders (e.g., reselection boundaries from 2G or 3G towers). If 4G/LTE piques your curiosity, you may want to explore the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/kotuliak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IMSI extractor.</a></p>



<p><strong>5G has finally addressed the cleartext IMSI network vulnerability.</strong> The IMSI is now called the Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI, pronounced “SOUP-ee”), and the unique identifier portion is encrypted using public key cryptography to create the Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI, pronounced “SU-shi”). </p>



<p>Together, the 5G SUPI and SUCI sufficiently solve the 5G network vulnerability: the SUCI is transmitted in the clear (instead of the 5G SUPI), yet the SUCI isn’t useful for identification or geolocation.</p>











<h2 id="h-so-that-s-it-imsi-catchers-are-dead">So that’s it? IMSI catchers are dead?</h2>



<p>From a purely academic stance, perhaps IMSI catchers have become impractical on fully patched, full-featured, network-wide 5G deployments. But such <strong>perfection remains extremely unlikely, and I expect to see several opportunities:</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>5G is a multi-stage rollout, and any 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) deployments have all of the same vulnerabilities as 4G!</li>



<li>Downgrading from 5G to 4G supports handover (i.e., the TMSI is passed between RATs), but I’ve seen so many misconfigured towers over the years that I’d assume a downgrade to be vulnerable.</li>



<li>Mobile carriers may also not use the SUCI at all. I’m not sure how prevalent this vulnerability is in the wild, but I believe it’s non-zero.</li>
</ol>











<h2 id="h-how-to-block-an-imsi-catcher">How to block an IMSI catcher</h2>



<p>There’s no way to block an IMSI catcher. The only simple thing you can do, that can have an effect, is to set your network priority to 5G-SA – but most phones don’t support this feature. </p>



<p>If you’re really paranoid, stay in airplane mode until you’re in a very dense coverage area. While this is far from a guarantee, IMSI catchers are more likely to be sitting in areas with compromised signal quality. </p>



<p>Finally, you can keep your phone in a Faraday bag, which can provide up to 100 dB of signal attenuation.</p>











<h2 id="h-there-s-always-something">There’s always something</h2>



<p>Cellular mobility will always have intrinsic vulnerabilities. The 3GPP 5G-NR spec has been a huge improvement against attribution attacks, which is definitely good for users. As for CNE developers, it has shifted the problem from technical to geographical. Active IMSI catchers and active jamming remain viable options, but they come with the same risks as always. On the bright side, there’s still work to be done – and it’s very fun work!</p>

<p dir="auto">Like most Wii homebrew software, this software depends on <a href="https://github.com/devkitPro/libogc">libogc</a>.
After development of The Homebrew Channel had already started, we discovered that large portions of libogc
were stolen directly from the Nintendo SDK or games using the Nintendo SDK (decompiled and cleaned up).
We thought that at least significant parts of libogc, such as its threading implementation, were original,
and reluctantly continued to use the project while distancing ourselves from it.</p>
<p dir="auto">It has recently been revealed that the threading/OS implementation in libogc is, in fact,
<a href="https://github.com/derek57/libogc">stolen from RTEMS</a>. The authors of libogc didn't just steal proprietary
Nintendo code, but also saw it fit to steal an <em>open source</em> RTOS and remove all attribution and copyright
information. This goes far beyond ignorance about the copyright implications of reverse engineering Nintendo
binaries, and goes straight into outright deliberate, malicious code theft and copyright infringement.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current developers of libogc are <a href="https://github.com/devkitPro/libogc/issues/201">not interested</a> in
tracking this issue, finding a solution, nor informing the community of the problematic copyright status of
the project. When we filed an issue about it, they immediately closed it, replied with verbal abuse, and then
completely deleted it from public view.</p>
<p dir="auto">For this reason, we consider it impossible to legally and legitimately compile this software at this point,
and cannot encourage any further development.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Wii homebrew community was all built on top of a pile of lies and copyright infringement, and it's all
thanks to shagkur (who did the stealing) and the rest of the team (who enabled it and did nothing when it was discovered). Together, the developers deceived everyone into believing their work was original.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please demand that the leaders and major contributors to console or other proprietary device SDKs and
toolkits that you use and work with do things legally, and do not tolerate this kind of behavior.</p>

function in a really old version of RTEMS. While the code has been simplified and many identifiers renamed, it
is clear that the libogc version is a direct descendant of the RTEMS version. It is not possible for two code
implementations to end up this similar purely by chance.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Homebrew Channel</h2><a id="user-content-the-homebrew-channel" aria-label="Permalink: The Homebrew Channel" href="#the-homebrew-channel"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This repository contains the public release of the source code for
The Homebrew Channel.</p>
<p dir="auto">Included portions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The Homebrew Channel</li>
<li>Reload stub</li>
<li>Banner</li>
<li>PyWii (includes Alameda for banner creation)</li>
<li>WiiPAX (LZMA executable packer)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Not included:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Installer</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note that the code in this repository differs from the source code used to build
the official version of The Homebrew Channel, which includes additional
protection features (i.e. we had to add reverse-DRM to stop scammers from
selling it).</p>
<p dir="auto">This code is released with no warranty, and hasn't even been tested on a real
Wii, only under Dolphin (yes, this release runs under Dolphin).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Build instructions</h2><a id="user-content-build-instructions" aria-label="Permalink: Build instructions" href="#build-instructions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You need devkitPPC and libogc installed, and the DEVKITPRO/DEVKITPPC environment
variables correctly set. Use the latest available versions. Make sure you have
libogc/libfat, and also install the following 3rd party libraries:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>zlib</li>
<li>libpng</li>
<li>mxml</li>
<li>freetype</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You can obtain binaries of those with
<a href="https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman" rel="nofollow">devkitPro pacman</a>. Simply use</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo (dkp-)pacman -S ppc-zlib ppc-libpng ppc-mxml ppc-freetype"><pre><code>sudo (dkp-)pacman -S ppc-zlib ppc-libpng ppc-mxml ppc-freetype
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, you'll need the following packages on your host machine:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>pycryptodomex (for PyWii)</li>
<li>libpng headers (libpng-dev)</li>
<li>gettext</li>
<li>sox</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The build process has only been tested on Linux. You're on your own if you
want to try building this on OSX or Windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">You'll need the Wii common key installed as ~/.wii/common-key.</p>
<p dir="auto">First run 'make' in wiipax, then 'make' in channel. You'll find a .wad file
that you can install or directly run with Dolphin under
channel/title/channel_retail.wad. You'll also find executable binaries under
channel/channelapp, but be advised that the NAND save file / theme storage
features won't work properly if HBC isn't launched as a channel with its
correct title identity/permissions.</p>

Multiply that by a thousand and aim it at every task you once called “work.” AI is scaling the creation side of knowledge work at an exponential rate, but our decision-making tools and rituals remain stuck in the past. The imbalance creates bottlenecks in everything from code reviews to roadmapping and everything in between. Before we drown in our own todo queues, we need to rethink the entire production-to-judgment pipeline.</p><p>Over the past few months, I’ve shared various experiments where AI dramatically accelerates production tasks:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://worksonmymachine.substack.com/p/a-vibe-code-to-user-stories-pipeline" rel="">Generating user stories from prototypes</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://worksonmymachine.substack.com/p/automating-test-generation-with-gemini" rel="">Creating integration tests from user stories</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://worksonmymachine.substack.com/p/fanoutparallelizereduce-refactoring" rel="">Breaking down a big refactoring into bite-sized tasks for an AI to do</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://worksonmymachine.substack.com/p/ai-programs-while-i-sleep-using-github" rel="">Autonomously developing new features overnight</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://worksonmymachine.substack.com/p/wasting-inferences-with-aider" rel="">Implementing complete features and tests directly from user stories</a></p></li></ul><p>There’s one common theme here: AI excels at production but always ends up with humans as a critical bottleneck dealing with a mountain of tasks to evaluate, approve, or modify what it creates.</p><p><span>This pile of tasks is how I understand what Vaughn Tan refers to as </span><a href="https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/ai-meaningmaking" rel="">Meaningmaking</a><span>: the uniquely human ability to make subjective decisions about the relative value of things. He argues this type of value judgement is something AI fundamentally cannot do, as it can only pattern match against existing decisions, not create new frameworks for assigning worth.</span></p><p>When an AI generates 10 pull requests overnight, a human needs to decide which ones are worth merging, which need modification, and which should be rejected entirely. This isn’t just about checking if the code works (which you still need to do!), it’s also about making judgement calls on whether the changes align with the project’s goals, whether they solve the right problems, and whether they will be maintainable long-term. </p><p>Ok, calling this a “crisis” may be a bit hyperbolic, but we can already see at least two problems emerging. </p><p><span>First, Rohit Krishnan points out in </span><a href="https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/when-we-become-cogs" rel="">When We Become Cogs</a><span> that working with AI effectively leads to less job satisfaction. An MIT study found materials scientists experienced a 44% drop in job satisfaction when AI automated 57% of their “idea-generation” tasks — precisely the creative work they most enjoyed.  This is similar to the direction that software development is going - as AI gets better at generating code, more and more of the work of a software engineer will turn into PR review and less of the aspects of creative problem-solving that drew many of them to the field.</span></p><p><span>Second, you may have realized while watching some of my demos that our tools aren’t designed for the volume of work AI can generate. In </span><a href="https://worksonmymachine.substack.com/p/ai-programs-while-i-sleep-using-github" rel="">AI Programs While I Sleep,</a><span> you can see that I am already underwater with hundreds of AI-generated PRs to review. Our code review tools are designed for reviewing at most 5-10 PRs a day, not 50. You can also see a similar pattern emerge in the other videos having to do with managing user stories, doing product acceptance, and test case validation. Our tools are designed for orders of magnitude less work. </span></p><p>These two problems compound each other. Just as the tools knowledge workers use for evaluation and judgment (the “meaningmaking” work) start to break under the weight of more tasks than they are designed for, the tasks themselves are becoming much less rewarding. The result? Work piles up in review queues, decisions get rushed or postponed, and we’re no better off than before adding AI tools into our process.</p><p>This raises some big questions:</p><ul><li><p>How might we design tools to enhance decision-making velocity?</p></li><li><p>What would code review look like if optimized for 50 PRs daily instead of 5?</p></li><li><p>Which skills become premium when humans focus on judgement rather than production?</p></li><li><p>Can we find job satisfaction in a majorly reviewer or “decider” role?</p></li></ul><p>Our current evaluation tools were designed for an era of scarcity - when human effort was the limiting factor in production. In an era of AI-driven abundance, we need systems built around human cognitive limitations. </p><p>The meta-challenge here is that we’re using tools optimized for the constraint of yesterday (production capacity) while facing a completely different constraint today (judgement capacity). The organizations that thrive will be those that recognize this fundamental shift and redesign their workflows accordingly.</p><p>For those familiar with John Boyd’s OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act), there’s a parallel. AI is increasingly handling the “Orient” and “Act” phases — the creative synthesis and execution that many knowledge workers found most satisfying. What remains are the “Observe” and “Decide” phases - the evaluation and judgment work that our tools and processes aren’t optimized for.</p><p>We must reimagine knowledge work as a high-velocity decision-making operation rather than a creative production process. Without new tools and frameworks, humans will become overwheLLMed judges in a court where AI generates more cases than could ever be heard.</p><p>Ultimately, I don’t see AI completely replacing knowledge workers any time soon. What I see happening is us not being prepared for how AI transforms the nature of knowledge work and us having a very painful and slow transition into this new era.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<p>:
<b>GET THE MULTISTREAM VERSION!</b> (and the corresponding index file, <i>pages-articles-multistream-index.txt.bz2</i>)
</p><p><i>pages-articles.xml.bz2</i> and <i>pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2</i> both contain the same <i>xml</i> contents. So if you unpack either, you get the same data. But with multistream, it is possible to get an article from the archive without unpacking the whole thing. Your reader should handle this for you; if your reader doesn't support it, it will work anyway since multistream and non-multistream contain the same <i>xml</i>. The only downside to multistream is that it is marginally larger. You might be tempted to get the smaller non-multistream archive, but this will be useless if you don't unpack it. And it will unpack to ~5–10 times its original size. Penny wise, pound foolish. Get multistream.
</p><p>NOTE THAT the multistream dump file contains multiple bz2 'streams' (bz2 header, body, footer) concatenated together into one file, in contrast to the vanilla file which contains one stream. Each separate 'stream' (or really, file) in the multistream dump contains 100 pages, except possibly the last one.

<p>For multistream, you can get an index file, <i>pages-articles-multistream-index.txt.bz2</i>. The first field of this index is the number of bytes to seek into the compressed archive <i>pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2</i>, the second is the article ID, the third the article title. 
</p><p>Cut a small part out of the archive with dd using the byte offset as found in the index. You could then either bzip2 decompress it or use bzip2recover, and search the first file for the article ID.

<p>As files grow in size, so does the likelihood they will exceed some limit of a computing device. Each operating system, file system, hard storage device, and software (application) has a maximum file size limit. Each one of these will likely have a different maximum, and the lowest limit of all of them will become the file size limit for a storage device.
</p><p>The older the software in a computing device, the more likely it will have a 2 GB file limit somewhere in the system. This is due to older software using 32-bit integers for file indexing, which limits file sizes to 2^31 bytes (2 GB) (for signed integers), or 2^32 (4 GB) (for unsigned integers). Older <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)" title="Library (computing)">programming libraries</a> have this 2 or 4 GB limit, but the newer file libraries have been converted to 64-bit integers thus supporting file sizes up to 2^63 or 2^64 bytes (8 or 16 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte" title="Exabyte">EB</a>).
</p><p>Before starting a download of a large file, check the storage device to ensure its file system can support files of such a large size, check the amount of free space to ensure that it can hold the downloaded file, and make sure the device(s) you'll use the storage with are able to read your chosen file system.

<p>There are two limits for a file system: the file system size limit, and the file system limit. In general, since the file size limit is less than the file system limit, the larger file system limits are a moot point. A large percentage of users assume they can create files up to the size of their storage device, but are wrong in their assumption. For example, a 16 GB storage device formatted as FAT32 file system has a file limit of 4 GB for any single file. The following is a list of the most common file systems, and see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Limits" title="Comparison of file systems">Comparison of file systems</a> for additional detailed information.

<p>It is useful to check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5" title="MD5">MD5</a> sums (provided in a file in the download directory) to make sure the download was complete and accurate. This can be checked by running the "md5sum" command on the files downloaded. Given their sizes, this may take some time to calculate. Due to the technical details of how files are stored, <i>file sizes</i> may be reported differently on different filesystems, and so are not necessarily reliable. Also, corruption may have occurred during the download, though this is unlikely.

<p>Suppose you are building a piece of software that at certain points displays information that came from Wikipedia. If you want your program to display the information in a different way than can be seen in the live version, you'll probably need the wikicode that is used to enter it, instead of the finished HTML.
</p><p>Also, if you want to get all the data, you'll probably want to transfer it in the most efficient way that's possible. The wikipedia.org servers need to do quite a bit of work to convert the wikicode into HTML. That's time consuming both for you and for the wikipedia.org servers, so simply spidering all pages is not the way to go.

It needs a custom build and conversion of the wiki dumps using the instructions available at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rockbox.org/tracker/4755">http://www.rockbox.org/tracker/4755</a> . The conversion recompresses the file and splits it into 1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte" title="Gigabyte">GB</a> files and an index file which all need to be in the same folder on the device or micro sd card.

<ol><li>Download WikiTaxi and extract to an empty folder. No installation is otherwise required.</li>
<li>Download the XML database dump (*.xml.bz2) of your favorite wiki.</li>
<li>Run WikiTaxi_Importer.exe to import the database dump into a WikiTaxi database. The importer takes care to uncompress the dump as it imports, so make sure to save your drive space and do not uncompress beforehand.</li>
<li>When the import is finished, start up WikiTaxi.exe and open the generated database file. You can start searching, browsing, and reading immediately.</li>
<li>After a successful import, the XML dump file is no longer needed and can be deleted to reclaim disk space.</li>
<li>To update an offline Wiki for WikiTaxi, download and import a more recent database dump.</li></ol>
<p>For WikiTaxi reading, only two files are required: WikiTaxi.exe and the .taxi database. Copy them to any storage device (memory stick or memory card) or burn them to a CD or DVD and take your Wikipedia with you wherever you go!

    <p>There is a pattern I am very fond of - “one database per tenant” in web applications with multiple, isolated users. Recently, I needed to fix an application I had for a long time where this database-per-tenant multitenancy utterly broke down, because I was doing connection management wrong. Which begat the question: how do you even approach doing it right?</p>

<p>And it turns out I was not alone in this. The most popular gem for multitenancy - Apartment - which I have even used in my failed startup back in the day -
<a href="https://github.com/rails-on-services/apartment/issues/304#issuecomment-2648202324">has the issue too.</a></p>

<p>The culprit of <q>does not handle multithreading very well</q> is actually deeper. Way deeper. Doing runtime-defined multiple databases with Rails has only recently become less haphazard, and there are no tools either via gems or built-in that facilitate these flows. It has also accrued a ton of complexity, and also changes with every major Rails revision.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> If you need to do database-per-tenant multitenancy with Rails or ActiveRecord <em>right now</em> - grab the middleware from <a href="https://gist.github.com/julik/69066f5a819ac3b38480d42c1351f8ef">this gist</a> and move on.</p>

<p>If you are curious about the genesis of this solution, strap in - we are going on a tour of a sizeable problem, and of an API of stature - the ActiveRecord connection management. 
Read on and join me on the ride! Many thanks to <a href="https://kirshatrov.com/">Kir Shatrov</a> and <a href="https://fractaledmind.com/">Stephen Margheim</a> for their help in this.</p>

<h2 id="the-advantages-of-the-database-per-tenant">The advantages of the “database per tenant”</h2>

<p>If you have a tenanted application (your “tenant” is a subgraph of your data model that can function independently, and mostly references other entities from within itself), you have a number of ways to approach an architecture like that. Imagine we have a system where the tenant is a <code>Site</code>. That system is some kind of end-user-serviceable CMS, and users own multiple <code>Sites</code> and can manage pages, media and other items within a <code>Site</code>. The data model will be as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Site</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Page</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:site</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:media_blocks</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:pages</span><span>,</span> <span>through: :media_blocks</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>class</span> <span>MediaBlock</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:media_item</span>
  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:page</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Comment</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:page</span> <span># and thus to a Site, "through"</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>class</span> <span>MediaItem</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:media_items</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:pages</span><span>,</span> <span>through: :media_items</span>
  <span>has_one_</span> <span>:site</span><span>,</span> <span>through: :pages</span> <span># since it can be reused across multiple pages</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sites very rarely get merged together, and 99% of the data that gets created within a <code>Site</code> stays inside that <code>Site</code>, forever. Either because your system has outgrown hosting a single <code>Site</code>, or because you want to have robust isolation (you don’t want Jane to post to her <code>Site</code> only for the article to end up on Blake’s <code>Site</code> by mistake), or because your system is wildly successful and profitable, you may want to apply the following strategies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Just like our initial model - the <code>Site</code> has an <code>id</code>, some models link to it directly, some - through others</li>
  <li>Every model gets a <code>site_id</code>. Every <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>DELETE</code> then knows which <code>Site</code> a particular model makes part of - and a deletion can address the database where the site is stored. Databases will then be <em>shards</em> and store multiple <code>Sites</code>. If you decide to become a host for Slashdot, and get millions of <code>Page</code> records and bullions of <code>Comment</code> records, they will likely be extracted into a separate DB. There will be a mapping table of sorts, that will record that <code>slashdot.org</code> gets mapped to <code>db_slashdot_tenant</code> explicitly.</li>
  <li>Just like our initial model - but there is only <em>one</em> <code>Site</code> record in the entire database. All records belonging to a <code>Site</code> are stored inside that database.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other tricks for doing sharding/multitenancy well - for example, using generated primary keys which contain the tenant ID within them - so that shards can be merged, etc.</p>

<p>But what interests us here, specifically, is the last approach - having one database per tenant. For my smaller sites, using SQLite as the database has become part and parcel. Having a DB server that you can configure easily is very good. Having a database server that you do not have to configure at all - exceptional, though. Same for backups: centralised backup is great and useful. But nothing beats an <code>rsync</code> if that’s all you need to do a backup. And the schema becomes smaller too - we can move the <code>Site</code> out of the database outright, and the rest of the models no longer needs the associations to <code>site</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Page &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :media_blocks
  has_many :pages, through: :media_blocks
end

class MediaBlock &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :media_item
  belongs_to :page
end

class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :page # and thus to a Site, "through"
end

class MediaItem &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :media_blocks
end
</code></pre>

<p>Development-wise those setups are a breeze too - if you need to debug something inside a particular <code>Site</code>, all you need to do is download this site’s data. With just one <code>scp</code> command, usually. And there are elephants in the room too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Doing schema migrations where a migration runs on one tenant, but fails on another</li>
  <li>Accessing the same DB from multiple servers</li>
  <li>Doing backups is somewhat unorthodox - there are many ways to do it</li>
</ul>

<p>But remember: using this approach has one jarring advantage. It firmly pushes you out of the “big data” territory, and even out of “medium data” - it is “tiny data”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Data which, when stored on immediately-accessible random-read storage media of reasonable speed, does not fit under your desk” is my formal definition for “big data”, if that helps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some joints were exceptionally successful doing this. <a href="https://use.expensify.com/blog/scaling-sqlite-to-4m-qps-on-a-single-server">Expensify,</a> for one, is notorious for pushing and pulling SQLite well beyond the boundaries most folks would call comfortable. I know that Autodesk’s own ShotGrid - back when it used to be Shotgun and was an independent software product - used SQLite3 pretty extensively. Along with the obligatory <code>SQLite3::BusyException</code> every now and then 😉</p>

<h2 id="why-this-is-challenging-with-rails">Why this is challenging with Rails</h2>

<p>When using SQLite3 “bare”, handling a database “open” and “close” is absolutely trivial:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SQLite3</span><span>::</span><span>Database</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"site_1.sqlite3"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>db</span><span>|</span>
  <span>site_title</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>get_first_value</span><span>(</span><span>"SELECT title FROM sites LIMIT 1"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>pages</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"SELECT * FROM pages "</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we use Rack, we just wrap this in a middleware:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>call</span><span>(</span><span>env</span><span>)</span>
  <span>SQLite3</span><span>::</span><span>Database</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"site_1.sqlite3"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>db</span><span>|</span>
    <span>@app</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>merge</span><span>(</span><span>"site_db"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>db</span><span>))</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>  
</code></pre></div>

<p>But for this to work, the <code>db</code> variable - the handle to the database - has to be explicitly used for every query! ActiveRecord, however, manages the connections not through a variable you give it, but through it’s own “recollection” of what database a particular ActiveRecord <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/141201/how-to-best-handle-per-model-database-connections-with-activerecord">superclass connects to:</a></p>

<div><pre><code>class Page &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  establish_connection database: "site_1.sqlite3"
end
</code></pre></div>

<p>Needless to say, this code runs just once (and you don’t know exactly “when” - to which the answer is <em>at first query</em>), and is not at all designed for disconnecting and reconnecting all the time. Now, if there was a way to do this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Page</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
  <span>obtain_connection_from</span> <span>{</span> <span>tenancy_system</span><span>.</span><span>database_config</span> <span>}</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>it would have been easier, but alas. And with the addition of connection pooling, query cache, schema cache - you are looking at a sizeable contraption of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrdqQZ8FFc">things which are put on top of other things.</a> Which is what makes this exercise so frustrating: you know something utterly trivial with a “bare” API is infuriatingly complicated when doing it through ActiveRecord. Moreover - this is one of the headliner use-cases for SQLite3, and ActiveRecord seems to make it nigh-impossible to execute.</p>

<p>How come?</p>

<h2 id="churn-inevitable">Churn, inevitable</h2>

<p>The reason for difficulties with multiple databases in Rails comes down to the history of that feature and the needs of the <em>hyperscalers</em> - the Githubs, the Shopifys and the Zendesks of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Since I have been using Rails - and this ActiveRecord - for quite a long while - here is a brief history recap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rails 1 already had database assignment per <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> subclass</li>
  <li>Rails 3 added connection pooling</li>
  <li>Rails 4 added <code>connection_handling</code> (albeit - hidden)</li>
  <li>Rails 6 added <code>connected_to</code></li>
  <li>Rails 7 expanded on <code>connected_to</code> with the addition of shards (so now you have both roles and shards)</li>
</ul>

<p>The interesting part of it all is that while ActiveRecord <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activerecord/examples/simple.rb">example code</a> includes snippets like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
  <span>establish_connection</span> <span>adapter: </span><span>"sqlite3"</span><span>,</span> <span>database: </span><span>"foobar.db"</span>
  <span>connection</span><span>.</span><span>create_table</span> <span>table_name</span><span>,</span> <span>force: </span><span>true</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>t</span><span>|</span>
    <span>t</span><span>.</span><span>string</span> <span>:name</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>the changes in how Rails handles multiple databases have led to the fact that this example code is useful only in a very small number of cases. For example: with a snippet like this, how do we <code>close_connection</code>? Or, how do we tell <code>Person</code> to connect to a different database after having done a query or two?</p>

<p>If you start looking into this, an entire world opens befor your eyes. And this world has its own taxonomy - and it is sizeable. <code>ConnectionHandling</code>, <code>DatabaseConfig</code>, <code>DatabaseConfigurations</code> (yes, plural), <code>Resolver</code>, <code>PoolConfig</code>, <code>PoolManager</code>… and all these things interact, live and breathe in a carefully managed dance. Spoiler: they can do everything we need, but we have to conduct them like a little orchestra - <em>just like so.</em></p>

<h2 id="divergent-api-design">Divergent API design</h2>

<p>The way ActiveRecord is designed - having model classes with no explicit way to tell them “through which connection” they should work for this query - means that there will always be some hidden state. It can be a global, or a class variable (which is… a glorified global) - or a thread-local, but somewhere there <em>is</em> a connection, and until recently (Rails 6, to be exact) there was no official way to tell ActiveRecord which connection to use.</p>

<p>In theory, an API like this could be realised:</p>

<p><code>Page.with_connection(tenant_db_conn).first</code></p>

<p>However, this database connection argument would then need to be provided to every call to ActiveRecord - and the API is truly vast.</p>

<p>An extra complication is that a lot of the design of AR assumes that a connection to the database (and that it is going to be <em>the</em> database) will be opened early, and then kept intact. The schema cache (letting ActiveRecord subclasses know which columns are in the tables, for example) gets loaded once. The query cache gets initialised once. Migrations get run once - and, again, they run on <em>the</em> database,</p>

<h2 id="divergent-configuration-lifecycle">Divergent configuration lifecycle</h2>

<p>If you want to build a multitenant system of small tenants using SQLite3, with a single database being allocated per tenant, your needs are not exactly in alignment with a hypothetical Shopify: they want to have <code>cluster_a</code>, <code>cluster_b</code>, <code>cluster_eu</code> and <code>cluster_us</code>, each tens of terabytes in size. You, instead, want to have <code>site_1</code>, <code>site_2</code> and so on - with some being just a few KB in size.</p>

<p>This would mean that for them, the configuration of those big clusters can be output into <code>database.yml</code> programmatically. It can be source-controlled, and follow strict and specific semantics regarding</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the file gets read</li>
  <li>Whether (and when) templating is done in it, for example - to inject credentials</li>
  <li>That all internal datastructures - such as connection pools - get initialised ahead of time</li>
  <li>Preconfigured, large clusters where data is usually sharded - using things like <code>shop_id</code> - but not segregated.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of the “big guys” from the mentioned three have true, single-database-per-tenant setups – or at least I never heard they do.</p>

<p>Most of the modern ActiveRecord infrastructure is built around those assumptions, not because the makers of the feature want to work against what “we” want - they just made different tradeoffs.</p>

<h2 id="divergent-db-engine-tradeoffs">Divergent DB engine tradeoffs</h2>

<p>Another important item is database performance. “Big” database servers are designed with some assumptions. For example, if you have a database, the engine would be interested in holding file descriptors open for that database or <code>mmap()</code>ed files from it. If the tablespaces are large - they will be cached in memory, and cached fairly aggressively. If there are indices - the engine will try to cache them in memory as well, and keep access to the files containing the index data close at hand.</p>

<p>The end result is that, at least when I was working on an Apartment-based system with MySQL 5.7, after a certain number of databases created you would start hitting file descriptor limits. Those are set low on MacOS, but it was still noticeable - and it was clear that it was a question of time (and scale) - which we haven’t hit though - before that would become an actual problem.</p>

<p>On balance, thus, a database server is optimised for <em>few large databases</em> – not for thousands of small ones. This is another reason why the approach with a static <code>database.yml</code> seemed so appealing.</p>

<p>Just check <a href="https://kirshatrov.com/posts/fast-skip-locked">this article</a> out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By implementing these optimizations, I’ve seen remarkable performance improvements: single MySQL server handling 2M+ ticket reservation transactions per minute while the average latency of SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED query staying under 400μS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the kind of perf those “big engines” optimise for. Not “quickly handling 120 pages within this site, which is one of 2 thousands”.</p>

<p>With SQLite3, the story is completely different. SQLite3 <em>thrives</em> with multiple small databases. Since a SQLite3 database is just a file (well, 3 files sometimes, but you get the point), it makes perfect sense to have a single database per tenant in the system. Since the system is multitenanted, a request for tenant <code>A</code> is guaranteed not to need data from tenant <code>B</code>. Moreover - when we are handling a request for tenant <code>A</code>, we don’t need any resources from <code>B</code> - so we don’t even need a connection (file handle).</p>

<p>Having smaller SQLite3 databases has more affordances - for example, it’s much faster - and more granular - to do backups on a per-tenant basis. Debugging becomes much easier - instead of doing a sophisticated sequence of <code>SELECT</code>s to extract the “slice” of data for a particular tenant, you just copy the tenant’s DB wholesale. Same for granular restore. Same for deletions - removing a tenant, even a large one, is just an <code>unlink</code> away.</p>

<p>So one of the reasons why the modern multi-DB features in Rails do not support dynamic tenant management with automatically allocated databases - in large numbers - is because, at least on the surface, only SQLite3 currently makes this pattern viable.</p>

<p>And it’s not only viable – it is <em>glorious.</em> Did you know that the way iCloud works, for example, is literally millions of isolated SQLite databases, stored <em>inside</em> of larger Cassandra databases?</p>

<h2 id="back-to-the-original-problem">Back to the original problem</h2>

<p>So, I had an app. It has been running for more than a decade now. It was initially built with static HTML with some templating getting pre-processed before server upload using <code>rsync</code> - it was a glorified static site generator, essentially. Then came the “admin” features, and the app acquired databases. From the get go, the app - which is a mini-CMS of sorts - provided every website owner a UI to edit the content of their website. Every website also has its own database. Requests between them never cross - and no <code>site_id</code> is involved anywhere in the process.</p>

<p>Initially it was based on raw ERB and some glue code. Then it got rewritten into Camping, and the database switching looked roughly like the <code>establish_connection</code> example above. This was pre-Rails-3, so no Rack middleware, no frills, no nothing.</p>

<p>With the ActiveRecord 3 upgrade came the dance of splitting code into something more appropriate, along with a changeover to Sinatra. And the connection management - which got moved into a Rack middleware - took the following shape:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>call</span><span>(</span><span>env</span><span>)</span>
  <span>begin</span>
    <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>establish_connection</span><span>(</span><span>adapter: </span><span>'sqlite3'</span><span>,</span> 
      <span>database: </span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>'site_db_path'</span><span>),</span>
      <span>timeout: </span><span>BUSY_TIMEOUT</span><span>)</span>

    <span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>h</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>app</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>merge</span><span>(</span><span>'database'</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>self</span><span>))</span>
    <span>connection_closing_body</span> <span>=</span> <span>::</span><span>Rack</span><span>::</span><span>BodyProxy</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>::</span><span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>clear_active_connections!</span>
    <span>end</span>
    <span>[</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>h</span><span>,</span> <span>connection_closing_body</span><span>]</span>
  <span>rescue</span> <span>Exception</span>
    <span>::</span><span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>clear_active_connections!</span>
    <span>raise</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And this worked… mostly. Around the same time I have installed Sentry, but I didn’t take the habit of looking at it regularly - don’t remember the exact reasons. But, after a few years of painless operation, the app started throwing odd errors. The error that caught my eye was <code>ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished</code>, and it became more frequent the more load on the site there was. More visits - more frequent errors. Fast-forward a few years, and the error became quite frequent.</p>

<p>My assumption was that to figure out what is going on, I can better upgrade to at least ActiveRecord 6. This version is the oldest Rails version which, by virtue of Ruby version compatibilities, was already able to run on Apple Silicon - <a href="https://blog.julik.nl/2025/03/a-little-adventure-in-modern-frontend">which I am a proud owner of now.</a></p>

<p>Some hours later and a multitude of CoffeeScript files converted (and even more Ruby files edited) the update was complete. I tested it locally, verified everything was in good working order, and deployed the app.</p>

<p>And just 30 minutes in - <code>ConnectionNotEstablished</code>. And not only that, but 10x as frequently as before. The update hasn’t fixed the problem – in fact, it made it worse. Some experiments I did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allocating a separate connection pool per tenant and managing it myself</li>
  <li>Doing a connection checkout from a pool and checking it back into the pool</li>
  <li>Juju and voodoo magic</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing worked. With a helpful hint from <a href="https://kirshatrov.com/posts">Kir</a> – who is responsible for exactly the managing of database sharding at one of the “big boys” – I got the idea that it should be possible to use the new <code>roles:</code> parameter - and a fake database configuration - to achieve this functionality.</p>

<p>My mistake was that I was trying to manage pools and connections myself, manually - while the new Rails functionality is actually geared towards Rails maging the pools and connections <em>for you.</em> So in this instance there was also… a divergent understanding of the API.</p>

<p>I was still in the paradigm that you use <code>establish_connection</code> - like in the olden days - to manage that infrastructure. But the “blessed” approach is actually to furnish Rails the connection configurations and let it handle them automatically.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p><code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> now has a class method called <code>connected_to</code>. It allows you to do exactly the thing you need for a database-per-tenant setup - hop into a block with something being your “main” database. Previously, it accepted <code>database:</code> with a whole DB configuration, but now it only accepts <code>role:</code> (and - with Rails 7 and above - <code>shard:</code>). This is how you use it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connected_to</span><span>(</span><span>shard: </span><span>"sites_1"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>site</span> <span>=</span> <span>Site</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>site_id</span><span>)</span> <span># Which lives on this shard, "sites_1"</span>
  <span>posts</span> <span>=</span> <span>site</span><span>.</span><span>pages</span><span>.</span><span>order</span><span>(</span><span>created_at: :desc</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The challenge is where the <code>sites_1</code> gets configured. Normally it would be in your <code>database.yml</code>, as per the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html">official doc:</a></p>

<div><pre><code><span>production</span><span>:</span>
  <span>primary</span><span>:</span>
    <span>database</span><span>:</span> <span>my_primary_database</span>
    <span>adapter</span><span>:</span> <span>mysql2</span>
  <span>primary_replica</span><span>:</span>
    <span>database</span><span>:</span> <span>my_primary_database</span>
    <span>adapter</span><span>:</span> <span>mysql2</span>
    <span>replica</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
  <span>primary_shard_one</span><span>:</span>
    <span>database</span><span>:</span> <span>my_primary_shard_one</span>
    <span>adapter</span><span>:</span> <span>mysql2</span>
    <span>migrations_paths</span><span>:</span> <span>db/migrate_shards</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But if you want to switch between tenants live - and tenants get created (and deleted!) at runtime - having this static config with cross-referencing keys is not going to fly at all. Moreover - even if you can change that “God config” – how do you force ActiveRecord to reload it? How can you tell ActiveRecord that a shard/tenant no longer exists? And how do you do it in a thread-safe manner? Does it lead to a reinitialisation of all the connection pools, or just addition-deletion?</p>

<p>The solution then becomes focused in one area: taking over from ActiveRecord in managing those connection pools and naming the <code>roles</code> and <code>shards</code> automatically. This is where the bulk of the work was, in the end. We want to convert our tenant database name/filename into a string to devise the <code>role</code> name that we can furnish to AR. For me, I only went to update to Rails 6, so I didn’t go into shards yet. If I did (and I might, eventually) - the tenant name would be the <code>shard</code>, and the <code>reading</code> and <code>writing</code> roles could be used for hosting a <code>readonly: true</code> DB connection and a writable one. However, a method I ended up using does <em>not</em> support shards even on Rails 8, so read on.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-do-we-create-those-pools">So how do we create those pools?</h2>

<p>The way to do it is to <em>query</em> ActiveRecord for whether a particular connection pool is already setup or not. If it is not - there is going to be a <code>NoConnectionPool</code> exception if you try to switch to the role/shard that doesn’t exist. But doing this via rescues is not great – the control flow becomes a bit intricate. What we can do instead is check whether there is a connection pool set up for a particular role/shard, and then connect if there are none. Note that since this manages pools - it needs to be protected by a mutex:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>MUX</span><span>.</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connection_handler</span><span>.</span><span>connection_pool_list</span><span>(</span><span>role_name</span><span>).</span><span>none?</span>
    <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connection_handler</span><span>.</span><span>establish_connection</span><span>(</span><span>database_config_hash</span><span>,</span> <span>role: </span><span>role_name</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>After that we can use <code>connected_to</code> - which is going to be thread-safe, fast and pretty neat:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>MUX</span><span>.</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connection_handler</span><span>.</span><span>connection_pool_list</span><span>(</span><span>role_name</span><span>).</span><span>none?</span>
    <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connection_handler</span><span>.</span><span>establish_connection</span><span>(</span><span>database_config_hash</span><span>,</span> <span>role: </span><span>role_name</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connected_to</span><span>(</span><span>role: </span><span>role_name</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>pages</span> <span>=</span> <span>Page</span><span>.</span><span>order</span><span>(</span><span>created_at: :desc</span><span>).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span> <span># Only selects from that site/tenant</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="dont-forget-about-streaming-rack-bodies">Don’t forget about streaming Rack bodies</h2>

<p>There is a small additional element we need to take care of, though: doing it correctly in Rack. To have something similar to <a href="https://github.com/rails-on-services/apartment/blob/development/lib/apartment/elevators/generic.rb">Apartment::Elevator</a> we need to do something that - again - <code>apartment</code> doesn’t do correctly. If we assume all the renders of our app are buffered, we can do this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>call</span><span>(</span><span>env</span><span>)</span>
  <span>site_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>env</span><span>[</span><span>"SERVER_NAME"</span><span>]</span>
  <span>connection_config_hash</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>adapter: </span><span>"sqlite3"</span><span>,</span> <span>database: </span><span>"sites/</span><span>#{</span><span>site_name</span><span>}</span><span>.sqlite3"</span><span>}</span>
  <span>role_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"site_</span><span>#{</span><span>site_name</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>

  <span># Create a connection pool for that tenant if it doesn't exist</span>
  <span>MUX</span><span>.</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connection_handler</span><span>.</span><span>connection_pool_list</span><span>(</span><span>role_name</span><span>).</span><span>none?</span>
      <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connection_handler</span><span>.</span><span>establish_connection</span><span>(</span><span>connection_config_hash</span><span>,</span> <span>role: </span><span>role_name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connected_to</span><span>(</span><span>role: </span><span>role_name</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>@app</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>env</span><span>)</span> <span># returns [status, header, body]</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But we are aware, of course, that Rack bodies are <em>callable</em> and <em>iterable</em> - and Rack response bodies may also just be doing SQL queries. Code that lives in the Rack response body and serves streaming data is not any less useful than the one living in the app <code>call()</code> method, even though much fewer people use it. I even worked on a <a href="https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/pull/1037">big patch to Appsignal, my favorite APM</a> that made it report what happens inside a Rack streaming body the same way it would for the app’s <code>call</code>. The way it usually works for resource release with those bodies is this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span> <span>"rb"</span><span>)</span>
<span>status</span><span>,</span> <span>headers</span><span>,</span> <span>body</span> <span>=</span> <span>@app</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>env</span><span>)</span>
<span>body_with_close</span> <span>=</span> <span>Rack</span><span>::</span><span>BodyProxy</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>body</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>close</span> <span>}</span>
<span>[</span><span>status</span><span>,</span> <span>headers</span><span>,</span> <span>body_with_close</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This attaches a callback to the <code>#close</code> method of the Rack body we return, which - according to the Rack [SPEChttps://github.com/rack/rack/blob/main/SPEC.rdoc] - <em>must</em> be called by the webserver <em>or</em> by the calling middleware.</p>

<p>Reasonably enough, the ActiveRecord API for <code>connected_to</code> only works with a block. That’s a good idea from the point of encouraging the correct (and safe) usage of a rather blunt tool. However, specifically in this case, it gets in the way. Luckily, this problem can be bypassed with judicious <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2018/11/27/ruby-magic-fibers-and-enumerators-in-ruby.html">application of a Fiber:</a></p>

<div><pre><code><span>connected_to_context_fiber</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fiber</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connected_to</span><span>(</span><span>role: </span><span>role_name</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>Fiber</span><span>.</span><span>yield</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>And thus, our “tenant switching middleware” for ActiveRecord connection management with one database per tenant becomes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>Shardine</span><span>::</span><span>Middleware</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>env</span><span>|</span>
  <span>site_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>env</span><span>[</span><span>"SERVER_NAME"</span><span>]</span>
  <span>{</span><span>adapter: </span><span>"sqlite3"</span><span>,</span> <span>database: </span><span>"sites/</span><span>#{</span><span>site_name</span><span>}</span><span>.sqlite3"</span><span>}</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And there you go - a safe and performant database-per-tenant switcher.</p>

<h2 id="an-additional-hurdle">An additional hurdle</h2>

<p>Since I was upgrading to Rails 6 - which seemed the lowest “modern” version I really had to go to - there was an extra snag.</p>

<p>By default, when you use ActiveRecord without Rails, it gets configured “conservatively” - or, rather, not configured at all. Rails 6 has the concept of <code>legacy_connection_handling</code>. Without going into too much detail, to make this solution work that parameter must be turned off explicitly. In Rails 7 and above this parameter no longer exists.</p>

<h2 id="some-remaining-work">Some remaining work</h2>

<p>Since I initially migrated my app to ActiveRecord 6 I don’t have <code>shard</code> support yet. It would actually make perfect sense to have your “reading replica” be a <code>readonly: true</code> SQLite3 database, <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/04/11/sqlite-on-rails-isolated-connection-pools/">as Stephen has written.</a></p>

<p>Another aspect is that there’s currently no API to remove a connection pool if a tenant gets removed from the system, which I just don’t need (my tenants don’t change as frequently).</p>

<p>Handling other contexts when you need to “step into” a Tenant can be handled similarly, either using <code>connected_to</code> or using the fiber approach.</p>

<p>And, of course, the “database per tenant” workflow is just starting and it’s only in the recent years, with product from the ONCE family specifically, where SQLite3 began to shine again - as an engine of “small data, in big numbers”.</p>

<p>May we live to see this pattern come into the spotlight, finally.</p>
