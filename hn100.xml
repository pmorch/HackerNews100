<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of Democratic senators is <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24782736/2023.07.11_Letter_to_IRS__TIGTA__FTC__DOJ_on_tax_prep_pixel_data_sharing.pdf">urging federal law enforcement officials</a> to investigate and prosecute some of the most popular online tax filing companies for allegedly sharing millions of taxpayers’ financial data with Meta and Google.&nbsp;</p><p>On Tuesday, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and others asked the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, Treasury Department, and the IRS to investigate whether TaxSlayer, H&amp;R Block, and TaxAct violated taxpayer privacy laws by sharing sensitive user information with the two tech firms.</p><p>Senators also released <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Attacks%20on%20Tax%20Privacy_Final.pdf">their own report</a> Wednesday detailing the accusations, first raised <a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook">by <em>The Markup </em>last November</a>. The report alleges that for years, tax preparation companies infused their products with Meta and Google tracking pixels that revealed identifying information — like a user’s full name, address, and date of birth. The senators also suggest that some of the information provided, like the forms a user accessed, could be used to show “whether taxpayers were eligible for certain deductions or exemptions.”&nbsp;</p><p>The senators claim that the companies did not receive user consent to share this information, which could violate laws banning tax preparers from sharing tax return information with third parties, especially since much of this data could be used for advertising purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>“The findings of this report reveal a shocking breach of taxpayer privacy by tax prep companies and by Big Tech firms that appeared to violate taxpayers’ rights and may have violated taxpayer privacy law,” the senators said in their Tuesday letter.&nbsp;</p><p>TaxSlayer, H&amp;R Block, and TaxAct all confirmed that they shared “extensive taxpayer data” through Meta’s pixel in the senators’ report. After <em>The Markup </em>published its November findings, each of the companies said they had “removed or disabled” it from their websites. &nbsp; </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	<a href="https://variety.com/t/milan-kundera/" id="auto-tag_milan-kundera" data-tag="milan-kundera">Milan Kundera</a>, whose 1984 novel “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” was turned into an Oscar-nominated film, has died at the age of 94.</p>



<p>
	Kundera died Tuesday in Paris after a long illness, Jindra Pavelková, a representative of the Moravian Library, the Czech library housing his personal collection, told <em>Variety</em> Wednesday. </p>



<p>
	“Milan Kundera was a writer who reached whole generations of readers across all continents and achieved global fame,” Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said. “He leaves behind not only notable fiction, but also significant essay work.”

</p>



<p>
	The 1988 film adaptation of “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” was directed by <a href="https://variety.com/t/philip-kaufman/" id="auto-tag_philip-kaufman" data-tag="philip-kaufman">Philip Kaufman</a> and starred Daniel Day-Lewis and Juliette Binoche. Jean-Claude Carrière and Kaufman were Oscar nominated for adapted screenplay, and Sven Nykvist was Oscar nominated for cinematography.

	</p>




<p>
	Other films based on his writing include 1965’s “Nobody Will Laugh,” directed by Hynek Bocan, which won the Grand Prize at Mannheim-Heidelberg Film Festival, 1969’s “The Joke,” directed by Jaromil Jires, which played at San Sebastián Film Festival, and 1969’s “I, the Distressing God,” directed by Antonín Kachlík.</p>



<p>
	Kundera was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1929. His first novel, “The Joke,” was published in 1967, and was greeted with acclaim. French poet Louis Aragon called it “one of the greatest novels of the century.” </p>



<p>
	In 1968, the Prague Spring, a period of liberal reform in Czechoslovakia, was crushed by Soviet troops. Kundera criticized the invasion, and was subsequently ostracized by the Communist regime, and sacked from his post at Prague’s FAMU film school. “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” centers on the Prague Spring and its aftermath.</p>



<p>
	In 1975, he emigrated to France, and was stripped of his Czechoslovak citizenship four years later. He became a French citizen in 1981, and lived in France until his death, although he was made a citizen of the Czech Republic in 2019.</p>

series of books looking at the impact of 70s and 80s pop culture.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Both vividly remember the film, with Brotherstone admitting he only managed to watch the first half when it was broadcast as it "wrecked" his head.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, he finally saw the full movie when it was repeated - and it has stayed with him ever since.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"I can still remember lying in bed in my bedroom and you can kind of see the next street on from my mum and dad's and it was almost like an overlaid

had "looked really special" when he read the script, largely because he admired the work of writer Hines.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, the Normanton-born actor, who was shortly to star in sitcom Home to Roost with John Thaw, had no idea of the drama's impact.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"We said 'wow if we can pull this off it'll be great,' but I didn't have a clue that it held that much of a punch."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The film was shot on location in Sheffield and, after it was completed, 500 guests were attended a special screening in the city.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"There was complete silence and all you could hear was various people sobbing around the room," the actor recalled.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"People blame me to this day for scarring them for life. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"People say it is the most scary thing

Threads.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"I think '83, '84 was the peak of Cold War paranoia in the 80s," said Lawrence.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"You've got nuclear

said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"They are so wrapped up in their own lives, that is very powerful I think."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1"

just draws you in."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Brotherstone said director Jackson had initially thought of using the cast of Coronation Street.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"Until it was pointed out to him that it would be massively distracting to watch Deirdre Barlow get blown up," he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"It

never coming back as a society, language is gone, skills are gone, we are just in rags grunting at each other," Brotherstone said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For the actors and crew it was "a ball" to make, according to Dinsdale.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"We had the biggest laugh I remember, it was one of the happiest crews ever."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>To him though, Threads remains a "seminal" piece of television which still resonates with audiences.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"It was one of the most outstanding pieces of work the BBC has ever created," he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"It is so grim and gruesome and so truthful and real and so horrific.</p></div><div

 Building the Theory</h2>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Most of my free time for the past few years has gone into building out the compiler's foundations so that it could support this unexplored approach.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It was <i>hard</i>. Any kind of borrowing system is already pretty complex, but they also requires full generics, which are notoriously difficult. <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a> <a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
On top of that, an entire new compiler stage was needed to get regions and generational references to work seamlessly together. <a href="#note6" data-noteid="6">6</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Finally, a few months ago, <b>the regions prototype was finished</b>. It's rough around the edges, <a href="#note7" data-noteid="7">7</a> but it successfully compiled something for the first time.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
With that, I made the <a href="https://github.com/Verdagon/RegionsBenchmarks/blob/main/cellular-automata/CellularAutomata.vale">first ever zero-check Vale program</a>! <a href="#note8" data-noteid="8">8</a>
</p>
<p>
It was a program that uses <a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664">Cellular Automata</a> to generate a level for a roguelike game.
</p>

</section>

<section>
<p>
Of course, it didn't work perfectly at first. Compilers are tricky. The slightest misstep in the compiler code will add extra instructions to the resulting assembly, causing artificial overhead in the final program. And sometimes, there's extra little bits of information you need to pass to the optimizer (or the CPU itself!) to trick it into the most optimal behavior.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
To help me track down the problems, I kept comparing its assembly to the assembly generated by Vale's "unsafe" modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>unsafe_no_bounds</span> is similar to C; all memory-safety protections are turned off, and it only uses raw pointers for everything, rather than generational references.
</li>
<li>
<span>unsafe_with_bounds</span> then adds bounds checking for array accesses, similar to how Rust does it.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
After a couple months of tracking down differences, the resulting assembly looked nearly identical to Vale's <span>unsafe_with_bounds</span> mode! Every difference was expected <a href="#note9" data-noteid="9">9</a> and everything looked pretty reasonable.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="the-benchmarks">
 The Benchmarks</h2>
<p>
Finally, I benchmarked the program again:
</p>

</section>
<div>
      
      <pre><code>Summary
  './build_unsafe_no_bounds/main' ran
    1.18 ± 0.01 times faster than './build_unsafe_with_bounds/main'
    1.18 ± 0.01 times faster than './build_safe_fastest/main'</code></pre>
    </div>
<section>
<p>
Success! Vale's normal mode (<span>safe_fastest</span> here) showed no slowdowns compared to only bounds checking.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
In other words, <b>this approach has no observable overhead.</b> <a href="#note10" data-noteid="10">10</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Finally seeing this was a shock, a relief, and almost surreal. No overhead! We knew it was possible in theory, but seeing it happen for real still felt very surprising.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Feel free to play with it! Just build from the <a href="https://github.com/Verdagon/Vale/tree/regions">regions branch</a>, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Verdagon/RegionsBenchmarks">benchmarking scripts</a>, and to ask any questions in the <a href="https://discord.gg/SNB8yGH">discord server</a>.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
And before we get too excited, let's keep these important details in mind:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This is not benchmarking against languages like C and Rust directly. Those compilers have years of unrelated optimizations that would just confound the experiment, so I compare with <span>unsafe_no_bounds</span> and <span>unsafe_with_bounds</span> to isolate those variables and get a more accurate comparison of the memory safety approaches.
</li>
<li>
This was benchmarked on a Razer Blade 15" 2018 (512GB SSD) running Ubuntu 22.04, using <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a> inside a <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/cset-shield.1.html">cset shield</a>.
</li>
<li>
When I made larger programs, I observed quite a bit of optimizer noise, <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a> where a minor change in one area would swing the measurements one way or another. <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a> Benchmark results for the larger programs seemed rather fragile. We'll need a large set of benchmark programs to isolate away this optimizer noise.
</li>
<li>
In a larger program (a tiny roguelike game), I also observed that the optimizer didn't merge two identical branches of an if-statement, and missed a couple other obvious optimizations. I'm not sure how the presence of an integer (especially unread!) would affect this. It could even be a bug in LLVM, which are pretty common.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
That last one hints that we might want our own Vale-specific pre-optimizer, similar to Rust's <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a>, since LLVM was designed more with C in mind. <a href="#note13" data-noteid="13">13</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Still, even with these details, these results are quite promising!
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">
 What does this mean?</h2>
<p>
This means that generational references and regions combine to form a memory safety approach that is very, very fast.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It also means that this approach is actually viable, and could be desirable for quite a few software domains. A domain might desire this approach if:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It wants more predictable latency than tracing garbage collection.
</li>
<li>
It wants better performance and cache friendliness than reference counting.
</li>
<li>
It wants to prototype and iterate more easily than with borrow checking.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="where-does-vale-go-from-here">
 Where does Vale go from here?</h2>
<p>
The above benchmarks compared Vale's safe mode to Vale's unsafe modes, for a more accurate comparison of the memory safety approaches.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
However, there are still a few things to do before Vale can really go toe-to-toe with languages like C and C++. <a href="#note14" data-noteid="14">14</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I'll need to start a Vale-specific pre-optimizer, since LLVM's optimizer seems to have some problems reasoning about generations and immutability.
</li>
<li>
Vale still needs to support inline data, instead of putting all structs on the heap. (Note that that wouldn't affect the above benchmarks, which didn't use any structs.)
</li>
<li>
Regions are still just in the prototype phase. I'll need to smoothe out the rough edges, pay down a bit of tech debt, and merge this code in before doing anything else.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
After this is merged in, I'll be making the standard library use regions so that every user will benefit from them, even if their main program code doesn't use regions directly.
</p>

</section>

<p>
It's a pretty ambitious endeavor, so it's not clear how long this will take.

Previously, Vale had templates (like C++), not full generics.

It took the Golang team a decade to figure out their generics, and I don't blame them at all for that, after this struggle with generics!

<p>
Under the hood, it reduces regions to "pure height" integers: negative for region generic parameters, zero for the default region, and increasing positive for every pure block.

<div id="note7" data-noteid="7">
<p><span>7</span></p><section>
<p>
For example, its compile errors are very, <i>very</i> verbose, and there are a lot of things that just trigger assertions in the compiler still. I'll be fixing all of these before merging it into the main branch.

<p>
The only expected difference is that it put a pseudo-random generation number at the top of every allocation, though it never needed to read it for any generation checks. This is really just a montonically increasing register under the hood, to keep things fast. We'll be able to remove this once we add <a href="https://verdagon.dev/blog/zero-cost-borrowing-regions-part-2-isolates">isolates</a> or <span>uni</span>que references.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note10" data-noteid="10">
<p><span>10</span></p><section>
<p>
There could be overhead in theory, in the form of a nonatomic monotonically incrementing integer used for filling generations. It doesn't seem to affect the performance, likely because registers and simple arithmetic operations are so cheap on modern CPUs compared to the real bottleneck which is memory latency. The optimizer also often optimizes it out, since it sees nobody using these generations.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note11" data-noteid="11">
<p><span>11</span></p><section>
<p>
This is not the same thing as benchmark noise. This benchmarking setup reported very consistent run times (hence the <span>± 0.01</span> in the output).
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note12" data-noteid="12">
<p><span>12</span></p><section>
<p>
In fact, when I switched the size of the generation numbers, it consistently had negative overhead (<span>1.13 ± 0.01</span>), which is a bit weird considering that there weren't that many generation numbers in the program anyway. It did change the register allocations, so I suspect that's dwarfing any performance differences from anything actually semantically different in the programs.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note13" data-noteid="13">
<p><span>13</span></p><section>
<p>
We might want this anyway, as I'm pretty sure LLVM would treat generational references as undefined behavior, if it could figure out that we're intentionally accessing released memory.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated unprecedented
capabilities in multiple AI tasks. However, hardware inefficiencies have become
a significant factor limiting the democratization of LLMs. We propose Chiplet
Cloud, an ASIC supercomputer architecture that optimizes total cost of
ownership (TCO) per token for serving generative LLMs. Chiplet Cloud fits all
model parameters inside the on-chip SRAMs to eliminate bandwidth limitations
while moderating the die size to improve system costs while leveraging software
mappings to overcome data communication overhead. We propose a comprehensive
design methodology that accurately explores a spectrum of major design
trade-offs in the joint space of hardware-software and generates a detailed
performance-cost analysis on all valid design points. We evaluate Chiplet Cloud
on four popular LLMs. Compared to GPU and TPU, our architecture can achieve up
to 94x and 15x improvement in TCO/Token respectively, significantly reducing
the cost for realistically serving modern LLMs.

                                        Since most code is written using ASCII characters, these characters are the
                                        backbone of every coding font. They have been sculpted with particularly great
                                        precision and attention to detail.

                                                There are better ways to design than putting a big effort into making
                                                something look special. Special is generally less useful than normal,
                                                and less rewarding in the long term. Special things demand attention for
                                                the wrong reasons, interrupting potentially good atmosphere with their
                                                awkward presence.

                                                The most noticable characters in Commit Mono are ‘agrQ£@’. If you’re not
                                                used to looking at fonts, they can be difficult to tell apart, but if
                                                those characters match what you see here, you’re looking at Commit Mono.

                                                The ligatures already in Commit Mono are added because they provide
                                                additional functionality (i.e. != becomes ≠), but they are off by
                                                default. Commit Mono won’t be updated with ligatures that purely serve
                                                aesthetic purposes (i.e. $&gt; becomes connected).

                                                You need to check if your editor/IDE/terminal supports ligatures. If it

                                            be turned on by ‘enabling font ligatures’. In VS Code you simply put
                                            ["editor.fontLigatures": true,] in the settings.json file.

<p dir="auto">English is a high-level, multi-paradigm, expressive, general purpose language optimized for concurrent communications. English has been successfully used in a wide variety of scenarios, such as long-term data storage, analog and digital arts, and text-based adventures, to name a few. To date, English is used on more than 1,456 million carbon-based devices, and powers more than five million books.</p>
<p dir="auto">English has been designed over the course of fourteen centuries. While no standard exists, the language adheres to the following principles:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Portability: English follows a Write Once, Read Anywhere, Then Rewrite (WORATR) philosophy.</li>
<li>Extensibility: Like Lua, English can borrow constructs and keywords from other languages.</li>
<li>Multi-paradigm: English supports most modern programming paradigms (imperative, meta, etc.)</li>
<li>Resilience: English programs can execute on organic hardware despite severe syntax errors.</li>
<li>Polymorphism: English evolves over time without having to refactor existing codebases.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">English's stability makes it ideal for long-term projects where data integrity is more important than precision: The last breaking change in the specifications happened five centuries ago and there are no plans for further major releases.</p>
<p dir="auto">English's mantra is "there's more than one way to say it".</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Syntax</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a typical English program that implements the Frost pathfinding algorithm:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference."><pre><code>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

<p dir="auto">English uses whitespace and commas to delimit words, relying heavily on punctuation. Statements can end with a period or, less frequently, with a semicolon. Blocks are usually separated by two or more line breaks. Correct statements are always written in sentence case.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Operators</h3>
<p dir="auto">English uses the following operators:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>!</code>: Emphasize execution (similar to CSS's <code>!important</code>). Can be stacked</li>
<li><code>?</code>: Request information or open data stream thread. Can be stacked</li>
<li><code>,</code>: Concatenate statements in the same block</li>
<li><code>.</code>: End of statement</li>
<li><code>;</code>: End of statement (weak)</li>
<li><code>:</code>: Definition, for example for functions or clauses</li>
<li><code>...</code>: Temporarily suspend async execution (similar to <code>await</code>)</li>
<li><code>-</code>: Short break in execution or definition of list items</li>
<li><code>"</code>: Import value from another module or class</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Code comments are added using parentheses or round brackets. Unlike other programming languages, English executes code comments with lower priority to enrich execution context and debug logging. For example:</p>

<p dir="auto">English operators can be overloaded, although this is not recommended by the ENG23 committee.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Statements and control flow</h3>
<p dir="auto">English statements are free-form and its execution depends on the interpreter's training, as well as word order. Conditional execution and exception handling also depend on the mood and tense of the keywords, as well as resources available.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keywords</h3>
<p dir="auto">English does not have reserved words, relying instead on a set of 470,000 keywords that can be used interchangeably and even repeated to accelerate memory allocation. The training process results in scores that make the usage of certain keywords less likely. Keywords that score higher in the profanity dimension might cause the system to panic.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Data structures</h2>
<p dir="auto">English only has two data structures, Lists and Raw. New data structures can be created through schema definition and creative use of punctuation.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Typing</h2>
<p dir="auto">English uses context-sensitive and duck typing. The only base types are <code>strings</code> and <code>numbers</code>, with no size limit. Buffer overflows are typically handled by the interpreter, which performs just-in-time (JIT) type casting and guessing. To compensate for the lack of predefined types, English uses a rich system of classes, with <code>noun</code>, <code>adjective</code>, and so on.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2>
<p dir="auto">English programs are self-documenting and implement literate programming.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tooling</h2>
<p dir="auto">Currently, the only compiler available is Wernicke. It requires a temporal lobe trained in social settings for at least three to four years, though better results can be achieved with training runs in excess of 30 years.</p>
<p dir="auto">Numerous development environments (IDEs) have been released since version 1.0. The most common editors for English are Word and Docs, although programs can still be written in WordPerfect, Vi, and emacs. English is unique in that it can be coded on almost any medium capable of supporting scratches and marks, such as paper, stone, or clay.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are millions of English libraries available. You can look for the closest in Google Maps.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Community</h2>
<p dir="auto">The English community is vibrant, with more than 150 distributions available. For a complete list of forks see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_English" rel="nofollow">List of dialects</a>.</p>

<p>The layout of the Disney parks may not be something you think about except for at the end of the day when your feet are aching and sitting feels like the best ride ever. Or when you’re hiking around the Epcot World Showcase in the blazing sun and afternoon heat. <strong>But</strong> <strong>the ways the Imagineers have creatively designed the parks influence your experience more than you think, and in ways you might not have considered before.</strong> </p>



<p>So today we’re going to talk about why we love (or mostly love) Disney’s park designs and architectural illusions. And we’ll learn a bit about the history of Disney’s design along the way. </p>



<p>Let’s dive in, shall we?</p>



<p>We all know Disney creates the impression of height using forced perspective (or at least you do now!). Almost all the buildings on Main Street USA are designed with a 1—5/8—1/2 scale. The first floor is full scale, followed by the next facade floor being 5/8 before adding a third fake floor that is only 1/2 size. This illusion draws the eyes up and makes you think (from the ground) that the building is three stories when it actually is quite shorter. (Note: Main Street USA in the Magic Kingdom in Florida uses a 7/8 scale instead because it has a larger castle and so everything is sized up instead of “pony size” like Walt wanted at Disneyland).</p>

<p>This same effect is widely used in the parks, everywhere from Liberty Square to the tree stump atop Splash Mountain, and even the castles themselves. All buildings at Disney need to stay under 200 feet in order to not have to put lighting on the top for aircraft safety, which means even our beloved Cinderella Castle is only 189 feet high (though it looks quite a bit taller). </p>

You can tell by looking at the windows and comparing their sizes as your eye moves upwards!</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are a few buildings on Main Street USA, however, that do not use forced perspective. One is Tony’s Town Square restaurant building, which needed to be tall enough to block the view of the Contemporary while in the parks and was therefore built with all its floors true-to-size.</p>



<p>Another is the Town Square Firehouse, which stands a full three stories because the original plans for the parks included an apartment for Walt’s family like its counterpart in Disneyland. As you may know, Walt sadly passed away before the opening of Walt Disney World, which made the apartment unnecessary. But as construction was already underway, the building was completed full-scale.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="853" src="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-768x1024.jpg?resize=640%2C853&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Town Square Firehouse, looking rather large on Main Street. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Forced perspective isn’t limited to the height of the buildings, however, on Main Street USA. The buildings themselves are designed to be at a slightly wider angle on one side of the building, so when you are traveling down the street towards the castle, it creates an illusion that the end of the street (and castle) is far away in the distance. When you turn around and head towards the exit after a long day, the street appears shorter and the end of the street manageably closer. </p>



<p>The trees also play a part in this visual trickery, as they are smaller as you look down the street towards the castle to make the magnificent structure appear larger and more impressive. The trees planted in the Town Square near the exit are larger and therefore create the illusion as you walk back to your resort that the train station is much closer.</p>



<p>And speaking of the walk back to your hotel room…</p>



<p>Walt had a term for the sore feet we often get after a long day of traipsing around the parks… he called it “museum feet”. His goal in designing the original parks was to avoid tired, aching feet as much as possible by creating useful walkways that connected people quickly to their destination. </p>



<p>After traveling to Washington D.C. and seeing the French-born architect Pierre L’Enfant’s hub-and-spoke street designs, Walt proposed the same concept for Disneyland (if you’ve ever traveled in Paris, you’ll notice this is a common architectural street layout there as well). Below is a 1:100 scale model of opening day in Disneyland, where you can see this concept played out:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?w=1280 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?w=1920 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Disneyland, Opening Day, 1955.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In this original design, every land is accessible via the hub in the center of the park. This hub, called “Central Plaza” or “Plaza” by Walt and the Imagineers (hence “The Plaza Inn” name) allowed for visitors to always have an anchor point to orient themselves to no matter where they were in the park. The castle itself became a visual reference for this anchor point. </p>



<p>But what Walt soon realized is that everyone had to backtrack back to the hub in order to get to another land, and that simply called for too much walking. So, secondary routes between each land were created at the back so that you could easily travel from land to land. </p>



<p>I am going to pause here and mention that, in my opinion, it is a major flaw in the design of the Magic Kingdom in Disney World that there is NOT a back entrance to Frontierland connecting it to Liberty Square/Fantasyland as there is in Disneyland. That walk from Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is ROUGH to backtrack around the Rivers of America on a hot Floridian day. </p>

You can clearly see what I mean here on the left side around the river. Even from the sky you can tell that is a LONG way to walk!</figcaption></figure>



<p>I digress. </p>



<p>Sadly, not all of the parks are laid out in this brilliant hub-and-spoke fashion. Epcot could easily be known as “Every Person Comes Out Tired” simply because of its massive double-circle design that arguably creates more steps needed than any other park. We could go on and on about why it’s that way (namely: it was supposed to be two separate parks and they pushed the two models together to create one large one) but that’s a whole other post for another day. </p>

<p>Animal Kingdom takes a page from the Magic Kingdom in design, with the hub being Discovery Island with the Tree of Life as a visual anchor. There are also walkways on the backside of all lands leading into the next land, much like Disneyland. This park feels smaller than it is at times because of this simple design that makes almost every area easily accessible. I particularly appreciate the bypass of DinoLand U.S.A., allowing me quick access to Expedition Everest without having to pass through that visually assaulting area.</p>

<p>It’s here I make my apologies to all the DinoLand fans out there… I love the cute Chester and Hester backstory, but would much rather have the defunct <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Beastly_Kingdom">Beastly Kingdom</a> area instead, quite honestly. </p>



<p>And now we come to an oft-controversial park that, at 72 acres, is one of the smallest of any Disney park, but is quickly becoming more beloved as it evolves. That’s right, I’m looking at you, California Adventure. </p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?w=1280 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?w=1920 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Don’t be fooled by the large buildings, the bottom right corner is all Disney’s Grand Californian Resort and not part of the park!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where to start with this park? This is a question you may ask yourself when you enter it (from Buena Vista street OR the Grand Californian if you are a guest there). While the Carthay Circle Theatre is next to a small circular fountain, the lands are nowhere near connected by a central hub. And once you get back to Pixar Pier (top right in photo) or Radiator Springs Racers, you may find yourself with quite a trek back to the entrance. The visual anchor is arguably Grizzly Peak, but it’s not a clear center location point in any regard. </p>



<p>The fact is, it’s easy to get quite lost in this park. Case in point, while talking to a friend the other day, they didn’t know there were three entrances to Cars Land (and they were a Disney regular). That’s not surprising as the design is not intuitive in the least. It’s a sprawling, chaotic mess that is reminiscent of the lack of forethought that went into designing this park in the first place. Disney is doing a great job correcting its early mistakes of DCA with the Pixar retheming, the creation of the (beautiful!) Radiator Springs, and now the addition of Marvel, but it’s hard to hide the bad bones of structure that make walking around this park a little awkward, to say the least. </p>



<p>That being said, I have an abundance of love for California Adventure, and it’s become a family favorite. And the small footprint of the park makes it an easy stroll, even if we do get a bit lost at times.  And who’s to say it’s such a bad thing to be lost while on Flo’s V-8 Cafe’s back patio watching the cars go by with a backdrop of Ornament Valley?</p>

<p>Which brings us to Hollywood Studios. A plethora of opinions abound about this park at the moment. Some love the layout, some hate it, but regardless, I think we can all agree its set-up is not the most convenient or intuitive.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="965" src="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM-679x1024.png?resize=640%2C965&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM.png?resize=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 679w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM.png?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM.png?resize=768%2C1158&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM.png?resize=1018%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1018w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM.png?w=1098&amp;ssl=1 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Hollywood Studios from above… the green is Echo Lake, and you can clearly see Batuu on the bottom left in shades of brown and grey.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The compact design of this park at just 135 acres makes it feel quite crowded even when it’s running at the same capacity as the rest of the parks. Even though it’s larger than the Magic Kingdom, the lands themselves do not have many vast open areas, therefore consistently channeling people into smaller walkways. I am pretty sure there are places I have never been in Hollywood Studios just because I didn’t know how to get there (or didn’t care to try to figure it out). </p>



<p>One could debate about what the visual anchor is for this park at the moment. Is it the Chinese Theater with Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway? Or the Hollywood Tower Hotel, even all the way down at the end of the street? It used to be the Earffel&nbsp;Tower before they dismantled it for the addition of Toy Story Land(or the giant sparkly sorcerer hat that blocked the view of the Chinese Theater). It’s hard to say, though I lean towards the Chinese Theater as the center now that Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway has become so popular. </p>



<p>Ok, Disney friends. Let’s bring it back to the original park, shall we? Let’s return to Walt’s design, where it all started. </p>



<p>One cannot talk about layout without discussing the brilliance of the Imagineers and what they have done with the postage-stamp size of Disneyland. At only 85 acres, this park has many more rides per the relative space as Magic Kingdom, and many of them opening-day (or Walt-concept) originals that still operate with only slight variations. </p>

<p>One of the most fascinating visual tricks is the way Disney places several rides in the same show building to save on space, changing only the facade on the outside of the building. Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride is on the first floor, while Alice in Wonderland climbs up to the second story to wind around above Mr. Toad. You can see the show building, which also includes Peter Pan’s Flight and The Mad Hatter gift shop in the photo below:</p>

<p>You probably have already heard about the “berm”, with the Disneyland Railroad atop it, which creates a visual barrier between you and the outside world while in the Magic Kingdom. What you may not know is that, in order to create the Haunted Mansion and the Pirates of the Caribbean, the show buildings had to be built <em>outside</em> the berm.</p>



<p>Ever wonder why Pirates of the Caribbean in Disneyland has two drops at the beginning of the ride instead of only one at Disney World?</p>



<p>Because you have to get below the train tracks, and into a separate building. </p>



<p>The same is true with the Haunted Mansion. As mentioned in my previous post about Halloween, the stretching room was designed solely to get everyone down a level in an elevator so they could walk down a long hallway underneath the berm. Imagineers and guests liked the gag so much that they replicated it in the Disney World version, but with the room stretching up instead of down since there was plenty of space for the show building right next to the stretching room. Well, technically they did plan to have elevators in the Magic Kingdom version of the Haunted Mansion, but they decided not to install them and changed their plans when Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion elevator shaft sprung a leak from the Rivers of America. The two elevators planned for Disney World still went to good use, however. One ended up in the Fantasyland stage, and the other currently resides sits under Cosmic Ray, raising him up and down as the need arises. </p>



<p>Anyway, back to Disneyland. You can clearly see in this photo below the two show buildings on the opposite side of the tracks:</p>

<p>I could go on and on for days about the layouts and intricacies within the lands themselves and how they are arranged for optimal guest traffic flow coupled with visual awe and wonder. That so many lands keep you closely within the theming without the intrusion of the surrounding areas is a magical feat unto itself. </p>



<p>The Imagineers have spent countless years hiding, sculpting, maneuvering, and designing ways for us to see the Disney parks in a specific way.</p>



<p>And that is why we love Disney. Because they not only care to bring us a beautiful Main Street USA but choose to make it magical in a way that goes beyond our understanding, creating a unique place that feels nostalgic even though none of us have ever lived in the early 1900s. </p>



<p>They invent space where there isn’t space, allowing us to believe that two rides can occupy the same location at the same time and that the Haunted Mansion could go on forever. </p>



<p>They turn an extra drop or an elevator ride into something we think of now as iconic when all it did was serve a practical need. </p>



<p>The magic is in the details, and all of this only scratches the surface of the Imagineering architectural design magic (don’t get me started about Liberty Square moving through time or the reason behind the name of the Seven Seas Lagoon!).</p>



<p>The next time you walk down Main Street, pause for a moment and take a glance at the second-story windows. Those names forever influenced the parks we know and love, and have altered our perspective in more magical ways than we’ll ever know. </p>

  <p><strong>Biologists present the latest innovation in nest building: bird nests made from anti-nesting spikes. Researchers from Naturalis Biodiversity Center and the Natural History Museum Rotterdam collected these special nests for the first time and described this remarkable behavior in a scientific publication as 'an ultimate adaptation to life in the city.'</strong></p>
                            </div>
          


    
              <div>
                                                                  <div>
                          <h2><p>A nest</p><p>that is a joke</p></h2>
          <div><p>If you look around in cities, you can see anti-bird spikes on many buildings. The sharp metal spikes are placed to scare away birds, and to prevent them from building nests. But birds are not so easily scared away, it now appears. Researchers from two Dutch natural history museums collected nests of a carrion crow and a Eurasian magpie that were largely built with material that should have deterred birds: bird nests made of anti-bird spikes. "It's like a joke, really" says biologist Auke-Florian Hiemstra of Naturalis: "Even for me as a nest researcher, these are the craziest bird nests I've ever seen."</p>

<p>The adaptability and creativity of urban birds seem to know no bounds. Researchers from Naturalis Biodiversity Center and the Natural History Museum Rotterdam describe these spiky structures in the scientific journal <em>Deinsea</em>. "Just when you think you've seen it all after half a century of studying natural history, these inventive crows and magpies really surprise me again," said Kees Moeliker, director of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam and co-author of the scientific publication.</p>

<p><strong>1500 metal spikes</strong><br>
It started with the discovery of a huge nest in Antwerp, in the courtyard of a hospital, which was spotted by one of the patients. High up in a tree, magpies made a huge nest of up to 1,500 metal spikes. For this particular nest, birds have pulled as many as 50 meters (150 feet) of anti-bird pins from the eaves. “An impregnable fortress”, says Hiemstra, “because the magpies appear to be using the pins exactly the same way we do: to keep other birds away from their nest.”</p>

<p>Magpies make a roof on their nest to prevent the robbery of eggs and young, and they specifically look for thorny plants in nature for this purpose. Spiky branches keep hungry egg robbers away. In the city there is another option: the anti-bird spikes. “They are literally made to keep birds at bay,” says Hiemstra, “which is how they seem to be used by birds as well.”</p>

<div><p><strong>Rebel birds</strong><br>
And it is not just one pair of magpies that have ventured into the bird-repellent material. The article describes several magpie nests with anti-bird spikes as nesting material. This behavior has already been seen in the Netherlands, Belgium and Scotland. Other sharp materials, such as barbed wire and knitting needles, are also used by magpies for the roof of their nests. Crow's nests made of anti-bird spikes are currently only known from the Netherlands.</p><p>
It was already known that birds are not easily deterred by the pins. The '<a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/city-file/article/face-adversity-saga-parkdale-pigeon">Parkdale Pigeon</a>' gained fame for not being scared away by anti-bird pegs and several videos show the rebellious <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/05/chick-flick-cockatoo-gives-anti-nesting-spikes-the-bird-in-viral-video">behavior of birds</a> tearing <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-05/corella-contraceptive-needed-to-address-plague/11274434">the spikes off roofs</a>. The collaboration between the Leiden and Rotterdam museums has now resulted in the first scientific publication showing that birds also use those miserable anti-bird pins as nesting material.</p></div>

<div><p><strong>Condoms and cocaine</strong><br>
Auke-Florian Hiemstra (1992) is doing a PhD at Naturalis and Leiden University on the use of artificial materials in animal structures, and has previously published on the use of <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/ab/71/2/article-p215_7.xml?language=en">face masks</a> and <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/159/2/article-p193_5.xml">plastic plants</a> in bird nests. He also regularly encounters condoms, fireworks, cocaine wraps, sunglasses and windshield wipers as nesting material for his coots. “If even bird-repellent sharp spikes are used as nesting material, apparently anything can end up in a bird's nest these days. It doesn’t get any crazier than this, does it?"</p><p>
The large magpie's nest of anti-bird pins from Antwerp can be seen from 11 July as a new highlight in the LiveScience room of Naturalis, which can be visited free of charge. The Natural History Museum Rotterdam exhibits the crow's nest of anti-bird pins in the recently opened exhibition 'National Park Rotterdam', along with a number of other remarkable constructions of urban animals.</p><p><img alt="Metal bird nest" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2f846d7c-0530-4235-be4d-a3303234a972" src="https://www.naturalis.nl/uploads/inline/Magpie%20nest%20_0.jpg" width="1256" height="942" loading="lazy"></p></div></div>

Let's abuse a bug in <code>java.lang.String</code> to make some <em>weird</em> Strings.
We'll make "hello world" not start with "hello", and show that not all empty Strings are equal to each other.
</p>

<h2>Intro: Equality among Strings</h2>

<p>
Before we get started, we look at what it takes for two Strings to be equal in the JDK.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Why is <code>"foo".equals("fox")</code> false?
</blockquote>

<p>
Because Strings are compared character by character, and the third character of those Strings is different.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Why is <code>"foo".equals("foo")</code> true?
</blockquote>

<p>
You might think that in this case the Strings are also compared character by character.
But String literals are <em>interned</em>.
When the same String appears as a constant multiple times in the source code, it's not just another String with the same content.
It is the same instance of String.
And the first thing that String.equals does is <code>if (this == anObject) { return true; }</code>, so it doesn't even look at the contents.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Why is <code>"foo!".equals("foo⁉")</code> false?

<p>
Since JDK 9 (since <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/254">JEP 254: Compact Strings</a>), a String represents its content internally as a byte array.
"foo!" only contains simple characters, with a codepoint less than 256. The String class internally encodes such values using the latin-1 encoding, with one byte per character.
"foo⁉" contains a character (⁉) that cannot be represented using latin-1, so it encodes the whole String using UTF-16, with two bytes per character.
The <code>String.coder</code> field keeps track of which of the two encodings was used.
When comparing two Strings with a different <code>coder</code>, then <code>String.equals</code> always returns false.
It does not even look at the contents, because if one String can be represented in latin-1, and the other one can not, then they can't be the same. Or can they?
</p>

<p>
Note: The compact strings feature can be disabled, but it's enabled by default. This blog post assumes it is enabled.

<h2>Creating a broken String</h2>

<blockquote>
How are Strings created? How exactly does <code>java.lang.String</code> choose to use latin-1 or not?
</blockquote>
<p>
Strings can be created in multiple ways, we'll focus here on the String constructor that takes a <code>char[]</code>.
It first tries to encode the characters as latin-1 using <code>StringUTF16.compress</code>. If that fails, it returns <code>null</code> and the constructor falls back to using UTF-16.
Here is a simplified version of how that is implemented.
(For readability I removed irrelevant indirections, checks and arguments from the actual implementation
  <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/b3f34039fedd3c49404783ec880e1885dceb296b/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/String.java#L277-L279">here</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/b3f34039fedd3c49404783ec880e1885dceb296b/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/String.java#L4757-L4772">here</a>)

</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>/**
 * Allocates a new {@code String} so that it represents the sequence of
 * characters currently contained in the character array argument. The
 * contents of the character array are copied; subsequent modification of
 * the character array does not affect the newly created string.
 */</span>
<span>public</span> <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>value</span><span>[])</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
There is the bug. This code does not always preserve the assumptions that <code>String.equals</code> makes that we talked about above.
Do you see it?

</p><p>
The javadoc points out that "subsequent modification of the character array does not affect the newly created string".
But how about <em>concurrent</em> modification?
The String constructor has a race condition.
The contents of <code>value</code> may have changed between trying to encode it as latin-1, and encoding it as UTF-16.
That way we can end up with a String that only contains latin-1 characters, but is encoded as UTF-16.
We can trigger that race condition like this:

</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>/**
 * Given a latin-1 String, creates a copy that is
 * incorrectly encoded as UTF-16.
 */</span>
<span>static</span> <span>String</span> <span>breakIt</span><span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>original</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>"Can only break latin-1 Strings"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>char</span><span>[]</span> <span>chars</span> <span>=</span> <span>original</span><span>.</span><span>toCharArray</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// in another thread, flip the first character back</span>
  <span>// and forth between being encodable as latin-1 or not</span>
  <span>Thread</span> <span>thread</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Thread</span><span>(()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>chars</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>^=</span> <span>256</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>});</span>
  <span>thread</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// at the same time call the String constructor,</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>charAt</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>256</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span><span>original</span><span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
The broken Strings we can create this way have some interesting properties.

</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>String</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span><span>;</span>
<span>String</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>breakIt</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>);</span>

<span>// they are not equal to each other</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>));</span>
<span>// =&gt; false</span>

<span>// they do contain the same series of characters</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>Arrays</span><span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>toCharArray</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>toCharArray</span><span>()));</span>
<span>// =&gt; true</span>

<span>// compareTo does consider them equal (even though its javadoc</span>
<span>// specifies that "compareTo returns 0 exactly when the</span>
<span>// equals(Object) method would return true")</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>compareTo</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>));</span>
<span>// =&gt; 0</span>

<span>// they have the same length, and one startsWith the other,</span>
<span>// but not the other way around (because if it wasn't broken,</span>
<span>// a latin-1 string cannot start with a non-latin-1</span>
<span>// substring).</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>());</span>
<span>// =&gt; true</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>));</span>
<span>// =&gt; true</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>));</span>
<span>// =&gt; false</span></code></pre></figure><p>

Strange. I didn't expect this weird behaviour from such a fundamental Java class.

</p><h2>Spooky action at a distance</h2>

<p>
Just because we can, let's have some more fun with this.
We can not only create a broken String, we can also break a String <em>at a distance</em>, in another class.

</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>OtherClass</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>startWithHello</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world"</span><span>.</span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>));</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
If we write that in IntelliJ then it warns us that <em>Result of '"hello world".startsWith("hello")' is always 'true'</em>.
This code doesn't even take any input, but we can still make it print <code>false</code>, by injecting a broken "hello" into it, through interning:
We break a String containing hello before any other code has literally mentioned or explicitly interned it, and we intern that broken version.
That way, we have broken every <code>"hello"</code> String literal in our JVM.

</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>breakIt</span><span>(</span><span>"hell"</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span><span>"o"</span><span>)).</span><span>intern</span><span>();</span>
<span>OtherClass</span><span>.</span><span>startWithHello</span><span>();</span> <span>// prints false</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2>Challenge: Empty or not?</h2>

<p>
Using our breakIt method, we can create an equivalent but not-actually-equal String of any latin-1 String.
But it doesn't work for the empty String, because that one doesn't have any characters to trigger the race condition.
Yet, we can still create a broken empty String. I'll leave that as a challenge to the reader.

</p><p>
Concretely:
Can you make a <code>java.lang.String</code> object, for which this is true: <code>s.isEmpty() &amp;&amp; !s.equals("")</code>.
No cheating: You're only allowed to use public APIs for this, e.g. no <code>.setAccessible</code> to access privates, no instrumentation.

</p><p>
If you find it, let me know <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7NQr97AA8R-4-NhaL4g1B3yGNkjXVLJqMM3aIcbJtMEn6-A/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>.
I'll update this page with submitted answers later.

<p>
A decision that arises over and over when designing concurrent programs
is whether to represent program state in control flow or as data.
This post is about what that decision means and how to approach it.
Done well, taking program state stored in data
and storing it instead in control flow can make programs
much clearer and more maintainable than they otherwise would be.

</p><p>
Before saying much more, it’s important to note that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV9rvDllKEg">concurrency is not parallelism.</a>:
</p><ul>
<li>


<p>
Concurrency is about <i>how you write programs</i>,
about being able to compose independently executing control flows,
whether you call them processes or threads or goroutines,
so that your program can be <i>dealing with</i> lots of things at once without turning into a giant mess.
</p></li><li>


<p>
On the other hand, parallelism is about <i>how you execute programs</i>,
allowing multiple computations to run simultaneously,
so that your program can be <i>doing</i> lots of things at once efficiently.</p></li></ul>


<p>
Concurrency lends itself naturally to parallel execution,
but the focus in this post is about how to use concurrency
to write cleaner programs, not faster ones.

</p><p>
The difference between concurrent programs and non-concurrent programs
is that concurrent programs can be written as if they are executing multiple
independent control flows at the same time.
The name for the smaller control flows varies by language:
thread, task, process, fiber, coroutine, goroutine, and so on.
No matter the name, the fundamental point for this post
is that writing a program in terms of multiple independently executing control flows
allows you to store program state in the execution state of one or more
of those control flows, specifically in the program counter
(which line is executing in that piece)
and on the stack.
Control flow state can always be maintained as explicit data instead,
but then the explicit data form is essentially simulating the control flow.
Most of the time, using the control flow features built into a programming language
is easier to understand, reason about, and maintain than simulating them
in data structures.

</p><p>
The rest of this post illustrates the rather abstract claims I’ve been making
about storing data in control flow by walking through some
concrete examples.
They happen to be written in <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>,
but the ideas apply to any language that supports writing concurrent programs,
including essentially every modern language.
<a href="#step"></a></p><h2 id="step"><a href="#step">A Step-by-Step Example</a></h2>


<p>
Here is a seemingly trivial problem
that demonstrates what it means to store program state in control flow.
Suppose we are reading characters from a file and want to scan over a C-style double-quoted string.
In this case, we have a non-parallel program.
There is no opportunity for parallelism here,
but as we will see, concurrency can still play a useful part.

</p><p>
If we don’t worry about checking the exact escape sequences in the string,
it suffices to match the regular expression <code>"([^"\\]|\\.)*"</code>,
which matches a double quote, then a sequence of zero or more characters,
and then another double quote.
Between the quotes, a character is anything that’s not a quote or backslash,
or else a backslash followed by anything (including a quote or backslash).

</p><p>
Every regular expression can be compiled into finite automaton or state machine,
so we might use a tool to turn that specification into this Go code:
</p><pre>state := 0
for {
    c := read()
    switch state {
    case 0:
        if c != '"' {
            return false
        }
        state = 1
    case 1:
        if c == '"' {
            return true
        }
        if c == '\\' {
            state = 2
        } else {
            state = 1
        }
    case 2:
        state = 1
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
The code has a single variable named <code>state</code> that represents the state of the automaton.
The for loop reads a character and updates the state, over and over,
until it finds either the end of the string or a syntax error.
This is the kind of code that a program would write and that only a program could love.
It’s difficult for people to read, and it will be difficult for people to maintain.

</p><p>
The main reason this program is so opaque is that its program state is stored as data,
specifically in the variable named <code>state</code>.
When it’s possible to store state in code instead, that often leads to a clearer program.
To see this, let’s transform the program, one small step at a time,
into an equivalent but much more understandable version.

</p><p>
We can start by duplicating the <code>read</code> calls into each case of the switch:
</p><pre><span>state := 0                          state := 0</span>
<span>for {                               for {</span>
    c := read()                     
<span>    switch state {                      switch state {</span>
<span>    case 0:                             case 0:</span>
                                            c := read()
<span>        if c != '"' {                       if c != '"' {</span>
<span>            return false                        return false</span>
<span>        }                                   }</span>
<span>        state = 1                           state = 1</span>
<span>    case 1:                             case 1:</span>
                                            c := read()
<span>        if c == '"' {                       if c == '"' {</span>
<span>            return true                         return true</span>
<span>        }                                   }</span>
<span>        if c == '\\' {                      if c == '\\' {</span>
<span>            state = 2                           state = 2</span>
<span>        } else {                            } else {</span>
<span>            state = 1                           state = 1</span>
<span>        }                                   }</span>
<span>    case 2:                             case 2:</span>
                                            c := read()
<span>        state = 1                           state = 1</span>
<span>    }                                   }</span>
<span>}                                   }</span>
</pre>


<p>
(In this and all the displays that follow, the old program is on the left, the new program
is on the right, and lines that haven’t changed are printed in gray text.)

</p><p>
Now, instead of writing to <code>state</code> and then immediately going around the for loop again
to look up what to do in that state, we can use code labels and goto statements:
</p><pre>state := 0                          state0:
for {                               
    switch state {                  
    case 0:                         
<span>        c := read()                     c := read()</span>
<span>        if c != '"' {                   if c != '"' {</span>
<span>            return false                    return false</span>
<span>        }                               }</span>
        state = 1                       goto state1
    case 1:                         state1:
<span>        c := read()                     c := read()</span>
<span>        if c == '"' {                   if c == '"' {</span>
<span>            return true                     return true</span>
<span>        }                               }</span>
<span>        if c == '\\' {                  if c == '\\' {</span>
            state = 2                       goto state2
<span>        } else {                        } else {</span>
            state = 1                       goto state1
<span>        }                               }</span>
    case 2:                         state2:
        c := read()                     read()
        state = 1                       goto state1
    }                               
}                                   
</pre>


<p>
Then we can simplify the program further.
The <code>goto</code> <code>state1</code> right before the <code>state1</code> label is a no-op and can be deleted.
And we can see that there’s only one way to get to state2,
so we might as well replace the <code>goto</code> <code>state2</code> with the actual code from state2:
</p><pre><span>state0:                         state0:</span>
<span>    c := read()                     c := read()</span>
<span>    if c != '"' {                   if c != '"' {</span>
<span>        return false                    return false</span>
<span>    }                               }</span>
    goto state1                 
<span>state1:                         state1:</span>
<span>    c := read()                     c := read()</span>
<span>    if c == '"' {                   if c == '"' {</span>
<span>        return true                     return true</span>
<span>    }                               }</span>
<span>    if c == '\\' {                  if c == '\\' {</span>
        goto state2             
    } else {                    
        goto state1             
    }                           
state2:                         
<span>    read()                              read()</span>
<span>    goto state1                         goto state1</span>
                                    } else {
                                        goto state1
                                    }
</pre>


<p>
Then we can factor the “goto state1” out of both branches of the if statement.
</p><pre><span>state0:                         state0:</span>
<span>    c := read()                     c := read()</span>
<span>    if c != '"' {                   if c != '"' {</span>
<span>        return false                    return false</span>
<span>    }                               }</span>
<span>                                </span>
<span>state1:                         state1:</span>
<span>    c := read()                     c := read()</span>
<span>    if c == '"' {                   if c == '"' {</span>
<span>        return true                     return true</span>
<span>    }                               }</span>
<span>    if c == '\\' {                  if c == '\\' {</span>
<span>        read()                          read()</span>
        goto state1                 }
    } else {                        goto state1
        goto state1             
    }                           
</pre>


<p>
Then we can drop the unused <code>state0</code> label and replace the <code>state1</code> loop with an actual loop.
Now we have something that looks like a real program:
</p><pre>state0:                         
<span>    c := read()                 c := read()</span>
<span>    if c != '"' {               if c != '"' {</span>
<span>        return false                return false</span>
<span>    }                           }</span>
<span>                                </span>
state1:                         for {
<span>    c := read()                     c := read()</span>
<span>    if c == '"' {                   if c == '"' {</span>
<span>        return true                     return true</span>
<span>    }                               }</span>
<span>    if c == '\\' {                  if c == '\\' {</span>
<span>        read()                          read()</span>
<span>    }                               }</span>
    goto state1                 }
</pre>


<p>
We can simplify a little further, eliminating some unnecessary variables,
and we can make the check for the final quote (<code>c</code> <code>==</code> <code>""</code>) be the loop terminator.
</p><pre>c := read()                     if read() != '"' {
if c != '"' {                   
<span>    return false                    return false</span>
<span>}                               }</span>
<span>                                </span>
for {                           var c byte
    c := read()                 for c != '"' {
    if c == '"' {                   c = read()
        return true             
    }                           
<span>    if c == '\\' {                  if c == '\\' {</span>
<span>        read()                          read()</span>
<span>    }                               }</span>
<span>}                               }</span>
                                return true
</pre>


<p>
The final version is:
</p><pre>func parseQuoted(read func() byte) bool {
    if read() != '"' {
        return false
    }
    var c byte
    for c != '"' {
        c = read()
        if c == '\\' {
            read()
        }
    }
    return true
}
</pre>


<p>
Earlier I explained the regular expression by saying it
“matches a double quote, then a sequence of zero or more characters,
and then another double quote.
Between the quotes, a character is anything that’s not a quote or backslash,
or else a backslash followed by anything.”
It’s easy to see that this program does exactly that.

</p><p>
Hand-written programs can have opportunities to use control flow too.
For example, here is a version that a person might have written by hand:
</p><pre>if read() != '"' {
    return false
}
inEscape := false
for {
    c := read()
    if inEscape {
        inEscape = false
        continue
    }
    if c == '"' {
        return true
    }
    if c == '\\' {
        inEscape = true
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
The same kinds of small steps can be used to convert the boolean variable
<code>inEscape</code> from data to control flow,
ending at the same cleaned up version.

</p><p>
Either way, the <code>state</code> variable in the original is now implicitly represented
by the program counter, meaning which part of the program is executing.
The comments in this version indicate the implicit value of the original’s
<code>state</code> (or <code>inEscape</code>) variables:
</p><pre><span>func parseQuoted(read func() byte) bool {</span>
    // state == 0
<span>    if read() != '"' {</span>
<span>        return false</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span></span>
<span>    var c byte</span>
<span>    for c != '"' {</span>
        // state == 1 (inEscape = false)
<span>        c = read()</span>
<span>        if c == '\\' {</span>
            // state == 2 (inEscape = true)
<span>            read()</span>
<span>        }</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>    return true</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>


<p>
The original program was, in essence, <i>simulating</i> this control flow
using the explicit <code>state</code> variable as a program counter,
tracking which line was executing.
If a program can be converted to store explicit state in control flow instead,
then that explicit state was merely an awkward simulation of the control flow.
<a href="#more"></a></p><h2 id="more"><a href="#more">More Threads for More State</a></h2>


<p>
Before widespread support for concurrency,
that kind of awkward simulation was often necessary,
because a different part of the program wanted
to use the control flow instead.

</p><p>
For example, suppose the text being parsed is
the result of decoding base64 input, in which
sequences of four 6-bit characters (drawn from a 64-character alphabet)
decode to three 8-bit bytes.
The core of that decoder looks like:
</p><pre>for {
    c1, c2, c3, c4 := read(), read(), read(), read()
    b1, b2, b3 := decode(c1, c2, c3, c4)
    write(b1)
    write(b2)
    write(b3)
}
</pre>


<p>
If we want those <code>write</code> calls to feed into the parser from the
previous section, we need a parser that can be called with one byte at a time,
not one that demands a <code>read</code> callback.
This decode loop cannot be presented as a <code>read</code> callback
bceause it obtains 3 input bytes at a time and
uses its control flow to track which ones have been written.
Because the decoder is storing its own state
in its control flow, <code>parseQuoted</code> cannot.

</p><p>
In a non-concurrent program, this base64 decoder and <code>parseQuoted</code>
would be at an impasse: one would have to give up
its use of control flow state and fall back to some kind
of simulated version instead.

</p><p>
To rewrite <code>parseQuoted</code>, we have to reintroduce the <code>state</code>
variable, which we can encapsulate in a struct with a <code>Write</code> method:
</p><pre>type parser struct {
    state int
}

func (p *parser) Init() {
    p.state = 0
}

func (p *parser) Write(c byte) Status {
    switch p.state {
    case 0:
        if c != '"' {
            return BadInput
        }
        p.state = 1
    case 1:
        if c == '"' {
            return Success
        }
        if c == '\\' {
            p.state = 2
        } else {
            p.state = 1
        }
    case 2:
        p.state = 1
    }
    return NeedMoreInput
}
</pre>


<p>
The <code>Init</code> method initializes the state,
and then each <code>Write</code> loads the state,
takes actions based on the state and the input byte,
and then saves the state back to the struct.

</p><p>
For <code>parseQuoted</code>, the state machine is simple enough that this may be completely fine.
But maybe the state machine is much more complex,
or maybe the algorithm is best expressed recursively.
In those cases, being passed an input sequence by the caller
one byte at a time means making all that state explicit in a
data structure simulating the original control flow.

</p><p>
Concurrency eliminates the contention between different parts of the
program over which gets to store state in control flow,
because now there can be multiple control flows.

</p><p>
Suppose we already have the <code>parseQuoted</code> function,
and it’s big and complicated
and tested and correct, and we don’t want to change it.
We can avoid editing that code at all by writing this wrapper:
</p><pre>type parser struct {
    c      chan byte
    status chan Status
}

func (p *parser) Init() {
    p.char = make(chan byte)
    p.status = make(chan Status)
    go p.run()
    &lt;-p.status // always NeedMoreInput
}

func (p *parser) run() {
    if !parseQuoted(p.read) {
        p.status &lt;- BadSyntax
    } else {
        p.status &lt;- Success
    }
}

func (p *parser) read() byte {
    p.status &lt;- NeedMoreInput
    return &lt;-p.c
}

func (p *parser) Write(c byte) Status {
    p.c &lt;- c
    return &lt;-p.status
}
</pre>


<p>
Note the use of <code>parseQuoted</code>, completely unmodified, in the <code>run</code> method.
Now the base64 decoder can use <code>p.Write</code> and keep its program counter
and local variables.

</p><p>
The new goroutine that <code>Init</code> creates runs the <code>p.run</code> method,
which invokes the original <code>parseQuoted</code> function with an
appropriate implementation of <code>read</code>.
Before starting <code>p.run</code>, <code>Init</code> allocates two channels for communicating
between the <code>p.run</code> method, runing in its own goroutine,
and whatever goroutine calls <code>p.Write</code> (such as the base64 decoder’s goroutine).
The channel <code>p.c</code> carries bytes from <code>Write</code> to <code>read</code>, and the channel <code>p.status</code>
carries status updates back.
Each time <code>parseQuoted</code> calls <code>read</code>, <code>p.read</code> sends <code>NeedMoreInput</code> on <code>p.status</code>
and waits for an input byte on <code>p.c</code>.
Each time <code>p.Write</code> is called, it does the opposite: it sends the input byte <code>c</code> on <code>p.c</code>
and then waits for and returns an updated status from <code>p.status</code>.
These two calls take turns, back and forth,
one executing and one waiting at any given moment.

</p><p>
To get this cycle going, the <code>Init</code> method does the initial receive from <code>p.status</code>,
which will correspond to the first <code>read</code> in <code>parseQuoted</code>.
The actual status for that first update is guaranteed to be <code>NeedMoreInput</code>
and is discarded.
To end the cycle, we assume that when <code>Write</code> returns <code>BadSyntax</code> or <code>Success</code>,
the caller knows not to call <code>Write</code> again.
If the caller incorrectly kept calling <code>Write</code>,
the send on <code>p.c</code> would block forever, since <code>parseQuoted</code> is done.
We would of course make that more robust in a production implementation.

</p><p>
By creating a new control flow (a new goroutine), we were able to keep the
code-state-based implementation of <code>parseQuoted</code> as well as our code-state-based
base64 decoder.
We avoided having to understand the internals of either implementation.
In this example, both are trivial enough that rewriting one would not
have been a big deal,
but in a larger program, it could be a huge win to be able to write this kind of
adapter instead of having to make changes to existing code.
As we’ll discuss <a href="#limitations">later</a>, the conversion is not entirely free – we need to
make sure the extra control flow gets cleaned up, and we need to think about
the cost of the context switches – but it may well still be a net win.
<a href="#stack"></a></p><h2 id="stack"><a href="#stack">Store Stacks on the Stack</a></h2>


<p>
The base64 decoder’s control flow state included not just the program counter
but also two local variables.
Those would have to be pulled out into a struct if the decoder had to be changed
not to use control flow state.
Programs can use an arbitrary number of local variables by using their call stack.
For example, suppose we have a simple binary tree data structure:
</p><pre>type Tree[V any] struct {
    left  *Tree[V]
    right *Tree[V]
    value V
}
</pre>


<p>
If you can’t use control flow state, then to implement iteration over this tree,
you have to introduce an explicit “iterator”:
</p><pre>type Iter[V any] struct {
    stk []*Tree[V]
}

func (t *Tree[V]) NewIter() *Iter[V] {
    it := new(Iter[V])
    for ; t != nil; t = t.left {
        it.stk = append(it.stk, t)
    }
    return it
}

func (it *Iter[V]) Next() (v V, ok bool) {
    if len(it.stk) == 0 {
        return v, false
    }
    t := it.stk[len(it.stk)-1]
    v = t.value
    it.stk = it.stk[:len(it.stk)-1]
    for t = t.right; t != nil; t = t.left {
        it.stk = append(it.stk, t)
    }
    return v, true
}
</pre>


<p>
On the other hand, if you can use control flow state,
confident that other parts of the
program that need their own state can run in other control flows,
then you can implement iteration without an explicit iterator,
as a method that calls a yield function for each value:
</p><pre>func (t *Tree[V]) All(f func(v V)) {
    if t != nil {
        t.left.All(f)
        f(t.value)
        t.right.All(f)
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
The <code>All</code> method is obviously correct.
The correctness of the <code>Iter</code> version is much less obvious.
The simplest explanation is that <code>Iter</code> is simulating <code>All</code>.
The <code>NewIter</code> method’s loop that sets up <code>stk</code> is
simulating the recursion in <code>t.All(f)</code> down successive <code>t.left</code> branches.
<code>Next</code> pops and saves the <code>t</code> at the top of the stack
and then simulates the recursion in <code>t.right.All(f)</code> down successive <code>t.left</code> branches,
setting up for the next <code>Next</code>.
Finally it returns the value from the top-of-stack <code>t</code>,
simulating <code>f(value)</code>.

</p><p>
We could write code like <code>NewIter</code> and argue its correctness
by explaining that it simulates a simple function like <code>All</code>.
I’d rather write <code>All</code> and stop there.
<a href="#tree"></a></p><h2 id="tree"><a href="#tree">Comparing Binary Trees</a></h2>


<p>
One might argue that <code>NewIter</code> is better than <code>All</code>,
because it does not use any control flow state, so it can be
used in contexts that already use their control flows
to hold other information.
For example, what if we want to traverse two binary trees
at the same time, checking that they hold the same values
even if their internal structure differs.
With <code>NewIter</code>, this is straighforward:
</p><pre>func SameValues[V any](t1, t2 *Tree[V]) bool {
    it1 := t1.NewIter()
    it2 := t2.NewIter()
    for {
        v1, ok1 := it1.Next()
        v2, ok2 := it2.Next()
        if v1 != v2 || ok1 != ok2 {
            return false
        }
        if !ok1 &amp;&amp; !ok2 {
            return true
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
This program cannot be written as easily using <code>All</code>,
the argument goes, because <code>SameValues</code> wants to use
its own control flow (advancing two lists in lockstep)
that cannot be replaced by <code>All</code>’s control flow
(recursion over the tree).
But this is a false dichotomy, the same one we saw
with <code>parseQuoted</code> and the base64 decoder.
If two different functions have different demands
on control flow state, they can run in different control flows.

</p><p>
In our case, we can write this instead:
</p><pre><span>func SameValues[V any](t1, t2 *Tree[V]) bool {</span>
    c1 := make(chan V)
    c2 := make(chan V)
    go gopher(c1, t1.All)
    go gopher(c2, t2.All)
<span>    for {</span>
        v1, ok1 := &lt;-c1
        v2, ok2 := &lt;-c2
<span>        if v1 != v2 || ok1 != ok2 {</span>
<span>            return false</span>
<span>        }</span>
<span>        if !ok1 &amp;&amp; !ok2 {</span>
<span>            return true</span>
<span>        }</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
func gopher[V any](c chan&lt;- V, all func(func(V))) {
    all(func(v V) { c &lt;- v })
    close(c)
}
</pre>


<p>
The function <code>gopher</code> uses <code>all</code> to walk a tree, announcing
each value into a channel. After the walk, it closes the channel.

</p><p>
<code>SameValues</code> starts two concurrent gophers,
each of which walks one tree and announces the values into one channel.
Then <code>SameValues</code> does exactly the same loop as before
to compare the two value streams.

</p><p>
Note that <code>gopher</code> is not specific to binary trees in any way:
it applies to <i>any</i> iteration function.
That is, the general idea of starting a goroutine to run the <code>All</code> method
works for converting any code-state-based iteration into an
incremental iterator.
A future post will expand on this idea.
<a href="#limitations"></a></p><h2 id="limitations"><a href="#limitations">Limitations</a></h2>


<p>
This approach of storing data in control flow is not a panacea.
Here are a few caveats:
</p><ul>
<li>


<p>
If the state needs to evolve in ways that don’t naturally map
to control flow, then it’s usually best to leave the state as data.
For example, the state maintained by a node in a distributed system
is usually not best represented in control flow,
because timeouts, errors, and other unexpected events tend to
require adjusting the state in unpredictable ways.
</p></li><li>


<p>
If the state needs to be serialized for operations like snapshots,
or sending over a network, that’s usually easier with data than code.
</p></li><li>


<p>
When you do need to create multiple control flows to hold different control flow state,
the helper control flows need to be shut down. When <code>SameValues</code> returns
false, it leaves the two concurrent <code>gopher</code>s blocked waiting to
send their next values. Instead, it should unblock them.
That requires communication in the other direction
to tell <code>gopher</code> to stop early. A future post will show that.
</p></li><li>


<p>
In the multiple thread case, the switching costs can be significant.
On my laptop, a C thread switch takes a few microseconds.
A channel operation and goroutine switch
is an order of magnitude cheaper: a couple hundred nanoseconds.
An optimized coroutine system can reduce the cost to tens of
nanoseconds or less.</p></li></ul>


<p>
In general, storing data in control flow is a valuable tool
for writing clean, simple, maintainable programs.
Like all tools, it works very well for some jobs and not as well for others.
<a href="#counterpoint"></a></p><h2 id="counterpoint"><a href="#counterpoint">Counterpoint: John McCarthy’s GOPHER</a></h2>


<p>
The idea of using concurrency to align a pair of binary trees is over 50 years old.
It first appeared in Charles Prenner’s
“<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/942582.807990">The control structure facilities of ECL</a>”
(<i>ACM SIGPLAN Notices</i>, Volume 6, Issue 12, December 1971; see pages 106–109).
In that presentation, titled “Tree Walks Using Coroutines”, the problem was to take two binary trees A and B with the same number of nodes
and copy the value sequence from A into B despite the two having different internal structure.
They present a straightforward coroutine-based variant.

</p><p>
Brian Smith and Carl Hewitt introduced the problem of simply comparing two
Lisp-style cons trees (in which internal nodes carry no values)
in their draft of “<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/185900689/A-Plasma-Primer">A Plasma Primer</a>” (March 1975; see pages 61-62).
For that problem, which they named “samefringe”, they used continuation-based actors
to run a pair of “fringe” actors (credited to Howie Shrobe)
over the two trees and report nodes back to a comparison loop.

</p><p>
Gerald Sussman and Guy Steele presented the samefringe problem again,
in “<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5794/AIM-349.pdf">Scheme: An Interpreter for Extended Lambda Calculus</a>” (December 1975; see pages 8–9),
with roughly equivalent code (crediting Smith, Hewitt, and Shrobe for inspiration).
They refer to it as a “classic problem difficult to solve in most programming languages”.

</p><p>
In August 1976, <i>ACM SIGART Bulletin</i> published Patrick Greussay’s
“<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1045270.1045273">An Iterative Lisp Solution to the Samefringe Problem</a>”,
This prompted <a href="https://dl.acm.org/action/showFmPdf?doi=10.1145%2F1045276">a response letter by Tim Finin and Paul Rutler in the November 1976 issue</a> (see pages 4–5)
pointing out that Greussay’s solution runs in quadratic time and memory
but also remarking that
“the SAMEFRINGE problem has been notoriously overused as a justification for coroutines.”
That discussion prompted <a href="https://dl.acm.org/action/showFmPdf?doi=10.1145%2F1045283">a response letter by John McCarthy in the February 1977 issue</a> (see page 4).

</p><p>
In his response, titled “Another samefringe”, McCarthy gives the following LISP solution:
</p><pre>(DE SAMEFRINGE (X Y)
       (OR (EQ X Y)
           (AND (NOT (ATOM X))
                (NOT (ATOM Y))
                (SAME (GOPHER X) (GOPHER Y)))))

(DE SAME (X Y)
       (AND (EQ (CAR X) (CAR Y))
            (SAMEFRINGE (CDR X) (CDR Y))))

(DE GOPHER (U)
       (COND ((ATOM (CAR U)) U)
             (T (GOPHER (CONS (CAAR U)
                              (CONS (CDAR U) (CDR U)))))))
</pre>


<p>
He then explains:</p><blockquote>

<p>
<i>gopher</i> digs up the first atom in an S-expression, piling up the <i>cdr</i> parts
(with its hind legs) so that indexing through the atoms can be resumed.
Because of shared structure, the number of new cells in use in each argument
at any time (apart from those occupied by the original expression and assuming
iterative execution) is the number of <i>cars</i> required to go from the top to the
current atom – usually a small fraction of the size of the S-expression.</p></blockquote>

<p>
In modern terms, McCarthy’s <code>GOPHER</code> loops applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_rotation">right tree rotations</a>
until the leftmost node is at the top of the tree.
<code>SAMEFRINGE</code> applies <code>GOPHER</code> to the two trees, compares the tops,
and then loops to consider the remainders.

</p><p>
After presenting a second, more elaborate solution, McCarthy remarks:</p><blockquote>

<p>
I think all this shows that <i>samefringe</i> is not an example of the need for co-routines,
and a new “simplest example” should be found.
There is no merit in merely moving information from data structure to control structure,
and it makes some kinds of modification harder.</p></blockquote>

<p>
I disagree with “no merit”. We can view McCarthy’s <code>GOPHER</code>-ized trees as an encoding
of the same stack that <code>NewIter</code> maintains but in tree form.
The correctness follows for the same reasons: it is simulating a
simple recursive traversal.
This <code>GOPHER</code> is clever, but it only works on trees.
If you’re not John McCarthy, it’s easier to write the recursive traversal
and then rely on the general, concurrency-based <code>gopher</code> we saw earlier
to do the rest.

</p><p>
My experience is that when it is possible,
moving information from data structure to control structure
usually makes programs clearer, easier to understand,
and easier to maintain.
I hope you find similar results.

                    <p>Since July 2022, health insurance companies have been required to publish how much they pay healthcare providers for nearly all health care services. In the past, these negotiated prices were kept secret, leading to wide differences in payments between providers. Patients and even doctors had very little idea how much was actually being paid for healthcare.</p><p>Posting prices of items and services seems like an easy problem to solve. After all, across other industries, we can instantly browse prices for nearly anything, whether we are looking for something big like a new house or something truly important, like fuzzy cat socks:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-27-at-7.51.45-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-27-at-7.51.45-PM.png 600w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-27-at-7.51.45-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-27-at-7.51.45-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-27-at-7.51.45-PM.png 2372w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If other complex markets like air travel and real estate have public pricing, we should be able to do the same for healthcare. Unfortunately, nothing in the US healthcare system is simple.</p><p>While the<a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide"> Transparency in Coverage (TiC) rule</a> has been effective in revealing payer-negotiated rates, the amount of data is overwhelming. Insurance companies are posting in total about a petabyte per month of price data. And at Turquoise Health, we are collecting, cleaning, and augmenting all of that data every month. We use the data to populate our patient-facing website, to share with our customers and to power our own products.</p><p>If you are a software engineer, you might have just done a spit take at “a petabyte of data per month.” A petabyte is a truly astronomical amount of information — many hundreds of trillions of numbers. With only 66% of Americans covered by commercial health insurance, how is it that we need trillions of numbers to represent health care prices for only 220 million people?</p><h2 id="some-context-on-hospital-pricing">Some Context On Hospital Pricing</h2><p>Imagine that you are an online retailer selling cat socks. You would have a simple table of prices that looked like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.21.44-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.21.44-PM.png 600w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.21.44-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.21.44-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.21.44-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>That’s how most people think about prices — a menu of options provided at a fixed rate. So you’d think hospitals and insurance companies have a simple database table containing a list of services with prices like any other retailer. But in most cases, they have complex contracts that look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.22.40-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.22.40-PM.png 600w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.22.40-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.22.40-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.22.40-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Notice how every item has a price that requires external information to understand:</p><ul><li>Per diem rates are paid for each day a patient is in the hospital. We need to know how long the patient will be in the hospital to know the total amount.</li><li>Rates for Cardiac Studies require knowing the price the hospital will bill in the future. The rate is essentially “44.8% of another unknown price,” which isn’t terribly helpful to a patient.</li><li>Radiology rates are based on an external price list that has to be looked up in an entirely different database. External rate lists are very common in health insurance but are not helpful unless you have access to the latest price list and can do the math yourself.</li></ul><p>Health insurance companies don't have a simple price list showing every price for every service. They have a rules engine that calculates prices based on formulas and look-up tables. While the healthcare system has lived with formula-based pricing for decades, the government was rightfully concerned that releasing rules-based prices would not be helpful to patients. Is “44.8% of an unknown price” better or worse than “162% of a benchmark rate that I also don’t know?”</p><p>As a result, the<a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide"> Transparency in Coverage rule</a> requires insurance companies to do the math for patients and, in most cases, publish prices as dollar amounts. That’s helpful for patients, but it requires that a price be pre-calculated for every possible service. Pre-calculating all the prices also causes the data to mushroom from a few formulas that apply to a range of billing codes to thousands of individual prices.</p><p>For example, using the table above, a payer would display a dollar amount for each billing code in the range shown in the Cardiac Studies column.</p><p>This single row:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cSDYO5BsBoMWe7XCSChwVrFs9yAXsSssBW3BSm78RXsSDNdWEJdT0Xe_SQljNDgocKOXq_AVTse-AYELGRmx39MrvjoWTRqwVQwPPkftN5wiKi2xVl1FMVpLhHNwYn9tw2fgNQ8kFgkL49B9izfITKM" alt=""></figure><p>Expands to many rows:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>Service</span></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>Billing Code</span></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>Rate</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>Cardiac Studies</span></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>99303</span></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>$5,432.08</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>Cardiac Studies</span></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>99304</span></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>$5,499.75</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>Cardiac Studies</span></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>99305</span></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>$4,381.08</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>1, 2, ..., 99…</span></p></td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><span>Cardiac Studies</span></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>93356</span></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><span>$6,059.33</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This makes the data much larger than what insurance companies store internally, but it also makes the data much easier to use.</p><h2 id="same-procedure-different-scenarios">Same Procedure, Different Scenarios</h2><p>We can handle storing a menu of prices with each service and still have a manageable amount of data. In practice, though, every service has many possible prices because each service has many different scenarios that could affect the final price. Here are some common situations that change the price:</p><ul><li>A surgery was started but cancelled mid-operation for medical reasons.</li><li>A nurse practitioner performed the procedure in place of a doctor.</li><li>A doctor performed multiple procedures at once, which is cheaper than performing each procedure separately.</li><li>Instead of a doctor performing the MRI, a technician runs the MRI machine and a doctor reviews the results later.</li><li>A flu vaccination is given by a mobile flu clinic instead of in a hospital.</li></ul><p>So every item in the price list gets a price for all of the possible situations, creating hundreds of price variations of each service.</p><h3 id="massive-data-redundancy">Massive Data Redundancy</h3><p>Even with separate prices for each variant of each service, the data is still <em>possible</em> to manage. Where things get hairy is how the data is represented. The<a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide"> Transparency in Coverage schema</a> requires requires rates to be arranged in a hierarchical fashion, like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.26.56-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.26.56-PM.png 600w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.26.56-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.26.56-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.26.56-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>This means that each hospital's long list of doctors is repeated for every possible price variation of every medical service. Data balloons exponentially.</p><p>The schema does provide a way to avoid this duplication by referring to a separate list of doctors instead of repeating them. But taking advantage of that feature is currently optional, so not all insurance companies use it.</p><h3 id="clinically-implausible-rates">Clinically Implausible Rates</h3><p>The data is further ballooned because it includes rates for <strong><em>many</em></strong> medical services that can never occur. For example, an insurance company may have a contract that says they pay $180,000 for a heart transplant. The payer follows the rules and publishes that price for the list of “<strong>all </strong>doctors in this hospital.” That means including a heart transplant rate for podiatrists, pediatricians, urologists, and neurologists. Those doctors would never perform a heart transplant, so the data is dead weight. When multiplied by every possible procedure performed by every type of care provider, this issue adds a significant amount of useless data.</p><h3 id="highly-redundant-insurance-plans">Highly Redundant Insurance Plans</h3><p>Lastly, the law requires that rates are published for every insurance <strong><em>plan</em></strong>. Insurance companies don't usually set rates at the plan level. Insurance companies agree to rates with networks of doctors and those rates are re-used among many insurance plans. They may offer 1,000 slightly customized insurance plans to 1,000 different employers that all share largely the same rates for the same doctors. The result is 1,000 giant files that repeat the same prices for the same doctors repeatedly. There is some guidance on avoiding this in the schema, but the solutions aren't always used effectively.</p><h2 id="shrinking-it-down">Shrinking it Down</h2><p>First, we must credit CMS. It<a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide/issues"> developed its payer data schema in public on Github</a>, accepts suggestions from interested parties, and is responsive to feedback. We expect to see some of the issues mentioned here addressed in the future. Thanks, CMS!</p><p>But in the meantime, &nbsp;Turquoise Health is processing around a petabyte of data per month which our users want to use to make decisions about healthcare prices. Our goal is to make the data as small, clean and easy to use as possible.</p><p>We’ve been working to pull the data out of an overly-hierarchical structure to remove the inherent duplication. The idea is to look for duplicated information being stored lower in the hierarchy and only store one copy. Along the way, we can also remove some unneeded levels of hierarchy:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.29.18-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.29.18-PM.png 600w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.29.18-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.29.18-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-3.29.18-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>By storing only one copy of each piece of information, we can store the exact same information <em><strong>with an 85% reduction in size</strong></em>.</p><p>We are applying further optimizations to shrink the data even more. We've analyzed historical healthcare records to identify which types of doctors are likely to perform which types procedures. By removing prices for clinically implausible services, we can cut the data at least in half again.</p><h2 id="smaller-data-leads-to-insights-and-saves-money-">Smaller Data Leads to Insights (and Saves Money)</h2><p>Performing this de-duplication processing is a tricky data engineering problem. The data is spread across millions of files from hundreds of insurance companies. Cross-referencing the data to find only unique information within a massive dataset is computationally intensive.</p><p>But the effort is worth it. Reducing this data down to a much smaller dataset has huge implications for our users and for us.</p><p>First, a much smaller dataset is exponentially faster to query. Queries that used to take minutes or hours now take seconds. Faster data exploration naturally leads to more exploration and insights.</p><p>Second, working with a much smaller dataset is quicker and more cost-effective when running complex analyses across the entire dataset. We are working on several exciting projects that require summarizing the entire price landscape. One of our first goals is to quantify the quality of each insurance company's published rates, which requires quickly analyzing all of the data together.</p><p>Third, the duplicated data we eliminated was making the data harder to understand. When users searched and exported data, they could get reams of repeated information that was challenging to pick through. Removing redundant data makes rates easier to understand.</p><h2 id="show-me-tangible-results">Show Me Tangible Results</h2><p>After filtering down the data, we are left with a few tens of terabytes of compressed information that represents the prices of the entire US commercial healthcare system. But tens of terabytes is still a challenge for traditional database systems.</p><p>To query this data quickly, we use the open-source <a href="https://trino.io/">Trino database engine</a>. Trino is designed from the ground up for big data analytics. The raw rate data is stored in Amazon S3 in a compressed file format. Users write normal SQL and Trino scans the data in S3 to find what it needs. To the user, it looks just like any other database. But behind the scenes, Trino executes many queries in parallel using a cluster of servers to speed up results.</p><p>Imagine that we want to grab the Anthem insurance rates for insurance plans for hospitals in California. It seems like a simple request, but even something this basic would be slow and difficult with the original data.</p><ul><li>Anthem operates in 14 states, including country-sized states like California and New York, and offers many plans in each market, making the pool of data we are checking quite large.</li><li>We look for hospitals using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Provider_Identifier">National Provider IDs (NPIs)</a>, but each hospital has several NPIs, and the original payer data schema repeats the list of providers for every price – and we have to check them all!</li></ul><p>So we are actually looking for hundreds of needles in a haystack approximately the size of Mars. But with the deduplicated payer data and Trino, this query is no sweat. Previously, this kind of query could take an hour or more to run. Now it runs in 10-20 seconds.</p><h2 id="better-data-makes-everything-better">Better Data Makes Everything Better</h2><p>Raw performance improvements are great on their own, but these data improvements will also flow through to all of the tools on the Turquoise Health platform. </p><p>Many users explore pricing data through <a href="https://turquoise.health/products/rate_sense">Rate Sense</a>, our health rates search engine. Using Rate Sense, very complex questions like "how much does it actually cost to deliver a baby in California?" can be answered in seconds. </p><p>Just query for MSDRG 768 (the code for an inpatient child delivery in a hospital) and get specific prices or even a complete market summary in seconds:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.turquoise.health/content/images/2023/07/rs-demo-2.gif" alt=""></figure><p>These data updates will make all our tools even more delightful to use. We are excited about the new possibilities! Want to learn more? <a href="https://turquoise.health/contact?page=contact-us">Get in touch</a>.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Recent work has demonstrated that increased training dataset diversity
improves general cross-domain knowledge and downstream generalization
capability for large-scale language models. With this in mind, we present
\textit{the Pile}: an 825 GiB English text corpus targeted at training
large-scale language models. The Pile is constructed from 22 diverse
high-quality subsets -- both existing and newly constructed -- many of which
derive from academic or professional sources. Our evaluation of the untuned
performance of GPT-2 and GPT-3 on the Pile shows that these models struggle on
many of its components, such as academic writing. Conversely, models trained on
the Pile improve significantly over both Raw CC and CC-100 on all components of
the Pile, while improving performance on downstream evaluations. Through an
in-depth exploratory analysis, we document potentially concerning aspects of
the data for prospective users. We make publicly available the code used in its
construction.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://openmkt.org/blog/2023/ucla-professor-refuses-to-cover-for-dan-ariely-in-issue-of-data-provenance/">https://openmkt.org/blog/2023/ucla-professor-refuses-to-cover-for-dan-ariely-in-issue-of-data-provenance/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36684242">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In one of the more bizarre twists of the Dan Ariely saga, there is a huge issue of provenance in one of Dan Ariely’s studies. The study in question is <a href="https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jandreoni/Seminar/OnAmir.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Ariely’s Ten Commandments study at JMR</a>. The hugely impactful paper has over 3,000 citations but unfortunately <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245918781032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to replicate in a large-scale systematic replication project</a>. The person who Ariely claims ran the study for him at UCLA, Professor Aimee Drolet Rossi, has no recollection of running the study for him at all. That would be fine if she just couldn’t remember, but there are two more relevant facts:</p><ol><li>Dan Ariely was a super star even at that time so it would have been very memorable if she had collected data for him.</li><li>The data for Ariely’s Ten Commandments study, the study in question, could not have come out of the generating process used by the subject pool Drolet Rossi managed at that time.</li></ol><p>Unfortunately for Ariely, <a href="https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/articles/dan-ariely-investigation-by-the-source-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Israeli press won’t let the issue die and has been digging into this issue of provenance rather deeply</a>. This has led to two things:</p><ol><li>Dan Ariely pressuring Rossi to cover for him</li><li>Aimee Drolet Rossi posting their email exchanges to EJMR</li></ol><p>According to Aimee Drolet Rossi, the other two authors, On Amir and Nina Mazar have claimed to not remember where the data came from (though one of the emails below seems to possibly involve On Amir as claiming to receive the data in the exchange that never happened). That means one of the most cited studies in the history of <em>Journal of Marketing Research</em> is completely lacking in provenance. The trail stops at Dan Ariely but his story that it was run at UCLA does not check out.</p><p>Here are all of the emails that I could gather from <a href="https://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/francesco-gino/page/64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the EJMR thread</a>. They should be clickable to zoom in on the a bit if needed:</p><h3>August 2021</h3><figure><a

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Lately, my Magit buffer broke once again because of something weird going on with major mode, and I couldn’t stash or commit hunks unless the point was at the beginning of the line.
That once again reminded me that Emacs UI is not really a UI, all of it is mere text with a bunch of properties slapped on top.
It’s easy to forget about it, and use such things like Treemacs, Customize, heck, even Org Mode, thinking that you’re interacting with UI elements (file nodes in Treemacs, text-boxes in Customize, Org Modes sub-trees and drawers).
However, it is an illusion, though neatly crafted.
It’s still text.</p>
<p>Well, what’s bad about it you might ask?
We love to manipulate text, Emacs even makes it actually comfortable to do, with a lot of functions dedicated to it.
And buffers are also a very fast way to manipulate even moderate amounts of text.
But ask yourself, do you really want to do the same kind of thing in a different UI system, outside of Emacs?
Maybe if it came with the same amount of useful functions?
Well, maybe you’d want to, but I sure don’t.</p>
<p>I’ve made my own custom UI elements in Kakoune, making a file tree, and tag list plugins.
That was before I actually started using Emacs as my main environment, and Kakoune text properties are much less sophisticated than ones of Emacs, but…
It’s the same thing, really.</p>
<p>You programmatically spit some text into the buffer, then you parse it, find elements, walk on them, change them, and so on.
Yes, text properties, markers, overlays, all of it makes it more robust in Emacs, but even though, things still break.
Because Emacs still tries to interpret stiff in your buffer as text.</p>
<p>Because that’s what it does, it expects text!
If you call <code>forward-sexp</code> on some Magit UI element it will try to do the right thing, even if there’s no right thing - there are no sexps in the Magit buffer.
Well, maybe there are if you’re viewing diffs of your lisp code, and then yeah, the benefit of everything being text you can move on becomes obvious.
Except when we’re talking about UI it’s not working more of the times than it is useful in an occasional context of that UI element.</p>
<p>I think you probably get where I’m going with this.
And you probably don’t like it, but bear with me.
And it’s an angry bear, so don’t threaten me more than he does, please.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is that Emacs, as a GUI application isn’t something that I’d be advertising to other people.
You can make Emacs look beautiful, no doubt about that, <a href="https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs" target="_blank">Nano</a> Emacs, <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs" target="_blank">DOOM</a>, and others try very hard to make Emacs visually appealing.
But it’s all too janky IMO.
Nano Emacs looks great on the pictures, but resize a window and the illusion of a coherent interface breaks fast.
So let’s look at different systems for inspiration:</p>
<h2 id="smalltalk">Smalltalk</h2>
<p>I’ve already mentioned Smalltalk in the past regarding comparison with Emacs in the GUI field.
And I think it is a fair thing to do - both are dynamic systems that you can program with their respective language.
Except, one is GUI oriented pretty much from the start, and the other one is Emacs.</p>
<p>Look at how Smalltalk looks when you fire up Pharo:</p>
<figure><img src="https://andreyor.st/2023-07-11-emacs-gui-library/pharo.gif">
</figure>

<p>It’s a GUI <em>system</em>.
Complete with windows, containing text editors, browsers, context-aware menus, and so on.
Maybe it doesn’t look as pretty as your preferred GUI toolkit, but it’s not the main point.</p>
<p>Although, here’s how Smalltalk looks when you fire up GToolkit, which is written in Pharo:</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://andreyor.st/2023-07-11-emacs-gui-library/gtoolkit-1.png" alt="Figure 1: Visualizing the current knowledge base through a Pharo snippet. Clicking on nodes opens the page to the right." width="580px"><figcaption>
            <p><span>Figure 1: </span>Visualizing the current knowledge base through a Pharo snippet. Clicking on nodes opens the page to the right.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure><img src="https://andreyor.st/2023-07-11-emacs-gui-library/gtoolkit-2.png" alt="Figure 2: A page with a JavaScript snippet that is combined with a Pharo snippet to produce a visualization of dependencies defined in a Yarn file." width="580px"><figcaption>

            <p><span>Figure 3: </span>Explaining a domain object through examples and custom views.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>
<p>There are much more pictures on the <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/" target="_blank">official web page</a>.</p>
<p>The point of it is that you can build your own tools for your tasks in this toolkit, as shown in the pictures.
They call it building an inspector, and GToolkit comes with a lot of inspectors for various kinds of data.</p>
<p>This is my favorite system so far, and it gets worse from here but I feel that we need to talk about other examples still.</p>
<h2 id="clojure"><del>Java</del> Clojure</h2>
<p>Why not?
Clojure is another dynamic system, that you can change at runtime.
While Java isn’t what comes to mind when speaking about beautiful and functional GUI, making GUI apps in Clojure is far more fun than it is in Java.
Because again, you can update your UI elements on the fly.</p>
<p>There are some examples of apps where the UI is done in Clojure, one example is the game engine called <a href="https://defold.com/product/" target="_blank">Defold</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://andreyor.st/2023-07-11-emacs-gui-library/defold.png" alt="Figure 4: I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a non-skewed image on the official page." width="580px"><figcaption>
            <p><span>Figure 4: </span>I couldn’t find a non-skewed image on the official page.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As far as I understand, its Editor is made in Clojure, and UI is handled via the JavaFX toolkit.</p>
<p>Intellij Idea is many another example of a decent-looking GUI in Java, although your opinion may vary.</p>
<p>Still, JVM isn’t the greatest at UI, and somehow another language with a J in the name managed to do somewhat better.</p>
<h2 id="web">Web</h2>
<p>Lastly, the web is another way of building user interfaces, one that is quite popular today.
Because the web works the same across a majority of operating systems, as browsers are ported to them with a lot of care.
Browsers are also extremely capable of rendering all kinds of file formats, doing interactive stuff, and JavaScript frameworks are aimed at providing facilities for building UI that is highly responsive and interactive.</p>
<p>The web is however associated with slow, often unresponsive UI, a lot of wasted screen space, and unnecessary high CPU and memory usage.
Mostly due to Electron packing lots of stuff.
I think Electron wasn’t a bad idea, the execution was just poor.
There are other projects that provide similar facilities like <a href="https://ultralig.ht/" target="_blank">Ultralight</a>, but I didn’t investigate further.
I’m OK with the idea of building UI on web technologies, as long as we’re making a robust system that works across multiple devices and actually benefits from using the browser.</p>
<p>There’s also this project, which I find cool because it looks similar to GToolkit: <a href="https://natto.dev/example/0a7aeb805e76412989946c5f270f84e5" target="_blank">natto.dev</a>.
Basically, you get an infinite canvas, on which you can place text editing widgets, video widgets, and other stuff.
Keep this thing in mind, I find the idea of such UI interesting, and probably it will be explored more in the future.</p>
<p>But, let’s get back to Emacs, and I’ll try to explain why I was bragging about all these other systems.</p>
<h2 id="emacs">Emacs</h2>
<p>Emacs has a windowing system.
Basically like a tiling window manager - you have a frame, you can divide it into windows, you can spawn other frames, you can divide them, and so on.
But, these windows can only display basic text, among some graphical elements, like SVG graphics, or bitmaps.
Needless to say, when compared to any of the systems I’ve talked about before the GUI capabilities of Emacs are quite limited.</p>
<p>Basically, Emacs is a glorified terminal, with ability to draw different font sizes and decent image support.
Don’t make such a face, you know it’s not far from the truth.
Again, this may be a bit harsh, but I believe we need to admit things in order to move forward.</p>
<p>Speaking of terminals, Emacs can actually run in a terminal!
You can start it with <code>emacs -nw</code> and it will happily transform your terminal into Emacs.
I mean, you no longer have a terminal, it just acts as a rendering engine for Emacs.
So you basically get the same thing as GUI Emacs but worse, because now your terminal is responsible for rendering fonts, and you no longer have any image support.
Well, there are terminals that support images, but come on.</p>
<p>And I think terminal support is one of the things that holds Emacs back.
Think about it - why do you even need a terminal if you’re already using Emacs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to ssh somewhere to edit files or run some commands?
<ul>
<li>TRAMP got you covered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Need to run some commands in general?
<ul>
<li>You can call <code>async-shell-command</code>, it even can handle your input in case there’s a prompt;</li>
<li>Or you can run <code>compile</code>, and it will be much more interactive than the raw terminal output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Want to run some complex commands with editing convenience?
<ul>
<li>You can run <code>eshell</code>, and go nuts on scripting in Emacs Lisp and calling sh scripts from the Emacs shell;</li>
<li>Or you can run a proper terminal emulator from Emacs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I too previously was a terminal enjoyer before Emacs.
As I’ve mentioned, I was using Kakoune, and prior to that, I was a Vim user.
Now, with Emacs, I rarely open the terminal at all.
There’s simply no need to, as there are more comfortable ways of interacting with the shell.
So yeah, ditch the terminal version of Emacs, you’re ain’t gonna miss it.</p>
<p>Except, don’t.
Because the solution I’m going to propose doesn’t require anything to be ditched at all.
But before that, let’s talk XWidgets</p>
<h3 id="xwidgets">XWidgets</h3>
<p>When I was talking about the web, I’m sure some of you thought about XWidgets and Webkit support in Emacs.
Like, here, I’m running the already mentioned natto.dev inside my Emacs right now:</p>
<figure><img src="https://andreyor.st/2023-07-11-emacs-gui-library/emacs-1.png" width="580px">
</figure>

<p>So what gives?
And at work, I occasionally use Portal to navigate through nested data structures while debugging Clojure code:</p>
<figure><img src="https://andreyor.st/2023-07-11-emacs-gui-library/emacs-2.png" alt="Figure 5: (the code isn&amp;rsquo;t from work, just a hobby project)" width="580px"><figcaption>
            <p><span>Figure 5: </span>(the code isn’t from work, just a hobby project)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Again, what gives?
This looks like we can have interactive GUIs in Emacs, much like in GToolkit and Pharo.
However, there’s a catch.
There’s always a catch, and in the case of Emacs, it’s that the XWidget UIs are <em>foreign</em> to Emacs.</p>
<p>Here, foreign means that inside that <code>*xwidget-webkit: portal...*</code> buffer nothing you expect to work will actually work.
Remember how I mentioned that in Magit if you call <code>forward-sexp</code> it will try to do the right thing?
Well, here it can’t do anything, because this isn’t a buffer really.
It is an embedded widget that only looks like a buffer in the Emacs window, but it’s not.</p>
<p>There’s <em>no point</em> in calling <code>forward-sexp</code> because there’s literally no point in such a buffer.
You can’t use <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/avy" target="_blank">Avy</a> to jump to an element in such a buffer because there are no textual elements that Avy can look at.</p>
<p>Because of it, it is basically the same as if you’ve opened a separate web browser side by side with Emacs and used it to browse the web, or run Portal, and it would probably even work better.
Unfortunately, we can’t embed something like Webkit into Emacs and hope that it will solve our UI problems.
Or can we?</p>

<p>So here’s my idea.
I’m pretty sure it’s not new, but that’s not the point of this blog - it is merely a container for my thoughts, original or not.</p>
<p>What if, instead of embedding Webkit into Emacs, we turn this around?
Hear me out.</p>
<p>When I was talking about opening a browser side by side with Emacs two seconds ago, I should have mentioned that window managers, or WMs for short, are quite good at placing windows.
If you’re using some kind of a tiling manager, you know what I mean - you can leave window management to your window manager.
Kakoune, for instance, does exactly that - instead of creating its own windowing system, like Vim or Emacs, it leaves it out for things like TMUX or i3 to solve.
This, of course, has some problems too, but works well enough in general.</p>
<p>But I’m not saying that we should ditch windowing from Emacs and leave it to the WM, far from it.
I would rather ditch frames from Emacs if you ask me, but that’s another topic.</p>
<p>Look at this as if Emacs was embedded into your window manager, which is basically how it works.
You start your WM of choice<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, you launch Emacs, and as long as the Emacs window is focused, you live in Emacs.
All of your shortcuts work, and all of your navigation habits are there.</p>
<p>So what if we expand on this idea?
Instead of embedding Webkit, let’s embed Emacs in its current state as a UI widget.</p>
<h3 id="the-widget-library">The Widget Library</h3>
<p>What I’m thinking is, let’s take, say SDL2 (or maybe something like <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui" target="_blank">ImGui</a>), and create a library of widgets for Emacs.
We’ll then integrate Emacs into it as the runtime system behind it, much like in the case of Smalltalk, JavaFX+Clojure, and Web+JS, and provide a set of functions to navigate through widgets in a meaningful way.
The widgets would include basic stuff, like buttons, text boxes, buffers, drawers, menus… wait, buffers?</p>
<p>Yes, why ditch something that works well?
Like when you focus Emacs in your WM and it just works, when the buffer widget is in focus it will just work too!
We can keep the redisplay code, it will just need to learn how to render into such widgets, which I’m sure is possible, as there’s a very similar feature in Emacs already, called child-frames.</p>
<p>With enough widgets, one will be able to build GUI, much like in GToolkit, but with Emacs Lisp, and we’ll still have all the legacy textual interface working, e.g. things like Magit don’t have to throw everything out of the window and adapt - they can continue to work.
We just need to be sure to provide enough extensibility, and a way to implement custom widgets, much like Emacs allows right now with its text properties, overlays, and such.
Then new plugins for the GUI toolkit will arrive, making Emacs even more extensible than before.</p>
<p>Now, imagine, you open Emacs and it creates a window that is basically like a desktop of your operating system.
You open a window, and it’s a real window, floating on that desktop.
Don’t like it?
Just maximize it, the window widget will work similarly to how windows are created in Emacs right now.
Except it doesn’t have to be a window displaying a buffer and nothing else - it can display other widgets, some of which are buffers.</p>
<p>Frames become virtual desktops, which they really are, it’s just that they’re represented as WM windows because Emacs didn’t include ways of switching them virtually (it did in the terminal mode actually).
You can still open a separate “frame” with a given virtual desktop, so again, everything would work as you’d expect.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-emacs">The future of Emacs</h2>
<p>…probably isn’t what I’m describing here.
I don’t know.
I’m just fantasizing, but the image of such a system I see behind my eyelids is great.</p>
<p>I <em>depend</em> on Emacs, it is my main tool for the job, this blog, my other hobbies, and other activities, so I want this system to evolve.
This is just a route I think it could take.
Again, maybe nothing of this makes any sense to you, but I encourage you to try out at least the GToolkit, I think it is the most interesting things I saw in the last years.
Pharo can be a bit less exciting but it laid the foundation for GT, and I think that’s says something.
If it wasn’t for Clojure, and maybe this blog which I do in Org-mode, and if I never used Emacs I would probably try GToolkit at some point, and maybe it would become my main tool, and I would probably look at Emacs as an inferior system.
Well, at least when it comes to GUI capabilities.
But I still love Emacs as it is, it fulfills my needs, and I can make it do what I want it to do, which is the main point.</p>
<p>This post was mostly a collection of random thoughts, hence the category, but I genuinely think that if a system like this can be created in Smalltalk or in the current state of the web, it is definitively possible in Emacs, there’s just not that much of an interest in it.
Well, actually there is, as I’ve mentioned, people trying to make emacs more beautiful and appealing, but I think we should not forget about utility too, and thus if someone is to develop a GUI toolkit for Emacs they need to put a lot of thought into it:</p>
<ul>
<li>What widgets to include;</li>
<li>How do you move from widget to widget in an efficient way;</li>
<li>What is best done with a mouse, and what should not be done with it;</li>
<li>What level of interactivity from Emacs Lisp we should get;</li>
<li>Other questions like this.</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, it will take a lot of planning, prototyping, maybe some competing systems to progress on this - let’s see where Emacs will go in the upcoming 30 years.
Maybe another XEmacs will happen, or it will be forced to evolve by something like <a href="https://project-mage.org/elevator" target="_blank">Project Mage</a> or <a href="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/" target="_blank">Nyxt</a>, or even another system, that would embrace GToolkit’s modal-less interface and infinite canvas.
The advent of virtual and/or augmented reality makes an interesting infinite-canvas type of interface candidate in my opinion, so maybe we’ll stop seeing flat screens in the future, who knows?</p>
<p>Anyway, let me know what you think.
If you have any thoughts you like to share, you can find my contacts on the <a href="https://andreyor.st/about">About</a> page.
Hope it was an interesting read!</p>

                <p>Dear NewPipe community and other beloved creatures,</p>

<p>You might have already noticed this: Searching “NewPipe” via Google will yield plenty information about the project, but a link to the official website is missing. This is because Google submitted to a DMCA takedown notice from a French record label, “Because Music”. The notice demands removing our homepage <a href="https://newpipe.net/">newpipe.net</a> from their search listings along with a set of other domains completely unrelated to our project. The DMCA takedown notice was published <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/34149383">in the Lumen database</a> by Google themselves.</p>

<p>While worse things could have happened as the result of such a takedown request, Google’s unlisting of our homepage creates a variety of problems. Given the fact that Google no longer counts visits to our site, it will lose relevance. As a result, websites for fake clones of NewPipe that mimic our homepage will tend to rank higher in the results. This could ultimately cause users to fall for such scams.</p>

<p>The team is currently discussing what to do about the situation. We are considering taking legal action. <strong>If you are a lawyer and have experience with this and would like to help us, please contact us via email (team(at)newpipe.net).</strong></p>

<p>Regards,
Schabi</p>

This is what the INP metric assesses.</p><p>Good responsiveness means that a page responds quickly to interactions made with it. When a page responds to an interaction, the result is <em>visual feedback</em>, which is presented by the browser in the next frame the browser presents. Visual feedback tells you if, for example, an item you add to an online shopping cart is indeed being added, whether a mobile navigation menu has opened, if a login form's contents are being authenticated by the server, and so forth.</p><p>Some interactions will naturally take longer than others, but for especially complex interactions, it's important to quickly present some initial visual feedback as a cue to the user that something is <em>happening</em>. The time until the next paint is the earliest opportunity to do this. Therefore, the intent of INP is not to measure all the eventual effects of the interaction (such as network fetches and UI updates from other asynchronous operations), but the time in which the <em>next</em> paint is being blocked. By delaying visual feedback, you may be giving users the impression that the page is not responding to their actions.</p><p>The goal of INP is to ensure the time from when a user initiates an interaction until the next frame is painted is as short as possible, for all or most interactions the user makes.</p><p>In the following video, the example on the right gives immediate visual feedback that an accordion is opening.

The final INP value is the longest interaction observed, ignoring outliers.</p><details><summary>A note on how INP is calculated</summary> <p>As stated above, INP is calculated by observing all the interactions made with a page. For most sites the interaction with the worst latency is reported as INP. However, for pages with large numbers of interactions, random hiccups can result in an unusually high interaction on an otherwise responsive site. The more interactions, the more likely this is to happen. To counter this, and give a better measure of the actual responsiveness for those types of pages, we ignore one highest interaction for every 50 interactions. The vast majority of page experiences do not have over 50 interactions so will report the worst interaction. The 75th percentile of all the page views is then reported as usual, which further removes outliers to give a value that the vast majority of users experience or better.</p></details><p>An <em>interaction</em> is a group of event handlers that fire during the same logical user gesture. For example, "tap" interactions on a touchscreen device include multiple events, such as <code>pointerup</code>, <code>pointerdown</code>, and <code>click</code>. An interaction can be driven by JavaScript, CSS, built-in browser controls (such as form elements), or a combination thereof.</p><p>An interaction's latency consists of the single longest <a href="https://w3c.github.io/event-timing/#ref-for-dom-performanceentry-duration%E2%91%A1:~:text=The%20Event%20Timing%20API%20exposes%20a%20duration%20value%2C%20which%20is%20meant%20to%20be%20the%20time%20from%20when%20user%20interaction%20occurs%20(estimated%20via%20the%20Event%27s%20timeStamp)%20to%20the%20next%20time%20the%20rendering%20of%20the%20Event%27s%20relevant%20global%20object%27s%20associated%20Document%E2%80%99s%20is%20updated" rel="noopener">duration</a> of a group of event handlers that drives the interaction, from the time the user begins the interaction to the moment the next frame is presented with visual feedback.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-good-inp-score">What is a good INP score? <a href="#what-is-a-good-inp-score">#</a></h3><p>Pinning labels such as "good" or "poor" on a responsiveness metric is difficult. On one hand, you want to encourage development practices that prioritize good responsiveness. On the other hand, you must account for the fact that there's considerable variability in the capabilities of devices people use to set achievable development expectations.</p><p>To ensure you're delivering user experiences with good responsiveness, a good threshold to measure is the <strong>75th percentile</strong> of page loads recorded in the field, segmented across mobile and desktop devices:</p><ul><li>An INP below or at <strong>200 milliseconds</strong> means that your page has <strong>good responsiveness</strong>.</li><li>An INP above <strong>200 milliseconds</strong> and below or at <strong>500 milliseconds</strong> means that your page's responsiveness <strong>needs improvement</strong>.</li><li>An INP above <strong>500 milliseconds</strong> means that your page has <strong>poor responsiveness</strong>.</li></ul><figure><svg style="enable-background:new 0 0 296.6 220.2" title="A diagram of the INP thresholds.

An input delay occurs until event handlers begin running, which may be caused by factors such as long tasks on the main thread. The interaction's event handlers then run, and a delay occurs before the next frame is presented.</figcaption></figure><p>The primary driver of interactivity is often JavaScript, though browsers do provide interactivity through controls <em>not</em> powered by JavaScript, such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and controls powered by CSS.</p><p>As far as INP goes, <strong>only the following interaction types are observed:</strong></p><ul><li>Clicking with a mouse.</li><li>Tapping on a device with a touchscreen.</li><li>Pressing a key on either a physical or onscreen keyboard.</li></ul><p>Interactions happen in the main document or in iframes embedded in the document—for example clicking play on an embedded video. End users will not be aware what is in an iframe or not. Therefore, INP within iframes are needed to measure the user experience for the top level page. Note JavaScript Web APIs will not have access to the iframe contents so may not be able to measure INP within an iframe and this will <a href="https://web.dev/crux-and-rum-differences/#iframes">show as a difference between CrUX and RUM</a>.</p><p>Interactions may consist of two parts, each with multiple events. For example, a keystroke consists of the <code>keydown</code>, <code>keypress</code>, and <code>keyup</code> events. Tap interactions contain <code>pointerup</code> and <code>pointerdown</code> events. The event with the longest duration within the interaction is chosen as the interaction's latency.</p><figure><img alt="A depiction of more complex interaction containing two interactions. The first is a mousedown event, which produces a frame before the mouse button is let up, which kicks off more work until yet another frame is presented as the result." decoding="async" height="164" loading="lazy" src="https://web-dev.imgix.net/image/jL3OLOhcWUQDnR4XjewLBx4e3PC3/vNosnKDYgBRnFmEvwm0c.svg" width="736"><figcaption>A depiction of an interaction with multiple event handlers. The first part of the interaction receives an input when the user clicks down on a mouse button. However, before they release the mouse button, a frame is presented. When the user releases the mouse button, another series of event handlers must run before the next frame is presented.</figcaption></figure><p>INP is calculated when the user leaves the page, resulting in a single value that is representative of the page's overall responsiveness throughout the entire page's lifecycle. <strong>A low INP means that a page is reliably responsive to user input.</strong></p><h3 id="how-is-inp-different-from-first-input-delay-fid">How is INP different from First Input Delay (FID)? <a href="#how-is-inp-different-from-first-input-delay-fid">#</a></h3><p>Where INP considers <em>all</em> page interactions, <a href="https://web.dev/fid/">First Input Delay (FID)</a> only accounts for the <em>first</em> interaction. It also only measures the first interaction's <em>input delay</em>, not the time it takes to run event handlers, or the delay in presenting the next frame.</p><p>Given that FID is also a <a href="https://web.dev/user-centric-performance-metrics/#types-of-metrics">load responsiveness metric</a>, the rationale behind it is that if the first interaction made with a page in the loading phase has little to no perceptible input delay, the page has made a good first impression.</p><p>INP is more than about first impressions. By sampling all interactions, responsiveness can be assessed comprehensively, making INP a more reliable indicator of overall responsiveness than FID.</p><h3 id="what-if-no-inp-value-is-reported">What if no INP value is reported? <a href="#what-if-no-inp-value-is-reported">#</a></h3><p>It's possible that a page can return no INP value. This can happen for a number of reasons:</p><ul><li>The page was loaded, but the user never clicked, tapped, or pressed a key on their keyboard.</li><li>The page was loaded, but the user interacted with the page using gestures that did not involve clicking, tapping, or using the keyboard. For example, scrolling or hovering over elements does not factor into how INP is calculated.</li><li>The page is being accessed by a bot such as a search crawler or headless browser that has not been scripted to interact with the page.</li></ul><h2 id="how-to-measure-inp">How to measure INP <a href="#how-to-measure-inp">#</a></h2><p>INP can be measured both in <a href="https://web.dev/lab-and-field-data-differences/#field-data">the field</a> and in <a href="https://web.dev/lab-and-field-data-differences/#lab-data">the lab</a> through a variety of tools.</p><h3 id="in-the-field">In the field <a href="#in-the-field">#</a></h3><p>Ideally, your journey in optimizing INP will start with field data. At its best, field data from Real User Monitoring (RUM) will give you not only a page's INP value, but also contextual data that highlights what specific interaction was responsible for the INP value itself, whether the interaction occurred during or after page load, the type of interaction (click, keypress, or tap), and other valuable information.</p><p>If your website qualifies for inclusion in the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/" rel="noopener">Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)</a>, you can quickly get field data for INP <a href="https://web.dev/find-slow-interactions-in-the-field/#get-field-data-quickly-with-crux">via CrUX in PageSpeed Insights</a> (and other Core Web Vitals). At a minimum, you can get an origin-level picture of your website's INP, but in some cases, you can also get page-level data as well.</p><p>However, while CrUX is useful to tell you that there <em>is</em> a problem at a high level, it often doesn't provide enough detail to help fully understand what the problem is. A RUM solution can help you drill down into more detail as to the pages, users or user interactions which are experiencing slow interactions. Being able to attribute INP to individual interactions avoids guesswork and wasted effort.</p><h3 id="in-the-lab">In the lab <a href="#in-the-lab">#</a></h3><p>Optimally, you'll want to start testing in the lab once you have field data that suggests you have slow interactions. In the absence of field data, however, there are some strategies for reproducing slow interactions in the lab. Such strategies include following common user flows and testing interactions along the way, as well as interacting with the page during load—when the main thread is often busiest—in order to surface slow interactions during that crucial part of the user experience.</p><h2 id="how-to-improve-inp">How to improve INP <a href="#how-to-improve-inp">#</a></h2><p>A <a href="https://web.dev/optimize-inp/">collection of guides on optimizing INP</a> is available to guide you through the process of identifying slow interactions in the field and using lab data to drill down and optimize them in a variety of ways.</p><h2 id="changelog">CHANGELOG <a href="#changelog">#</a></h2><p>Occasionally, bugs are discovered in the APIs used to measure metrics, and sometimes in the definitions of the metrics themselves.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A California judge is allowing Microsoft to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard after five days of grueling testimony. Microsoft still faces an ongoing antitrust case by the Federal Trade Commission, but Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley has listened to arguments from both the FTC and Microsoft and decided to deny the regulator’s request for a preliminary injunction.</p><p>In a ruling submitted today, Judge Corley said the following:</p><div><blockquote><p>Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been described as the largest in tech history. It deserves scrutiny. That scrutiny has paid off: Microsoft has committed in writing, in public, and in court to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years on parity with Xbox. It made an agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Switch. And it entered several agreements to for the first time bring Activision’s content to several cloud gaming services. This Court’s responsibility in this case is narrow. It is to decide if, notwithstanding these current circumstances, the merger should be halted—perhaps even terminated—pending resolution of the FTC administrative action. For the reasons explained, the Court finds the FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to <em>Call of Duty</em> and other Activision content. The motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore DENIED.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p>Judge Corley has clearly sided with Microsoft on its commitments to keep <em>Call of Duty</em> on PlayStation and even extend the game to Nintendo Switch. Despite the FTC challenging Microsoft’s cloud agreements, Judge Corley took them into consideration in her decision. The court ruling even agrees with Microsoft in theory about the Nintendo Switch being part of the console market, but also accepts the FTC can reasonably claim it’s not. Judge Corley has also agreed with the FTC that the console market does not include PCs.</p><p>In a statement following Judge Corley’s decision, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the company was “grateful to the Court in San Francisco for this quick and thorough decision and hope other jurisdictions will continue working towards a timely resolution.” Xbox head Phil Spencer, a key witness in the trial, also <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1678785930079944704">tweeted a reaction</a>. “We’re grateful to the court for swiftly deciding in our favor. The evidence showed the Activision Blizzard deal is good for the industry and the FTC’s claims about console switching, multi-game subscription services, and cloud don’t reflect the realities of the gaming market,” said Spencer.</p><p>Activision Blizzard has also reacted to the decision. “Our merger will benefit consumers and workers,” Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard’s CEO, said in a statement. “It will enable competition rather than allow entrenched market leaders to continue to dominate our rapidly growing industry.”<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>In a statement, FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar said the FTC was still planning its next move. “We are disappointed in this outcome given the clear threat this merger poses to open competition in cloud gaming, subscription services, and consoles. In the coming days we’ll be announcing our next step to continue our fight to preserve competition and protect consumers,” said Farrar.</p><p>The judge’s ruling now allows Microsoft to close its Activision Blizzard deal ahead of the July 18th deadline, but only if the company is willing to close around the UK or if the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is willing to negotiate some form of remedy. The UK regulator moved to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/26/23689252/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-blocked-uk-cma">block Microsoft’s proposed acquisition</a> in April, and Microsoft is currently appealing that decision with a hearing set to start on July 28th. </p><p><a href="https://mlexmarketinsight.com/news/insight/microsoft-is-exploring-options-to-close-activision-deal-despite-uk-block"><em>MLex&nbsp;</em>reported</a>&nbsp;last month that Microsoft was exploring options to close the deal despite the UK block, which, in part, spooked the FTC enough to request an injunction in the first place. The CMA also <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2023-06/2023.06.29_1590_Microsoft_Ruling_Adjournment_Final.pdf">filed to try and delay</a>&nbsp;Microsoft’s appeal of its Activision Blizzard acquisition decision, with a request right in the middle of the <em>FTC v. Microsoft</em> hearing. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) shut that request down, as it would have pushed the appeal process from July to October — “contrary to justice and fairness.”</p><p>Minutes after Judge Corley’s decision, both the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/11/23791149/microsoft-activision-blizzard-uk-regulators-cma-appeal">CMA and Microsoft have agreed to pause their legal battle in the UK</a> to negotiate how the Activision Blizzard deal could be modified to address the CMA’s cloud gaming concerns. The CAT will need to approve this pause, but it increasingly looks like all parties are willing to secure a remedy in the UK.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/15/23723703/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-approved-eu-european-commission">European regulators gave the deal the go-ahead</a>&nbsp;in May, so Microsoft could now technically close without the UK and without an injunction in the US preventing it. That’s a complicated scenario though, and it’s clear Microsoft and the CMA are both hoping to avoid that.</p><p>The FTC will now have the chance to appeal Judge Corley’s decision ahead of 11:59PM PT on July 14th, but the regulator didn’t appeal a court’s decision permitting Meta to acquire Within, so it may abandon its case against Microsoft and Activision Blizzard instead.</p><p>If the court order stands, this would be the second major loss for FTC Chair Lina Khan as the head of the regulator. Khan has been chasing Big Tech companies ever since she was confirmed as the head of the agency in 2021.</p><p><h3>Related:</h3></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>We're excited to share with you a new library called <strong>Keras Core</strong>,
a preview version of the future of Keras.
In Fall 2023, this library will become Keras 3.0.
Keras Core is a full rewrite of the Keras codebase that rebases it
on top of a <strong>modular backend architecture</strong>.
It makes it possible to run Keras workflows on top of arbitrary frameworks —
starting with TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch.</p>
<p>Keras Core is also a drop-in replacement for <code>tf.keras</code>,
with near-full backwards compatibility with <code>tf.keras</code> code
when using the TensorFlow backend.
In the vast majority of cases you can just start importing it via
<code>import keras_core as keras</code> in place of <code>from tensorflow import keras</code>
and your existing code will run with no issue —
and generally with slightly improved performance, thanks to XLA compilation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why we're making Keras multi-backend again</h2>
<p>Keras Core is a big return to our multi-backend roots. Not so long ago,
Keras could run on top of Theano, TensorFlow, and CNTK (even MXNet!).
In 2018, we made the decision to refocus Keras development exclusively
on TensorFlow. At the time, TensorFlow was the only viable option
available: Theano and CNTK had discontinued development.
The added cost of supporting multiple backends was simply no longer worth it.</p>
<p>But in 2023, this is no longer true. According to large-scale developer surveys
such as the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/">2023 StackOverflow Developer Survey</a> and the
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2022">2022 Kaggle Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Survey</a>
(as well as other adoption metrics such as PyPI downloads, Conda downloads,
and Colab import statistics, which all paint the same picture),
TensorFlow has between 55% and 60% market share and is the top choice for
production ML, while PyTorch has between 40% and 45% market share and is
the top choice for ML research.
At the same time, JAX, while having a much smaller market share,
has been embraced by top players in generative AI such as
<a href="https://github.com/deepmind">Google DeepMind</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/midjourney">Midjourney</a>,
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/accelerating-language-model-training-with-cohere-and-google-cloud-tpus">Cohere</a>,
and more.</p>
<p>We believe each of these frameworks provides important value for different
use cases — and what we've created lets you tap into all three at once.
With a new multi-backend Keras,
we hope to make the lives of ML developers easier by fostering an inclusive,
cross-framework deep learning ecosystem. Say goodbye to framework silos,
and say hello to the new world of multi-framework ML!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why use Keras Core?</h2>
<p>You're already familiar with the benefits of using Keras — it enables
high-velocity development via an obsessive focus on great UX, API design,
and debuggability. It's also a battle-tested framework that has been chosen
by over 2.5M developers and that powers some of the most sophisticated
and largest-scale ML systems in the world,
such as the Waymo self-driving fleet or the YouTube recommendation engine.
But what are the additional benefits of using the new multi-backend Keras Core?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always get the best performance for your models.</strong> In our benchmarks,
we found that JAX typically delivers the best training and inference performance
on GPU, TPU, and CPU — but results vary from model to model, as non-XLA
TensorFlow is occasionally faster on GPU. The ability to dynamically select
the backend that will deliver the best performance for your model
<em>without having to change anything to your code</em> means you're always guaranteed
to train and serve with the highest achievable efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Maximize available ecosystem surface for your models.</strong> Any Keras Core
model can be instantiated as a PyTorch <code>Module</code>, can be exported as a TensorFlow
<code>SavedModel</code>, or can be instantiated as a stateless JAX function. That means
that you can use your Keras Core models with PyTorch ecosystem packages,
with the full range of TensorFlow deployment &amp; production tools
(like TF-Serving, TF.js and TFLite), and with JAX large-scale
TPU training infrastructure. Write one <code>model.py</code> using
Keras Core APIs, and get access to everything the ML world has to offer.</li>
<li><strong>Maximize distribution for your open-source model releases.</strong> Want to
release a pretrained model? Want as many people as possible
to be able to use it? If you implement it in pure TensorFlow or PyTorch,
it will be usable by roughly half of the market.
If you implement it in Keras Core, it is instantly usable by anyone regardless
of their framework of choice (even if they're not Keras users themselves).
Twice the impact at no added development cost.</li>
<li><strong>Use data pipelines from any source.</strong> The Keras Core
<code>fit()</code>/<code>evaluate()</code>/<code>predict()</code> routines are compatible with <code>tf.data.Dataset</code> objects,
with PyTorch <code>DataLoader</code> objects, with NumPy arrays, Pandas dataframes —
regardless of the backend you're using. You can train a Keras Core + TensorFlow
model on a PyTorch <code>DataLoader</code> or train a Keras Core + PyTorch model on a
<code>tf.data.Dataset</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Main features of Keras Core</h2>
<p>Let's look at some of what's included in the preview release.</p>
<h3>The full Keras API, available for TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch</h3>
<p>To start with, Keras Core implements the full Keras API and makes it available
with TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch — over a hundred layers, dozens of metrics,
loss functions, optimizers, and callbacks, the Keras training and evaluation
loops, and the Keras saving &amp; serialization infrastructure. All the APIs you
know and love are here.</p>
<p>Any Keras model that only uses built-in layers will immediately work with
all supported backends. In fact, your existing <code>tf.keras</code> models
that only use built-in layers can start running in JAX and PyTorch <em>right away</em>
when you change your <code>keras</code> import to point to <code>keras_core</code>!
That's right, your codebase just gained a whole new set of capabilities.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/keras.io/img/keras-core/multibackend_workflow.jpg"></p>
<h3>A cross-framework low-level language for deep learning</h3>
<p>Keras Core enables you to create components
(like arbitrary custom layers or pretrained models) that will work the same
in any framework. In particular, Keras Core gives you access
to the <code>keras_core.ops</code> namespace that works across all backends. It contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A near-full implementation of the NumPy API.</strong>
Not something "NumPy-like" — just literally the
NumPy API, with the same functions and the same arguments.
You get <code>ops.matmul</code>, <code>ops.sum</code>, <code>ops.stack</code>, <code>ops.einsum</code>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>A set of neural network-specific functions</strong> that are absent from NumPy,
such as <code>ops.softmax</code>, <code>ops.binary_crossentropy</code>, <code>ops.conv</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you only use ops from <code>keras_core.ops</code>, your custom layers,
custom losses, custom metrics, and custom optimizers
<strong>will work with JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow — with the same code</strong>.
That means that you can maintain only one
component implementation (e.g. a single <code>model.py</code>
together with a single checkpoint file), and you can use it in all frameworks,
with the exact same numerics.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/keras.io/img/keras-core/custom_components.jpg"></p>
<h3>Seamless integration with native workflows in JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow</h3>
<p>Unlike old-school multi-backend Keras 1.0,
the Keras Core is not just intended for Keras-centric workflows
where you define a Keras model, a Keras optimizer, a Keras loss and metrics,
and you call <code>fit()</code>/<code>evaluate()</code>/<code>predict()</code>.
It's also meant to work seamlessly with low-level backend-native workflows:
you can take a Keras model (or any other component, such as a loss or metric)
and start using it in a JAX training loop, a TensorFlow training loop,
or a PyTorch training loop, or as part of a JAX or PyTorch model,
with zero friction. Keras Core provides exactly
the same degree of low-level implementation flexibility in JAX and PyTorch
as <code>tf.keras</code> previously did in TensorFlow.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a low-level JAX training loop to train a Keras model
using an <code>optax</code> optimizer, <code>jax.grad</code>, <code>jax.jit</code>, <code>jax.pmap</code>.</li>
<li>Write a low-level TensorFlow training loop to train a Keras model
using <code>tf.GradientTape</code> and <code>tf.distribute</code>.</li>
<li>Write a low-level PyTorch training loop to train a Keras model
using a <code>torch.optim</code> optimizer, a <code>torch</code> loss function,
and the <code>torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel</code> wrapper.</li>
<li>Use a Keras layer or model as part of a <code>torch.nn.Module</code>. This means
that PyTorch users can start leveraging Keras models whether or not
they use Keras APIs! You can treat a Keras model just like any other
PyTorch <code>Module</code>.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/keras.io/img/keras-core/custom_training_loops.jpg"></p>
<h3>Support for cross-framework data pipelines with all backends</h3>
<p>Multi-framework ML also means multi-framework data loading and preprocessing.
Keras Core models can be trained using a wide range of
data pipelines — regardless of whether you're using the JAX, PyTorch, or
TensorFlow backends. It just works.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tf.data.Dataset</code> pipelines: the reference for scalable production ML.</li>
<li><code>torch.utils.data.DataLoader</code> objects.</li>
<li>NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes.</li>
<li><code>keras_core.utils.PyDataset</code> objects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pretrained models</h3>
<p>What would a deep learning framework be without pretrained models?
Right from launch day, there's a wide range of pretrained models that
you can start using with Keras Core.</p>
<p>All 40 Keras Applications models (the <code>keras_core.applications</code> namespace)
are available in all backends
(minus one model that is architecturally incompatible with PyTorch
due to lack of support for asymmetric padding in average pooling).
The vast array of pretrained models in <a href="https://keras.io/api/keras_cv/">KerasCV</a>
and <a href="https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/">KerasNLP</a>
(e.g. BERT, T5, YOLOv8, Whisper, etc.) also work with all backends.</p>
<h3>Progressive disclosure of complexity</h3>
<p><em>Progressive disclosure of complexity</em> is the design principle at the heart
of the Keras API. Keras doesn't force you to follow
a single "true" way of building and training models. Instead, it enables
a wide range of different workflows, from the very high-level to the very
low-level, corresponding to different user profiles.</p>
<p>That means that you can start out with simple workflows — such as using
<code>Sequential</code> and <code>Functional</code> models and training them with <code>fit()</code> — and when
you need more flexibility, you can easily customize different components while
reusing most of your prior code. As your need become more specific,
you don't suddenly fall off a complexity cliff and you don't need to switch
to a different set of tools.</p>
<p>We've brought this principle to all of our backends. For instance,
you can customize what happens in your training loop while still
leveraging the power of <code>fit()</code>, without having to write your own training loop
from scratch — just by overriding the <code>train_step</code> method.</p>
<p>Here's how it works in PyTorch and TensorFlow:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/keras.io/img/keras-core/customizing_fit.jpg"></p>
<p>And <a href="http://keras.io/keras_core/guides/custom_train_step_in_jax/">here's the link</a> to the JAX version.</p>
<h3>A new stateless API for layers, models, metrics, and optimizers</h3>
<p>Are you a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> enjoyer?
You're in for a treat.</p>
<p>All stateful objects in Keras (i.e. objects that own numerical variables that
get updated during training or evaluation) now have a stateless API, making it
possible to use them in JAX functions (which are required to be fully stateless):</p>
<ul>
<li>All layers and models have a <code>stateless_call()</code> method which mirrors <code>__call__()</code>.</li>
<li>All optimizers have a <code>stateless_apply()</code> method which mirrors <code>apply()</code>.</li>
<li>All metrics have a <code>stateless_update_state()</code> method which mirrors <code>update_state()</code>
and a <code>stateless_result()</code> method which mirrors <code>result()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods have no side-effects whatsoever: they take as input the current value
of the state variables of the target object, and return the update values as part
of their outputs, e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>updated_non_trainable_variables</span> <span>=</span> <span>layer</span><span>.</span><span>stateless_call</span><span>(</span>
    <span>trainable_variables</span><span>,</span>
    <span>non_trainable_variables</span><span>,</span>
    <span>inputs</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You never have to implement these methods yourself: they're automatically available
as long as you've implemented the stateful version (e.g. <code>call()</code> or <code>update_state()</code>).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Give us your feedback!</h2>
<p>The purpose of this preview release is to let everyone try out the new
capabilities, spot issues, and help us make the software the best it can be
before the stable Keras 3.0 release this fall. So please send us your feedback!
Here are some things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to run your existing <code>tf.keras</code> codebase on top of Keras Core with the
TensorFlow backend, and report any issue you find. This will help us
guarantee full backwards compatibility.</li>
<li>Try to adapt your existing <code>tf.keras</code> models so they can run on top of
JAX and PyTorch in addition to TensorFlow. This involves replacing calls
to the TensorFlow API with calls the NumPy functions from <code>keras_core.ops</code>.
We're looking to offer a comprehensive guide to cover this conversion, and
you can help us write it!</li>
<li>Try to integrate Keras models into your existing JAX or PyTorch training or
serving infrastructure and let us know how it goes.</li>
<li>If you're a company with multi-framework workflows looking to adopt
Keras Core, and you'd like to chat about your use case,
reach out to fchollet@google.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy the library!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p>Keras Core is a beta release — you should expect to encounter issues.
Please let us know (via GitHub issues) about any issue you find so we can make
the library work better for you!</p>
<p>Here are known gotchas to watch out for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Import order.</strong> Due to a bug in PyTorch, importing <code>torch</code>
when <code>tensorflow</code> is already imported will cause
either a segfault crash of your Python runtime, or a deadlock.
In reverse, importing <code>tensorflow</code>
when <code>torch</code> is already imported is fine — so when importing both packages,
you should make sure
to import <code>torch</code> first, and then <code>tensorflow</code>.
Note that when using the <code>torch</code> backend, <code>keras_core</code>
imports <code>torch</code>, and thus <code>keras_core</code> should be imported before <code>tensorflow</code>
if you're importing both.</li>
<li><strong>Integer dtypes with PyTorch.</strong> The <code>torch</code> package has no support
for dtypes <code>uint16</code> and <code>uint32</code>. To maintain compatibility
with JAX and TensorFlow, using these dtypes with the <code>torch</code>
backend will fallback to <code>int32</code> and <code>int64</code> respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Average pooling with PyTorch.</strong> The <code>torch</code> package has no support
for asymmetric padding with pooling ops. As a result, when using average
pooling with <code>padding="same"</code>, you may see different results
(on the last row/column) compared to other backends.</li>
<li><strong>Using Keras layers or models in a <code>tf.data</code> pipeline.</strong> As long as you're
using the TensorFlow backend, you can <code>.map()</code> Keras layers and models in a
<code>tf.data</code> pipeline, but when using other backends, this is generally
not possible. We've special-cased preprocessing layers so that they can be
used in <code>tf.data</code> regardless of your choice of backend, but this doesn't
extend to non-preprocessing layers or to a <code>Sequential</code> models wrapping a
list of preprocessing layers.</li>
<li><strong>Image layout and performance considerations with PyTorch.</strong>
When using convnets, the typical image layout to use
is <code>"channels_last"</code> (aka NHWC), which is
the standard in cuDNN, TensorFlow, JAX, and others. However, PyTorch uses
<code>"channels_first"</code>. You can use any Keras Core convnet with any image
layout, and you can easily switch from one default layout to the other via
the <code>keras_core.config.set_image_data_format()</code> flag. Importantly, when using
PyTorch convnets in the <code>"channels_last"</code> format, Keras will have to
convert layouts back and forth at each layer, which is inefficient. For best
performance, remember to set your default layout to <code>"channels_first"</code> when
using convnets in PyTorch. In the future, we hope to resolve this issue by
by-passing <code>torch.nn</code> ops and going directly to cuDNN.</li>
<li><strong>Sparse NN support.</strong> Unlike in <code>tf.keras</code>, there is currently no
support for networks that operate on sparse types. We intend to add support
in the future for the TensorFlow backend, where it is feasible.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>Q: What is the relationship between Keras Core and Keras 3.0?</h3>
<p>Keras Core is a preview release of Keras 3.0.
Ultimately, the current Keras Core codebase will become Keras 3.0
and will be released as the <code>keras</code> pip package.</p>
<h3>Q: When will Keras 3.0 be released?</h3>
<p>We're targeting Fall 2023. As you will see when you try out Keras Core,
the library is already feature-complete and fairly mature,
so all we need is a few months of beta-testing
to iron out any possible issue and pilot large-scale production use cases.</p>
<p>We're currently starting production pilots at Google and other
Alphabet companies. If your company has an interesting production use case
and you'd like to work with us to pilot Keras Core, we can take a look at it
— please contact us.</p>
<h4>Q: Is Keras Core compatible with <code>tf.keras</code>?</h4>
<p>Code developed with <code>tf.keras</code> can generally be run as-is with Keras Core
(with the TensorFlow backend) simply by changing the Keras imports and making
sure your saving your models in the <code>.keras</code> format (as opposed to the
legacy Keras SavedModel or <code>.h5</code> formats).</p>
<p>When it comes to using APIs from <code>tf.keras</code> and Keras Core side by side,
that is <strong>not</strong> possible at this time.</p>
<p>However, when Keras 3.0 is released, Keras Core will <em>become</em> <code>tf.keras</code>
(in the sense that Keras Core will be distributed as the <code>keras</code> package on
PyPI and <code>tf.keras</code> will become a pointer to it). There will only
be one stable, production-ready version of Keras — today, that is <code>tf.keras</code>,
and soon that will be multi-backend Keras.</p>
<h3>Q: Do pretrained models developed in <code>tf.keras</code> work with Keras Core?</h3>
<p>Generally, yes. Any <code>tf.keras</code> model should work out of the box with Keras Core
with the TensorFlow backend (make sure to save it in the <code>.keras</code> v3 format).
In addition, if the model only
uses built-in Keras layers, then it will also work out of the box
with Keras Core with the JAX and PyTorch backends.</p>
<p>If the model contains custom layers written using TensorFlow APIs,
it is usually easy to convert the code to be backend-agnostic.
For instance, it only took us a few hours to convert all 40
<code>tf.keras</code> models from Keras Applications to be backend-agnostic.</p>
<h3>Q: Can I save a Keras Core model in one backend and reload it in another backend?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can. There is no backend specialization in saved <code>.keras</code> files whatsoever.
Your saved Keras models are framework-agnostic and can be reloaded with any backend.</p>
<p>However, note that reloading a model that contains custom components
with a different backend requires your custom components to be implemented
using backend-agnostic APIs, e.g. <code>keras.ops</code>.</p>
<h3>Q: Does Keras add extra overhead in eager mode?</h3>
<p>In eager mode, yes — a very small amount, quantified below. In compiled
mode, virtually none.</p>
<p>Keras Layers and Keras Functional and Sequential models do more than
just piping data through to cuDNN.
They run a variety of input validation checks, standardization operations,
and so on, which improve
your development and debugging experience, but which add a small time cost
to every training and inference step when running eagerly.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a simple model (e.g. a classification model with 3 layers implemented
in the Sequential or Functional API)
Keras eager overhead per step is about 150μs, on a typical CPU.</li>
<li>For a model with 50 layer blocks with 10 layers per block
(which is roughly the format of current SotA LLMs),
or 500 layers in total, the eager overhead per step of a
Functional Keras model is about 20ms.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if your training step time is ~500ms (which is on the lower end of
what's needed to keep your device utilized),
then Keras eager overhead would represent 5% of your total step time.
If you care about a 5% difference, then you
should definitely not be running eagerly — you should be compiling your model,
which will typically bring much larger performance benefits than just 5%.</p>
<p>By comparison, a compiled Keras model only has about 10μs of dispatch
overhead — in total, regardless of model size.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we recommend using eager mode to debug your code,
then switching to compilation for any real training or inference run.
This workflow works the same in TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch.</p>
<h3>Q: Why does using Keras Core with PyTorch or JAX still requires TensorFlow?</h3>
<p>Right now, we use <code>tf.nest</code> (a Python data structure processing utility)
extensively across the codebase, which requires the TensorFlow package.
In the near future, we intend to turn <code>tf.nest</code> into a standalone
package, so that you could use Keras Core without installing TensorFlow.</p>
<h3>Q: Can I use Keras Core components inside <code>tf.data</code> pipelines?</h3>
<p>With the TensorFlow backend, Keras Core is fully compatible with <code>tf.data</code>
(e.g. you can <code>.map()</code> a <code>Sequential</code> model into a <code>tf.data</code> pipeline).</p>
<p>With a different backend, Keras Core has limited support for <code>tf.data</code>.
You won't be able to <code>.map()</code> arbitrary layers or models into a <code>tf.data</code>
pipeline. However, you will be able to use specific Keras Core
preprocessing layers with <code>tf.data</code>, such as <code>IntegerLookup</code> or
<code>CategoryEncoding</code>.</p>
<p>When it comes to using a <code>tf.data</code> pipeline (that does not use Keras)
to feed your call to <code>.fit()</code>, <code>.evaluate()</code> or <code>.predict()</code> —
that works out of the box with all backends.</p>
<h3>Q: Do Keras Core models behave the same when run with different backends?</h3>
<p>Yes, numerics are identical across backends.
However, keep in mind the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>RNG behavior is different across different backends
(even after seeding — your results will be deterministic in each backend
but will differ across backends). So random weight initializations
values and dropout values will differ across backends.</li>
<li>Due to the nature of floating-point implementations,
results are only identical up to 1e-7 precision in float32,
per function execution. So when training a model for a long time,
small numerical differences will accumulate and may end up resulting
in noticeable numerical differences.</li>
<li>Due to lack of support for average pooling with asymmetric padding
in PyTorch, average pooling layers with <code>padding="same"</code>
may result in different numerics on border rows/columns.
This doesn't happen very often in practice —
out of 40 Keras Applications vision models, only one was affected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Q: Does Keras Core support distributed training?</h3>
<p>Data-parallel distribution is supported out of the box in TensorFlow
and PyTorch.</p>
<p>Keras Core is compatible with <code>tf.distribute</code> —
just open a Distribution Strategy scope and create / train your model within it.
<a href="http://keras.io/keras_core/guides/distributed_training_with_tensorflow/">Here's an example</a>.</p>
<p>Keras Core is also compatible with PyTorch's <code>DistributedDataParallel</code> utility.
<a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras-core/blob/main/examples/demo_torch_multi_gpu.py">Here's an example</a>.</p>
<p>In JAX, you should distribute training yourself via JAX APIs such as
<code>jax.sharding</code>. <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras-core/blob/main/examples/demo_jax_distributed.py">Here's an example</a>.</p>
<h3>Q: Will you add more backends in the future? What about framework XYZ?</h3>
<p>We're open to adding new backends as long as the target framework has a large user base
or otherwise has some unique technical benefits to bring to the table.
However, adding and maintaining a new backend is a large burden,
so we're going to carefully consider each new backend candidate on a case by case basis,
and we're not likely to add many new backends. We will not add any new frameworks
that aren't yet well-established.
At this time, we have no immediate plans for additional backends.</p>
