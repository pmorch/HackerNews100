<p>Ural Airlines is preparing to fly an Airbus A320 out of the field in which it made an emergency landing last month. It will be the first time that any such recovery has been tried, yet many questions remain about how it ended up in the field to start with and whether the recovery operation can be successful.</p>

<p>Russian carrier <a href="https://simpleflying.com/tag/ural-airlines/">Ural Airlines </a>has confirmed its plans to attempt to fly a stranded<a href="https://simpleflying.com/tag/airbus-a320/"> Airbus A320</a> from the field in which it <a href="https://simpleflying.com/russian-airbus-a320-makes-forced-landing-in-a-field/">performed an emergency landing</a> on September 12, 2023. The airline has taken to its <a href="https://t.me/uralairlines_official/653" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram channel</a> this week to post various photos of preparatory work taking place on the plane, along with a comment that various options are available.</p>

<p>Ural Airlines has confirmed that tests carried out on the aircraft's two CFM International CFM56 engines had shown that they "<em>will not require refurbishment</em>." The carrier also stated that following its unconventional landing location, the engine flow section has been "<em>cleared of soil and straw, which was confirmed by repeated inspection</em>."</p>

<p>Ural Airlines has previously indicated that removal/recovery of the aircraft from the field could take several months (possibly until the ground freezes during the coming winter months). That work is already underway to temporarily store the narrowbody twinjet in its current location.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-there-an-a320-in-a-field"> Why is there an A320 in a field? </h2>
<p>The 17-year-old Ural Airlines A320 with registration RA-73805 was operating flight U6 1383, a domestic flight from Sochi (AER) to Omsk (OMS), Russia, when it suffered a reported hydraulic failure on the approach to its final destination. The flight had 165 passengers and crew onboard.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":1044} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":0} -->
<p>Following the execution of a missed approach, or 'go around,' the crew climbed the aircraft back up to 18,000ft and subsequently elected to divert to Novosibirsk Airport (OVB), which has a longer runway that would facilitate a landing possibly without the use of brakes and spoilers, among other systems.</p>

<p>The crew's initial calculations indicated that the aircraft would have had enough fuel to reach the alternative airport. However, with the crew being unable to retract the main landing gear doors due to the hydraulic failure this increased the fuel consumption during the diversion, an issue exacerbated by stronger-than-predicted headwinds during the flight.</p>

<p>After realizing they could not make it to Novosibirsk, the crew landed in the wheat field with the landing gear extended. The location is reportedly on the outskirts of Kamenka, a rural village about 180 km (110 mi) from Novosibirsk.</p>

<h2 id="possibly-wider-issues-involved"> Possibly wider issues involved </h2>
<p>It has been widely speculated that the incident occurred due to Russian airlines having difficulty sourcing spares for their civil aircraft due to Western sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, Ural Airlines has denied facing such an issue or using any non-certified spare parts to keep its fleet in the air.</p>

<p>A similar incident occurred in August 2019 when another Ural Airlines-operated aircraft <a href="https://simpleflying.com/ural-a321-birdstrike-cornfield/">landed in a cornfield near Moscow</a>. The Airbus A321 involved in that incident suffered a dual-engine failure following a bird strike. In that case, the aircraft sustained substantial damage and was eventually disassembled in the field where it landed.</p>

<p>Thankfully, all passengers and crew survived, and the captain was considered a hero. However, like the more recent incident, experts suggested that the pilots could have handled the situation differently and that, in both cases, better decision-making at crucial points in both flights could have avoided the off-airport landings.</p>

                <figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/DNS-Incident-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>On 4 October 2023, Cloudflare experienced DNS resolution problems starting at 07:00 UTC and ending at 11:00 UTC. Some users of 1.1.1.1 or products like WARP, Zero Trust, or third party DNS resolvers which use 1.1.1.1 may have received SERVFAIL DNS responses to valid queries. We’re very sorry for this outage. This outage was an internal software error and not the result of an attack. In this blog, we’re going to talk about what the failure was, why it occurred, and what we’re doing to make sure this doesn’t happen again. </p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>In the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">Domain Name System (DNS)</a>, every domain name exists within a DNS zone. The zone is a collection of domain names and host names that are controlled together. For example, Cloudflare is responsible for the domain name cloudflare.com, which we say is in the “cloudflare.com” zone. The .com top-level domain (TLD) is owned by a third party and is in the “com” zone. It gives directions on how to reach cloudflare.com. Above all of the TLDs is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone">the root zone</a>, which gives <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db">directions on how to reach TLDs</a>. This means that the root zone is important in being able to resolve all other domain names. Like other important parts of the DNS, <a href="https://www.iana.org/dnssec/procedures">the root zone is signed with DNSSEC</a>, which means the root zone itself contains cryptographic signatures.</p><p>The root zone is published on <a href="https://root-servers.org/">the root servers</a>, but it is also common for DNS operators to <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8806">retrieve and retain a copy of the root zone automatically</a> so that in the event that the root servers cannot be reached, the information in the root zone is still available. Cloudflare’s recursive DNS infrastructure takes this approach as it also makes the resolution process faster. New versions of the root zone are normally published twice a day. 1.1.1.1 has a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/">WebAssembly app</a> called static_zone running on top of the main DNS logic that serves those new versions when they are available.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image2-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="951" height="604"></figure><h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2><p>On 21 September, as part of <a href="https://blog.verisign.com/security/root-zone-zonemd/">a known and planned change in root zone management</a>, a new resource record type was included in the root zones for the first time. The new resource record is named <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8976.html">ZONEMD</a>, and is in effect a checksum for the contents of the root zone.</p><p>The root zone is retrieved by software running in Cloudflare’s core network. It is subsequently redistributed to Cloudflare’s data centers around the world. After the change, the root zone containing the ZONEMD record continued to be retrieved and distributed as normal. However, the 1.1.1.1 resolver systems that make use of that data had problems parsing the ZONEMD record. Because zones must be loaded and served in their entirety, the system’s failure to parse ZONEMD meant the new versions of the root zone were not used in Cloudflare’s resolver systems. Some of the servers hosting Cloudflare's resolver infrastructure failed over to querying the DNS root servers directly on a request-by-request basis when they did not receive the new root zone. However, others continued to rely on the known working version of the root zone still available in their memory cache, which was the version pulled on 21 September before the change.</p><p>On 4 October 2023 at 07:00 UTC, the DNSSEC signatures in the version of the root zone from 21 September expired. Because there was no newer version that the Cloudflare resolver systems were able to use, some of Cloudflare’s resolver systems stopped being able to validate DNSSEC signatures and as a result started sending error responses (SERVFAIL). The rate at which Cloudflare resolvers generated SERVFAIL responses grew by 12%. The diagrams below illustrate the progression of the failure and how it became visible to users.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image3-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1337" height="1999"></figure><h2 id="incident-timeline-and-impact">Incident timeline and impact</h2><p><strong>21 September 6:30 UTC</strong>: Last successful pull of the root zone.<br><strong>4 October 7:00 UTC</strong>: DNSSEC signatures in the root zone obtained on 21 September expired causing an increase in SERVFAIL responses to client queries.<br><strong>7:57</strong>: First external reports of unexpected SERVFAILs started coming in.<br><strong>8:03</strong>: Internal Cloudflare incident declared.<br><strong>8:50</strong>: Initial attempt made at stopping 1.1.1.1 from serving responses using the stale root zone file with an override rule.<br><strong>10:30</strong>: Stopped 1.1.1.1 from preloading the root zone file entirely.<br><strong>10:32</strong>: Responses returned to normal.<br><strong>11:02</strong>: Incident closed.</p><p>This below chart shows the timeline of impact along with the percentage of DNS queries that returned with a SERVFAIL error:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image1-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1431" height="414"></figure><p>We expect a baseline volume of SERVFAIL errors for regular traffic during normal operation. Usually that percentage sits at around 3%. These SERVFAILs can be caused by legitimate issues in the DNSSEC chain, failures to connect to authoritative servers, authoritative servers taking too long to respond, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unwrap-the-servfail/">and many others</a>. During the incident the amount of SERVFAILs peaked at 15% of total queries, although the impact was not evenly distributed around the world and was mainly concentrated in our larger data centers like Ashburn, Virginia; Frankfurt, Germany; and Singapore.</p><h2 id="why-this-incident-happened">Why this incident happened</h2><h4 id="why-parsing-the-zonemd-record-failed">Why parsing the ZONEMD record failed</h4><p>DNS has a binary format for storing resource records. In this binary format the type of the resource record (TYPE) &nbsp;is stored as a 16-bit integer. The type of resource record determines how the resource data (RDATA) is parsed. When the record type is 1, this means it is an A record, and the RDATA can be parsed as an IPv4 address. Record type 28 is an AAAA record, whose RDATA can be parsed as an IPv6 address instead. When a parser runs into an unknown resource type it won’t know how to parse its RDATA, but fortunately it doesn’t have to: the RDLENGTH field indicates how long the RDATA field is, allowing the parser to treat it as an opaque data element.</p><figure><pre><code>                                   1  1  1  1  1  1

</code></pre><figcaption><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC 1035</a></figcaption></figure><p>The reason static_zone didn’t support the new ZONEMD record is because up until now we had chosen to distribute the root zone internally in its presentation format, rather than in the binary format.

</code></pre><figcaption>Example records taken from <a href="https://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone">https://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone</a></figcaption></figure><p>When we run into an unknown resource record it’s not always easy to know how to handle it. Because of this, the library we use to parse the root zone at the edge does not make an attempt at doing so, and instead returns a parser error.</p><h3 id="why-a-stale-version-of-the-root-zone-was-used">Why a stale version of the root zone was used</h3><p>The static_zone app, tasked with loading and parsing the root zone for the purpose of serving the root zone locally (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7706">RFC 7706</a>), stores the latest version in memory. When a new version is published it parses it and, when successfully done so, drops the old version. However, as parsing failed the static_zone app never switched to a newer version, and instead continued using the old version indefinitely. When the 1.1.1.1 service is first started the static_zone app does not have an existing version in memory. When it tries to parse the root zone it fails in doing so, but because it does not have an older version of the root zone to fall back on, it falls back on querying the root servers directly for incoming requests.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1999" height="1417"></figure><h3 id="why-the-initial-attempt-at-disabling-staticzone-didn%E2%80%99t-work">Why the initial attempt at disabling static_zone didn’t work</h3><p>Initially we tried to disable the static_zone app through override rules, a mechanism that allows us to programmatically change some behavior of 1.1.1.1. The rule we deployed was:</p><pre><code>phase = pre-cache set-tag rec_disable_static
</code></pre><p>For any incoming request this rule adds the tag rec_disable_static to the request. Inside the static_zone app we check for this tag and, if it’s set, we do not return a response from the cached, static root zone. However, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/">to improve cache performance</a> queries are sometimes forwarded to another node if the current node can’t find the response in its own cache. Unfortunately, the rec_disable_static tag is not included in the queries being forwarded to other nodes, which caused the static_zone app to continue replying with stale information until we eventually disabled the app entirely.</p><h3 id="why-the-impact-was-partial">Why the impact was partial</h3><p>Cloudflare regularly performs rolling reboots of the servers that host our services for tasks like kernel updates that can only take effect after a full system restart. At the time of this outage, resolver server instances that were restarted between the ZONEMD change and the DNSSEC invalidation did not contribute to impact. If they had restarted during this two-week period, they would have failed to load the root zone on startup and fallen back to resolving by sending DNS queries to root servers instead. In addition, the resolver uses a technique called serve stale (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8767">RFC 8767</a>) with the purpose of being able to continue to serve popular records from a potentially stale cache to limit the impact. A record is considered to be stale once the TTL amount of seconds has passed since the record was retrieved from upstream. &nbsp;This prevented a total outage; impact was mainly felt in our largest data centers which had many servers that had not restarted the 1.1.1.1 service in that timeframe.</p><p>This incident had widespread impact, and we take the availability of our services very seriously. We have identified several areas of improvement and will continue to work on uncovering any other gaps that could cause a recurrence.</p><p>Here is what we are working on immediately:</p><p><strong>Visibility</strong>: We’re adding alerts to notify when static_zone serves a stale root zone file. It should not have been the case that serving a stale root zone file went unnoticed for as long as it did. If we had been monitoring this better, with the caching that exists, there would have been no impact. It is our goal to protect our customers and their users from upstream changes.</p><p><strong>Resilience:</strong> We will re-evaluate how we ingest and distribute the root zone internally. Our ingestion and distribution pipelines should handle new RRTYPEs seamlessly, and any brief interruption to the pipeline should be invisible to end users.</p><p><strong>Testing:</strong> Despite having tests in place around this problem, including tests related to unreleased changes in parsing the new ZONEMD records, we did not adequately test what happens when the root zone fails to parse. We will improve our test coverage and the related processes.</p><p><strong>Architecture</strong>: We should not use stale copies of the root zone past a certain point. While it’s certainly possible to continue to use stale root zone data for a limited amount of time, past a certain point there are unacceptable operational risks. We will take measures to ensure that the lifetime of cached root zone data is better managed as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8806">RFC 8806: Running a Root Server Local to a Resolver</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>We are deeply sorry that this incident happened. There is one clear message from this incident: do not ever assume that something is not going to change! &nbsp;Many modern systems are built with a long chain of libraries that are pulled into the final executable, each one of those may have bugs or may not be updated early enough for programs to operate correctly when changes in input happen. We understand how important it is to have good testing in place that allows detection of regressions and systems and components that fail gracefully on changes to input. We understand that we need to always assume that “format” changes in the most critical systems of the internet (DNS and BGP) are going to have an impact.</p><p>We have a lot to follow up on internally and are working around the clock to make sure something like this does not happen again.</p>

<li><code>SC2EventIterator</code> collects both TrackerEvents and GameEvents. Events are provided as they appear, be them Tracker or Game</li>

<p dir="auto">The iterators returns a tuple <code>(SC2EventType, UnitChangeHint)</code>
The first item contains the event itself as it was deserialized from the SC2Replay.
The second item hints the consumers of the iterator about the changes performed to the state machine due to this event.
For example, units may have been deleted, added, changed position, etc.</p>

<p dir="auto">In the arrow file generation, sha256 digest is used to detect duplication/etc.
This inflates the size of the rows. Even tho it's slightly less than long directory names.
Perhaps using short rev-parse for sha256 may be better, find something like 7-characters unique combinations
And use that instead of the long sha256 form.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-version-compatibility" dir="auto"><a href="#version-compatibility">version compatibility.</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">After a bit of testing, it seems most of the types are compatible between versions, so only when they differ would they make part of the protocol version.
Since I started this exercise on protocol87702, all types would be relative to it. That is, most modules would re-use protocol87702 as much as possible.
This explains why old-er versions such as 75689 would still reference 87702 as much as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">The generator above thus would show example code <code>S2ProtoResult</code> created in favour of unwrapping/panic'ing.</p>

<p dir="auto">The rust code for the protocols versions available were generated using:
This would now be compared with ./src/versions/protocol99999.template file and from there we can analyze what has changed.
Notably, the number of bits used for the Chat Message is still miscalculated to 3 so it needs to be dismissed.</p>

as a separate company: <a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa.ai</a>.
Vespa began as a project to solve Yahoo’s use cases in search, recommendation, and ad serving. 
Since we open-sourced it in 2017, it has grown to become the platform of choice for 
applying AI to big data sets at serving time.</p>

<p>Those working with large language models such as ChatGPT and vector databases turn to Vespa when 
they realize that creating quality solutions that scale involves much more than just looking up vectors. 
Enterprises with experience with search or recommender systems come to Vespa for the AI-first approach 
and unrivaled operability at scale.</p>

<p>Even with the support built into the Vespa platform, running highly available stateful systems in 
production with excellence is challenging. We’ve seen this play out in Yahoo, which is running 
about 150 Vespa applications. To address the scalability needs, we created a centralized cloud service 
to host these systems, and in doing so, we freed up the time of up to 200 full-time employees and reduced 
the number of machines used by 90% while greatly improving quality, stability, and security.</p>

<p>Our cloud service is already available at <a href="https://cloud.vespa.ai/">cloud.vespa.ai</a>, 
helping people with everything from running quick Vespa experiments, to serving 
business-critical applications. In total we serve over 800.000 queries per second.</p>

<p>While we’re separating Vespa from Yahoo, we’re not ending our relationship. Yahoo will own a<br>
stake in the new company and will be one of Vespa’s biggest customers for a long time to come. 
Vespa will continue to serve Yahoo’s personalized content, search and run new use cases leveraging 
large language models to provide new personalized experiences, something that can only be done 
at scale with Vespa.</p>

<p>Creating a company around Vespa will enable us to bring these advantages to the rest of the world 
on a massive scale, allowing us to bring the efficiencies of our cloud service to enterprises 
already relying on Vespa, as well as help more companies solve problems involving AI and big data online. 
It will also let us accelerate development of new features to empower Vespa users to create even 
better solutions, faster and at lower cost, whether deploying on our cloud service or sticking with 
the open-source distribution. For, while Vespa offers features and scalability far beyond any 
comparable technology thanks to our decades-long focus on combining AI and big data online, 
there is so much more to do. As the world is starting to leverage modern AI to solve 
real business problems online, the need for a platform that provides a solid foundation 
for these solutions has never been stronger. As engineers, we admit this is the part that excites us the most.</p>

<p>We look forward to empowering all of you to create online AI applications ever better and faster, 
and we hope you do too!</p>

Wireless charging and being able to use phone as a navigator was a tempting option. However, when I also had my amateur radio handheld tranceiver inside with me monitoring the local frequencies I noticed the scan stopping on 2m band (145 MHz) and awful noise was getting through the squelch. This radio interference was also present on the aviation frequencies (around 124 MHz). We can assume this is a problem for every VHF radio user.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:596342,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Apple's wireless Magsafe charger mounted on RAM Mounts cradle specifically made for this charger.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Apple's wireless Magsafe charger mounted on RAM Mounts cradle specifically made for this charger." title="Apple's wireless Magsafe charger mounted on RAM Mounts cradle specifically made for this charger." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277a5457-2087-4a70-97e1-fe6e2198ce83_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The offending device causing major radio frequency interference</figcaption></figure></div><p>The wireless charging (Apple’s Magsafe as well as other chargers implementing Qi charger specification) works with radio frequency to produce magnetic field.

<p><strong>International criminals used Estonia’s deficient cryptocurrency regulation to turn the small country into a hub of financial crime where over a billion euros have been laundered or defrauded from victims. Now the same actors are relocating to other countries who repeat all the same mistakes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Over the last 5 years Estonia became a global hotspot for crypto companies: </span><span>as of mid-2021, nearly 55% of all virtual currency service providers in the world were registered in Estonia.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Estonia’s liberal crypto licensing system enabled such companies – often with non-resident owners and clients – to promote themselves as EU-licensed financial services.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>VSquare and partners analysed close to 300 crypto companies and discovered dozens of cases of massive fraud, money laundering, sanctions evasion and illicit financing of criminal enterprises and paramilitary organizations.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>VSquare and partners identified multiple cases where the anti-money laundering (AML) officers and managers of crypto companies were clearly inadequate and underprepared for the work and in dire financial situations: taxi drivers, a welder and a person living on social benefits were responsible for dozens of crypto firms.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>When the Estonian state began tightening the regulation and stripping companies of their licenses, many of them moved to new countries in Europe, such as Lithuania. This shows that fixing the system in one country doesn’t change much at all.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>“Usually I was just a shell; I didn’t work with the transactions. I didn’t know what kind of millions went through there,” says Sergei Bezrodny, an unemployed plumber from the Estonian town of Tartu. His public LinkedIn profile claims he has almost 20 years of experience in finance and banking, but Bezrodny is surprised to learn about it and says it is a “mistake”.</p>
<p>And yet, Bezrodny is a former director of 24 international cryptocurrency firms.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to talk about it really. It was a while ago in the past and I had enough problems with that,” he says.</p>
<p>He now claims to be unemployed as his career in Estonia’s finance sector was cut short after banks started to close his accounts because of fear of money laundering.</p>
<p>“I had to open all my accounts in Lithuania,” the unemployed plumber explains.</p>
<p>“Now I just sit at home.”</p>
<p>The “virtual assets” licensing system established in 2017, which the Estonian state sold to the world as pioneering and innovative, metastasized into a Wild West of shadowy firms operating in the jurisdiction, resulting in massive amounts of illicit funds flowing through the European Union.</p>
<p>The term “licensed in the EU” became a selling point for international fraudsters who used the jurisdiction to inject trust in their illegal operations. As a result, during the last six years, 1644 licensed cryptocurrency companies have operated in Estonia: one for every 800 residents in the country.</p>
<p>Forty percent of those are related to just three company formation agencies in Estonia.Two of them provided “AML (anti-money laundering) compliance officers” to the companies. VSquare and its partners Delfi (Estonia), Siena (Lithuania), Fronstory.pl (Poland), Paper Trail Media, <span>Der Spiegel, ZDF (Germany) and Der Standard (Austria)</span> have established that many of the “specialists” hired by these crypto firms had no background whatsoever in money laundering compliance and were people with financial difficulties seeking a quick paycheck.</p>
<p>We identified a taxi driver in deep debt, a welder banned from any business activities, a person living in subsidized housing, and an unemployed plumber, who collectively were responsible for more than 60 crypto companies as either an official director or AML officer.</p>
<p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="<iframe src=&quot;https://r.muu.ee/55069/111397/index.html&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;></iframe>" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking through <a href="https://r.muu.ee/55069/111397/index.html">hundreds of licensed companies</a>, we found Russian intelligence ties, vast money laundering operations, dozens of cases of international fraud, and a serious lack of transparency: hired actors, fake profiles, and fraudulent owners of the companies.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Our methodology:</strong></p>
<p>We requested data on virtual service provider licenses in Estonia from 2017-2022 from the <a href="https://mtr.ttja.ee/"><span>Estonian Registry of Economic Activity</span></a>. The data included 1644 companies, license numbers, dates, addresses, bank accounts and information about the people applying for the license on behalf of the companies. Then we combined this data with financial and historical records from the Estonian company registry, shedding light on international affiliations and beneficial owners.</p>
<p>Next, we combined this data with similar datasets from Lithuania and cross-referenced all the companies with crowd-sourced financial intelligence service <a href="https://fintelegram.com/"><span>Fintelegram</span></a> for any existing public warnings. After analyzing the data we identified and looked further into 291 out of the 1,644 companies that matched several of our specific criteria: they hadn’t voluntarily waived the license; they had established ties with a crypto-licenced company in Lithuania; they had connections to a country flagged for money laundering concerns; or they had a hit in Fintelegram.</p>
</div>
<p>Although over 1500 crypto companies have lost their licenses since the Estonian state started to fix its broken regulation, it didn’t mean that the operators stopped their activities. Many of them moved to other European jurisdictions like Lithuania, which now hosts over 800 virtual assets companies.</p>
<h2><b>AML office in public housing</b></h2>
<p>According to Estonian crypto license applications acquired and analyzed by our data reporters, eight crypto companies are related to a single address in Tallinn, Paagi st 10. This is a social accommodation building owned by the city government meant for underprivileged people who are not able to secure a place of residence for themselves and who need help to cope with everyday life. The address in question is the residence of a 65-year-old Estonian citizen, Igor Torsin.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10857" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10857"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Igor-Torshin-credit-Rauno-Volmar-Delfi-Estonia.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="615" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Igor-Torshin-credit-Rauno-Volmar-Delfi-Estonia.jpg 1000w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Igor-Torshin-credit-Rauno-Volmar-Delfi-Estonia-600x369.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10857">Torsin complained about drunk and troublesome neighbors in his subsidized housing in 2017. By 2020 he was responsible for eight crypto companies’ AML compliance operating from the room pictured here. Source: Rauno Volmar / Delfi Estonia</figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, until June 2022 Torsin was the management board member and AML officer in BITEEU DCX OÜ, a company that still has a valid crypto service license in Estonia. Biteeu is a European branch of Kazakhstan’s exchange Intebix, co-founded in 2019 by Kazakh businessmen Talgat Dossanov and Shukhrat Ibragimov, the son of local oligarch Alijan Ibragimov.</p>
<p>FinTelegram, a website which regularly publishes investor warnings for cryptocurrency companies, names Steveyx, Venus Exchange Services and Paytechno as scam facilitators providing payment services to fraudulent operators. Torsin has been in charge of AML procedures in all of them.</p>
<p>Asking about investor warnings against his companies, Torsin says that he left Paytechno when Interpol started asking questions, but also insists that these matters are confidential. He denies being a nominee director and officer for hire but insists he is a real anti-money laundering specialist. “They told me that you need to study and I studied so much,” he says. When asked, who are “they”, he only says: “Those who invited me.”</p>
<p>Looking at other licenses of Estonian crypto companies, one can see a pattern. People with obvious financial difficulties and no experience in the field have been used as AML officers in dozens of international crypto companies. For example, a welding specialist, Kirill Saksen, has been bankrupt as a private person with a ban from practicing business since September 2021. Saksen is associated with 22 crypto companies, in five of them as an official AML expert. One of them, ReliabilityStabilityIncome OÜ, which operated a Russian exchange called RSI Capital, has been blacklisted by the Russian Central Bank since 2021 under suspicion of being a financial pyramid.</p>
<p>Saksen says he has since quit working in the field of cryptocurrency AML.</p>
<p>“I’d rather go and weld something,” the penniless welder-AML officer told us now. “I like to do more stuff by hand,” he explains, saying being a welder is more profitable than being in crypto.</p>
<p>Providing AML experts is a common service among the company formation agencies in Estonia who have been attracting international crypto-investors to Estonia en masse. About 668 crypto companies can be traced back to only three formation agencies. For example, Eesti Firma (translates as “Estonian Company”), a company associated with 266 crypto firms alone, is related to Igor Torsin’s companies. It lists “implementation and integration of effective payment and AML/KYC (know your client) solutions” as its official service on their webpage.</p>
<p>The company’s representative, Ilja Nikiforov, says that he has no reason to doubt Torsin’s competence.</p>
<p>“We are not going to share retrospective competence assessments of people’s activities, but we can say that their competence has been checked by the Estonian FIU and FIU has deemed them to be in compliance with the requirements arising from the law,” he explained.</p>
<p>Questions arise about how the AML services were implemented when Eesti Firma took on Garantex Europe OÜ as a client.</p>
<h2><b>Donations to Russian mercenaries and funds from drugs</b></h2>
<p>“They smelled great,” explains Russian mercenary Alexei Milchakov in an infamous interview to Czar.tv. Milchakov was describing how he deeply enjoys the smell of burning bodies of his enemies and loves to collect body parts from Ukrainians as trophies.</p>
<p>In his youth, he went viral for decapitating a puppy.</p>
<p>He is the founder and leading figure of the neo-nazi Rusich private military group, which has fought in Ukraine since the Russian invasion of the country’s Eastern region in 2014. Rusich – which was at the heart of the foundation of Wagner PMC – is one of the most infamous military groups who has fought for Russia in Ukraine.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10851"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image4.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="666" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image4.jpg 593w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image4-534x600.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10851">Rusich Telegram channel applauded the video of the beheading of an Ukrainian prisoner of war (without taking responsibility for it), explaining: “You will be surprised how many of these videos will gradually pop up”.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Donating money to this kind of organization via the traditional banking system would be very difficult, because of the tight money laundering regulations and SWIFT sanctions against Russia, but Rusich’s numerous crypto wallets show how the military group has been able to amass hundreds of thousands of euros in donations via cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In April 2022, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the cryptocurrency company with offices in the Moscow Federation building but operated from the Estonian jurisdiction – Garantex Europe OÜ. Earlier, in November 2021, it had already sanctioned another Estonian company related to Chatex (Izibits OÜ, formerly managed by plumber Bezrodnoi), a Telegram-based crypto exchange which also operates from the same highrise in Moscow. Both exchanges are associated with huge criminal revenues.</p>
<p>With the help of OCCRP’s Investigative Dashboard we looked into nine Rusich cryptocurrency wallets used in its fundraising campaigns. The Elliptic blockchain analysis tool indicates that the crypto wallets related to Rusich have raised around 200 000 EUR in total. For example, Elliptic indicates that about $8,697.26 has traveled from Garantex to Rusich and $5,122.92 from Rusich to Garantex. This means that whoever ran Rusich donation campaigns used (among others) Garantex to circumvent the sanctions regimes of Western countries and the banking sector.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10848" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10848"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1.png" alt="" width="1009" height="444" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1.png 1009w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1-600x264.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10848">A cluster of wallets transact between each other mixing the Rusich and Garantex Europe funds making it very difficult to track the source of these funds. This is an example on one of the eight Rusich wallets we analyzed.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The flow to Rusich wallets represents only a small part of the illicit funds funneled via the Garantex exchange. According to materials provided to us by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) citing the Global Ledger blockchain analysis tool, Garantex has exchanged huge revenues with Hydra – a now-defunct Russian darknet market dealing in illegal goods, drugs, documents and enabling money laundering services.</p>
<p>Hydra’s wallets received about 2,505 bitcoins originating from Garantex between April 2021 and April 2022, while it was operated from Estonia. In turn, 966 bitcoins originating from Hydra wallets reached Garantex Europe wallets. According to bitcoin’s value in that timeframe, that amounts to at least 138,6 million euros in revenue connected to a criminal marketplace selling drugs and offering money laundering services.</p>
<p>For example, Garantex also has a connection to a number of wallets transacting with the Lazarus Group, a North-Korean cyber criminal group, and with Ivan Vasilyevich Vakhromeyev (a.k.a. “Mushroom”), a wanted cybercriminal connected to Conti, a cybercriminal group with Russian intelligence ties. According to the US, Garantex’ illicit transactions with Conti amount to $6 million. Also in this network is Blacksprut, a Russian-language, drug-focused darknet marketplace which has won over many of Hydra’s former clients.</p>
<p>In December 2021, five months before Garantex got sanctioned in the US, its “offices” (actually a room provided by a law firm) in Tallinn were raided by the Estonian FIU. The FIU determined from their findings that in 90% of the cases, Garantex had not checked the identities of their clients at all. The company did not present suspicious activity reports to the FIU.</p>
<p>The FIU stripped Garantex Europe’s license on February 24 2022 (the day when Russia started the full-fledged war against Ukraine) but that didn’t stop the company from continuing business. VSquare partner Delfi found out that as a result, Estonia’s state prosecutors’ office started a criminal investigation into Garantex Europe and its management board in Estonia on the basis of unauthorized economic activities. <span>According to the sources of Russian investigative journalists from Dossier Center, Garantex has been active during the war in Ukraine, enabling people to convert cash into cryptocurrency and move it abroad during the sanctions regimes, and its ownership also has ties to people associated with Russian intelligence agencies.</span></p>
<h2><b>The anonymous ruble problem</b></h2>
<p>On June 26,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-26/russians-appeared-to-seek-refuge-in-crypto-during-wagner-revolt?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner"><span> Bloomberg reported</span></a> how the short-lived uprising of Yevgeny Prigozhin and his private army Wagner PMC in Russia generated significant traffic in the cryptocurrency market, suggesting that blockchain has become an important channel for moving Russian assets.</p>
<p>Another Estonian-related crypto exchange called Coinsbit is among the contributors to this phenomenon, enabling users to convert their Russian rubles into bitcoin.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10862" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10862"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-16-600x500.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="500" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-16-600x500.jpg 600w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-16.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10862">“There are no restrictions for Russian citizens on our exchange,” a representative of Coinsbit explained in February 2023 and October 2022 in the official Telegram chat of the company.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We can find a reference to the Estonian company ITEcosystem OÜ on the company’s website, which actually lost its crypto license already in July 2020. Coinsbit was co-founded by Ukrainian IT businessman Nikolai Udyansky. However, he has claimed he sold his stake in Coinsbit in 2019, and the current owner is unknown.</p>
<p>Officially, ITEcosystem was founded and owned by a Ukrainian national named Yaroslav Yarovenko, according to the Estonian business register. Managing an international company with a huge turnover has been a great success story for Yarovenko, who was convicted in 2014 of stealing women’s shoes from the Kyiv Zara clothing store.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian former small-time thief, who operated an international crypto company, has no public connection with the business. At the same time, cryptocurrency worth billions of dollars is being transacted via Coinsbit monthly. There is no public profile or contacts on Yarovenko anywhere to be found so VSquare was unable to track him down. Coinsbit did not respond to VSquare’s questions sent via email.</p>
<p>There are also hundreds of warnings about scams associated with Coinsbit’s services on the internet. According to Trustpilot, its trustscore is 2.2 out of 5 from 212 reviews.<b> </b></p>
<p>Although the website still has a reference to the Estonian company, which was its main operator at least a few years ago, Coinsbit’s official operating company has now been moved to the Seychelles which doesn’t get us any closer to understanding who is the owner of this multi-billion enterprise.</p>
<h2><b>The creation of broken law</b></h2>
<p>For decades, Estonia has built its international reputation through its ‘e-Estonia’ brand: a small country with a booming information technology sector that has also been the frontrunner in several initiatives, such as e-governance and e-residency. Another success story contributing to that narrative was becoming the first country in the EU in 2017 to establish a ‘licensing’ system for cryptocurrency companies.</p>
<p>However, the regulation went horribly wrong.</p>
<p>“This is a prime example of bad legislation. It could never have worked ,” explains a former government official who was involved in the creation of the virtual assets licensing law and who only agreed to talk to us off the record.</p>
<p>The law was adopted, and by the end of 2017, only four companies had the virtual assets license in the country. However, everything changed rapidly the following year when company formation agencies turned Estonian cryptolicensing into a business model and began to attract non-residents en masse.</p>

</div>
<p>A company formation agency called E-Advisors has provided services to 69 Estonian crypto companies. Its owner, Estonian lawyer Richard Witismann, describes how the licensing system became a profitable business. “Apparently, the country did not really understand what this would entail. But for us, this was an opportunity,” he explains. “The world was full of entrepreneurs who needed to say that their activities were licensed for marketing. Our clients wanted an opportunity to say that a country had taken a position on the legitimacy of their business.”</p>
<p>Asking if his company had clients who planned to defraud their clients from the start, Witismann says: “It’s very hard for me to say we didn’t, we probably did.”</p>
<p>The FIU soon realized that, according to the law, they had very few options for denying licenses to anyone who wanted them. Consequently, when they denied an application and the requesting company appealed in court, the FIU repeatedly lost the disputes.</p>
<p>“In spring 2018, I received a call from the FIU. They informed me that the situation was dire: whenever they didn’t issue the licenses, they were sued,” the official explains. “I told them they should ask for more resources and not hand out licenses to everyone!”</p>
<p>As the situation worsened, the FIU started receiving more and more complaints about fraud from international partners, but their hands were tied.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10854" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10854"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image7.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="509" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image7.jpg 720w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image7-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10854">Cryptocurrency companies started to use Estonian licensing to inject trust into their activities. Although the license number cited in here is genuine, the “certificate” originating from a Chinese company formation agency website is completely made up and a hammer and sickle symbol has been added for unknown reasons.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“At some point, Estonians realized that they had no control over it. Most of these companies were shell companies that had nothing to do with the local economy. They did not [pay] taxes, did not employ [anyone], and exposed the country to a loss of reputation”, adds Polish lawyer Artur Kuczmowski, who specializes in registering companies in Estonia.</p>
<p>According to the Estonian financial intelligence unit (FIU), as of mid-2021, nearly 55% of all virtual currency service providers in the world were registered in Estonia.</p>


<p>From then on, Estonia initiated a massive reform to clean up the system. As most of the companies did not agree (or were not able) to follow new regulations, only 78 licensed crypto companies now remain out of 1644 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The head of Estonia’s FIU, Matis Mäeker, confirms that the US sanctions decisions show how these kinds of companies helped finance Russian mercenary groups and even North Korean nuclear programs.</p>
<p>“But there’s nothing that links them with Estonia, only that the service providers have created their address, provided some random nominal directors and AML contact [people] found in the street who understand nothing. They don’t even know which companies they are directors of,” Mäeker says.</p>
<p>“When they are laundering money, our hands are tied. In a criminal sense or in a sense of supervision, they are not even here. They are here only on paper.”</p>
<h2><b>Sanction evasion via P2P</b></h2>
<p>Crypto exchanges implement the so-called person to person (p2p) method to bypass Russian sanctions.</p>
<p>For example, international crypto exchange MEXC at the time of writing has a daily trade revenue of around 500 million euros and it owns a branch in Estonia (Mexc Estonia OÜ) with an active virtual assets license in the country.</p>
<p>MEXC also offers ruble payments via P2P method: you wire money to a private Russian bank account and receive cryptocurrency to your MEXC wallet. MEXC doesn’t allow withdrawing funds directly but there are no restrictions to transfer the cryptocurrency to exchanges which support withdrawing USD and EUR using the European and US banking system.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10858"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image10.jpg" alt="" width="1324" height="461" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image10.jpg 1324w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image10-600x209.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1324px) 100vw, 1324px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10858">MEXC enables Russians to deposit rubles into the exchange via a private person’s bank account.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The press secretary of the Estonian FIU, Õnne Mets, says that this activity from MEXC is known to the state agency and it is currently reviewing the company’s license. “This procedure has lasted for more than a year and will receive a solution when all the relevant facts have been clarified,” Mets says.</p>
<p>The manager of MEXC Estonia OÜ Ljudmila Budnikova confirms that the company is waiting for Estonian FIU to extend its’ license. She claims that the European branch in Estonia is a completely different company from MEXC Global.</p>
<p>“Simply put, MEXC Estonia OÜ is a unit operating as a franchise to serve European customers. This means that the company can use the global brand name “MEXC” but has no corporate connection with the brand owner,” she claims.</p>
<h2><b>Actors and fake profiles</b></h2>
<p>The fact that officials’ hands were tied is no surprise to Nico S. (full name known to the editorial board) from the Netherlands. In January 2022, he had made several statements to the Estonian police because “an Estonian” crypto company called Arbismart had not returned his funds. No criminal proceedings were opened. He was told that the owner of Arbismart was not Estonian and not based in the country. The company had no actual premises there.</p>
<p>But the public had been persuaded of the opposite. The company advertised that it was “<span>fully EU licensed and regulated</span>” and “regulated by the Financial Intelligence Unit (“FIU”) in Estonia”. To boost credibility, Arbismart had published “articles” in numerous crypto blogs. The articles featured Mike Meyers, CEO; Andrus Steiner, CTO; and Dennis Müller, Head of Business Development. According to their public LinkedIn pages, Meyers claims to be from a small village of Risti in Estonia, Steiner from the small town of Rakvere, and Müller is described on a blog as an IT graduate from Tallinn University, except… none of these people actually exist and Steiner even used images of other person found from the internet to give an illusion of presence in Estonia.</p>
<p>A series of videos uploaded to YouTube showed alleged Arbismart employees standing in an office and praising the service. In fact, these were actors. These videos were shot in 2019 in Moscow, at the design centre ARTPlay, according to one of the participants of the shoot interviewed by VSquare. In the studio, the whole operation was run by two Arbismart representatives in their 30s. One of them, known as Eli, spoke Russian with the actors but Hebrew with his business partner. They paid the actors in cash.</p>
<p>VSquare could not discover the true beneficiary of this operation. In the eyes of the Estonian state, Arbismart was owned by a 34-year-old Ukrainian, Dmytro Averianov. Averianov is in debt for utility bills and owes child support. At an alimony hearing, Averianov’s ex-wife described how the man is unemployed in the winter, but in the summer he gets occasional jobs to help put roofs and facades on apartment buildings.</p>
<p>To become an investor, one had to buy so-called RBIS tokens created by the company, which it promised to buy back in 2022 at a higher value. Nico invested one bitcoin in 2019, worth €6,000 at the time. “By December 2021, the theoretical value of my assets in RBIS tokens plus arbitrage gains was around €95,000,” he explains. Soon enough, however, investors began to understand that there was no promised buyback programme.</p>
<p>Finally, Arbismart paid Nico back €6,000 in January 2022. However, Arbismart kept his bitcoin – the coin was worth €40,000 by then. Others were not so lucky. Telegram victims’ chats indicate that numerous clients have still received nothing and the amounts lost range up to €50,000.</p>
<p>In February 2022, Arbismart wrote on Telegram that the Estonian FIU had introduced “draconian new regulations” in Estonia and Arbismart planned to move to Lithuania, where “the regulator body brings greater experience” and “offers a more welcoming environment for Fintech companies’.</p>
<p>In September 2021, Arbismart UAB was founded in Vilnius (initially under a different name, changed to Arbismart in November 2021).</p>
<h2><b>Migration to Lithuania: a full start over</b></h2>
<p>After moving its operations from Estonia to Lithuania, Arbismart continues to state it is a “secure, EU authorized, interest-generating wallet and exchange”.</p>
<p>After moving to Lithuania, Arbismart indicated another Ukrainian owner: Pavlo Havrylov, with an address in Nova Kakhovka, a frontline city in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Arbismart claims it has an “active operating authorization issued by the Lithuanian FCIS” – the Financial Crime Investigation Service. The FCIS doesn’t issue licenses or any other kind of “authorization” to crypto exchanges, the deputy chief of FCIS Audrius Valeika told VSquare.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only part of Arbismart’s official statements that isn’t exactly true. The company claims it is required to provide “adequate operational capital”. In fact Lithuania and Estonia have tried to tackle the crypto companies by demanding a minimum share capital from the operators. In Lithuania it has to be at least 125,000 euros in share capital. Arbismart’s share capital is 2,500 euros.</p>

<p>In an attempt to reach Arbismart for comment, VSquare called the two numbers indicated by the company in the Lithuanian registry. One was answered by a recording. The other number apparently belonged to a formation agent that helped Arbismart set up their Lithuanian business. He confirmed that Lithuanian law enforcement also called him in an attempt to reach Arbismart, and agreed to share the number for the person he considered to be Pavlo Havrylov. However, that number was offline.</p>
<p>VSquare managed to find Pavlo Havrylov. The 34-year-old Ukrainian confirmed it was his personal details indicated in the Lithuanian company’s documents, but claimed to have no knowledge of Arbismart or any connection to the company in general.</p>
<p>“What? Who am I? This is the first time I heard of it”, Havrylov said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>He said this was not the first time his identity got stolen. “I never took part in any of it. Once I got questioned [by authorities], they asked how do I have these companies where I’m allegedly the director. I have no knowledge of this”, he explained.</p>
<p>When asked if he would testify to Lithuanian authorities if they investigated Arbismart, Havrylov said this is not his main concern now, since he has enlisted in the Ukrainian army.</p>
<p>Arbismart did not respond to an emailed request for comment.</p>
<h2><b>Migration to Lithuania: a familiar story</b></h2>
<p><span>Arbismart is just one example of many showing how crypto companies have been able to continue their business activities even after being expelled from Estonia due to tougher regulations implemented in 2022. VSquare</span> has established that at least 68 crypto companies in Lithuania have clear connections to cryptocurrency firms operated in Estonia using the same brand, company name or internet domain.<span>&nbsp; </span>39 Lithuanian crypto companies have connections to Estonian service providers and company formation agencies.</p>
<p>For example, the Estonian law firm Gofaizen &amp; Sherle is connected to 11 crypto companies in Lithuania. Gofaizen &amp; Sherle also advertise jobs for AML/MLRO (anti-money laundering/money laundering reporting) officers, claiming “the job requires minimal involvement from 1 to 20 hours per month” and is “perfect as a side job or additional income source”. The job ad presents no qualification requirements and suggests it as an opportunity for university students to make some extra cash. The head of Lithuania’s Center of Excellence in Anti-Money Laundering, Eglė Lukošienė, claims this does not look like a description of a real MLRO position.</p>
<p>“It is a full time job. If transactions are happening, they have to be monitored”, Lukošienė told VSquare.</p>
<p>Siena’s intern, a student at the Vilnius university, responded to Gofaizen &amp; Sherle’s job ad. Posing as a potential candidate, she called the company and asked if the job requires any experience in the field. The answer was: “No”.</p>
<p>VSquare emailed Gofaizen &amp; Sherle with a request to comment on the quality of the AML/MLRO officers they hire for their clients in Lithuania. <span>The company did not respond to the e-mail, all </span><span>attempts</span><span> to reach </span><span>Gofaizen &amp; Sherle by their Estonian and Lithuanian phone numbers were fruitless</span></p>
<p>A Lithuanian company called CAML claims to provide MLROs to 20% of the Lithuanian crypto industry. In July, CAML had more than 20 employees with an average salary of less than 800 euros before tax, which is below the Lithuanian minimum wage. The average salary in the company is significantly fluctuating, but rarely makes it above 1,000 euros before tax.</p>
<p>In Lukošienė’s view, these figures look nothing like the actual money made by real AML officers. “Less experienced specialists earn up to 2,600 euros before tax. Those with more experience earn above the 2,600 mark”, she claims.</p>
<p>Audrius Valeika, the deputy director of Lithuania’s FCIS, admits that MLROs and AML competency is being faked, similar to what had happened in Estonia.</p>
<p>Another journalism student from Lithuania also called CAML to be considered for the AML/MLRO position. The company’s representative confirmed there are virtually no requirements for the position and asked for a CV. He said that hourly wage is between 10 and 20 euros. Later, the candidate got rejected, on the grounds that the only currently open position does require some experience.</p>
<p>Povilas Norkūnas, the director of CAML, was also approached for comments by phone. He did not argue that his company’s AML/MLRO officers are paid below minimum wage, on average.</p>
<p>“So what?” he said.</p>
<p>When asked about the AML/MRLO officers’ qualification for the job and the fact that the company is offering the job to university students, Norkūnas refused to respond to any further questions and asked them to be sent via email.</p>
<p>The request for comments was sent late last week. In a written response, Norkūnas claimed his company values “honesty, quality and value” and all of their employees have at least two years of experience in the field. CAML’s director did not directly respond to the question about hiring university students for AML/MLRO position.</p>
<p>“We are not in control of our employees’ spare time or the decisions they take regarding their future, career or additional studies”, he said.</p>
<h2><b>Migration to Lithuania: sanction evasion</b></h2>
<p>In March 2022, a YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHeyS19Grog&amp;ab_channel=%D0%AD%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%83%D0%BC2.0"><span>uploaded a tutorial in Russian</span></a> titled “Bypassing Sanctions Without VPN.” In the video, the uploader instructs Russians on how to evade payment sanctions via Payeer, a popular crypto exchange and payment processor in Russia. Numerous similar tutorials can be found in Russian forums and websites. At that time, Payeer was operated from Estonia (Payeer OÜ) and it boasts to have millions of customers, many of them based in Russia.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10850" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10850"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image3-600x576.png" alt="" width="600" height="576" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image3-600x576.png 600w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image3.png 941w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10850">In Payeer, funds can be deposited via Russian banks and withdrawn in USD via Advcash and Perfectmoney.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Since its establishment in 2012, Payeer has operated through various jurisdictions. By 2023, it had lost its license in Estonia and reestablished itself in Lithuania as Payeer UAB <span>registering a company involved in crypto exchange activities</span> there. The actual beneficiary of the enterprise has never been clear as with each incarnation the ownership information of the operator has been different. In Russia, its first incarnation, Payeer RUS LLC, was founded by a woman named Evgenia Kosolapova, who doesn’t appear to have any public profile in connection to payment and crypto services.</p>
<p>During its operations in Georgia, Payeer was officially owned by a Ukrainian, Kostiantyn Buriachenko. The same Buriachenko established BlackShire United LP’s Czech spinoff company, which was owned by Dexberg Inc and Montbridge Inc from the Marshall Islands, notorious for concealing the true beneficiaries of suspicious companies. <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/how-a-russian-linked-shell-company-hired-an-ex-trump-aide-to-boost-albanias-right-wing-party-in-dc/"><span>Journalists from Mother Jones</span></a> have linked the Scottish company Blackshire to a network of Russian-backed shell companies associated with suspicious political donations to Albania.</p>
<p>During Payeer’s operations in Estonia, a Russian national named Liubov Svezhentseva was listed as the UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner) of Payeer. However, she is officially the marketing director of Payeer, and VSquare was not able to confirm her position as a founder/owner. According to Payeer’s homepage, the service provider also claims to have a financial license from Vanuatu.</p>
<p>In Lithuania, Payeer now declares another Russian national as beneficiary – Ekaterina Olegovna Gorshkova, with an address in the Netherlands.</p>
<h2><b>A mirage of funds</b></h2>
<p>VSquare found several cases in which crypto companies use cryptocurrency to claim that they fulfill the minimum share capital requirement (125,000 EUR) in Lithuania. This method may be used as a way to bypass tougher regulations implemented in the hopes of cleaning up the market. For example, in January 2023 Payeer uploaded an official asset valuation report made by a hired expert in Lithuania, claiming the amount of cryptocurrency owned by Ekaterina Olegovna Gorshkova was worth exactly the amount in euros needed for Payeer to reach the minimum capital required in Lithuania.</p>
<p>The document indicated a particular crypto walled with its unique ID. Several publicly available wallet analysis tools indicate that 125,000 EUR worth of crypto currency (USDC) was sent out from the wallet on 17th of January 2023 so the wallet doesn’t actually have the necessary assets to fulfill the requirement.</p>
<p>Lukošiene from Center of Excellence in Anti-Money Laundering concludes that crypto is not a reliable asset in terms of share capital.</p>
<p>“The practice you mentioned does not ensure the [reason] share capital is needed, in the first place: to provide security to clients, users and the company itself. So it seems like it doesn’t serve its purpose”, Lukošienė told VSquare.</p>
<p>Similarly to Arbismart, the phone number submitted to the Lithuanian registry by Payeer was offline. The Lithuanian formation agent who provided Payeer with company registration and his own address claimed to have no contact with the client. He also said the company is obliged to move from the premises within 12 months.</p>

<p>Payeer did not respond to an emailed request for comment.</p>
<h2><b>Connection to Sberbank leadership</b></h2>
<p>Similar to Payeer, another international crypto-firm, MoneySwap OÜ, operating the virtual assets platform Mercuryo, set up a new business entity in Lithuania, MoneyAmber UAB.</p>
<p>The Estonian FIU (Financial Intelligence Unit) refused to extend MoneyAmber’s license due to a lack of transparency in the ownership structure and incriminating information on the internet about the service provider. FIU noted that the investor warning website FinTelegram had noted that Mercuryo had brokered numerous crypto scams and was popular among Russian clients.</p>
<p>The shares of both the Estonian and Lithuanian business entities of Mercuryo are managed through the Cypriot company MRCR Holdings. One of the shareholders of this Cypriot company is Akshin Dzhangirov. In cooperation with Siena, the Lithuanian Center for Investigative Journalism, we found out that Dzhangirov is the brother of Dzhangir Dzhangirov, the group CRO of Sberbank, one of the most important Russian state banks. At the same time, Akshin, the co-owner of the Estonian and Lithuanian crypto company, has received about 285,600 euros in income from Sberbank in 2021, directly connecting him to the state bank.</p>
<p><span>Akshin Dzhangirov is a direct shareholder of MRCR Holdings since October 2020. He is the third largest shareholder of the company, after Moneybag, an offshore entity based in the Cayman Islands, and Target Global, registered in Delaware, US. </span></p>
<p>However, data on Dzhangirov being one of the Lithuanian company’s beneficiaries was never provided to the state registry. MoneyAmber, the Lithuanian company controlled by MRCR Holdings, lists only one beneficiary – and it’s Petr Kozyakov, a Russian national reportedly residing in the UK.</p>
<p>In written comments to our Lithuanian partner organization Siena, Mercuryo’s Senior Legal Counsel Adam Berker first stated it would be inaccurate to say they moved their activities to Lithuania, since “the entity in Lithuania was established 1.5 years ago with the aim of expanding [the] company’s presence in Europe”.</p>
<p>Regarding Akshin Dzhangirov, Berker stated he was “an early investor in Mercuryo and the third largest investor behind the founders of Mercuryo and Target Global”. “He is considered a minority shareholder (&lt;25%) who does not exercise control over Mercuryo and is not operationally involved in Mercuryo’s business activities,” Berker added.</p>
<p>Mercuryo’s representative claimed the company was “not in the position to comment on the family relationship(s)” of their investors.</p>
<p>He further claimed Mercuryo has no business relations with Sberbank and has an unequivocal “stance against the ongoing war in Ukraine”.</p>

The series was produced with funding from IJ4EU.</p>
<h2>“Estonian” crypto companies related to more than a billion in damages</h2>
<p>In addition to the companies mentioned previously, between 2018-2023 Estonia has hosted international crypto firms and illicit actors who are responsible for more than a billion of euros in damages according to US sanctions decisions, public claims, indictments, media and victims. Here are some of the examples.</p>
<p>● <b>Hashflare (HashCoins OÜ)</b></p>
<p>According to US prosecutors, Estonian citizens Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turõgin promised investors lucrative profits from cryptocurrency mines. According to the US indictment, their Bitcoin mining capabilities were only about 1% of what they had claimed to their victims. The US indictment indicates that the duo’s scam amounts to $575 million USD which would be one of the biggest frauds originating from Estonia ever.</p>
<p>● <b>FuturoCoin (FuturoCoin OÜ)</b></p>
<p>When Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen finished third overall in the 2019 season representing Red Bull, “FuturoCoin” was emblazoned on the sleeve of his race jersey as part of a sponsorship deal. FuturoCoin was a cryptocurrency sold on international exchanges and, while one FuturoCoin was worth<span>&nbsp; </span>almost $17 in June 2018, it is currently valued at $0.000026. Of the $451,000,000 worth of market cap at its high, only $860 has remained. FuturoCoin is actually part of a larger “multimedia network” called Futurenet, which is a series of pyramid schemes originating from Poland. Its Polish founder Roman Z. was arrested in Italy and accused of organizing Ponzi scams by South Korean prosecutors. Later he escaped the country and now he’s wanted by a European Arrest Warrant issued by the Polish court. As well as his German business partner Stephan M., arrested in Albania in August 2023. Z. and M. have still not been questioned by the Polish prosecutor’s office although investigators have worked on this case since 2016. Futurocoin OÜ never presented any financial statements to the Estonian business registry. Both Z. and M. accumulated considerable wealth. Roman Z. is a collector of luxury, very expensive cars, as well as the owner of eight properties in Dubai. Stephan M. is also a wealthy man. He used to live in Dubai, where he runs a garage for luxury cars called “The Space”. Just before his arrest, he was supposed to buy a villa near Tirana. Formally, the CEO of the company was Paulina Woźniak, who today claims that this work was only a form of “service” provided to the real owners of FuturoCoin. The “AML officer” in the company was Mateusz Głowicki, who in an interview with us denied having ever had anything to do with the field of AML.</p>
<p>● <b>Coinloan (CoinLoan OÜ)</b></p>
<p>According to bankruptcy proceedings in Estonia, 200 million euros of investors’ money is currently frozen because of the bankruptcy of Coinloan’s operator Coinloan OÜ. That is more than 12,000 investors. There are only 133 million euros worth of assets in the company and from that about half is Coinloan’s own token which is pretty much worthless because of the bankruptcy. The company’s founder is Alexandr Faliushin from Russia. The development director of Coinloan is Mikhail Rozhko, a former local United Russia politician in Petersburg and former coordinator in Immortal Regiment – a Russian propaganda organization.</p>
<p>● <b>CREX24 (Crex24 OÜ)</b></p>
<p>Russian-owned Crex24 OÜ announced in 2020 that their customers will not be getting their investments back since the firm had been hacked. Since then, the internet has been filled with numerous warnings of fraud. By the next year, the Estonian business entity was liquidated. The owner of the Estonian Crex24 business entity was Elizaveta Kazorina, whose husband Dmitry Kazorin, the founder of 1xBet online casinos, is wanted in Russia due to financial fraud. According to the Russian prosecutor’s office, 63 billion rubles (620 million euros) were stolen from customers through the 1xBet casinos. Kazorina resides in Cyprus, while Kazorin’s whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>● <b>Finiko (CyfronCapital OÜ)</b></p>
<p>In July 2021, the Russian prosecutor’s office arrested Kirill Doronin, the front man of Finiko’s alleged crypto Ponzi scheme. According to media reports, the scam amounted to about 90 million euros. At the same time, Doronin owned the company CyfronCapital OÜ in Estonia, which had a valid crypto license for almost three years until July 2022. Cyfron is the developer of the Finiko mobile app and is directly related to Finiko’s activities.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to Chainalysis, Finiko’s scheme’s funds were also laundered via Garantex mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>● <b>CryptoVenience/Cryptanet (OÜ)</b></p>
<p>The shareholder of both companies is Oskar Anselm Schmucki, a Swiss citizen. He manages Russian assets via DuLac Capital, whose offices are located in St. Petersburg and Moscow, among others. “Schmucki controls a global network of shell companies and has had close financial relationships with an individual charged with financial crimes and a company with suspected links to Russian organized crime and money laundering,” the US Treasury Department explained when sanctioning both crypto firms. Cryptanet owned a virtual currency license in Estonia until February 2021.</p>
<p>● <b>RR Crypto (RoiRising Crypto OÜ)</b></p>
<p>According to French media and a law firm representing victims, RR Crypto customers lost up to 58 million euros when their investments in the crypto platform disappeared. In spring 2022, the French police arrested four RR Crypto representatives on suspicion of fraud. The arrested founder of RR Crypto, Vincent R., also owns the biggest share in an Estonian company RoiRising CryptoOÜ whose virtual assets license was canceled in July 2021.</p>
<p>● <b>CoinsBank (OÜ)</b></p>
<p><span><a href="https://ekspress.delfi.ee/artikkel/93859615/tahame-oma-raha-tagasi-meestel-jai-kruptopanka-kinni-ule-miljoni-euro">Eesti Ekspress wrote last year </a></span>how Coinsbank OÜ refused to return 1.2 million euros of investments to two customers. The prosecution and the court did not initiate criminal proceedings. There are dozens of similar experiences shared about the investment platform online. Coinsbank was known for its luxurious conferences held on cruise ships and was related to Belarusian and Ukrainian individuals, who in turn, according to VSquare, had close ties to the infamous former US outlaw John McAfee, who hanged himself in prison before his charges of fraud and crypto scams came to fruition. Coinsbank’s contact e-mail address didn’t work at the time of writing.</p>
<p>● <b>Dagcoin</b></p>
<p>In 2022, Dagcoin’s Estonian creators were arrested. They, according to the Estonian Central Criminal Police, stole at least 8 million euros from customers. In 2019, the interior services of Estonia noted that Dagcoin could also be used to finance terrorism, as it was openly praised by Islamic radicals from Jordan.</p>
<p>● <b>VeMarkets (Grau International OÜ)</b></p>
<p>VeMarkets, which constantly changed business entities behind the scenes, was run until 2020 through Grau International OÜ, licensed in Estonia. According to investor warnings website FinTelegram, before moving to Estonia VeMarkets was operated by two now-arrested fraudsters, Uwe Lenhoff (died in prison in 2020) and Gal Barak, through a Montenegrin business entity. Dutchman Floris Waals was the official manager of Grau International. “My identity has been abused and I’m still suffering from it,” he explained to Vsquare. In three months’ time in 2018, Waals and his compatriot Gaele De Graaf had opened six crypto firms in Estonia, which all have warnings from government agencies related to them or have numerous warnings about them public on the internet. Although Waals claims his identity was abused, he was also named the official AML expert in all three of the companies.</p>

<p>Maybe Intel chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger has spent too much time at EMC and VMware. Because now Intel wants to spin out the FPGA business that is a small but bright spot in its datacenter and edge computing businesses.</p>
<p>It never made a lot of sense that EMC, the maker of traditional storage arrays and the poster child for datacenter-class storage during the Dot Com boom, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2003/12/15/emc_eyes_the_server/">snapped up VMware in December 2003 for $635 million</a> in cash just after that boom had gone bust. EMC was looking for some place where it could park its cash and get a great return on its investment. But no one would argue that maybe EMC should have just gone public. As it was, EMC had to maintain Switzerland status for VMware so its partners would not abandon it for other server virtualization platforms from Microsoft and Red Hat, and this is always a hassle. And so, EMC never did build a hybrid server-storage platform that changed the architecture in the datacenter.</p>
<p>To be fair, these deals always make <em>some sense</em> in the financial engineering way, just like it made sense for Michael Dell and Silverlake Partners to try to get rich <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/10/14/with-emc-and-vmware-dell-must-start-building-a-platform/">buying EMC (and therefore VMware) for an incredible $67 billion in October 2015</a> and in just the same way that it eventually made sense to spinoff VMware so it could finally be free – just so <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/05/26/with-vmware-broadcom-has-a-real-enterprise-software-stack/">Broadcom could swoop down from the skies to buy VMware from Wall Street for $61 billion</a> for its own financial engineering reasons. There were more twists and turns in there – including <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/09/10/for-whom-the-dell-toils/">Michael Dell taking the company that bears his name private</a> a year before announcing the EMC-VMware deal to avoid the sharp tongues of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Importantly, Dell also did not use VMware and EMC to build a new kind of server-storage-networking hybrid in the datacenter – something that Nutanix has tried to do – and we do not think Broadcom is trying to do this. These deals are about installed bases and subscription and maintenance streams and extracting maximum value from customers who are more or less trapped on the ESXi/vSphere stack.</p>
<p>When the rumors were going around back in March 2015 – the same month we started publishing <em>The Next Platform</em> – that Intel might buy FPGA maker Altera, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/03/30/why-intel-might-buy-fpga-maker-altera/">we did a deep dive analysis of the state of the FPGA market</a> and how it could be transformed by SmartNICs and other kinds of high speed computing where the FPGA is an excellent choice over a CPU or a GPU. It really comes down to software. Dedicated hardware with functions etched into ASICs are more efficient and CPUs running higher level software algorithms are more flexible, but the FPGA can sort of meet algorithm and function writers in the middle with FPGAs and hard blocked components like DSP engines. The problem is, you have to know how to code VHDL. You can convert C and C++ to VHDL, but ultimately you need to get in there and tune it for maximum performance.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/06/01/how-intel-is-hedging-on-the-future-of-compute-with-altera-buy/">Intel did buy Altera in June 2015 for what seemed like an excessive $16.7 billion</a>, we were also thinking that FPGAs could transform the datacenter. It was clear to us that in a lot of cases, an FPGA would be just right for workloads that do not change too much and yet needed low latency and high performance, albeit at a price/performance that could not match custom ASICs, which were getting more expensive with every node jump. (It is insanely costly at the 3 nanometer node.) There was talk about an FPGA being embedded in a third of the hyperscaler and cloud servers by 2020 – something that was driven in large part by the popularity of FPGAs on Microsoft’s Azure cloud to accelerate workloads and offload network and storage functions from the CPUs in servers. There was talk of hybrid CPU-FPGA packages, which never seem to get commercialized because no system architect likes static ratios of compute – unless they are determining the ratios. Like the hyperscalers and cloud builders, who can tell companies like Intel and AMD what their product roadmaps need to look like.</p>
<p>Intel hedged so many bets between 2015 and 2020 that it is hard to keep track of them all, but it started a GPU compute business for the third time, it bought Barefoot Networks and the Cray and QLogic InfiniBand interconnect businesses (which have all been sold off or shut down), and it bought up Nervana Systems and Habana Labs for a combined $2.35 billion in case custom ASIC neural network processors were going to replace CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. Intel looked like it could sell anyone anything. And what it ended up doing was selling very little of anything but “supply win” CPUs as others did a better job getting cutting-edge CPUs and GPUs into the field. FPGA sales just continued along their normal course because people who use FPGAs, and who have used them for decades, <em>know what they are doing</em>. The jury is still out on NNPs as far as we are concerned. (Sorry Cerebras Systems, SambaNova Systems, Graphcore, Groq, and Tenstorrent. We probably forgot to mention a few dozen others.) Intel has hedged so many bets that it forgot what the real bet was and it has therefore hemmed itself in.</p>
<p>And it is no surprise that Intel dropped Nervana’s NNPs like a hot rock for Habana’s devices – and has basically said that after Gaudi 3, which has taped out, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/06/08/intel-downplays-hybrid-cpu-gpu-compute-engines-merges-nnp-into-gpu/">the Habana line is over, too</a>, and that some Habana technology – it’s matrix math engines and Ethernet interconnect – will live on in the future “Falcon Shores” GPU.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t place heavy bets on Falcon Shores making it to completion unless a big HPC center adopts it, and given how Argonne National Laboratory was treated, we don’t think there will be a lot of uptake unless Intel makes some pretty big pricing concessions. Which it can ill afford. Hybrid CPU-GPU devices – the original plan for Falcon Shores, have also been shelved.</p>
<p>So, the FPGA business formerly known as Altera is being spun out into a separate unit and will be run hands-off in the anticipation that Intel can do an initial public offering for that business sometime in the next two to three years. Thereby setting Altera free again and “unlocking shareholder value” as corporate behemoths say when they do this spinoff a few years after an acquisition.</p>
<p>We find this annoying, and said three years ago, when Intel’s chief financial officer, Bob Swan, was running the company and Gelsinger had not been asked to take the job (as far as we know), that <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2020/10/23/intel-needs-to-engineer-its-financial-future/">Intel needed to <em>start engineering its future</em> and stop trying to <em>financially engineer its future</em></a>. Spinning out the MobileEye edge AI Inference business (as happened last year) or spinning out the FPGA business doesn’t really solve anything as far as we are concerned. Intel paid a fortune for these things, and it should give them a chance to be the businesses that they are and then benefit from them. Spinning them out weakens Intel even if it might – and we emphasize the might here – help an aggregate share price across Intel, MobileEye, and FPGA Co stocks when they are separate. Doing this tells Wall Street Intel doesn’t believe in its own stock, and at the very least, if Intel spins them out, then its stock should depreciate precisely by the amount of value it unlocks in the spinoffs.</p>
<p>The Altera team was a great team, and Sandra Rivera, who runs the Data Center &amp; AI organization today, and Shannon Poulin, who we have known for years in the Xeon organization, will do a good job as chief executive officer and chief operating officer of an independent FPGA company and can build a great team again that can compete with the Xilinx part of AMD. The FPGA market is not going away, even if it is not exploding, and there is an opportunity to capture some of that value.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/gartner-wells-fargo-fpga-market-2021-2027.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143091"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/gartner-wells-fargo-fpga-market-2021-2027.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="361" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/gartner-wells-fargo-fpga-market-2021-2027.jpg 1151w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/gartner-wells-fargo-fpga-market-2021-2027-768x427.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/gartner-wells-fargo-fpga-market-2021-2027-600x334.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></a></p>
<p>The FPGA business is a good business, but as you can see – well maybe, because those shares of blue are tough to parse – the datacenter portion of the FPGA business is not particularly large. (Our thanks to Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo for allowing us to reprint this chart.) And it sure as heck is not as large as many of us thought it would become. But that doesn’t mean that Intel should not be in the FPGA business and that it should not have a great SerDes team and a great SoC team and a great algorithm team and infuse that across Intel. That is why <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/02/15/what-will-amd-do-with-programmable-logic-and-other-xilinx-ip/">AMD paid close to $49 billion to acquire FPGA maker Xilinx</a> in February 2022.</p>
<p>By spinning out FPGA Co – here’s a crazy idea: You could call the spinout Altera – Intel can solicit private equity funding as well as public funding to help do the investing that Intel cannot right now afford to do to compete with AMD/Xilinx. The financial separation between Intel and Altera – why don’t we just call it Altera, people – starts with the Q1 2024 financials. By the way, Altera will keep its foundry relationship with Intel Foundry Services, but we presume Altera will have the option to go to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co or Samsung as alternative foundries. Right now, if Intel did that with Altera still being part of DC&amp;AI, it would be seen as a failure of its foundry roadmap.</p>

It must surely follow that we’re the most relaxed generation of all time. Agree?</p><p><span>You might find that claim dubious, but if adverts are to be believed, AI, digital payments, self-driving cars and automation in general is only there to make our lives </span><em>easier. </em><span>We carry in our pockets a powerful computer that can take on the role of your personal navigator, translator, matchmaker, meditation teacher, and banker. With so many of our tasks automated, our leisure time must have expanded greatly. Right?</span></p><p><span>It matters how we frame this question. If you ask ‘are we working less than before’, research is ambiguous. In rich countries people work less than labourers who toiled during the 19th century industrial revolution, but more than our ancient ancestors. If you ask ‘are our lives more leisurely than ever’, the answer is less ambiguous. Many people feel their lives are frenetic. We’re not only expected to work a lot. We’re expected to</span><em> consume</em><span> a lot. Ask ‘are we more chilled out than ever?’ and the answer is no. People are strung out, stressed out, and burned out.</span></p><p><span>There’s more to work than the amount of time spent doing it. Carving a wooden door frame for ten hours in the 1600s is a very different emotional experience to jumping between a hundred emails, meetings and micro-tasks for four hours in 2023. Levels of workplace burnout have skyrocketed. We might think we’ve escaped Charles Dickens’ 19</span><sup>th</sup><span> century sweatshop dystopia, but our global economy now apportions drudge-work to labourers in the Global South while middle-class workers plug into an attention-burning digital matrix that yokes us far beyond ordinary work hours. There’s all sorts of ‘half-work’ going on, such as checking emails while eating breakfast, and promoting yourself via Instagram while on holiday. Even our consumption has become unpaid work: every act of buying something with a card, watching a streaming show, or using Google Maps to get to a concert produces data that will train AIs for big tech.</span></p><p>It’s easy to brush these off as unintended by-products of digital life, a necessary downside to the great benefits brought to us by tech. To truly understand our predicament, however, requires us to look at this systemically. We don’t just live in any economy. We live in a mega-scale corporate capitalist economy, and in such a setting technology is never used to save time. It’s used to speed up production and consumption in order to expand the system. The basic rule is this: technology doesn't make our lives easier. It makes them faster and more crammed with stuff.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg" width="562" height="737.344" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1312,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:562,&quot;bytes&quot;:271163,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Ye olde rough path to the meadow</figcaption></figure></div><p>Let’s look at an example.

Our modern lives are built from globe-spanning supply chains that require vast logistics systems and incredible communication speed to make sense. Each technology not only unlocks a new state of expanded acceleration (that will be hardcoded into our lives as the new basis for our survival), but will also be used as the basis for new technologies to continue that process. The vast majority of people do not experience this technology as ‘liberating’ them. Rather, they experience it as something that propagates itself around them, and something they must race to keep up with in order to not be ‘left behind’.</p><p>Consider the current AI hype. Believing that AI will save time is like being a person in the late 1800s seeing their first car and thinking “oh how easy it’ll be to get to the meadow now!” People back then didn’t imagine that by the 1960s we’d be stuck in traffic jams for hours in mega-cities. Now apply this to AI. If we fast-forward a decade, it will have recalibrated the entire economy to a state of higher acceleration where you’ll be expected to do far more, at much greater scale, in the same amount of time. At that point, if you’re not using it you’ll feel like a 19th century villager who finds themselves trying to walk to work in the middle of modern Los Angeles.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://brettscott.substack.com/p/tech-doesnt-make-our-lives-easier?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://brettscott.substack.com/p/tech-doesnt-make-our-lives-easier?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>This is why the stories we hear about tech are so rife with cognitive dissonance. Marketers and futurists first place themselves in the position of our proverbial villager - hyping the convenience of AI - but if you say you don’t need it they fast-forward their minds into the future and issue dire warnings that if don’t adopt it you’ll be </span><em>left behind</em><span>. What they’re trying to say, in their convoluted and euphemistic way, is this: </span><strong>the global capitalist system doesn’t care whether or not you want to use the technology, or whether you believe it should be used to save your time</strong><span>. </span><strong>You will have to use it, and you’re not in charge of how it will be used systemically</strong><span>. In fact, </span><em>nobody</em><span> is really in charge. Our personal desires will always play second fiddle to the systemic logic of a large-scale economy that is blind to anything except the profit motive. In the absence of us being able to get together and demand something different, our system will always just </span><em>default</em><span> towards increasingly speed and growth. It only has one gear.</span></p><p>This is why innovation futurists get stuck in doublethink. They tell you technological change is ‘inevitable’, and that you better sync up, but soften the blow by telling you it’s all happening because you desire it and will benefit. We have to emotionally cope with the state of inertia we’re in, so we accept this circular reasoning. </p><p><span>Let’s illustrate this by returning to the Los Angeles example. L.A. only exists in its current form </span><em>because</em><span> of cars, which means life will be difficult there if you don’t have one. In this scenario you’re essentially held hostage by the auto industry, whose products are the very thing that have catalysed our dependence on giant megacities. Rather than acknowledge that, we lapse into a type of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome" rel="">Stockholm Syndrome</a><span> where we choose to imagine the car as a saviour that grants us our independence in that context. In reality, the car is just a minimum requirement to scrape by in a car-catalysed environment (to explore this, check out this piece about navigating </span><a href="https://walkingtheworld.substack.com/p/la-without-a-car-part-2" rel="">LA by foot</a><span>). Certainly, there are many people in LA who have cars, but who struggle just as much as our ancient ancestors did. There are also many without cars, who struggle far more.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg" width="1200" height="734.3406593406594" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:891,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:426389,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6713038e-bfce-46fb-932e-796f419b04ac_2048x1253.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Life in the shadows of LA (thanks to </span><a href="https://walkingtheworld.substack.com/p/la-without-a-car-part-2" rel="">Chris Arnade</a><span> for allowing use of this image)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>This topic is close to my heart, because I </span><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/439997/cloudmoney-by-scott-brett/9781529111484" rel="">campaign to protect physical cash</a><span> in places where ‘cashless’ digital payments are spreading.

If I hop across to Germany, people of exactly the same social class don’t experience this inconvenience even now. In fact, there are hundreds of millions of people across the world who view the cash system as easy to use. So, why do perceptions of inconvenience change depending on where you go and when?</p><p><span>Convenience and inconvenience are not absolute properties that can be universally measured or experienced. In my birth country of South Africa, where the pace of life and expectations are different, cash feels totally normal, but in London it doesn’t. That’s because the city is moving into a state of higher automation-acceleration. In the early phases of their London takeover, digital payments companies invested hugely into nudging people towards the belief that cash was inconvenient (through marketing campaigns, and so on), but it’s only when the vortex of automation reorganized the environment that it started to </span><em>feel</em><span> like that. If you’re trying to use cash in Sweden, where many service jobs have been replaced by cash-refusing machines plugged directly into the banking sector (via Visa and Mastercard), it’s going to feel like you’re swimming against the tide. It literally will start to feel arduous to use cash, because the ATMs have been shut down, the branches won’t take it, and you keep getting refused when you try use it. What’s actually happening is that digital payments are being used to accelerate everything, but if you’re a person trying to live a slower life amidst all the others who are trying to keep up, you’ll find yourself out of sync.

That very same adaptability, though, prevents us from using the new tech to save time, because – under a system with a growth fetish – we’ll be expected to adapt to a new normal in which we have to do more stuff and get more stuff in the same amount of time.</p><p>The dark irony then, is that it is the introduction of the new tech that inspires the subsequent irritation at its absence. Twenty years ago nobody fidgeted in agitation if they had to wait ten minutes for a taxi. Now you’ll check your phone incessantly if the Uber is running three minutes later than you expected. And god forbid the driver cancels, because you’ve probably algorithmically planned everything down to the last minute. We increasingly live a ‘just in time’ life because, at a systemic level, there’s pressure to pack in as much stuff as possible at both a consumption and production level.

The latter will just increase systemic acceleration, after which any situation in which the tech is not available will be perceived as ‘inconvenient’. This – in true Stockholm Syndrome style – will be transformed into a belief that AI is a saviour that helps us survive in a frenetic world (cue all the adverts that start with ‘In today’s fast-paced business environment, AI is more vital than ever…”). In reality, we’ll just be more burned out, which in turn will be weaponised to sell us more acceleration tech. </span><em>Feeling burned out? Why not automate more?</em></p><p><span>When trying to defend this, economists typically claim that we have unlimited desire for new stuff. Apparently, rather than dedicating the time gains from technology to leisure, we pour it into making more stuff for ourselves. This is bogus. People do have a limited desire for new things, because dedicating yourself to endless production (and consumption) comes at the expense of hanging out with your family, friends and pets, or doing stuff like walking in the wilderness or surfing the waves. What people actually desire is a </span><em>balance</em><span> of many things, but the system we’re stuck in has unlimited desire for one direction only.

In reality, we’re biological beings with finite capacities ensnared within an economy with an acceleration drive, and its constant attempt to expand just crowds out other stuff in our lives. It’s like opening the tap in a bath that’s already full, and then watching the new water push other water into the overflow. Beyond the ‘overflow’ point, all the happens is that we become more confused, bloated and strung out. The requirement to pack more into the same time just fragments our attention and erodes our patience, which again will be weaponised: </span><em>feeling impatient?

Perversely, this information obesity actually makes us feel more </span><em>sluggish</em><span>. We might be moving faster, but everything starts to blend into one.

										<p>Although proponents of secret science like to focus on examples in which it has benefited society, insiders from the very beginning of the Cold War worried that the best minds would not be drawn to work that they could not even talk about. Secrecy protected those involved from embarrassment or criminal prosecution, but it also made it much harder to vet experimental protocols, validate the results, or replicate them in follow-up research.</p>
<p>One research manager at a Department of Energy weapons lab would later admit, “Far more progress is actually evidenced in the unclassified fields of research than the classified ones.” The physicist Robert McCrory, whose own lab received millions in funding in partnership with Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, and Los Alamos National Laboratories, was even more blunt: “Some of the work is so poor that if it were declassified, it would be laughed off the face of the Earth.”</p>
<p>We can only guess what, specifically, McCrory had in mind when he said this. There are all too many possibilities. Collectively, they lend credence to the oft-stated concern that secret programs became a refuge for second- and third-rate minds. The wizards of Langley, for instance, considered it a “remarkable scientific achievement” when they managed to prove that cats could be “trained to move short distances.” According to a CIA veteran, Victor Marchetti, this achievement was part of a program to determine whether cats could be turned into surveillance devices:</p>
<blockquote><p>A lot of money was spent. They slit the cat open, put batteries in him, wired him up. The tail was used as an antenna. They made a monstrosity. They tested him and tested him. They found he would walk off the job when he got hungry, so they put another wire in to override that. Finally they’re ready. They took it out to a park and pointed it at a park bench and said, “Listen to those two guys. Don’t listen to anything else—not the birds, no dog or cat—just those two guys!” They put him out of the van, and a taxi comes and runs him over. There they were, sitting in the van with all those dials, and the cat was dead!</p></blockquote>
<p>The CIA nevertheless commended the “energy and imagination” of the team, and considered them potential “models for scientific pioneers.”</p>
<p><span>Secrecy protected those involved from embarrassment or criminal prosecution, but it also made it much harder to vet experimental protocols.</span></p><p>It could be argued that a sprawling research program purposely designed to push the envelope will, over several decades, inevitably produce some strange and low-quality research. But in some cases it is possible to make a side-by-side comparison of US government research with research commissioned by another country that had fewer resources but the same goal.</p>
<p>For instance, during World War II, American and British forces both used dogs to detect mines. It was delicate, dangerous work, and the dogs sometimes proved unreliable. Both governments therefore mounted research projects in the early 1950s to evaluate and improve dogs’ ability to locate mines.</p>
<p>____________________________________</p>
<p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-declassification-engine-what-history-reveals-about-america-s-top-secrets/18909336?ean=9781101871577" target="_blank">The Declassification Engine: <span>What History Reveals about America’s Top Secrets</span></a> by Matthew Connelly has been shortlisted for the 2023 <a href="https://www.cundillprize.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cundill History Prize</a>.</em></p>
<p>____________________________________</p>
<p>The British just wanted “the facts” and sought out a “trained scientist.” They selected Solly Zuckerman, an anatomist expert in animal behavior. He designed the experiment to eliminate the possibility that human handlers were unconsciously influencing the dogs’ performance.</p>
<p>This required systematically isolating the specific biochemical and physiological factors that might explain success or failure, since either could prove important when mines were odorless. Zuckerman had a strong personal motivation—he had seen the devastating impact of blast injuries when he conducted wartime physiological research with the survivors. His larger agenda was to develop more rigorous experimental methods in animal research. Zuckerman found no solid evidence that dogs could be relied on to detect buried mines.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army, on the other hand, hired a “parapsychologist” named J. B. Rhine. It is not clear why—all the army records were later destroyed. Though his training was in botany, Rhine had become famous for his experiments—never replicated— in extrasensory perception (ESP) and psychokinesis. For Rhine, the study was an opportunity to prove that ESP really existed; he had already gathered a collection of amazing stories of animal ESP. Rhine once again convinced himself that dogs possessed special powers.</p>
<p>Army officials found in follow-up work that the results were random, and another study proved to be a complete failure, marked by a “rather conspicuous refusal of the dogs to alert.” But Rhine used the army money to seed new research, and found new customers. The Office of Naval Research funded a decade of work on ESP in homing pigeons. In other studies, one of Rhine’s colleagues tried to influence a cat telepathically to select one dish of food over another. But here, too, even Rhine admitted that the results were “not spectacular.” Alas, the cats proved “elusive.”</p>
<p>The US government would spend several decades on the larger program of mind-control research. And Rhine was a paragon of scientific rigor compared with some of the other researchers on the government payroll, who espoused theories of extraterrestrial and ghostly visitations to explain ESP, and were hired by the US Army to consult on psychedelic mushrooms.</p>
<p>The CIA’s Project MKUltra involved a whole series of experiments on unwitting subjects, using a range of different drugs in order to manipulate them into saying and doing things against their will. It was given carte blanche to operate without the normal Agency accounting controls or need for written contracts. Once again, researchers rapidly escalated their trials with little understanding of the effects. In the first round of an experiment conducted at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, one of the patients, Harold Blauer, was given 0.4 mg of methylenedioxyphenyl-isopropylamine, a drug similar to ecstasy. The next dose was sixteen times stronger, and Blauer was dead in thirty minutes.</p>
<p>When the family took legal action, government lawyers threatened witnesses with prosecution under the Espionage Act. Decades later, CIA Director Stansfield Turner admitted that “some unwitting testing took place,” but testified to Congress that the subjects were “criminal sexual psychopaths confined at a State hospital.” In fact, Blauer was a tennis pro who voluntarily sought treatment for depression after a divorce.</p>
<p>The CIA also experimented on its own personnel. In one case, the head of MKUltra, a chemist named Sidney Gottlieb, dosed the attendees of a joint Agency-army retreat with LSD. One of the unwitting subjects, an army biochemist named Frank Olson, was traumatized by the experience. Until then, Olson had been an outgoing and devoted family man. Afterward, he sank into depression, overcome with feelings of shame, and would not return home. He told his army supervisor that he wanted to quit or be fired.</p>
<p>Gottlieb was likely alarmed upon being warned about this situation. MKUltra had been approved by the CIA director himself, Allen Dulles, who called the program “ultra-sensitive.” But Gottlieb reportedly had not obtained prior authorization before drugging Olson and the others. As an internal Agency report later noted, participants in this work well understood that their methods were “professionally unethical” and legally dubious, and would provoke “serious adverse reaction” from the public if ever revealed. Gottlieb therefore had a powerful motivation to make certain Olson told no one about what the CIA had done to him.</p>
<p><span>The government’s venture into the paranormal proved useless for any legitimate intelligence purposes.</span></p><p>Gottlieb and his deputy decided to take Olson to see a New York doctor. The man had no psychiatric training but did have a top-secret CIA security clearance and experience with LSD. The doctor plied Olson with bourbon and sedatives, and took him to see a performance by a magician, whom Gottlieb was interested in hiring to help dose more unwitting targets. Olson’s public behavior became increasingly erratic, and he said that the Agency was “out to get him.” The doctor said he would take Olson to a sanitarium to be treated by CIA psychiatrists. But that night, Olson “fell” from the tenth floor of the Statler Hotel in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Gottlieb’s deputy was sharing the room with him, and claimed to have been asleep when it happened. His story was that Olson had just crashed right through the window, without opening it first, or even raising the shade. We may never know what happened in that hotel room. But at the time, the CIA was training its assassins to first ply their victims with drugs or alcohol, and advised, “The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface.”</p>
<p>The CIA was clearly prepared to kill innocent American citizens. Six weeks after the Agency covered up what happened to Olson, a CIA mind-control team went on its first foreign assignment. The mission was to slip “artichoke”—likely LSD—into the drink of another unwitting subject and induce him to attempt an assassination of a prominent politician or American official. The artichoke team was primed for action, proudly noting that they “were ready when called upon for support, even though the operation did not materialize.”</p>
<p>Most of the MKUltra records were later destroyed, so we cannot know what other missions might have aimed to achieve. But CIA mind-control research went on for more than a decade, involved some eighty different institutions, and would eventually cost approximately ten million dollars—about a hundred million in today’s dollars.</p>
<p>A whole new mind-control program started up in 1972, this time led by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The goal of this new program was “to determine whether anomalous mental phenomena (i.e. extrasensory perception and psychokinesis) existed and the degree to which such phenomena might be applicable to problems of national interest.” Like MKUltra, it went on for many years, and cost many millions of dollars. How many exactly is still difficult to determine. But a single California contractor, SRI International, would eventually receive $11.3 million (or about thirty-six million in today’s dollars).</p>
<p>Even escape artists and magicians saw that the government was being rooked, and patiently explained to officials how timeworn tools of their trade could easily trick someone into believing in ESP. So, too, did the scientists at DARPA, who concluded that the Israeli illusionist Uri Geller, the DIA’s star pupil, was a “charlatan.” They thought it was “ridiculous” that Geller had fooled the US government into using taxpayer dollars to see whether he could bend spoons with his brain. They pointed to a host of problems with the ESP and psychokinesis experiments, above all the fact that the people paid to conduct them had a financial incentive to produce positive results.</p>
<p><span>Under the cloak of secrecy, their hubris and magical thinking ran wild.</span></p><p>In 1985, the army commissioned a blue-ribbon panel from the National Research Council to evaluate the program. The panel concluded there was “no scientific warrant for the existence of parapsychological phenomena” such as “remote-viewing”—sensing the location or appearance of things through sheer mental effort—or psychokinesis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, over the following decade the army conducted between fifty and a hundred more such experiments. In 1995, another review of the remote-viewing program was commissioned, this time by the American Institutes for Research (AIR). Once again, the reviewers found that, because of flaws in the research designs, there was no clear evidence demonstrating the existence of the paranormal.</p>
<p>But the AIR report found something even more damning. After some twenty-five years of experiments, the reviewers concluded, “In no case had the information provided ever been used to guide intelligence operations.” Even if some people really do have ESP that cannot be explained by science, the point of the program was not to use government resources to explore the Twilight Zone. It was to support actual missions that would safeguard national security. Yet, despite all the time and money spent—not to mention the human costs—the government’s venture into the paranormal proved useless for any legitimate intelligence purposes.</p>
<p>Why, then, did the intelligence community and the Pentagon go to extremes in pursuing such embarrassing “research”? For the same reason why they felt they had license to control the weather and alter the upper atmosphere: because, under the cloak of secrecy, their hubris and magical thinking ran wild. Moreover, controlling people’s minds was a prize that was just too tempting to resist. And although the government may have given up on telekinetic spoons, it did not give up on that larger goal.</p>
<p>During the first decade of the “Global War on Terror,” the CIA pursued mind control through more direct methods—i.e., “enhanced interrogation.” The program employed psychological abuse, stress positions, and waterboarding not just to make people talk, but also to discover scientifically rigorous and reproducible methods for compelling subjects to submit to the will of interrogators and lose all sense of personal agency. Just like MKUltra, the enhanced-interrogation program was conducted as a series of “experiments.” Here is how the CIA’s Office of Medical Services, in a top- secret 2004 document, described the protocol for recording the application of “treatments” to “subjects”:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CIA hired a retired air-force psychologist named James Mitchell to enact these methods. Mitchell, too, saw himself as a scientist. As an informed source recounted to the journalist Jane Mayer, after Mitchell took over a case, he told the FBI agents that an interrogation “was like an experiment, when you apply electric shocks to a caged dog, after a while, he’s so diminished, he can’t resist.” When the agents argued that the subject of this experiment was a human being and not a dog, Mitchell retorted, “Science is science.”</p>
<p>Waterboarding, “diapering,” and stress positions ultimately proved no more effective than ESP or psychokinesis, as the CIA’s own internal reviews concluded. Many of the victims had already provided valuable intelligence to their interrogators before they were tortured, and once the waterboarding began, many offered false information in order to make it stop. But the waterboarding did not stop until Mitchell’s company was paid eighty-one million dollars.</p>

Fairphone, a competing Android manufacturer that prioritizes lengthy support periods for its devices, has <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/2020/06/18/fairphone-2-gets-android-9/">publicly spoken about</a> how difficult it is to continue to support a phone after a chipset manufacturer like Qualcomm ends support for the processor used. In Google’s case with Tensor, the power is in its own hands.</p><p>Apple, another manufacturer that also produces its own processors for its phones, offers similarly lengthy support periods. Although the company doesn’t promote explicit promises about the number of years it supports its devices for, it released five major iOS version updates for the 2017 iPhone X before ending support with iOS 17 this year. Even then, however, Apple will <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213913">occasionally release security patches for older devices</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, Google’s pledge should mean the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro get updated to at least 2029’s Android 20 and maybe even 2030’s Android 21, depending on when in the year the update gets released. But that assumes Google is still using the same annual release cadence for Android seven years from now, even before we get into its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851107/google-graveyard-pixel-pass-subscription-phone-upgrades">somewhat flaky history</a> of ongoing support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning">other services and initiatives</a>.</p><p>Although seven years of security support puts Google out ahead of its mainstream competitors, it’s still technically beaten by Fairphone, which recently announced the Fairphone 5 with a promised eight years of security updates (with 10 years as a stretch goal). However, Fairphone has no plans to sell its fifth-generation device in the US and is also only committed to releasing five major Android OS updates.</p><div><p>Check out our complete coverage of the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, as well as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23660312">Pixel Watch 2</a> that Google also announced today, in our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23895660/google-pixel-8-event-news-roundup">guide to the Google Pixel 8 launch event</a>. </p></div><p><h3>Related:</h3></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether such systems just learn an enormous collection of superficial statistics or a coherent model of the data generating process -- a world model. We find evidence for the latter by analyzing the learned representations of three spatial datasets (world, US, NYC places) and three temporal datasets (historical figures, artworks, news headlines) in the Llama-2 family of models. We discover that LLMs learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales. These representations are robust to prompting variations and unified across different entity types (e.g. cities and landmarks). In addition, we identify individual ``space neurons'' and ``time neurons'' that reliably encode spatial and temporal coordinates. Our analysis demonstrates that modern LLMs acquire structured knowledge about fundamental dimensions such as space and time, supporting the view that they learn not merely superficial statistics, but literal world models.

Changes since OpenSSH 9.4
=========================

This release fixes a number of bugs and adds some small features.

Potentially incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * ssh-keygen(1): generate Ed25519 keys by default. Ed25519 public keys
   are very convenient due to their small size. Ed25519 keys are
   specified in RFC 8709 and OpenSSH has supported them since version 6.5
   (January 2014).
    
 * sshd(8): the Subsystem directive now accurately preserves quoting of
   subsystem commands and arguments. This may change behaviour for exotic
   configurations, but the most common subsystem configuration
   (sftp-server) is unlikely to be affected.

New features
------------

 * ssh(1): add keystroke timing obfuscation to the client. This attempts
   to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive traffic at
   fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when there is only a small
   amount of data being sent. It also sends fake "chaff" keystrokes for
   a random interval after the last real keystroke. These are
   controlled by a new ssh_config ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword.
    
 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Introduce a transport-level ping facility. This adds
   a pair of SSH transport protocol messages SSH2_MSG_PING/PONG to
   implement a ping capability. These messages use numbers in the "local
   extensions" number space and are advertised using a "ping@openssh.com"
   ext-info message with a string version number of "0".
    
 * sshd(8): allow override of Sybsystem directives in sshd Match blocks.

Bugfixes
--------

 * scp(1): fix scp in SFTP mode recursive upload and download of
   directories that contain symlinks to other directories. In scp mode,
   the links would be followed, but in SFTP mode they were not. bz3611
    
 * ssh-keygen(1): handle cr+lf (instead of just cr) line endings in
   sshsig signature files.
    
 * ssh(1): interactive mode for ControlPersist sessions if they
   originally requested a tty.
    
 * sshd(8): make PerSourceMaxStartups first-match-wins
    
 * sshd(8): limit artificial login delay to a reasonable maximum (5s)
   and don't delay at all for the "none" authentication mechanism.cw
    bz3602
    
 * sshd(8): Log errors in kex_exchange_identification() with level
   verbose instead of error to reduce preauth log spam. All of those
   get logged with a more generic error message by sshpkt_fatal().
    
 * sshd(8): correct math for ClientAliveInterval that caused the probes
    to be sent less frequently than configured.
    
 * ssh(1): fix regression in OpenSSH 9.4 (mux.c r1.99) that caused
   multiplexed sessions to ignore SIGINT under some circumstances.

Portability
-----------

 * Avoid clang zero-call-used-regs=all bug on Apple compilers, which
   for some reason have version numbers that do not match the upstream
   clang version numbers. bz#3584

 * Fix configure test for zlib 1.3 and later/development versions. bz3604

<p>Have you heard about CRDTs and wondered what they are? Maybe you’ve looked into them a bit, but ran into a wall of academic papers and math jargon? That was me before I started my <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Recurse Center</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.recurse.com/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://d29xw0ra2h4o4u.cloudfront.net/assets/logo_square-60e12570c3a1b0b0798e651a0755f71a40ff15421761b786f720e4c02fc89a1f.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The Recurse Center</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The Recurse Center is a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers in New York City.</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://d29xw0ra2h4o4u.cloudfront.net/assets/favicon-fbfd4d3b58909892b7caada24c507292a4f96f5ab03fda9a7ae3050ce4618f78.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">www.recurse.com/</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a> batch. But I’ve spent the past month or so doing research and writing code, and it turns out that you can build a lot with just a few simple things!</p>
<p>In this two-part series, we’ll learn what a CRDT is. Then we’ll write a primitive CRDT, compose it into more complex data structures, and finally use what we’ve learned to build a collaborative pixel art editor. All of this assumes no prior knowledge about CRDTs, and only a rudimentary knowledge of TypeScript.</p>
<p>To pique your curiosity, this is what we’ll end up with:</p>
<pixelart-demo resolution="100"></pixelart-demo>

<p>Draw by clicking and dragging with your mouse. Change the paint color by using the color input on the bottom left. You can draw on either canvas and your changes will show up on the other, as if they were collaborating on the same picture.</p>
<p>Clicking the network button prevents changes from reaching the other canvas (although they’ll sync up again when they come back “online”). The latency slider adds a delay before changes on one canvas show up on the other.</p>
<p>We’ll build that in the next post. First, we need to learn about CRDTs!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-crdt">What is a CRDT?</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s start from the top. CRDT stands for “Conflict-free Replicated Data Type”. That’s a long acronym, but the concept isn’t too complicated. It’s a kind of data structure that can be stored on different computers (peers). Each peer can update its own state instantly, without a network request to check with other peers. Peers may have different states at different points in time, but are guaranteed to eventually converge on a single agreed-upon state. That makes CRDTs great for building rich collaborative apps, like Google Docs and Figma — without requiring a central server to sync changes.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are two kinds of CRDTs: state-based and operation-based.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-cvrdt" id="user-content-fnref-cvrdt" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup> State-based CRDTs transmit their full state between peers, and a new state is obtained by merging all the states together. Operation-based CRDTs transmit only the actions that users take, which can be used to calculate a new state.</p>
<p>That might make operation-based CRDTs sound way better. For example, if a user updates one item in a list, an operation-based CRDT can send a description of only that update, while a state-based CRDT has to send the whole list! The drawback is that operation-based CRDTs impose constraints on the communication channel: messages must be delivered exactly once, in causal order, to each peer.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-delta" id="user-content-fnref-delta" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This post will exclusively focus on on state-based CRDTs. For brevity, I’ll just say “CRDTs” from here on out, but know that I’m referring specifically to state-based CRDTs.</p>
<p>I’ve been talking about what CRDTs do, but what <strong>is</strong> a CRDT? Let’s make it concrete: a CRDT is any data structure that implements this interface:<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-ackshually" id="user-content-fnref-ackshually" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">3</a></sup></p>
<pre><code><span>interface</span> <span><span>CRDT</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>{</span>
  value<span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>;</span>
  state<span>:</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>
  <span>merge</span><span>(</span>state<span>:</span> <span>S</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>void</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>That is to say, a CRDT contains at least three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A value, <code>T</code>. This is the part the rest of our program cares about. The entire point of the CRDT is to reliably sync the value between peers.</li>
<li>A state, <code>S</code>. This is the metadata needed for peers to agree on the same value. To update other peers, the whole state is serialized and sent to them.</li>
<li>A merge function. This is a function that takes some state (probably received from another peer) and merges it with the local state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The merge function must satisfy three properties to ensure that all peers arrive at the same result (I’ll use the notation <code>A ∨ B</code> to indicate merging state <code>A</code> into state <code>B</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Commutativity: states can be merged in any order; <code>A ∨ B = B ∨ A</code>. If Alice and Bob exchange states, they can each merge the other’s state into their own and arrive at the same result.</li>
<li>Associativity: when merging three (or more) states, it doesn’t matter which are merged first; <code>(A ∨ B) ∨ C = A ∨ (B ∨ C)</code>. If Alice receives states from both Bob and Carol, she can merge them into her own state in any order and the result will be the same.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-thesamepicture" id="user-content-fnref-thesamepicture" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Idempotence: merging a state with itself doesn’t change the state; <code>A ∨ A = A</code>. If Alice merges her own state with itself, the result will be the same state she started with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mathematically proving that a merge function has all these properties might sound hard. But luckily, we don’t have to do that! Instead, we can just combine CRDTs that already exist, leaning on the fact that someone has proven these things for us.</p>
<p>Speaking of CRDTs that already exist: let’s learn about one!</p>
<h3 id="last-write-wins-register">Last Write Wins Register</h3>
<p>A register is a CRDT that holds a single value. There are a couple kinds of registers, but the simplest is the Last Write Wins Register (or LWW Register).</p>
<p>LWW Registers, as the name suggests, simply overwrite their current value with the last value written. They determine which write occurred last using timestamps, represented here by integers that increment whenever the value is updated.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-logical" id="user-content-fnref-logical" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">5</a></sup> Here’s the algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the received timestamp is less than the local timestamp, the register doesn’t change its state.</li>
<li>If the received timestamp is greater than the local timestamp, the register overwrites its local value with the received value. It also stores the received timestamp and some sort of identifier unique to the peer that last wrote the value (the peer ID).</li>
<li>Ties are broken by comparing the local peer ID to the peer ID in the received state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try it out with the playground below.</p>
<lwwregister-demo></lwwregister-demo>

<p>Did you get a sense for how LWW Registers work? Here are a couple specific scenarios to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn the network off, make a bunch of updates to <code>bob</code>, and then turn it back on. When you send updates from <code>alice</code>, they’ll be rejected until the timestamp exceeds <code>bob</code>’s timestamp.</li>
<li>Perform the same setup, but once you turn the network back on, send an update from <code>bob</code> to <code>alice</code>. Notice how the timestamps are now synced up and <code>alice</code> can write to <code>bob</code> again!</li>
<li>Increase the latency and send an update from both peers simultaneously. <code>alice</code> will accept <code>bob</code>’s update, but <code>bob</code> will reject <code>alice</code>‘s. Since <code>bob</code>’s peer ID is greater, it breaks the timestamp tie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the code for the LWW Register:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>LWWRegister<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>readonly</span> id<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>state<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> state<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>merge</span><span>(</span>state<span>:</span> <span>[</span>peer<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> timestamp<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> value<span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>remotePeer<span>,</span> remoteTimestamp<span>]</span> <span>=</span> state<span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>localPeer<span>,</span> localTimestamp<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>state<span>;</span>

    <span>// if the local timestamp is greater than the remote timestamp, discard the incoming value</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>localTimestamp <span>&gt;</span> remoteTimestamp<span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// if the timestamps are the same but the local peer ID is greater than the remote peer ID, discard the incoming value</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>localTimestamp <span>===</span> remoteTimestamp <span>&amp;&amp;</span> localPeer <span>&gt;</span> remotePeer<span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// otherwise, overwrite the local state with the remote state</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>state <span>=</span> state<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s see how this stacks up to the CRDT interface:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>state</code> is a tuple of the peer ID that last wrote to the register, the timestamp of the last write and the value stored in the register.</li>
<li><code>value</code> is simply the last element of the <code>state</code> tuple.</li>
<li><code>merge</code> is a method that implements the algorithm described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>LWW Registers have one more method named <code>set</code>, which is called locally to set the register’s value. It also updates the local metadata, recording the local peer ID as the last writer and incrementing the local timestamp by one.</p>
<p>That’s it! Although it appears simple, the humble LWW Register is a powerful building block with which we can create actual applications.</p>
<h3 id="last-write-wins-map">Last Write Wins Map</h3>
<p>Most programs involve more than one value,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-citation" id="user-content-fnref-citation" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">6</a></sup> which means we’ll need a more complex CRDT than the LWW Register. The one we’ll learn about today is called the Last Write Wins Map (or LWW Map).</p>
<p>Let’s start by defining a couple types. First, our value type:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Value<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>If each individual map value holds type <code>T</code>, then the value of the entire LWW Map is a mapping of string keys to <code>T</code> values.</p>
<p>Here’s our state type:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> LWWRegister<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>|</span> <span>null</span><span>&gt;</span><span>[</span><span>"state"</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Do you see the trick? From our application’s perspective, the LWW Map just holds normal values — but <strong>it actually holds LWW Registers</strong>. When we look at the full state, each key’s state is the state of the LWW Register at that key.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-null" id="user-content-fnref-null" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">7</a></sup></p>
<p>I want to pause on that for a moment, because it’s important. Composition lets us combine primitive CRDTs into more complex ones. When it’s time to merge, all the parent does is pass slices of incoming state to the appropriate child’s merge function. We can nest this process as many times as we want; each complex CRDT passing ever-smaller slices of state down to the next level, until we finally hit a primitive CRDT that performs the actual merge.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the LWW Map merge function is simple: iterate through each key and hand off the incoming state at that key to the corresponding LWW Register to merge. Try it out in the playground below:</p>
<lwwmap-demo add="off" delete="off" state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;], &quot;bar&quot;: [&quot;bob&quot;, 1, &quot;dolor sit amet&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>It’s kind of difficult to trace what’s happening here, so let’s split up the state for each key. Note, though, that this is just a visualization aid; the full state is still being transmitted as a single unit.</p>
<p>Try increasing the latency and then updating different keys on each peer. You’ll see that each peer accepts the updated value with a higher timestamp, while rejecting the value with a lower timestamp.</p>
<lwwmap-demo split="true" add="off" delete="off" state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;], &quot;bar&quot;: [&quot;bob&quot;, 1, &quot;dolor sit amet&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>The full LWW Map class is kinda beefy, so let’s go through each property one by one. Here’s the start of it:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>LWWMap<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>readonly</span> id <span>=</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  #data <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Map<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> LWWRegister<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>|</span> <span>null</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> state<span>:</span> State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>id <span>=</span> id<span>;</span>

    <span>// create a new register for each key in the initial state</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> register<span>]</span> <span>of</span> Object<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>LWWRegister</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> register<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p><code>#data</code> is a private property holding a map of the keys to LWW Register instances. To instantiate a LWW Map with preexisting state, we need to iterate through the state and instantiate each LWW Register.</p>
<p>Remember, CRDTs need three properties: <code>value</code>, <code>state</code> and <code>merge</code>. We’ll look at <code>value</code> first:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>get</span> <span>value</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> value<span>:</span> Value<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// build up an object where each value is set to the value of the register at the corresponding key</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> register<span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>register<span>.</span>value <span>!==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> value<span>[</span>key<span>]</span> <span>=</span> register<span>.</span>value<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> value<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s a getter that iterates through the keys and gets each register’s <code>value</code>. As far as the rest of the app is concerned, it’s just normal map!</p>
<p>Now let’s look at <code>state</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>get</span> <span>state</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> state<span>:</span> State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// build up an object where each value is set to the full state of the register at the corresponding key</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> register<span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>register<span>)</span> state<span>[</span>key<span>]</span> <span>=</span> register<span>.</span>state<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> state<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Similar to <code>value</code>, it’s a getter that builds up a map from each register’s <code>state</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a clear trend here: iterating through the keys in <code>#data</code> and handing things off to the register stored at that key. You’d think <code>merge</code> would work the same way, but it’s a little more involved:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>merge</span><span>(</span>state<span>:</span> State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// recursively merge each key's register with the incoming state for that key</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> remote<span>]</span> <span>of</span> Object<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>const</span> local <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>

      <span>// if the register already exists, merge it with the incoming state</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>local<span>)</span> local<span>.</span><span>merge</span><span>(</span>remote<span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>// otherwise, instantiate a new `LWWRegister` with the incoming state</span>
      <span>else</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>LWWRegister</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> remote<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>First, we iterate through the incoming <code>state</code> parameter rather than the local <code>#data</code>. That’s because if the incoming state is missing a key that <code>#data</code> has, we know that we don’t need to touch that key.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-delete" id="user-content-fnref-delete" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">8</a></sup></p>
<p>For each key in the incoming state, we get the local register at that key. If we find one, the peer is <strong>updating</strong> an existing key that we already know about, so we call that register’s <code>merge</code> method with the incoming state at that key. Otherwise, the peer has <strong>added</strong> a new key to the map, so we instantiate a new LWW Register using the incoming state at that key.</p>
<p>In addition to the CRDT methods, we need to implement methods more commonly found on maps: <code>set</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>delete</code> and <code>has</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <code>set</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> value<span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// get the register at the given key</span>
    <span>const</span> register <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// if the register already exists, set the value</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>register<span>)</span> register<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>value<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// otherwise, instantiate a new `LWWRegister` with the value</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>LWWRegister</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> value<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Just like in the merge method, we’re either calling the register’s <code>set</code> to update an existing key, or instantiating a new LWW Register to add a new key. The initial state uses the local peer ID, a timestamp of 1 and the value passed to <code>set</code>.</p>
<p><code>get</code> is even simpler:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>?.</span>value <span>??</span> <span>undefined</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Get the register from the local map, and return its value if it has one.</p>
<p>Why coalesce to <code>undefined</code>? Because each register holds <code>T | null</code>. And with the <code>delete</code> method, we’re ready to explain why:</p>

<p>Rather than fully removing the key from the map, we set the register value to <code>null</code>. The metadata is kept around so we can disambiguate deletions from states that simply don’t have a key yet. These are called <strong>tombstones</strong> — the ghosts of CRDTs past.</p>
<p>Consider what would happen if we really did delete the keys from the map, rather than leaving a tombstone. Here’s a playground where peers can add keys, but not delete them. Can you figure out how to get a peer to delete a key?</p>
<lwwmap-demo delete="off" merge="naive" state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>Turn off the network, add a key to <code>alice</code>’s map, then turn the network back on. Finally, make a change to <code>bob</code>’s map. Since <code>alice</code> sees that the incoming state from <code>bob</code> is missing that key, she removes it from her own state — even though <code>bob</code> never knew about that key in the first place. Whoops!</p>
<p>Here’s a playground with the correct behavior. You can also see what happens when a key is deleted.</p>
<lwwmap-demo state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>Notice how we never remove deleted keys from the map. This is one drawback to CRDTs — we can only ever add information, not remove it. Although from the application’s perspective the key has been fully deleted, the underlying state still records that the key was once there. In technical terms, we say that CRDTs are <strong>monotonically increasing</strong> data structures.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-efficiency" id="user-content-fnref-efficiency" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The final LWW Map method is <code>has</code>, which returns a boolean indicating whether the map contains a given key.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>has</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// if a register doesn't exist or its value is null, the map doesn't contain the key</span>

  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>There’s a special case here: if the map contains a register at the given key, but the register contains <code>null</code>, the map is considered to not contain the key.</p>

<li id="user-content-fn-cvrdt">
<p>They’re also known as CvRDTs (“Cv” standing for “convergent”) and CmRDTs (“Cm” standing for “commutative”), respectively, although I think “state-based” and “operation-based” are the preferred terms. <a href="#user-content-fnref-cvrdt" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-delta">
<p>There are also delta CRDTs, or hybrid CRDTs, which allow peers to negotiate the subset of the state they need to send each other. That’s one example of blending operation-based and state-based CRDTs. But the fundamental tradeoff remains: sending less data between peers means more constraints on communication. <a href="#user-content-fnref-delta" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-ackshually">
<p>Technically, a CRDT can be anything that follows the merging rules described below. This is a working definition; in practice, implementations in object-oriented languages will end up looking something like this. <a href="#user-content-fnref-ackshually" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>

<p>Commutativity and associativity might sound the same, and indeed most commutative operations are also associative. But there are a few math operations that are only one or the other.

And surprisingly, floating point arithmetic — i.e. any math operator in JavaScript — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property#Nonassociativity_of_floating_point_calculation" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">is commutative but not associative</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property#Nonassociativity_of_floating_point_calculation" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Associativity_of_binary_operations_%28without_question_marks%29.svg/1200px-Associativity_of_binary_operations_%28without_question_marks%29.svg.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Associative property - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico#Nonassociativity_of_floating_point_calculation" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property#Nonassociativity_of_floating_point_calculation</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>! <a href="#user-content-fnref-thesamepicture" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>

<p>You might ask: why not use the actual time? Unfortunately, accurately syncing clocks between two computers is an extremely hard problem.

<p>You might be wondering: if another peer deleted a key from their map, shouldn’t we remove it from our local map as well? It’s the same reason the state holds <code>T | null</code>.

<p>There are a couple ways mitigate this drawback, both of which are outside the scope of this article. One is “garbage collection”: pruning tombstones from CRDTs, which prevents you from merging states with any changes made before the tombstones were removed. Another is creating an efficient format to encode the data. You can also combine these methods. Research suggests that <a href="https://youtu.be/x7drE24geUw?t=3587" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">this can result in as little as 50% overhead compared to the “plain” data</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://youtu.be/x7drE24geUw?t=3587" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x7drE24geUw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">CRDTs: The Hard Parts</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">A talk on the latest research on CRDTs, originally given at the Hydra distributed computing conference on 6 July 2020.References: https://martin.kleppmann.co...</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://www.youtube.com/s/desktop/a24ea7cc/img/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">youtu.be/x7drE24geUw?t=3587</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>. <a href="#user-content-fnref-efficiency" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Language models generate responses by producing a series of tokens in immediate succession: the $(K+1)^{th}$ token is an outcome of manipulating $K$ hidden vectors per layer, one vector per preceding token. What if instead we were to let the model manipulate say, $K+10$ hidden vectors, before it outputs the $(K+1)^{th}$ token? We operationalize this idea by performing training and inference on language models with a (learnable) $\textit{pause}$ token, a sequence of which is appended to the input prefix. We then delay extracting the model's outputs until the last pause token is seen, thereby allowing the model to process extra computation before committing to an answer. We empirically evaluate $\textit{pause-training}$ on decoder-only models of 1B and 130M parameters with causal pretraining on C4, and on downstream tasks covering reasoning, question-answering, general understanding and fact recall. Our main finding is that inference-time delays show gains when the model is both pre-trained and finetuned with delays. For the 1B model, we witness gains on 8 of 9 tasks, most prominently, a gain of $18\%$ EM score on the QA task of SQuAD, $8\%$ on CommonSenseQA and $1\%$ accuracy on the reasoning task of GSM8k. Our work raises a range of conceptual and practical future research questions on making delayed next-token prediction a widely applicable new paradigm.

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> previous version of this post didn't have "static" in the title to keep it short (but the body did). Added it in the title for clarification.</p>
<p>I've been writing software for over 20 years, and with every day that goes by I grow more certain that strong static typing is not just a good idea, but also almost always the right choice.</p>
<p>There are definitely uses for untyped languages (or language variants), for example they are much nicer when using a REPL, or for throwaway scripts in environments that are already hopelessly untyped (e.g. the shell). In almost every other case, however, strong typing is strongly preferred.</p>
<p>There are advantages to not using types, such as a faster development speed, but they pale in comparison to all of the advantages. To that I say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing software without types lets you go at full speed. Full speed towards the cliff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question around strong static typing is simple: would you rather work a bit more and get invariants checked at compile-time (or type-checking time for non-compiled languages), or work a bit less and have them be enforced at runtime, or even worse not enforced even at runtime (JavaScript, I'm looking at you... <code>1 + "2" == 12</code>).</p>
<p>Getting errors at runtime is a terrible idea. First, it means that you won't always catch them during development. Second, when you do catch them, it will happen in a customer facing manner. Yes, tests help, but writing tests for every possible mistyped function parameter is impossible given the endless possibilities. Even if you could, having types is much easier than testing for wrong types.</p>
<h2 id="types-lead-to-less-bugs">Types lead to less bugs</h2>
<p>Types also offer annotations to code that benefit both humans and machines. Having types is a way to more strictly define the contract between different pieces of code.</p>
<p>Consider the following four examples. They all do exactly the same thing just with varying level of contract definition.</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>// Params: Name (a string) and age (a number).</span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting1</span><span>(</span><span><span>...</span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>params<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>}</span></span><span> is </span><span><span>${</span>params<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>// Params: Name (a string) and age (a number).</span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> is </span><span><span>${</span>age<span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting3</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>:</span> string<span>,</span> age<span>:</span> number</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> string <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> is </span><span><span>${</span>age<span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first one doesn't even define the number of parameters, so it's hard to know what it does without reading the docs. I believe most people will agree the first one is an abomination and wouldn't write code like that. Though it's a very similar idea to typing, it's about defining the contract between the caller and the callee.</p>
<p>As for the second and the third, because of the typing, the third will need less documentation. The code is simpler, but admittedly, the advantages are fairly limited. Well, until you actually change this function...</p>
<p>In both the second and the third functions, the author assumes the age is a number. So it is absolutely fine to change the code as below:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>// Params: Name (a string) and age (a number).</span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> will turn </span><span><span>${</span>age <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>}</span></span><span> next year!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting3</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>:</span> string<span>,</span> age<span>:</span> number</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> string <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> will turn </span><span><span>${</span>age <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>}</span></span><span> next year!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The problem is that some of the places that use this code accept user input which was collected from an HTML input (so always a string). Which will result in:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>&gt;</span> <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span><span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>"20"</span><span>)</span>
</span><span><span>"John will turn 201 next year!"</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>While the typed version will correctly fail to compile because this function excepts age to be a number, not a string.</p>
<p>Having the contract between a caller and callee is important for a codebase, so that callers can know when callees change. This is especially important for an open source library, where the callers and the callees are not written by the same group of people. With this contract it's impossible to know how things change when they do.</p>
<h2 id="types-lead-to-a-better-development-experience">Types lead to a better development experience</h2>
<p>Typing can also be used by IDEs and other development tools to vastly improve the development experience. You get notified as you code if any of your expectations are wrong. This significantly reduces cognitive load. You no longer need to remember the types of all the variables and the function in the context. The compiler will be there with you and tell you when something is wrong.</p>
<p>This also leads to a very nice additional benefit: easier refactoring. You can trust the compiler to let you know whether a change you make (e.g. the change in our example above) will break assumptions made elsewhere in the code or not.</p>
<p>Types also make it much easier to onboard new engineers to a codebase or library:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can follow the type definitions to understand where things are used.</li>
<li>It's much easier to tinker with things as changes will trigger a compile error.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's consider the following changes to our above code:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>;</span>

</span><span>  <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  <span>birthdayGreeting3</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It's very easy to see (or use your IDE to find) all the places where <code>Person</code> is used. You can see it's initiated in <code>main</code> and you can see it's used by birthdayGreeting3<code>. However, in order to know it's used in </code>birthdayGreeting2`, you'd need to read the entire codebase.</p>
<p>The flip side of this is also that when looking at <code>birthdayGreeting2</code>, it's hard to know that it expects a <code>Person</code> as a parameter. Some of these things can be solved by exhaustive documentation, but: (1) why bother if you can achieve more with types? (2) documentation goes stale, here the code is the documentation.</p>
<p>It's very similar to how you wouldn't write code like:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>// a is a person</span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    b <span>=</span> person<span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    c <span>=</span> person<span>.</span><span>age</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>b<span>}</span></span><span> will turn </span><span><span>${</span>c <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>}</span></span><span> next year!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You would want to use useful variable names. Typing is the same, it's just variable names on steriods.</p>
<h2 id="we-encode-everything-in-the-type-system">We encode everything in the type system</h2>
<p>At Svix we love types. In fact, we try to encode as much information as we possibly can in the type system, so that all of the errors that can be caught at compile time will be caught at compile time; and also to squeeze that extra mileage of developer experience improvements.</p>
<p>For example, Redis is a string based protocol with no inherent typing. We use Redis for caching (among other things). The problem is that all of our nice typing benefits will be lost at the Redis layer, and bugs can happen.</p>
<p>Consider the following piece of code:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> age<span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> owner<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>let</span> id <span>=</span> <span>"p123"</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> person <span>=</span> <span>Person</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>cache<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"person-{id}"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> person<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>// ...</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> pet<span>:</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>=</span> cache<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"preson-{id}"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are a couple of bugs in the snippet:</p>
<ol>
<li>There's a typo in the second key name.</li>
<li>We are trying to load a person into a pet type.</li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid such issues we do two things at Svix. The first is that we require the key to be of a certain type (not a generic string), and to create this type you need to call a specific fuction. The second thing we do, is force pairing a key to a value.</p>
<p>So the above example would look something like:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>PersonCacheKey</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>impl</span> <span>PersonCacheKey</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>        <span>pub</span> name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>        <span>pub</span> age<span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>PetCacheKey</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>        <span>pub</span> owner<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>let</span> id <span>=</span> <span>"p123"</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> person <span>=</span> <span>Person</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>id<span>,</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>cache<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>PersonCacheKey</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>id<span>)</span><span>,</span> person<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>// ...</span>
</span><span><span>// Compilation will fail on the next line</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> pet<span>:</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>=</span> cache<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>PersonCacheKey</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>id<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is already much better, and makes it impossible to get either of the previously mentioned bugs. Though we can do even better!</p>
<p>Consider the following function:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>do_something</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>let</span> person<span>:</span> <span>Person</span> <span>=</span> cache<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>PersonCacheKey</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>id<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>// ...</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are a couple of problems with it. The first is that it's not very clear which <code>id</code> it should be for. Is it a person? A pet? It's very easy to accidentally call it with the wrong one, like in the following example:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>let</span> pet <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>do_something</span><span>(</span>pet<span>.</span>id<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;-- should be pet.owner!</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The second is that we are losing the discoverability. It's a bit hard to know that a Pet has a relationship to a Person.</p>
<p>So at Svix, we have a special type for each <code>id</code> to ensure that there are no mistakes. The adjusted code looks something like:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>PersonId</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>PetId</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>PersonId</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> age<span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>PetId</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> owner<span>:</span> <span>PersonId</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is indeed much better than our previous example.</p>
<p>There is still one issue. If we accept the <code>id</code>s from the API, how do we know that they are valid? All of the pet <code>id</code>s in Svix, for example, are prefixed with <code>pet_</code> and are then followed by a Ksuid like so: <code>pet_25SVqQSCVpGZh5SmuV0A7X0E3rw</code>.</p>
<p>We want to be able to tell our customers that they pass the wrong <code>id</code> in the API, e.g. they pass a person <code>id</code> when a pet one is expected. One simple solution for this is to validate this (duh...) but it can be easy to forget to validate it everywhere that it's used.</p>
<p>So we enforce that a <code>PetId</code> can never be created without first being validated. This way we know that all of the code paths that create a <code>PetId</code> first make sure it's valid. This means that when we return a <code>404 Not Found</code> to a customer because a pet isn't found in the database, we can be sure it was actually a valid <code>id</code> that wasn't found in the database. If it wasn't a valid <code>id</code>, we would have already returned a <code>422</code> or <code>400</code> when it was passed to the API handlers.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-doesnt-everyone-like-types">So why doesn't everyone like types?</h2>
<p>The main topic of argument against types are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Development speed</li>
<li>Learning curve and types complexity</li>
<li>The amount of effort and boilerplate required</li>
</ol>
<p>First of all, I'd argue that even if all of the above were true, the advantages mentioned above are well worth the trouble. Though I also don't agree with all of the above.</p>
<p>The first one is development speed. Prototyping without types is definitely much faster. You can comment out pieces of the code and won't have a compiler complain to you. You can set the wrong values for some of the fields until you're ready to figure out the right ones, etc.</p>
<p>Though like I said above: "Writing software without types lets you go at full speed. Full speed towards the cliff." The problem is that this is just aggressive and unnecessary technical debt. You'll pay it mulitple times over when you need to debug why your code doesn't work (either locally, in the test suite, or in production).</p>
<p>As for the learning curve: Yes, learning more things takes time. Though I'd say that most people don't need to be typing experts. They can just get by with very simple type expressions, and ask if they ever hit a wall. However, if you keep things simple, you'll probably rarely if ever hit one.</p>
<p>Additionally, people are already required to learn how to code, learn frameworks (React, Axum, etc.), and so many other things. I don't think the learning burden is as significant as it's made out to be.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, regarding the learning curve: I strongly believe that the benefits of a lessened learning curve by not having to know types, are much less than the benefits of using the type script to onboard on a specific codebase. Especially since learning types is a one time cost.</p>
<p>The last point is about the amount of effort and boilerplate required to use types in your codebase. I strongly believe that the amount of effort is actually less than the amount of effort required by not writing types.</p>
<p>Not using types requires significant documentation and testing in order to reach even a basic level of sanity. Documentation can go stale, and so can testing; and either way they require more effort than just adding the right types. Reading code with types is also easier, because you get the types inline instead of in the function documentation where it's in an inconsistent format with a lot of added noise.</p>
<p>Yes, typing can be a pain in languages that don't support inference, e.g Java can be tedious:</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It seems that Java has type inference nowadays. Thanks <code>pron</code> for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37765419">the correction on HN</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>Person</span> person1 <span>=</span> <span>newPerson</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>Person</span> person2 <span>=</span> <span>newPerson</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>Person</span> child <span>=</span> <span>makeChild</span><span>(</span>person1<span>,</span> person2<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>while mother languages that have inference (like Rust), are much nicer:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>let</span> person1 <span>=</span> <span>new_person</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> person2 <span>=</span> <span>new_person</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> child <span>=</span> <span>make_child</span><span>(</span>person1<span>,</span> person2<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So having the right tools definitely helps.</p>
<p>Speaking of tools, in order to reap the benefits of your typing, you probably need to use a code editor (or IDE) that supports modern code completion that is language aware.</p>
<h2 id="closing-words">Closing words</h2>
<p>I can see both side of the arguments on many topics, such as <code>vim</code> vs. <code>emacs</code>, tabs vs. spaces, and even much more controversial ones. Though in this case, the costs are so low compared to the benefits that I just don't understand why anyone would ever choose not to use types.</p>
<p>I'd love to know what I'm missing, but until then: Strong typing is a hill I'm willing to die on.</p>

This will be the seventh nationwide EAS test.</p><p>FEMA and the FCC are coordinating with EAS participants, wireless providers, emergency managers&nbsp;and other stakeholders in preparation for this national test to minimize confusion and maximize the public safety value of the test.</p><p>The purpose of the test is to ensure that the systems continue to be effective means of warning the public about emergencies, particularly those on the national level. In case the Oct. 4 test is postponed, due to widespread severe weather or other significant events, the back-up testing date is Oct. 11.&nbsp;</p><p>The WEA portion of the test will be initiated using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system">FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS)</a>, a centralized internet-based system administered by FEMA that enables authorities to send authenticated emergency messages to the public through multiple communications networks.

  </p>

  <p>
    <em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Anna’s Archive scraped all of Worldcat (the world’s largest library metadata collection) to make a TODO list of books that need to be preserved, and is hosting a data science mini-competition.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    A year ago, we <a href="https://annas-blog.org/blog-isbndb-dump-how-many-books-are-preserved-forever.html">set out</a> to answer this question: <strong>What percentage of books have been permanently preserved by shadow libraries?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
     Once a book makes it into an open-data shadow library like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis">Library Genesis</a>, and now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive">Anna’s Archive</a>, it gets mirrored all over the world (through torrents), thereby practically preserving it forever.
  </p>

  <p>
     To answer the question of which percentage of books has been preserved, we need to know the denominator: how many books exist in total? And ideally we don’t just have a number, but actual metadata. Then we can not only match them against shadow libraries, but also <strong>create a TODO list of remaining books to preserve!</strong> We could even start dreaming of a crowdsourced effort to go down this TODO list.
  </p>

  <p>
    We scraped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBNdb.com">ISBNdb</a>, and downloaded the <a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps">Open Library dataset</a>, but the results were unsatisfactory. The main problem was that there was not a ton of overlap of ISBNs. See this Venn diagram from <a href="https://annas-blog.org/blog-isbndb-dump-how-many-books-are-preserved-forever.html">our blog post</a>:
  </p>

  <p><img src="https://annas-blog.org/venn.svg"></p><p>
    We were very surprised by how little overlap there was between ISBNdb and Open Library, both of which liberally include data from various sources, such as web scrapes and library records. If they both do a good job at finding most ISBNs in out there, their circles surely would have substantial overlap, or one would be a subset of the other. It made us wonder, how many books fall <em>completely outside of these circles</em>? We need a bigger database.
  </p>

  <h2>Worldcat</h2>

  <p>
    That is when we set our sights on the largest book database in the world: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldCat">Worldcat</a>. This is a proprietary database by the non-profit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCLC">OCLC</a>, which aggregates metadata records from libraries all over the world, in exchange for giving those libraries access to the full dataset, and having them show up in end-users’ search results.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though OCLC is a non-profit, their business model requires protecting their database. Well, we’re sorry to say, friends at OCLC, we’re giving it all away. :-)
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the past year, we’ve meticulously scraped all Worldcat records. At first, we hit a lucky break. Worldcat was just rolling out their complete website redesign (in Aug 2022). This included a substantial overhaul of their backend systems, introducing many security flaws. We immediately seized the opportunity, and were able scrape hundreds of millions (!) of records in mere days.
  </p>

  <p><img src="https://annas-blog.org/worldcat_redesign.png"></p><p><em>Worldcat redesign</em></p>

  <p>
    After that, security flaws were slowly fixed one by one, until the final one we found was patched about a month ago. By that time we had pretty much all records, and were only going for slightly higher quality records. So we felt it is time to release!
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s look at some basic information on the data:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Format?</strong> <a href="https://annas-blog.org/annas-archive-containers.html">Anna’s Archive Containers (AAC)</a>, which is essentially <a href="https://jsonlines.org/">JSON Lines</a> compressed with <a href="http://www.zstd.net/">Zstandard</a>, plus some standardized semantics. These containers wrap various types of records, based on the different scrapes we deployed.</li>
    <li><strong>Where?</strong> On the torrents page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive">Anna’s Archive</a>. We can’t link to it directly from here. Filename: <code>annas_archive_meta__aacid__worldcat__20231001T025039Z--20231001T235839Z.jsonl.zst.torrent</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Size?</strong> 220GB compressed, 2.2TB uncompressed. 1.3 billion unique IDs (1,348,336,870), covered by 1.8 billion records (1,888,381,236), so 540 million duplicates (29%). 600 million are redirects or 404s, so <strong>700 million unique actual records</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Is that a lot?</strong> Yes. For comparison, Open Library has 47 million records, and ISBNdb has 34 million. Anna’s Archive has 125 million files, but with many duplicates, and most are papers from Sci-Hub (98 million).</li>
    <li><strong>What?</strong> Worldcat library records, merged from ~30,000 OCLC member libraries. Mostly books, but also magazines, journals, dissertations, physical artifacts, and so on. We only captured the records themselves, not holding information (e.g. which library has which items).</li>
    <li><strong>Scraping quality?</strong> This varies between our different collection methods. The vast majority of records are “Title JSON”, which contains a good amount of information. There are some records we only managed to scrape through bulk HTML searches, containing only basic information like title, author, and ISBN.</li>
    <li><strong>Primary key?</strong> The IDs of Worldcat records are known as “OCLC IDs”, and appear to be incrementing numbers, ranging from 1 to (when we started our scrape) about 1,350,000,000, which is the range we scraped for. However, due to how some of our scraping methods work, we also found other ranges, that seem different from the main set starting at 1.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples?</strong> Canoncial URLs of these records are of the form <code>worldcat.org/oclc/:id</code>, which currently redirects to <code>worldcat.org/title/:id</code>. For example, <a href="https://worldcat.org/oclc/528432361">https://worldcat.org/oclc/528432361</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Competition</h2>

  <p>
    Before we dive into the data, we have to acknowledge that we haven’t had a chance yet to dive very deep into this massive dataset. That’s why we’re inviting the world to have a go at it, in a mini-competition. We’re curious what you will discover!
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The 3 best submissions by 2023-12-01 will win a year-long membership of Anna’s Archive</strong> at the highest tier (“Amazing Archivist”), which includes the ability to include your own name or message in one of our torrent filenames. We will also feature your work in a blog post.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this mini-competition, anything goes, as long as you share your analysis publicly, e.g. in an open source repository or notebook. Send your submissions to <a href="https://annas-blog.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#db9ab5b5ba9aa9b8b3b2adb2a8af9baba9b4afb4b5f5b6be"><span data-cfemail="c382adada282b1a0abaab5aab0b783b3b1acb7acadedaea6">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. We will pick the three submissions we think are most interesing, inspiring, and insightful.
  </p>

  <p>
    Join us in the <a href="https://t.me/+GNQxkFPt1xkzY2Zk">devs &amp; translators Telegram group</a> to discuss what you’re working on! And check out our <a href="https://annas-software.org/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive/-/tree/main/data-imports">data imports</a> scripts, for comparing against various other metadata datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    If instead of data science, you’re more interested in helping us do more scrapes like this, then definitely contact us right away. We’re always looking for programmers, offensive security researchers (hackers), and so on.
  </p>

  <h2>Data</h2>

  <p>
    We haven’t looked too deeply into the different fields yet, and documentation is sparse. We’ll have to fill in a lot of gaps ourselves.
  </p>

  <h3>Official API</h3>

  <p>
    Let’s first look at an official API response. To use their API, you have to be a member library, but luckily the docs are public and <a href="https://developer.api.oclc.org/wcv2#/Bibliographic%20Resources/retrieve-bib">include an example</a>, which is for <a href="https://worldcat.org/oclc/311684437">this book</a>:

    From the <code>title.mainTitles.0.text</code> field we can see that they chose the example of <em>“Pride and prejudice and zombies : the classic regency romance--now with ultraviolent zombie mayhem / by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith.”</em> I will say, this makes me immediately like the OCLC people some more. :-)
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a lot of incredible information here, a lot of which we unfortunately do not have access to in our various scraping methods. For example, there are references to other numbering systems, such as LCCN, Dewey Decimal, and a long list of <code>externalIdentifiers</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some information in this API is only available in a subset of our scraping methods. For example, the "work ID", which is useful to cluster similar works, is available in our “providerSearchRequest” records.
  </p>

  <h3>Redirects</h3>

  <p>
    One of our simplest scraping types is “redirect_title_json”. This occurs when we make a request for a certain OCLC ID, but receive data for another OCLC ID. When this happens we can infer that these records have been merged, e.g. by a deduplication process. Indeed, for the <code>mergedOclcNumbers</code> in the official API, we can find the first of those redirects in our scrape:
  </p>

  <p><code>{"aacid":"aacid__worldcat__20230929T222220Z__261176486__kPkdUa7GVRadsU2hitoHNb","metadata":{"oclc_number":261176486,"type":"redirect_title_json","from_filenames":["w2/v7/1062/1062959057"],"record":{"redirected_oclc_number":311684437}}}</code></p><p>
    In this record you can also see the container JSON (per the <a href="https://annas-blog.org/annas-archive-containers.html">Anna’s Archive Container format</a>), as well as the metadata of which scrape file this record originates from (which we included in case it is somehow useful).
  </p>

  <h3>Title JSON</h3>

  <p>
    The main type of record we have is “title_json”. This is the JSON that is loaded when going to a <code>worldcat.org/title/:id</code> page. It can either be embedded in the page itself, or made with a separate request. We have not observed a difference in these two origins.
  </p>

  <p>
    For <em>“Pride and prejudice and zombies”</em> this looks like this:

    This is mostly a subset of the official API, though this does contain some metadata indicating that this Jane Austen is not an actual author, but a "parody of" relationship (the <code>http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/w/P10197</code>) at the very end. It is unclear if the official API example is simply outdated and nowadays also includes this, or if this is actual unique information to this scraping method.

    Another search API leaked the raw internal search request in a <code>providerSearchRequest</code> field, so we dubbed its type “providersearchrequest_json”. It has the most information of all our scrapes, but unfortunately we only have a very small number of records using this method. Nevertheless, here is <em>“Little Women”</em>:

  <p>
    We think this release marks a major milestone in mapping out all the books in the world. We can now work on making a TODO list of all the books that still need to be preserved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Join us: enter in our mini-competition to analyze these data, help seed our torrents, scan and upload some books, help build Anna’s Archive, help scrape more collections, or simply become a member. We’ve already met dozens of incredible volunteers, and <em>you too</em> can help preserve humanity’s legacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Special call for LLM companies and groups:</strong> we recently launched a special program on Anna’s Archive to help out teams building LLMs with high-speed access to our collections.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks everyone.

  </p>

  <p>
    PS: We do want to give a genuine shout-out to the Worldcat team. Even though it was a small tragedy that your data was locked up, you did an amazing job at getting 30,000 libraries on board to share their metadata with you. As with many of our releases, we could not have done it without the decades of hard work you put into building the collections that we now liberate. Truly: thank you.

<p>Oddly, the single keynote address at the event to celebrate GNU’s 40th birthday in Biel, Switzerland wasn’t scheduled at the start of the day, but in the early afternoon, at 2 pm local time. This eccentric scheduling only seemed to make sense, given the fact that the speaker was Richard Stallman, GNU’s founder who has always marched to his own beat.</p>
<p>Officially billed as a “hacker meeting,” Biel’s GNU community pretty much pulled out all of the stops for a relatively small one-day event. The speakers’ roster included the likes of Nextcloud co-founder Björn Schießle who talked about “The Next 40 years of Free Software”; Matthias Kirschner, president of FSFE who opened the day with “The FSFE’s Work: An Overview for Free Software Hackers”; and Swiss Parliament member Jörg Mäder, who was on hand to talk about GNU Taler, GNU’s privacy-aware online payment system.</p>
<p>In all, the day was filled with 14 presentations if you include Stallman’s middle of the day keynote.</p>
<h2>RMS Takes Center Stage</h2>
<p>I could be wrong, but my guess is that despite the impressive speaker’s list, for many in attendance, RMS’s appearance was the event’s centerpiece. That’s interesting, considering that several years back it appeared to many of us as if Stallman would spend the rest of his life in exile. Perseverance evidently pays off.</p>
<p>His talk was short, lasting only about 25 minutes. Except for <a href="https://fossforce.com/2023/09/rmss-cancer-linuxs-shrinking-support-googs-privacy-sandbox-naming-opensuse-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the big reveal</a> at the beginning about his having cancer, it was pretty much a classic RMS talk, with a focus on Red Hat, artificial intelligence, and why kids don’t think free software is cool (hint: it has to do with wanting to be popular, which evidently was never an issue for Stallman).</p>

<p>This being Stallman, “free software” ruled the day, with the phrase being uttered 13 times during his 25 minutes. “Open-source,” on the other hand, wasn’t spoken even once.</p>
<h2>Red Hat and the GPL</h2>
<p>After a brief mention of his current bout with cancer (at the event he said that he has “a kind of lymphoma,” but later in the day clarified on his website that he’s being treated for follicular lymphoma, which he called “slow-growing and manageable), Stallman talked about Red Hat’s support contracts, which forbid customers from distributing Red Hat’s open-source software. He said the practice might not violate the GPL (“I don’t have a conclusive answer to that”), but that its approach is “antisocial.”</p>
<p>“They’re threatening to cancel support contracts for users that do what they’re supposed to be able to do, which is to redistribute the free software they’re getting from Red Hat, and this Red Hat should stop,” he said. “There’s a separate aspect, which is that support customers have to pay based on how many users are getting the support and how many machines the support is for. That’s a secondary issue that I don’t think is remarkable. The crucial thing is that they’re trying to stop users from redistributing the software, since redistribution is what it [the GPL] is for. I hope the community’s influence will make Red Hat change that aspect of contracts.”</p>
<h2>There’s Nothing Intelligent About Generative AI</h2>
<p>When it comes to artificial intelligence, especially of the generative ChatGPT variety, Stallman seems to think that much of the danger is coming from the narrative that the AI marketers are weaving.</p>
<p>“As I see it, ‘intelligence’ needs something like the ability to know or understand some area,” he said. “If something can’t actually understand things we shouldn’t say it’s intelligent, not even a little intelligent, but people are using the term artificial intelligence for bullshit generators.”</p>

<p>He said that systems like ChatGPT “don’t understand anything and don’t know anything.”</p>
<p>“The only thing that they’re good at is making smooth-sounding output, any part of which could be bullshit,” he said. “You can’t believe it ever — well, you’re dumb if you do — so I won’t call those ‘artificial intelligence’ or anything with the word ‘intelligence’ in it, because that encourages people to think that what they [generative AI programs] are saying is not bullshit. It encourages people to believe them, and that gives them the chance to do great harm.”</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that Stallman  thinks that true artificial intelligence doesn’t exist, however. He says it does, and that it’s being used both to make a positive difference in the world, as well as to line the pockets of tech shysters with self-serving intent.</p>
<p>“There are programs that can look at a photo of some magnified cells and tell you, with greater likelihood of being right than any human doctor, whether it’s cancerous or not,” he said. “There are artificial intelligence systems that can very effectively figure out what’s going to attract people’s attention. These are used by anti-social media platforms, and sad to say, they work very well. They’re very good at what they do, but what they do is get users addicted.”</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be surprising that RMS doesn’t appear to be a supporter of so-called “ethical” software licenses, that attempt to regulate who can use software, or for what purpose. It’s “not surprising,” because the first of Stallman’s four essential freedoms that serve as the backbone of the free software philosophy he advocates is the freedom to run software anyway the user wishes and for any purpose.</p>
<p>He didn’t specifically mention ethical licenses by name during his talk, but they were definitely inferred when he discussed ways of dealing with the dangers that artificial intelligence pose.</p>
<p>“We have to realize that if there are things we don’t want programs to be used for, the way to achieve this is by making it illegal to use programs to do that,” he said. “Software licenses are not the right way to prevent a program from being used harmfully. That’s not what software licenses are effective for. They’re not powerful enough to achieve that goal. And because they’re chosen by private entities, it’s undemocratic for those choices to be made by those private entities.”</p>
<p>Stallman said that in cases where the use of software poses a social threat, that use should be regulated by the rule of law rather than by software licensing.</p>
<p>“It’s legitimate for democratic countries to pass a law saying you can’t run a platform designed to maximize users engagement,” he said. “It’s not legitimate for someone who wrote a program and published it to put on it a license with that same condition, because private entity shouldn’t have this type of power over other entities, over people.”</p>
<p>“This is not the first time we’ve seen people try to do this. There are various software licenses that people publish that restrict what a program can be used for, and they always do wrong,” he added, and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/programs-must-not-limit-freedom-to-run" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed to an article</a> he wrote on the GNU website about this aspect of ethical licenses some time back. “The situation is unchanged. The real problems of AI, the harmful uses like deep fakes, they should be prohibited by law, and individuals should not make these laws but governments should.”</p>
<p>So what about Stallman’s “bullshit generators,” the ChatGPT-style generative AI programs that can’t be trusted to tell the truth or not hallucinate? They should be regulated too, according to Stallman.</p>
<p>“One thing is perhaps a labeling requirements,” he said. “Publishing any outputs made by a bullshit generator or in part by a bullshit generator should have to have a label saying ‘this was generated by a language model, don’t believe anything is true.’ That might help. And in general, not calling it artificial intelligence, not supporting the belief that they’re anything but gobbledygook. Expecting to find errors in whatever they say, this will help society become somewhat resistant to the harm that they can do.”</p>
<h2>Getting Youngsters Interested in Free Software</h2>
<p>Towards the end of his talk, Stallman wandered into territory that offered a glimpse of insight into his lack of social skills that have been extensively covered by the press, discussed on social platforms, and which Stallman himself offered as an excuse after controversial comments he made in 2019 about one of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims led to his temporary resignation from the board at the Free Software Foundation, an organization he founded in 1985.</p>
<p>“How do we get young people interested in free software?” he asked, calling the question “one of the conundrums we face in our community.”</p>
<p>“Children sometimes can get interested in free software,” he said as an answer to his own question. “I’m afraid that there is a problem that happens once the calamity of peer pressure sets in. I was safe from peer pressure. I was completely out of popularity. I gave up on trying to be popular. I just said it’s a waste of time for me to do anything trying to be popular so I won’t bother, and so I was safe. And there are some others who are safe.</p>
<p>“Maybe we can find them and interest them in free software so that they can find a community of people that is not so superficially focused on imitating everybody before everybody else imitates each other. Maybe. But we can also look at the anti-social media platforms that exacerbate this affect, the platforms on which people are trying to compete with each other to do stupid things, and all the other terrible effects that they have, which include causing psychological illnesses, suicide, lunacy, terrible suspicion of each other… I don’t have children, I don’t work with children, but I read about these things and they sound pretty damn horrible.”</p>
<p>By this point he had come full circle, and Stallman was back to being Stallman.</p>
<p>“Maybe if we prohibited recommendation engines that are designed to encourage people to be more engaged in whatever platform they’re on, all these problems might become less,” he said. “There is no reason in the world why these companies should be allowed to do whatever profits them the most, and designing their recommendation engines to suit their desires is not what we have understood freedom of expression to mean.</p>
<p>“It’s not really expression of anything. It’s freedom of manipulation; freedom of engineering people’s brains to be ideal victims. Maybe that’s something society needs to prohibit.”</p>

Ostensibly, the retail firm is the lowest price option in the market, and it offers “free shipping” to over 100 million Amazon Prime customers, for which it charges a $139 a year membership fee. The revenue from Prime does not come close to covering the cost of its logistics arm, which was $85 billion in 2022. According to one J.P. Morgan analyst, the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/amazon-prime-is-it-worth-it/" rel="">actual value of Prime is roughly $1,000</a><span> for a customer, which means that Amazon is subsidizing its Prime business to the tune of tens of billions of dollars a year. Where is this money coming from? To put it differently, how can Amazon be the lowest-cost retailer and offer free shipping, all while making money?</span></p><p><span>A lot of people have tried to argue that this is some grand technological feat, or business genius. But the answer, as it turns out, is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Consumers pay for the free shipping, it’s just a hidden tax baked into the price of what you buy through an extraordinarily clever scheme put forward by Amazon. And that’s what the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states are suing over. This hidden tax is well-known in the industry.

As one former Amazon executive explained in recalling Amazon's motivation for adding non-shipping services to Prime, ‘[a]ny competitor might launch a Prime shipping clone, or they could potentially build a new Netflix-type service, but it was unlikely that any one of them would be able to do both.’”</p></blockquote><p>Amazon’s strategy is to use Prime to build, extend, and fortify barriers to entry. One result of Prime is that Amazon now has an overwhelming monopoly share of online shoppers. And online shoppers aren’t the customer, but the product that Amazon brokers to third-party sellers, who  must either pay Amazon what it demands or lose access to the market. As one seller put it, "We have nowhere else to go and Amazon knows it." </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png" width="1102" height="806" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:806,&quot;width&quot;:1102,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:436864,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Once it achieved monopoly power, Amazon squeezed on price through fees to third-party sellers. As a third-party seller, you pay fees for listing on Amazon; for using Amazon’s warehouse services, known as Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA); and for advertising services. If you don’t pay, you don’t get put in a place on the site where consumers click. "Advertised products on Amazon,” reads the complaint, “are 46 times more likely to be clicked on when compared with products that are not advertised." And these fees have all increased steadily over the years.</p><p><span>At this point, the price Amazon charges these third party sellers has grown to nearly 50% of its revenue. It is this money, </span><a href="https://cdn.ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AmazonMonopolyTollbooth-2023.pdf" rel="">estimated at $123 billion</a><span> in total last year, that pays for “free” shipping, as well as its video service, its music service, Twitch, and everything else that comes bundled with Prime.

Good question! That’s where the scheme gets very clever. Originally, Amazon imposed contracts, as the FTC noted, “barring all sellers from offering their goods for lower prices anywhere else.” But Europeans, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, complained about these price parity agreements, so Amazon dropped its explicit contractual requirements in 2019. </p><p><span>However, this change was a farce. The firm simply did through code what it couldn’t do through contract. "Amazon,” claims the FTC, “has implemented an algorithm for the express purpose of deterring other online stores from offering lower prices." Just weeks after dropping this requirement, Amazon wrote it would not </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-reveals-additional-evidence-antitrust-violations-lawsuit" rel="">change its policies</a><span>, as California’s attorney general revealed in April. The firm even speculated that “media and selling partners may claim the removal of the clause was not only trivial but a trick and an attempt to garner goodwill with policymakers amid increasing competition concerns.”</span></p><p>Today, Amazon tells sellers that if it detects a lower price for their products on any other online store, they will be punished, which is to say, their ability to get their products onto a place on the Amazon website where customers click will go away. The net effect, as Amazon itself wrote, is that "prices will go up."</p><p><span>Indeed, Amazon tells third-party sellers to </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-reveals-additional-evidence-antitrust-violations-lawsuit" rel="">raise prices</a><span>. In 2019, a seller complained to Amazon that they were being asked “to take our prices down [on&nbsp;Amazon] to match our own [website] store.”&nbsp;Amazon’s VP of Pricing told the seller’s account manager that “[Y]ou might want to ask him to check if his sales on other sites directly or through distributors is&nbsp;putting him and us at a relative competitive disadvantage…&nbsp; He might&nbsp;get the hint. :)”</span></p><p><span>If this whole scheme sounds familiar, it’s because I described it in May of 2021 when then-D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine filed a similar though much less developed suit, in a piece called </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/amazon-primes-free-shipping-promise" rel="">“Amazon Prime Is an Economy-Distorting Lie.”</a><span> Racine left out some key details, and got a bad judge, so that case was dismissed, though it’s on appeal. California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a very similar suit, which has </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-secures-court-decision-denying-amazon%E2%80%99s-attempt-evade" rel="">survived important procedural elements</a><span> and will go to trial. Another related suit, this one class action, in Washington state also passed a summary judgment.</span></p><p><span>The overall point is that Amazon is degrading the shopping experience, raising prices, and yet somehow still gaining market share. It is able to block third-party sellers from going elsewhere, and therefore also stop potential rivals from gaining share. It’s a fairly strong complaint, and while antitrust cases are always random, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/billbaer50/status/1706745133922767041" rel="">Bill Baer</a><span>, the former Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust under the Obama administration, said it’s a strong argument. “If the FTC and states can prove even some of the factual allegations in this 172 page complaint,” he said, “Amazon is in a world of hurt.”</span></p><p><span>If this suit is resolved in the government’s favor, the remedy could be anything from ending anti-discounting measures to breaking up the firm. Regardless, there will be lower prices and discounting all over the web, and a lot of new firms will be able to enter the market. As one legal analyst told me last year, “Let's say a product today is sold for $10 on Amazon with 'free shipping'. If Amazon is forced to unbundle the FBA fee from the product price then it would cost $6 + $4 shipping. Prime makes no sense in this world unless Amazon again decided to subsidize Prime.” And even Amazon doesn’t have the tens of billions of dollars required to do that. Indeed, the stakes here are one reason that antitrust legend Bill Kovacic </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/27/ftc-bill-kovacic-amazon-khan-00118353" rel="">called</a><span> the Amazon complaint “the most important case that the FTC has brought in its 109-year history.”</span></p><p><span>One of the more disturbing trends in antitrust is how secretive courts have become on antitrust matters. I wrote this up on Sunday in </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-to-hide-a-2-trillion-antitrust" rel="">my piece</a><span> on how Judge Amit Mehta is hiding the Google trial, and </span><em>the New York Times</em><span> did a big story on </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/technology/google-antitrust-trial-secrecy.html" rel="">the “unprecedented” secrecy</a><span> of the trial, which does seem to have embarrassed Mehta. Journalists are getting increasingly angry over these redactions and closed sessions, because they want to write about stuff, and when you remove all the interesting tidbits it means they can’t. (The same journalists who cover the Google trial are also covering the Amazon complaint.)</span></p><p>Much of the interesting information in this Amazon complaint is redacted, including two particular elements I want to highlight. The first is that Amazon, like Google, has been destroying documents and internal conversations. The extent of their perfidy is not clear, since the paragraph alleging wrongdoing is redacted.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png" width="1456" height="496" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:496,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:574817,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The second is something called Project Nessie, which is an algorithmic pricing system so egregious that the FTC determined that it deserved its own charge as an unfair method of competition.
