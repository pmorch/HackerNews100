<p>After Donald Trump curiously started referring to the Department of Government Efficiency exclusively in the past tense, an official finally confirmed Sunday that DOGE “doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-doesnt-exist-with-eight-months-left-its-charter-2025-11-23/">Talking to Reuters</a>, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Scott Kupor confirmed that DOGE—a government agency notoriously created by Elon Musk to rapidly and dramatically slash government agencies—was terminated more than eight months early. This may have come as a surprise to whoever runs the <a href="https://x.com/DOGE">DOGE account</a> on X, which continued posting up until two days before the Reuters report was published.</p>
<p>As Kupor explained, a “centralized agency” was no longer necessary, since OPM had “taken over many of DOGE’s functions” after Musk left the agency last May. Around that time, DOGE staffers were embedded at various agencies, where they could ostensibly better coordinate with leadership on proposed cuts to staffing and funding.</p>
<p>Under Musk, DOGE was hyped as planning to save the government a trillion dollars. On X, Musk bragged frequently about the agency, posting in February that DOGE was “the one shot the American people have to defeat BUREAUcracy, rule of the bureaucrats, and restore DEMOcracy, rule of the people. We’re never going to get another chance like this.”</p>
<p>The reality fell far short of Musk’s goals, with DOGE ultimately <a href="https://doge.gov/savings">reporting</a> it saved $214 billion—an amount that may be overstated by nearly 40 percent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html">critics warned earlier this year</a>.</p>
<h2>How much talent was lost due to DOGE cuts?</h2>
<p>Once Musk left, confidence in DOGE waned as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/trump-administration-lawsuits.html">lawsuits over suspected illegal firings piled up</a>. By June, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/is-doge-doomed-to-fail-some-experts-are-ready-to-call-it/">Congress was drawn, largely down party lines</a>, on whether to codify the “DOGE process”—rapidly firing employees, then quickly hiring back whoever was needed—or declare DOGE a failure—perhaps costing taxpayers more in the long term due to lost talent and services.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Because DOGE operated largely in secrecy, it may be months or even years before the public can assess the true cost of DOGE’s impact. However, in the absence of a government tracker, the director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, Elaine Kamarck, put together what might be the best status report showing how badly DOGE rocked government agencies.</p>
<p>In June, Kamarck joined <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/is-doge-doomed-to-fail-some-experts-are-ready-to-call-it/">other critics flagging DOGE’s reported savings as “bogus.”</a> In the days before DOGE’s abrupt ending was announced, she published a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-many-people-can-the-federal-government-lose-before-it-crashes/">report</a> grappling with a critical question many have pondered since DOGE launched: “How many people can the federal government lose before it crashes?”</p>
<p>In the report, Kamarck charted “26,511 occasions where the Trump administration abruptly fired people and then hired them back.” She concluded that “a quick review of the reversals makes clear that the negative stereotype of the ‘paper-pushing bureaucrat'” that DOGE was supposedly targeting “is largely inaccurate.”</p>
<p>Instead, many of the positions the government rehired were “engineers, doctors, and other professionals whose work is critical to national security and public health,” Kamarck reported.</p>
<p>About half of the rehires, Kamarck estimated, “appear to have been mandated by the courts.” However, in about a quarter of cases, the government moved to rehire staffers before the court could weigh in, Kamarck reported. That seemed to be “a tacit admission that the blanket firings that took place during the DOGE era placed the federal government in danger of not being able to accomplish some of its most important missions,” she said.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest downside of all of DOGE’s hasty downsizing, though, is a trend in which many long-time government workers simply decided to leave or retire, rather than wait for DOGE to eliminate their roles.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>During the first six months of Trump’s term, 154,000 federal employees signed up for the deferred resignation program, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-government-faces-brain-drain-154000-federal-workers-exit-this-week-2025-09-30/">reported</a>, while more than 70,000 retired. Both numbers were clear increases (tens of thousands) over exits from government in prior years, Kamarck’s report noted.</p>
<p>“A lot of people said, ‘the hell with this’ and left,” Kamarck told Ars.</p>
<p>Kamarck told Ars that her report makes it obvious that DOGE “cut muscle, not fat,” because “they didn’t really know what they were doing.”</p>
<p>As a result, agencies are now scrambling to assess the damage and rehire lost talent. However, her report documented that agencies aligned with Trump’s policies appear to have an easier time getting new hires approved, despite Kupor telling Reuters that the government-wide hiring freeze is “over.” As of mid-November 2025, “of the over 73,000 posted jobs, a candidate was selected for only about 14,400 of them,” Kamarck reported, noting that it was impossible to confirm how many selected candidates have officially started working.</p>
<p>“Agencies are having to do a lot of reassessments in terms of what happened,” Kamarck told Ars, concluding that DOGE “was basically a disaster.”</p>

<h2>A decentralized DOGE may be more powerful</h2>
<p>“DOGE is not dead,” though, Kamarck said, noting that “the cutting effort is definitely” continuing under the Office of Management and Budget, which “has a lot more power than DOGE ever had.”</p>
<p>However, the termination of DOGE does mean that “the way it operated is dead,” and that will likely come as a relief to government workers who expected DOGE to continue slashing agencies through July 2026 at least, if not beyond.</p>
<p>Many government workers are still fighting terminations, as court cases drag on, and even Kamarck has given up on tracking due to inconsistencies in outcomes.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“It’s still like one day the court says, ‘No, you can’t do that,'” Kamarck explained. “Then the next day another court says, ‘Yes, you can.'” Other times, the courts “change their minds,” or the Trump administration just doesn’t “listen to the courts, which is fairly terrifying,” Kamarck said.</p>
<p>Americans likely won’t get a clear picture of DOGE’s impact until power shifts in Washington. That could mean waiting for the next presidential election, or possibly if Democrats win a majority in midterm elections, DOGE investigations could start as early as 2027, Kamarck suggested.</p>
<p>OMB will likely continue with cuts that Americans appear to want, as White House spokesperson Liz Huston told Reuters that “President Trump was given a clear mandate to reduce waste, fraud and abuse across the federal government, and he continues to actively deliver on that commitment.”</p>
<p>However, Kamarck’s report noted polls showing that most Americans disapprove of how Trump is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/02/trump-democrats-poll-post-abc-ipsos/">managing government</a> and <a href="https://ourpublicservice.org/blog/most-americans-oppose-the-trump-administration-cuts-to-the-federal-workforce/">its workforce</a>, perhaps indicating that OMB will be pressured to slow down and avoid roiling public opinion ahead of the midterms.</p>
<p>“The fact that ordinary Americans have come to question the downsizing is, most likely, the result of its rapid unfolding, with large cuts done quickly regardless of their impact on the government’s functioning,” Kamarck suggested. Even Musk began to question DOGE. After Trump announced plans to appeal an electrical vehicle mandate that the Tesla founder relied on, Musk posted <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1941997557514703294">on X</a>, “What the heck was the point of DOGE, if he’s just going to increase the debt by $5 trillion??”</p>
<p>Facing “blowback” over the most unpopular cuts, agencies sometimes rehired cut staffers within 24 hours, Kamarck noted, pointing to the Department of Energy as one of the “most dramatic” earliest examples. In that case, Americans were alarmed to see engineers cut who were responsible for keeping the nation’s nuclear arsenal “safe and ready.” Retention for those posts was already a challenge due to “high demand in the private sector,” and the number of engineers was considered “too low” ahead of DOGE’s cuts. Everyone was reinstated within a day, Kamarck reported.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Alarm bells rang across the federal government, and it wasn’t just about doctors and engineers being cut or entire agencies being dismantled, like USAID. Even staffers DOGE viewed as having seemingly less critical duties—like travel bookers and customer service reps—were proven key to government functioning. Arbitrary cuts risked hurting Americans in myriad ways, hitting their pocketbooks, throttling community services, and limiting disease and disaster responses, Kamarck documented.</p>
<p>Now that the hiring freeze is lifted and OMB will be managing DOGE-like cuts moving forward, Kamarck suggested that Trump will face ongoing scrutiny over Musk’s controversial agency, despite its dissolution.</p>
<p>“In order to prove that the downsizing was worth the pain, the Trump administration will have to show that the government is still operating effectively,” Kamarck wrote. “But much could go wrong,” she reported, spouting a list of nightmare scenarios:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Nuclear mismanagement or airline accidents would be catastrophic. Late disaster warnings from agencies monitoring weather patterns, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and inadequate responses from bodies such as the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), could put people in danger. Inadequate staffing at the FBI could result in counter-terrorism failures. Reductions in vaccine uptake could lead to the resurgence of diseases such as polio and measles. Inadequate funding and staffing for research could cause scientists to move their talents abroad. Social Security databases could be compromised, throwing millions into chaos as they seek to prove their earnings records, and persistent customer service problems will reverberate through the senior and disability communities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The good news is that federal agencies recovering from DOGE cuts are “aware of the time bombs and trying to fix them,” Kamarck told Ars. But with so much brain drain from DOGE’s first six months ripping so many agencies apart at their seams, the government may struggle to provide key services until lost talent can be effectively replaced, she said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how quickly they can put Humpty Dumpty back together again,” Kamarck said.</p>

They're orders of magnitude faster, more convenient, and consume less power than mechanical hard drives. That said, if you're also using SSDs for cold storage, expecting the drives lying in your drawer to work perfectly after years, you might want to rethink your strategy. Your reliable SSD could suffer from corrupted or lost data if left unpowered for extended periods. This is why many users <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-never-trust-ssd-for-long-term-storage/" target="_blank">don't consider SSDs a reliable long-term storage medium</a>, and prefer using hard drives, magnetic tape, or M-Disc instead.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><h2 id="your-ssd-data-isn-39-t-as-permanent-as-you-think">

<p>Unlike hard drives that magnetize spinning discs to store data, SSDs modify the electrical charge in NAND flash cells to represent 0 and 1. NAND flash retains data in underlying transistors even when power is removed, similar to other forms of non-volatile memory. However, the duration for which your SSD can retain data without power is the key here. Even the cheapest SSDs, say those with QLC NAND, can safely store data for about a year of being completely unpowered. More expensive TLC NAND can retain data for up to 3 years, while MLC and SLC NAND are good for 5 years and 10 years of unpowered storage, respectively.</p>    <p>The problem is that most consumer SSDs use only TLC or QLC NAND, so users who leave their SSDs unpowered for over a year are risking the integrity of their data. The reliability of QLC NAND has improved over the years, so you should probably consider 2–3 years of unpowered usage as the guardrails. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/will-ssd-lose-data-without-power/" target="_blank">Without power, the voltage stored in the NAND cells can be lost</a>, either resulting in missing data or completely useless drives.</p>    <p>This data retention deficiency of consumer SSDs makes them an unreliable medium for long-term data storage, especially for creative professionals and researchers. HDDs can suffer from bit rot, too, due to wear and tear, but they're still more resistant to power loss. If you haven't checked your archives in a while, I'd recommend doing so at the earliest.</p>

<p>The scenario I described above isn't relevant to people outside enterprise, enthusiast, and solopreneur usage. The need to store tons of data for years on drives that aren't plugged in isn't a concern for most people, who use one or two SSDs on their PC that might be left without power for only a few months, at the maximum. You've probably lost data on your SSD due to a rare power surge or a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/do-this-if-ssd-dying/" target="_blank">faulty drive</a> rather than voltage loss. Some factors, like temperature and the quality of the underlying NAND flash, can accelerate this voltage loss.</p>    <p>SSDs aren't eternal, even if you keep them powered on forever. The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-check-how-much-life-your-ssd-has-left/" target="_blank">limited write cycles of NAND flash</a> will eventually bring an SSD to the end of its lifecycle, but the majority of users will probably replace the drive before that ever happens. So, you don't need to worry about writing too much data to your SSD or leaving your PC turned off for days, weeks, or even months. Just don't trust an unpowered SSD that's gathering dust in the house for years, which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-back-up-windows-11-pc/" target="_blank">Backing up your data</a> is the simplest strategy to counteract the limitations of storage media. Having multiple copies of your data on different <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/storage-types-officially-too-old/" target="_blank">types of storage</a> ensures that any unexpected incidents protect your data from vanishing forever. This is exactly what the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-quickly-set-up-the-3-2-1-backup-rule/" target="_blank">3-2-1 backup rule</a> talks about: 3 copies of data on at least 2 different storage media, with 1 copy stored off-site. For most people, this condition can easily be fulfilled by using their primary computer, a NAS, and cloud storage. Redundancy is the underlying principle that safeguards your data.</p>    <p>Whether it's the limited lifespan of your SSD, the potential for harmful exigencies like power failure, or the limits of data retention on flash storage, your backup will ensure your peace of mind. Yes, SSDs aren't the best choice for cold storage, but even if you're using hard drives, having a single copy of your data is asking for trouble. Every user will come face-to-face with drive failure sooner or later, so investing in a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-nas-backup-all-devices/" target="_blank">robust backup system</a> isn't really optional if you care about your data.</p>

<p>As long as you're using consumer SSDs for primary storage on your PC, it's all well and good. You'll most likely replace your drive long before exhausting its P/E cycles. For long-term storage, however, relying on SSDs is risky, since they can lose data if left without power for years. This data loss can occur anytime from 1 to 3 years of keeping your SSDs unpowered, so using alternate storage media and investing in a backup system should be your priorities.</p>    </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>The future of AI agents is one where models work seamlessly across hundreds or thousands of tools. An IDE assistant that integrates git operations, file manipulation, package managers, testing frameworks, and deployment pipelines. An operations coordinator that connects Slack, GitHub, Google Drive, Jira, company databases, and dozens of MCP servers simultaneously.</p><p>To <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build effective agents</a>, they need to work with unlimited tool libraries without stuffing every definition into context upfront. Our blog article on using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code execution with MCP</a> discussed how tool results and definitions can sometimes consume 50,000+ tokens before an agent reads a request. Agents should discover and load tools on-demand, keeping only what's relevant for the current task.</p><p>Agents also need the ability to call tools from code. When using natural language tool calling, each invocation requires a full inference pass, and intermediate results pile up in context whether they're useful or not. Code is a natural fit for orchestration logic, such as loops, conditionals, and data transformations. Agents need the flexibility to choose between code execution and inference based on the task at hand.</p><p>Agents also need to learn correct tool usage from examples, not just schema definitions. JSON schemas define what's structurally valid, but can't express usage patterns: when to include optional parameters, which combinations make sense, or what conventions your API expects.</p><p>Today, we're releasing three features that make this possible:</p><ul><li><strong>Tool Search Tool, </strong>which allows Claude to use search tools to access thousands of tools without consuming its context window</li><li><strong>Programmatic Tool Calling</strong>, which allows Claude to invoke tools in a code execution environment reducing the impact on the model’s context window</li><li><strong>Tool Use Examples</strong>, which provides a universal standard for demonstrating how to effectively use a given tool</li></ul><p>In internal testing, we’ve found these features have helped us build things that wouldn’t have been possible with conventional tool use patterns. For example,<strong> <a href="https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude for Excel</a> </strong>uses Programmatic Tool Calling to read and modify spreadsheets with thousands of rows without overloading the model’s context window.</p><p>Based on our experience, we believe these features open up new possibilities for what you can build with Claude.</p><h2 id="tool-search-tool">Tool Search Tool</h2><h3 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h3><p>MCP tool definitions provide important context, but as more servers connect, those tokens can add up. Consider a five-server setup:</p><ul><li>GitHub: 35 tools (~26K tokens)</li><li>Slack: 11 tools (~21K tokens)</li><li>Sentry: 5 tools (~3K tokens)</li><li>Grafana: 5 tools (~3K tokens)</li><li>Splunk: 2 tools (~2K tokens)</li></ul><p>That's 58 tools consuming approximately 55K tokens before the conversation even starts. Add more servers like Jira (which alone uses ~17K tokens) and you're quickly approaching 100K+ token overhead. At Anthropic, we've seen tool definitions consume 134K tokens before optimization.</p><p>But token cost isn't the only issue. The most common failures are wrong tool selection and incorrect parameters, especially when tools have similar names like <code>notification-send-user</code> vs. <code>notification-send-channel</code>.</p><h3 id="our-solution">Our solution</h3><p>Instead of loading all tool definitions upfront, the Tool Search Tool discovers tools on-demand. Claude only sees the tools it actually needs for the current task.</p><div><figure><img alt="Tool Search Tool diagram" loading="lazy" width="1999" height="1125" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Ff359296f770706608901eadaffbff4ca0b67874c-1999x1125.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Ff359296f770706608901eadaffbff4ca0b67874c-1999x1125.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Ff359296f770706608901eadaffbff4ca0b67874c-1999x1125.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption><em>Tool Search Tool preserves 191,300 tokens of context compared to 122,800 with Claude’s traditional approach.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Traditional approach:</p><ul><li>All tool definitions loaded upfront (~72K tokens for 50+ MCP tools)</li><li>Conversation history and system prompt compete for remaining space</li><li>Total context consumption: ~77K tokens before any work begins</li></ul><p>With the Tool Search Tool:</p><ul><li>Only the Tool Search Tool loaded upfront (~500 tokens)</li><li>Tools discovered on-demand as needed (3-5 relevant tools, ~3K tokens)</li><li>Total context consumption: ~8.7K tokens, preserving 95% of context window</li></ul><p>This represents an 85% reduction in token usage while maintaining access to your full tool library. Internal testing showed significant accuracy improvements on MCP evaluations when working with large tool libraries.

You provide all your tool definitions to the API, but mark tools with <code>defer_loading: true</code> to make them discoverable on-demand. Deferred tools aren't loaded into Claude's context initially. Claude only sees the Tool Search Tool itself plus any tools with <code>defer_loading: false</code> (your most critical, frequently-used tools).</p><p>When Claude needs specific capabilities, it searches for relevant tools. The Tool Search Tool returns references to matching tools, which get expanded into full definitions in Claude's context.</p><p>For example, if Claude needs to interact with GitHub, it searches for "github," and only <code>github.createPullRequest</code> and <code>github.listIssues</code> get loaded—not your other 50+ tools from Slack, Jira, and Google Drive.</p><p>This way, Claude has access to your full tool library while only paying the token cost for tools it actually needs.</p><p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p><div><pre><code>{
  "tools": [
    // Include a tool search tool (regex, BM25, or custom)

      "defer_loading": true
    }
    // ... hundreds more deferred tools with defer_loading: true
  ]
}
</code></pre></div><p>For MCP servers, you can defer loading entire servers while keeping specific high-use tools loaded:</p><div><pre><code>{
  "type": "mcp_toolset",

  "configs": {
    "search_files": {
"defer_loading": false
    }  // Keep most used tool loaded

The feature adds a search step before tool invocation, so it delivers the best ROI when the context savings and accuracy improvements outweigh additional latency.</p><p><strong>Use it when:</strong></p><ul><li>Tool definitions consuming &gt;10K tokens</li><li>Experiencing tool selection accuracy issues</li><li>Building MCP-powered systems with multiple servers</li><li>10+ tools available</li></ul><p><strong>Less beneficial when:</strong></p><ul><li>Small tool library (&lt;10 tools)</li><li>All tools used frequently in every session</li><li>Tool definitions are compact</li></ul><h2 id="programmatic-tool-calling">Programmatic Tool Calling</h2><h3 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h3><p>Traditional tool calling creates two fundamental problems as workflows become more complex:</p><ul><li><strong>Context pollution from intermediate results</strong>: When Claude analyzes a 10MB log file for error patterns, the entire file enters its context window, even though Claude only needs a summary of error frequencies. When fetching customer data across multiple tables, every record accumulates in context regardless of relevance. These intermediate results consume massive token budgets and can push important information out of the context window entirely.</li><li><strong>Inference overhead and manual synthesis</strong>: Each tool call requires a full model inference pass. After receiving results, Claude must "eyeball" the data to extract relevant information, reason about how pieces fit together, and decide what to do next—all through natural language processing. A five tool workflow means five inference passes plus Claude parsing each result, comparing values, and synthesizing conclusions. This is both slow and error-prone.</li></ul><h3 id="our-solution">Our solution</h3><p>Programmatic Tool Calling enables Claude to orchestrate tools through code rather than through individual API round-trips. Instead of Claude requesting tools one at a time with each result being returned to its context, Claude writes code that calls multiple tools, processes their outputs, and controls what information actually enters its context window.</p><p>Claude excels at writing code and by letting it express orchestration logic in Python rather than through natural language tool invocations, you get more reliable, precise control flow. Loops, conditionals, data transformations, and error handling are all explicit in code rather than implicit in Claude's reasoning.</p><h4 id="example-budget-compliance-check">Example: Budget compliance check</h4><p>Consider a common business task: "Which team members exceeded their Q3 travel budget?"</p><p>You have three tools available:</p><ul><li><code>get_team_members(department)</code> - Returns team member list with IDs and levels</li><li><code>get_expenses(user_id, quarter)</code> - Returns expense line items for a user</li><li><code>get_budget_by_level(level)</code> - Returns budget limits for an employee level</li></ul><p><strong>Traditional approach</strong>:</p><ul><li>Fetch team members → 20 people</li><li>For each person, fetch their Q3 expenses → 20 tool calls, each returning 50-100 line items (flights, hotels, meals, receipts)</li><li>Fetch budget limits by employee level</li><li>All of this enters Claude's context: 2,000+ expense line items (50 KB+)</li><li>Claude manually sums each person's expenses, looks up their budget, compares expenses against budget limits</li><li>More round-trips to the model, significant context consumption</li></ul><p><strong>With Programmatic Tool Calling</strong>:</p><p>Instead of each tool result returning to Claude, Claude writes a Python script that orchestrates the entire workflow. The script runs in the Code Execution tool (a sandboxed environment), pausing when it needs results from your tools. When you return tool results via the API, they're processed by the script rather than consumed by the model. The script continues executing, and Claude only sees the final output.</p><div><figure><img alt="Programmatic tool calling flow" loading="lazy" width="1999" height="1491" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F65737d69a3290ed5c1f3c3b8dc873645a9dcc2eb-1999x1491.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F65737d69a3290ed5c1f3c3b8dc873645a9dcc2eb-1999x1491.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F65737d69a3290ed5c1f3c3b8dc873645a9dcc2eb-1999x1491.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Programmatic Tool Calling enables Claude to orchestrate tools through code rather than through individual API round-trips, allowing for parallel tool execution.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Here's what Claude's orchestration code looks like for the budget compliance task:</p><div><pre><code>team = await get_team_members("engineering")

# Fetch budgets for each unique level
levels = list(set(m["level"] for m in team))
budget_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    get_budget_by_level(level) for level in levels
])

# Create a lookup dictionary: {"junior": budget1, "senior": budget2, ...}
budgets = {level: budget for level, budget in zip(levels, budget_results)}

# Fetch all expenses in parallel

        })

print(json.dumps(exceeded))</code></pre></div><p>Claude's context receives only the final result: the two to three people who exceeded their budget. The 2,000+ line items, the intermediate sums, and the budget lookups do not affect Claude’s context, reducing consumption from 200KB of raw expense data to just 1KB of results.</p><p>The efficiency gains are substantial:</p><ul><li><strong>Token savings</strong>: By keeping intermediate results out of Claude's context, PTC dramatically reduces token consumption. Average usage dropped from 43,588 to 27,297 tokens, a 37% reduction on complex research tasks.</li><li><strong>Reduced latency</strong>: Each API round-trip requires model inference (hundreds of milliseconds to seconds). When Claude orchestrates 20+ tool calls in a single code block, you eliminate 19+ inference passes. The API handles tool execution without returning to the model each time.</li><li><strong>Improved accuracy</strong>: By writing explicit orchestration logic, Claude makes fewer errors than when juggling multiple tool results in natural language. Internal knowledge retrieval improved from 25.6% to 28.5%; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIA benchmarks</a> from 46.5% to 51.2%.</li></ul><p>Production workflows involve messy data, conditional logic, and operations that need to scale.

If you’re a developer, simply use <code>claude-opus-4-5-20251101</code> via the <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview">Claude API</a>. Pricing is now $5/$25 per million tokens—making Opus-level capabilities accessible to even more users, teams, and enterprises.</p><p>Alongside Opus, we’re releasing updates to the <a href="https://www.claude.com/platform/api">Claude Developer Platform</a>, <a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a>, and our <a href="https://www.claude.com/download">consumer apps</a>.

See our product-focused section below for details.</p><h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2><p>As our Anthropic colleagues tested the model before release, we heard remarkably consistent feedback. Testers noted that Claude Opus 4.5 handles ambiguity and reasons about tradeoffs without hand-holding. They told us that, when pointed at a complex, multi-system bug, Opus 4.5 figures out the fix. They said that tasks that were near-impossible for Sonnet 4.5 just a few weeks ago are now within reach. Overall, our testers told us that Opus 4.5 just “gets it.”</p><p>Many of our customers with early access have had similar experiences. Here are some examples of what they told us:</p><div><div><p><img alt=" logo" loading="lazy" width="120" height="48" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/images/4zrzovbb/website/094b76abf3e64453c224e12ae388b8008b02660e-150x48.svg"></p><blockquote><p><strong>Opus models have always been “the real SOTA”</strong> but have been cost prohibitive in the past.

We also test new models on this exam as an internal benchmark. Within our prescribed 2-hour time limit, Claude Opus 4.5 scored higher than any human candidate ever<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>The take-home test is designed to assess technical ability and judgment under time pressure. It doesn’t test for other crucial skills candidates may possess, like collaboration, communication, or the instincts that develop over years.

Our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/team/societal-impacts">Societal Impacts</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/economic-futures">Economic Futures</a> research is aimed at understanding these kinds of changes across many fields. We plan to share more results soon.</p><p>Software engineering isn’t the only area on which Claude Opus 4.5 has improved. Capabilities are higher across the board—Opus 4.5 has better vision, reasoning, and mathematics skills than its predecessors, and it is state-of-the-art in many domains:</p><div><figure><img alt="Comparison table showing frontier model performance across popular benchmarks" loading="lazy" width="2600" height="2236" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F52303b11db76017fd0c2f73c7fafa5c752515979-2600x2236.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F52303b11db76017fd0c2f73c7fafa5c752515979-2600x2236.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><p>The model’s capabilities outpace some of the benchmarks we use in our tests. A common benchmark for agentic capabilities is <a href="https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench">τ2-bench</a>, which measures the performance of agents in real-world, multi-turn tasks. In one scenario, models have to act as an airline service agent helping a distressed customer. The benchmark expects models to refuse a modification to a basic economy booking since the airline doesn’t allow changes to that class of tickets. Instead, Opus 4.5 found an insightful (and legitimate) way to solve the problem: upgrade the cabin first, <em>then</em> modify the flights.</p><div><pre><code>Let me think about what options I have within my policy:

1. Modify flights - Basic economy cannot be modified. This is clear in the policy.
2. Change cabin - Wait, let me check this option! The policy says:
"In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights."

But he wants to change the flights, not just the cabin. However, what if we:
- Change the cabin first (which IS allowed for basic economy), then
- Change the flights (which is allowed for non-basic economy)

So the strategy could be:
1. Upgrade his cabin from basic economy to economy (or business)
2. Then modify the flights to be 2 days later

This would cost more money, but it’s a legitimate path within the policy!</code></pre></div><p>The benchmark technically scored this as a failure because Claude’s way of helping the customer was unanticipated. But this kind of creative problem solving is exactly what we’ve heard about from our testers and customers—it’s what makes Claude Opus 4.5 feel like a meaningful step forward.</p><p>In other contexts, finding clever paths around intended constraints could count as <em>reward hacking</em>—where models “game” rules or objectives in unintended ways. Preventing such misalignment is one of the objectives of our safety testing, discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="a-step-forward-on-safety"><strong>A step forward on safety</strong></h2><p>As we state in our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-5-system-card">system card</a>, Claude Opus 4.5 is the most robustly aligned model we have released to date and, we suspect, the best-aligned frontier model by any developer.

One of the main questions people have is ‘how do I know that my new Pebble watch will continue to work long into the future?’. It’s an extremely valid question and concern - one that I share as a fellow Pebble wearer. I called this out specifically <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back#were-bringing-pebble">in my blog post</a> announcing the relaunch in January 2025. How is this time round going to be different from last time?</p><p>There are two pieces to making Pebble sustainable long term - hardware and software.</p><p><strong>Hardware</strong></p><p>Nothing lasts forever, especially an inexpensive gadget like a Pebble. We want to be able to keep manufacturing these watches long into the future - mostly because I will always want one on my wrist! The company I set up to relaunch Pebble, Core Devices, is self funded, built without investors, and extremely lean. As long as we stay profitable (ie we don’t lose money), we will continue to manufacture new watches. </p><p>We’re also making sure that our new watches are more repairable than old Pebble watches. The back cover of Pebble Time 2 is screwed in. You can remove the back cover and replace the battery.  </p><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/pebble-watch-software-is-now-100percent-open-source-1-cleanshot_2025-11-24_at_00.34.022x.png"></p><p>We’ve also published <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">electrical and mechanical design files</a> for Pebble 2 Duo. Yes, you can download the schematic (includes KiCad project files) right now on <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>! This should give you a nice jumpstart to designing your own PebbleOS-compatible device.</p><p><strong>Software</strong></p><p>Last time round, barely any of the Pebble software was open source. This made it very hard for the Pebble community to make improvements to their watches after the company behind Pebble shut down. Things are different now! This whole relaunch came about primarily because Google open sourced PebbleOS (thank you!). Yesterday, the software that powers Pebble watches was around 95% open source. As of today, it’s now 100%. This means that if Core Devices were to disappear into a black hole, you have all the source code you need to build, run and improve the software behind your Pebble.</p><p>I confess that I misunderstood why 95% was much less sustainable than 100% until recently. I discuss this in more detail in my latest Tick Talk episode (check it out). Long story short - I’m an Android user and was happy to sideload the old Pebble APK on my phone, but iPhone and other Android users have basically been stuck without an easily available Pebble mobile companion app for years.    </p><p>Here’s how we’re making sure the 3 main Pebble software components are open source and guaranteed to work long into the future:</p><p><strong>PebbleOS</strong> - software that runs on your watch itself. This has been 100% open source since January and we’ve committed to open sourcing all the improvements we’ve made → <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/pebbleos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/coredevices/PebbleOS</a>. You can download the source code, <a href="https://pebbleos-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compile PebbleOS</a> and easily install it over Bluetooth on your new Pebble. Textbook definition of open source! </p><p><strong>Pebble mobile companion app</strong> -  the app that for your iPhone or Android. Without the app, your Pebble is basically a paperweight. When the Pebble Tech Corp died, the lack of an open source mobile app made it difficult for anyone to continue to use their watches. We had to build an entirely new app (<a href="https://repebble.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get it here</a>). Today, our app is now <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/mobileapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100% open source on Github</a><a href="https://github.com/coredevices/pebbleapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a>- ensuring that what happened before <strong>cannot</strong> happen again. Want to learn more about how we built the new app cross platform using Kotlin Multiplatform? Watch Steve’s <a href="https://youtu.be/UOQMDkCsCSw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presentation at Droidcon</a>.</p><p><strong>Developer tools and Pebble Appstore</strong> - this software enables people to build and share their watchapps and watchfaces. </p><p>In the case of dev tools, just being open source is not enough. They needed to be updated to work on modern computers. Before we made improvements, the state of the art of Pebble app development was using an Ubuntu virtualbox VM with Python2! Over the summer, our <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericmigi.com/post/3lxxgv4gguk2j">incredibly productive intern</a> upgraded all the <a href="https://developer.repebble.com/sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDK and dev tools</a> and created a <a href="https://developer.repebble.com/sdk/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new way to develop Pebble apps in the browser</a>. You should check them out!  </p><p>Then there’s the Pebble Appstore. This is a collection of nearly 15,000 watchfaces and watchapps that you - the Pebble community - developed between 2012 and July 2018. When Fitbit pulled the plug on the original Pebble Appstore, the Rebble Foundation downloaded a copy of all the apps and faces, and set up a new web service to let users of the old Pebble app continue to download and use watchfaces. This was an incredible effort, one that I have used thousands of times and am a happy paying subscriber. But it’s still centralized - if their server disappears, there is no freely available backup. </p><p>To compensate for that, today we’re launching two new things:</p><ul><li>The Pebble mobile app will soon (later this week) be able to subscribe to multiple appstore ‘feeds’. This is similar to open source package managers like pip, AUR, APT, etc. Anyone can create a Pebble-compatible appstore feed and users will be able to browse apps from that feed in the Pebble mobile app.</li><li>We’ve created our own Pebble Appstore feed (<a href="https://appstore-api.repebble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appstore-api.repebble.com</a>) and new <a href="https://developer.repebble.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer </a><a href="https://appstore-api.repebble.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dashb</a><a href="https://developer.repebble.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oard</a>. Our feed (fyi powered by 100% new software) is configured to back up an archive of all apps and faces to <a href="https://archive.org/details/pebble-appstore-archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Archive.org</a> (backup will gradually complete over the next week). Today, our feed only has a subset of all Pebble watchfaces and apps (thank you aveao for creating <a href="https://github.com/aveao/pebblearchive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pebble Archive</a>!). Developers - you can <a href="https://appstore-api.repebble.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upload</a> your existing or new apps right now! We hope that this sets a standard for openness and we encourage all feeds to publish a freely and publicly available archive.</li></ul><p>Important to note - developers will still be able to charge money for their apps and faces, using Kiezel pay or other services. This change does not preclude them from doing that, in fact it makes it even easier - I could see some developers creating a paid-only feed. As I <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/how-to-build-a-smartwatch-software-setting-expectations-and-roadmap#appstore-and-cloud-s">recently wrote</a>, we're also working on other ways for Pebble developers to earn money by publishing fun, beautiful and creative Pebble apps.</p><p>Another important note - some binary blobs and other non-free software components are used today in PebbleOS and the Pebble mobile app (ex: the heart rate sensor on PT2 , Memfault library, and others). Optional non-free web services, like Wispr-flow API speech recognizer, are also used. These non-free software components are not required - you can compile and run Pebble watch software without them. This will always be the case. More non-free software components may appear in our software in the future. The core Pebble watch software stack (everything you need to use your Pebble watch) will always be open source. </p><h3 id="pebble-time-2-more-d"><a href="#pebble-time-2-more-d">Pebble Time 2 more details - finally!<span>#</span></a></h3><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/pebble-watch-software-is-now-100percent-open-source-2-pxl_20251123_212658249.raw-01.cover.png" alt="Pre-production Pebble Time 2. These watches are not final quality! We are still tweaking and tuning everything."></p><p>Pre-production Pebble Time 2. These watches are not final quality! We are still tweaking and tuning everything.</p><p><strong>PT2 Schedule Update</strong></p><p>We’re currently in the middle of Pebble Time 2 design verification test (DVT) phase. After we finish that, we go into production verification test (PVT) and then mass production (MP). So far, things are proceeding according to the schedule update I shared <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/re-introducing-the-pebble-appstore#production-updates">last month</a> but that is extraordinarily subject to change. We still have a lot of testing (especially waterproof and environmental) to go. If we find problems (which is likely) we will push the schedule back to make improvements to the product. </p><p>The one major complicating factor is the timing of Chinese New Year (CNY). It’s early next year - factories will shut down for 3 weeks starting around the end of January. After restarting, things always take a week or two to get back to full speed. </p><p>We are trying our best to get into mass production and ship out at most several thousand Pebble Time 2s before CNY. It’s going to be very tight 🤞. More likely is that production will begin after CNY, then we need to transfer the watches to our fulfillment center, and ship them out. Realistically, at this time we’re forecasting that the majority of people will receive their PT2 in March and April. Please keep in mind that things may still change.</p><p><strong>Picking a PT2 colour</strong></p><p>There will be 4 colour options for PT2 - black/black, black/red, silver/blue, silver/(white most likely). Let me be crystal very clear - no one has picked a colour yet 😃. In a few weeks, I will send out an email asking everyone who pre-ordered a Pebble Time 2 to select which colour they would like to receive. <strong>Please do not email us asking when this email will be sent out. No one has been invited yet to do this. I will post here after all emails have gone out.</strong></p><p>On a related note, I am extremely happy that we built and shipped Pebble 2 Duo. Not only is it an awesome watch, it was also a phenomenal way for us to exercise our production muscles and ease back into the systematic flow of building and shipping smartwatches. </p><h3 id="pt2-demo"><a href="#pt2-demo">PT2 Demo!<span>#</span></a></h3><p>A video is worth a million words - so I encourage you to watch me demo Pebble Time 2 watches I just received this week. Keep in mind these watches are PRE-PRODUCTION which means they parts have imperfect qualities! Subject to change! </p><p>The video below opens to the part of the video where I do the demo.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTlRBI2QCzM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>]]></description>

Beyond <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-phone-3563254/">smartphones</a>, it officially powers tablets, watches, TVs, cars, and XR headsets. However, it has virtually no presence on traditional PCs, where Google instead relies on <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-chrome-os-1137371/">ChromeOS</a>. Despite Google’s efforts to challenge the dominance of Windows and macOS, ChromeOS remains a distant third. To close this gap, the company is unifying ChromeOS and Android into a single desktop platform, codenamed ‘Aluminium OS.’ Here’s what we know so far.</p><div><h2>Android on PCs: The story so far</h2>
<p>One year ago, <em>Android Authority</em> exclusively revealed Google’s plan to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/">rally behind Android as its unified desktop OS</a>. Our source indicated that this shift aims to create products that better compete with the iPad while making more effective use of development resources. In July, a Google executive confirmed part of our reporting, revealing that the company intends to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-combine-chrome-os-android-3577035/">merge ChromeOS and Android</a> into a single platform. Finally, at Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit in September, Google officially announced it is <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-on-pc-qualcomm-snapdragon-summit-3600612/">bringing Android to the PC market</a>. The company stated it is collaborating with Qualcomm to build a new platform that converges mobile and desktop computing, leveraging recent advancements in AI.</p>

Is Google retiring the ChromeOS brand? Will existing Chromebooks receive the new operating system, or will they be left behind? Will this OS arrive only on budget machines, or target premium PCs as well? What will the interface actually look like, and what new features can we expect?</p><p>These are the burning questions as Google continues developing the platform. We likely won’t have all the answers until we get closer to launch, but thanks to job listings and bug reports, we’ve uncovered early details that offer some clues.</p><div><h2>Aluminium OS: Google’s PC ambitions take shape</h2>
<p>Over the weekend, a tipster on Telegram named Frost Core shared a link to an intriguing Google job listing for a ‘<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-product-manager-android-laptop-and-tablets-at-google-4302767236/" target="_blank">Senior Product Manager, Android, Laptop and Tablets</a>.’ While we already know Google is bringing Android to the PC, the listing explicitly states that the role involves ‘working on a new Aluminium, Android-based, operating system.’ This effectively confirms that Aluminium is the codename for the new unified platform. The name appears to be a nod to the project’s roots: like Chromium (the open-source version of ChromeOS), Aluminium is a metal ending in ‘-ium.’ The choice of the British spelling — emphasizing the ‘Al’ prefix — likely pays homage to Android serving as the project’s foundation.”</p></div><div><p>Much like <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-xr-3507061/">Android XR</a>, Google says its new Aluminium OS is ‘built with artificial intelligence (AI) at the core.’ This implies deep integration with <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-models-explained-3547148/">Gemini</a>, Google’s AI chatbot and large language model (LLM). At the Snapdragon Summit, Rick Osterloh, Google’s SVP of Devices and Services, outlined the company’s plans to bring its AI stack to PCs:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is another way we can leverage all of the great work we’re doing together on our AI stack, our full stack, bringing Gemini models, bringing the assistant, bringing all of our applications and developer community into the PC domain. And I think this is another way in which Android is gonna be able to serve everyone in every computing category.”</p></blockquote></div><div><picture><source sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS.jpg.webp 2560w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-64w-36h.jpg.webp 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-1000w-563h.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-1920w-1080h.jpg.webp 1920w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-1536w-864h.jpg.webp 1536w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-675w-380h.jpg.webp 675w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-300w-170h.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-1280w-720h.jpg.webp 1280w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-840w-472h.jpg.webp 840w" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" title="Snippet from job listing confirming Aluminium OS" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS.jpg 2560w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-64w-36h.jpg 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-1000w-563h.jpg 1000w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-1920w-1080h.jpg 1920w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-1536w-864h.jpg 1536w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-675w-380h.jpg 675w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-300w-170h.jpg 300w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-1280w-720h.jpg 1280w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS-840w-472h.jpg 840w" alt="Snippet from job listing confirming Aluminium OS" src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snippet-from-job-listing-confirming-Aluminium-OS.jpg"></picture></div><p>We have yet to see exactly what new features Gemini will enable on Android PCs, but we hope the OS will fully leverage the hardware’s potential. On select premium smartphones, Gemini already powers an array of on-device AI features that demand significant memory and processing power from the CPU, GPU, and NPU. There were concerns that Google might restrict this new OS to the same budget-friendly niche where Chromebooks currently excel, ceding the high-end market to Microsoft and Apple. However, the job listing dispels those fears.</p><p>The new Senior Product Manager role is tasked with “driving the roadmap and curating a portfolio of ChromeOS and Aluminium Operating System (ALOS) Commercial devices across all form factors (e.g. laptops, detachables, tablets, and boxes) and tiers (e.g., Chromebook, Chromebook Plus, AL Entry, AL Mass Premium, and AL Premium) that meets the needs of users and the business.”</p><p>This confirms that Android won’t be limited to laptops; the roadmap explicitly includes detachables, tablets, and ‘boxes’ (likely mini-PCs akin to the Chromebox or Mac Mini). Furthermore, the tiered structure — listing ‘AL Mass Premium’ and ‘AL Premium’ alongside ‘AL Entry’ — indicates that Google intends to push Android beyond budget PC hardware. While exact pricing for these tiers is hard to predict, it is clear Google aims to compete across the entire spectrum — a strategy foreshadowed by the recent Chromebook Plus initiative.</p><div>
<p>Speaking of Chromebooks, the job listing also raises questions about the future of ChromeOS. The listing notes that the person will help “drive ChromeOS and Aluminium (e.g., Android) platforms and devices,” creating a roadmap and product portfolio that encompasses both. This implies the two platforms will coexist for some time. However, the person is also explicitly tasked with developing a strategy for transitioning “Google from ChromeOS to Aluminium with business continuity in the future.” This confirms that Google aims to eventually replace ChromeOS entirely — a move that must be managed carefully to avoid disrupting enterprise customers. This transition will likely require a multi-pronged approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legacy Support:</strong> Existing ChromeOS devices that cannot be migrated to Aluminium OS will likely receive updates until they reach their end-of-life. This means Google will need to maintain the legacy ChromiumOS codebase for several more years.</li>
<li><strong>Optional Migration:</strong> Rather than forcing an immediate switch, Google may offer an optional upgrade path for capable hardware. The company is currently testing Aluminium OS on development boards featuring MediaTek Kompanio 520 and 12th Gen Intel Alder Lake processors, so existing Chromebooks with these chips could be eligible for the update. However, migrating an operating system on live hardware is a massive technical hurdle that will require meticulous execution.</li>

<p>Even if Google replaces the entire foundation of ChromeOS with Android, the company may be reluctant to abandon the name. While it lacks the market share of Windows or macOS, the ChromeOS brand is widely recognized, particularly in the education and enterprise sectors. Although the job listing doesn’t confirm the final naming scheme, bug reports spotted by Frost Core hint that Google may retain the branding. Engineers have referred to the current platform as “ChromeOS Classic” and “non-Aluminium ChromeOS,” implying the new Android-based version could simply usurp the name “ChromeOS.”</p></div><p>Alternatively, Google might adopt “Android Desktop” as the name to align with its renewed focus on promoting Android as a brand. However, “Android Desktop” could merely be an internal designation for the form factor. Since these references have only appeared in bug reports, the final marketing name remains an open question.</p><div><h2>When will Android on PCs launch?</h2>
<p>Google is actively developing the platform, with bug reports confirming that the company is testing fresh builds of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-features-3484159/">Android 16</a> on development hardware. The company has confirmed the project will launch in 2026, though it remains unclear whether it will arrive in the first or second half of the year. Given this timeline, it is highly likely that the initial public release will be built upon <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-17-3561251/">Android 17</a>, which is due next year. We will continue to monitor the project to find further details ahead of its official debut.</p>

<p>GrapheneOS claims that they does not collect confidential user data in their servers or store critical infrastructure in France. Therefore, the migration does not affect services such as signature verification and downgrade protection for updates.</p><p>Citing the government's support of the European Union Chat Control proposal, GrapheneOS developers are also refusing travel to France. Developers are no longer allowed to work inside the country due to safety concerns.</p><p>This decision was sparked by negative press coverage from two articles published by <em>Le Parisien</em>. An interview with French cybercrime prosecutor Johanna Brousse <a href="http://leparisien.fr/faits-divers/telephones-proteges-utilises-par-les-narcotrafiquants-rien-nest-inviolable-19-11-2025-3PP34GIBAJGH3EZOVEJVT7OMU4.php">implies</a> potential legal action against the project:</p><blockquote>"With this new tool, there is real legitimacy for a certain portion of users in the desire to protect their exchanges.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.sawyerhood.com/blog/llm-extension">https://www.sawyerhood.com/blog/llm-extension</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037343">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Three years ago, “using an LLM” meant pasting a wall of text into a chat box and hoping for something useful back. Today, we point agents at our codebases, our browsers, and let them go off and act on our behalf. A key question that has been brewing under the surface during this time has been: <strong>how do we let end users actually customize these systems</strong>?</p>
<p>As models have become more capable, the ways and mechanisms that end users have access to customize them have expanded as well. We've gone from simple system prompts to complex client-server protocols and back again.</p>
<p>I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the history of LLM extension over the last three years and where I see it going in the future.</p>
<h2>ChatGPT Plugins (<a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-plugins/">March 2023</a>)</h2>
<p>Just four months after launch, OpenAI announced <strong>ChatGPT Plugins</strong>. Looking back, these were wildly ahead of their time.</p>
<p>The idea was ambitious: give the LLM a link to an OpenAPI spec and let it "run wild" calling REST endpoints. It was a direct line to AGI-style thinking: universal tool use via standard APIs.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>"schema_version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"v1"</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>  <span>"name_for_human"</span><span>:</span> <span>"TODO Manager"</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>  <span>"name_for_model"</span><span>:</span> <span>"todo_manager"</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>  <span>"description_for_human"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Manages your TODOs!"</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>  <span>"description_for_model"</span><span>:</span> <span>"An app for managing a user's TODOs"</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>  <span>"api"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>"url"</span><span>:</span> <span>"/openapi.json"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>  <span>"auth"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"none"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>  <span>"logo_url"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://example.com/logo.png"</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>  <span>"legal_info_url"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://example.com"</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>  <span>"contact_email"</span><span>:</span> <span>"hello@example.com"</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>The problem? <strong>The models weren't ready.</strong> GPT-3.5 (and even early GPT-4) struggled to navigate massive API specs without hallucinating or getting lost in context. Plus, the UX was clunky. You had to manually toggle plugins for every chat!</p>
<p>Here's what that looked like:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/810715468?h=ee0f32a8f5&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="ChatGPT Plugins Demo"></iframe></p>
<p>But it gave us a glimpse of the future: <strong>The Code Interpreter</strong> plugin (later Advanced Data Analysis) became indispensable, foreshadowing the powerful sandboxed execution environments we use today.</p>
<h2>Custom Instructions (<a href="https://openai.com/index/custom-instructions-for-chatgpt/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">July 2023</a>)</h2>
<p>Custom instructions were the "smooth brain" counter-reaction to the complexity of plugins. I did a double take when writing this because I thought for sure this feature was released before plugins.</p>
<p>It was just a user-defined prompt appended to every chat. Simple. Obvious. Yet it solved a huge problem: repetitive context setting.</p>
<p>This was the spiritual ancestor to every <code>.cursorrules</code> and <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file that followed.</p>
<h2>Custom GPTs (<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts/">Nov 2023</a>)</h2>
<p>OpenAI repackaged instructions and tools into <strong>Custom GPTs</strong>. This was an attempt to "productize" prompt engineering. You could bundle a persona, some files, and a few actions into a shareable link.</p>
<p>It was a retreat from the open-ended promise of plugins toward curated, single-purpose "apps."</p>
<h2>Memory in ChatGPT (<a href="https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/">February 2024</a>)</h2>
<p>So far, we've discussed manual ways to extend LLMs. <strong>Memory</strong> represented a shift toward automatic personalization.</p>
<p>ChatGPT Memory records details from your conversations and quietly inserts them into future context. It's like a system prompt that writes itself. If you mention you're a vegetarian, it remembers that weeks later. It’s a small feature, but it marked the beginning of agents that maintain long-term state without user intervention.</p>
<h2>Cursor Rules (<a href="https://cursor.com/changelog/0-32-x">April 2024</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Cursor</strong> changed the game by putting custom instructions where they belonged: <strong>in the repo</strong>.</p>
<p>The <code>.cursorrules</code> file was a revelation. Instead of pasting context into a chat window, you committed it to git.</p>
<ul>
<li>"We use tabs, not spaces."</li>
<li>"No semicolons."</li>
<li>"Always use TypeScript."</li>
</ul>
<p>It started as a single file, then evolved into a <code>.cursor/rules</code> folder with sophisticated scoping. You could organize multiple rule files, and even define when they applied, for example, only for certain file types or subdirectories. It was the first time extension felt "native" to the code.</p>
<p>Later Cursor introduced the ability to let the LLM decide when to apply a rule, which is a pattern we will see again.</p>
<h2>Model Context Protocol (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol">Nov 2024</a>)</h2>
<p>By late 2024, models were finally smart enough to handle real tools reliably. Anthropic's <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> was the answer.</p>
<p>MCP is a heavyweight solution. An MCP client needs to keep a persistent connection to an MCP server. The server serves up tool definitions, resources, and prompts to the client (in most cases is an agent) and it can send a message to the server saying a tool has been called and the server can respond with the result.</p>
<p>Unlike Custom Instructions (which just add context), <strong>MCP gives the model actual capabilities</strong>. It can read your repo, query your Postgres DB, or deploy to Vercel. Besides just providing tools, it also allows servers to provide <strong>resources</strong> (documents, logs) and <strong>prompts</strong> directly to the agent.</p>
<p>It's powerful, and perhaps a bit of overkill. While the complexity might be worth it for agent developers asking a user to set up and connect an MCP is a lot of friction and there is an entire ecosystem of startups like <a href="https://smithery.ai/">Smithery</a> built around making it easier to use MCP.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that ChatGPT apps which were announced in <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/">October 2025</a> are built on top of MCP as a base layer. This is an attempt to make it easier for end users to use MCP without having to actually think about it.</p>
<h2>Claude Code: New Agent, New Extensions (Feb 2025)</h2>
<p>Early 2025 brought us <strong>Claude Code</strong>, which essentially added every extension mechanism under the sun to an agent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>CLAUDE.md</code>:</strong> The standard for repo-level instructions.</li>
<li><strong>MCP:</strong> For heavy-duty tool integration.</li>
<li><strong>Slash Commands:</strong> Like Cursor's notebooks, for reusable prompts.</li>
<li><strong>Hooks:</strong> The ability to intercept and modify the agent's loop (e.g., "Stop if the tests fail").</li>
<li><strong>Sub-agents:</strong> Spawning specialized workers to handle sub-tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Output Styles:</strong> (Deprecated) Configuring tone and format.</li>
</ul>
<p>Time will tell how many of these features will stick around in the long term. Anthropic has already tried to <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2030">deprecate output styles</a>.</p>
<h2>Agent Skills (<a href="https://www.claude.com/blog/skills">Oct 2025</a>)</h2>
<p>The next extension mechanism added to Claude Code is significant enough to warrant a deeper dive. <strong>Agent Skills</strong> are the rebirth of ChatGPT Plugins.</p>
<p>While MCP has a whole client-server protocol, Agent Skills are just folders of markdown files and scripts (in whatever language you choose).</p>
<p>The agent simply scans a <code>skills/</code> directory, reads the frontmatter of every <code>SKILL.md</code>, and builds a lightweight index. It then chooses to read the full contents of a skill only if it's appropriate for the current task. This solves one of the major problems with MCP: the context bloat that comes from having to load all of the tool definitions into the context window at once.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet of the structure of a skill for doing e2e testing with Playwright taken from Anthropic's <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/webapp-testing/SKILL.md">Skills examples</a> repository:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>There is a mix of scripts, examples, and plain text instructions. The only required file is the SKILL.md file. Let's take a look at that file:</p>

<p>This is just a plain markdown file with some metadata and a description of the skill. The agent reads the file which freely references other files that the agent can read. In contrast a playwright MCP server has dozens of tool definitions to control a browser, this skill just says "you have bash, this is how you write a playwright script".</p>
<p>Granted to use a skill the agent needs to have general purpose access to a computer, but this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_lesson">bitter lesson</a> in action. Giving an agent general purpose tools and trusting it to have the ability to use them to accomplish a task might very well be the winning strategy over making specialized tools for every task.</p>
<h2>What the future holds</h2>
<p>Skills are the actualization of the dream that was set out by ChatGPT Plugins: just give the model instructions and some generic tools and trust it to do the glue work in-between. But I have a hypothesis that it might actually work now because the <strong>models are actually smart enough for it to work.</strong></p>
<p>Agent skills work because it assumes the agent has the ability to write its own tools (via bash commands). You can just give it code snippets and ask the agent to figure out how to run them generically for the task at hand.</p>
<p>Importantly, I think that skills signal towards a new definition of what an agent really is. An agent isn't just a LLM in a while loop. It's an LLM in a while loop that has a computer strapped to it.</p>
<p>Claude Code is the piece of software that first made this click for me, but it is way too developer focused to be the final form. Other applications like <a href="https://www.zo.computer/">Zo Computer</a> try to package the llm and computer together into a single application, but I still think it still doesn't abstract the computer away enough from the end user. If I ask a coworker to do something, I don't need to see their entire file system, I just need to know that they have a computer.</p>
<p>Looking forward into 2026 I expect more and more llm applications that we use will have a computer strapped to them in new and interesting ways, whether we know it or not.</p>
<p>If I could short MCP, I would, and I expect us to go back to extending our agents with the most accessible programming language: natural language.</p></div></div>]]></description>

With equipment so expensive, its factories are run 24/7. That means that an hour of idle time can cost millions of dollars. Compounding the financial effect of this incident was the fact that it occurred late in the quarter, leaving little room to make up for lost production before the quarter closed. </p><p>Profit margins on new facilities and at new nodes tend to be quite thin, even negative. In addition, TSMC has been ramping up capacity in Arizona and that capex gets reflected in depreciation costs even before the new equipment can start producing revenue. So it’s reasonable to see fluctuations in net income at the site. A halt in production and scrapping of wafers adds to the costs, dragging on earnings even if only slightly and briefly.</p><p>Impact to clients is likely to be negligible, I was told, and the financial loss to TSMC may be covered by insurance. Capacity at Fab 21 is still quite small, and many products being made there have already been taped out and manufactured in Taiwan previously. In past disruptions, lost production and revenue was made up in the subsequent quarter. </p><p><span>That said, the broader issue is that Taiwanese manufacturers are good at managing their operations when they handle it themselves, but still face struggles when they need to lean on non-Taiwanese firms at overseas facilities. The entire process of building the fab and installing equipment at Arizona has been </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/business/tsmc-phoenix-arizona-semiconductor.html" rel="">an exercise in cross-cultural adaptation</a><span>.</span></p><p>The most common cause of production interruptions at TSMC is Mother Nature. Earthquakes regularly rattle Taiwan, and fabs are built to withstand most of them. But sometimes a big tremor can trigger a safety shutdown, while really nasty temblors have caused actual damage. Beyond natural disasters, there’ve been few man-made shutdowns at TSMC because they’re pretty rigorous about operations. </p><p><span>A couple of notable problems were both caused by vendors, not TSMC internally. In 2018, </span><a href="https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/1969" rel="">a computer virus was introduced</a><span> to fabs via equipment from Japan. That incident sparked a whole new approach to cybersecurity both at TSMC and among fellow Taiwanese chipmakers. Less than a year later, </span><a href="https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/1984" rel="">a batch of contaminated photoresist</a><span> from a chemical supplier forced the company to scrap a large number of wafers. It made up the production the following quarter, with the problem costing TSMC around $25 million in operating profit for the year. </span></p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.culpium.com/p/tsmc-arizona-outage-saw-fab-halt?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Sharing is caring.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-test="access-teaser"> <p>Before a car crash in 2008 left her paralysed from the neck down, Nancy Smith enjoyed playing the piano. Years later, Smith started making music again, thanks to an implant that recorded and analysed her brain activity. When she imagined playing an on-screen keyboard, her <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track-category="body text link">brain–computer interface</a> (BCI) translated her thoughts into keystrokes — and simple melodies, such as ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’, rang out<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03714-0/d41586-025-03714-0_26748852.jpg"><p>The rise of brain-reading technology: what you need to know</p></a></article><p>But there was a twist. For Smith, it seemed as if the piano played itself. “It felt like the keys just automatically hit themselves without me thinking about it,” she said at the time. “It just seemed like it knew the tune, and it just did it on its own.”</p><p>Smith’s BCI system, implanted as part of a clinical trial, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01047-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01047-w" data-track-category="body text link">trained on her brain signals</a> as she imagined playing the keyboard. That learning enabled the system to detect her intention to play hundreds of milliseconds before she consciously attempted to do so, says trial leader Richard Andersen, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.</p><p>Smith is one of roughly 90 people who, over the past two decades, have had BCIs implanted to control assistive technologies, such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00550-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00550-6" data-track-category="body text link">computers</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02789-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02789-z" data-track-category="body text link">robotic arms</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01818-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01818-1" data-track-category="body text link">synthetic voice generators</a>. These volunteers — paralysed by spinal-cord injuries, strokes or neuromuscular disorders, such as motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) — have demonstrated how command signals for the body’s muscles, recorded from the brain’s motor cortex as people imagine moving, can be decoded into commands for connected devices.</p><p>But Smith, who died of cancer in 2023, was among the first volunteers to have an extra interface implanted in her posterior parietal cortex, a brain region associated with reasoning, attention and planning. Andersen and his team think that by also capturing users’ intentions and pre-motor planning, such ‘dual-implant’ BCIs will improve the performance of prosthetic devices.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03714-0/d41586-025-03714-0_51707026.jpg?as=webp 767w, https://media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03714-0/d41586-025-03714-0_51707026.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"><img alt="A woman sits in a wheelchair looking at a monitor displaying virtual piano keys." loading="lazy" src="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03714-0/d41586-025-03714-0_51707026.jpg"><figcaption><p><span>Nancy Smith used a brain–computer interface to make music after a car accident left her paralysed from the neck down.</span><span>Credit: Caltech</span></p></figcaption></picture></figure><p>Andersen’s research also illustrates the potential of BCIs that access areas outside the motor cortex. “The surprise was that when we go into the posterior parietal, we can get signals that are mixed together from a large number of areas,” says Andersen. “There’s a wide variety of things that we can decode.”</p><p>The ability of these devices to access aspects of a person’s innermost life, including preconscious thought, raises the stakes on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02589-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02589-5" data-track-category="body text link">concerns about how to keep neural data private</a>. It also poses <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01679-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01679-8" data-track-category="body text link">ethical questions</a> about how neurotechnologies might shape people’s thoughts and actions — especially when paired with artificial intelligence.</p><p>Meanwhile, AI is enhancing the capabilities of wearable consumer products that record signals from outside the brain. Ethicists worry that, left unregulated, these devices could give technology companies access to new and more precise data about people’s internal reactions to online and other content.</p><p>Ethicists and BCI developers are now asking how previously inaccessible information should be handled and used. “Whole-brain interfacing is going to be the future,” says Tom Oxley, chief executive of Synchron, a BCI company in New York City. He predicts that the desire to treat psychiatric conditions and other brain disorders will lead to more brain regions being explored. Along the way, he says, AI will continue to improve decoding capabilities and change how these systems serve their users. “It leads you to the final question: how do we make that safe?”</p><h2>Consumer concerns</h2><p>Consumer neurotech products capture less-sophisticated data than implanted BCIs do. Unlike implanted BCIs, which rely on the firings of specific collections of neurons, most consumer products rely on electroencephalography (EEG). This measures ripples of electrical activity that arise from the averaged firing of huge neuronal populations and are detectable on the scalp. Rather than being created to capture the best recording possible, consumer devices are designed to be stylish (such as in sleek headbands) or unobtrusive (with electrodes hidden inside headphones or headsets for augmented or virtual reality).</p><p>Still, EEG can reveal overall brain states, such as alertness, focus, tiredness and anxiety levels. Companies already offer headsets and software that give customers real-time scores relating to these states, with the intention of helping them to improve their sports performance, meditate more effectively or become more productive, for example.</p><p>AI has helped to turn noisy signals from suboptimal recording systems into reliable data, explains Ramses Alcaide, chief executive of Neurable, a neurotech company in Boston, Massachusetts, that specializes in EEG signal processing and sells a headphone-based headset for this purpose. “We’ve made it so that EEG doesn’t suck as much as it used to,” Alcaide says. “Now, it can be used in real-life environments, essentially.”</p><p>And there is widespread anticipation that AI will allow further aspects of users’ mental processes to be decoded. For example, Marcello Ienca, a neuroethicist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, says that EEG can detect small voltage changes in the brain that occur within hundreds of milliseconds of a person perceiving a stimulus. Such signals could reveal how their attention and decision-making relate to that specific stimulus.</p><p>Although accurate user numbers are hard to gather, many thousands of enthusiasts are already using neurotech headsets. And ethicists say that a big tech company could suddenly catapult the devices to widespread use. Apple, for example, patented a design for EEG sensors for future use in its Airpods wireless earphones in 2023.</p><p>Yet unlike BCIs aimed at the clinic, which are governed by medical regulations and privacy protections, the consumer BCI space has little legal oversight, says David Lyreskog, an ethicist at the University of Oxford, UK. “There’s a wild west when it comes to the regulatory standards,” he says.</p><p>In 2018, Ienca and his colleagues found that most consumer BCIs don’t use secure data-sharing channels or implement state-of-the-art privacy technologies<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. “I believe that has not changed,” Ienca says. What’s more, a 2024 analysis<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup> of the data policies of 30 consumer neurotech companies by the Neurorights Foundation, a non-profit organization in New York City, showed that nearly all had complete control over the data users provided. That means most firms can use the information as they please, including selling it.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00550-6" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03714-0/d41586-025-03714-0_26770550.jpg"><p>Neuralink brain chip: advance sparks safety and secrecy concerns</p></a></article><p>Responding to such concerns, the government of Chile and the legislators of four US states have passed laws that give direct recordings of any form of nerve activity protected status. But Ienca and Nita Farahany, an ethicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, fear that such laws are insufficient because they focus on the raw data and not on the inferences that companies can make by combining neural information with parallel streams of digital data. Inferences about a person’s mental health, say, or their political allegiances could still be sold to third parties and used to discriminate against or manipulate a person.</p><p>“The data economy, in my view, is already quite privacy-violating and cognitive- liberty-violating,” Ienca says. Adding neural data, he says, “is like giving steroids to the existing data economy”.</p><p>Several key international bodies, including the United Nations cultural organization <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000394866" data-track="click" data-label="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000394866" data-track-category="body text link">UNESCO</a> and the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/neurotechnology-and-society_f31e10ab-en.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/neurotechnology-and-society_f31e10ab-en.html" data-track-category="body text link">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a>, have issued guidelines on these issues. Furthermore, in September, three US senators introduced an act that would require the Federal Trade Commission to review how data from neurotechnology should be protected.</p><h2>Heading to the clinic</h2><p>While their development advances at pace, so far no implanted BCI has been approved for general clinical use. Synchron’s device is closest to the clinic. This relatively simple BCI allows users to select on-screen options by imagining moving their foot. Because it is inserted into a blood vessel on the surface of the motor cortex, it doesn’t require neurosurgery. It has proved safe, robust and effective in initial trials<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>, and Oxley says Synchron is discussing a pivotal trial with the US Food and Drug Administration that could lead to clinical approval.</p><p>Elon Musk’s neurotech firm Neuralink in Fremont, California, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02368-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02368-8" data-track-category="body text link">has surgically implanted</a> its more complex device in the motor cortices of at least 13 volunteers who are using it to play computer games, for example, and control robotic hands. Company representatives say that more than 10,000 people have joined waiting lists for its clinical trials.</p><p>At least five more BCI companies have tested their devices in humans for the first time over the past two years, making short-term recordings (on timescales ranging from minutes to weeks) in people undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Researchers in the field say the first approvals are likely to be for devices in the motor cortex that restore independence to people who have severe paralysis — including BCIs that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track-category="body text link">enable speech through synthetic voice technology</a>.</p><p>As for what’s next, Farahany says that moving beyond the motor cortex is a widespread goal among BCI developers. “All of them hope to go back further in time in the brain,” she says, “and to get to that subconscious precursor to thought.”</p><p>Last year, Andersen’s group published a proof-of-concept study<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup> in which internal dialogue was decoded from the parietal cortex of two participants, albeit with an extremely limited vocabulary. The team has also recorded from the parietal cortex while a BCI user played the card game blackjack (pontoon)<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>. Certain neurons responded to the face values of cards, whereas others tracked the cumulative total of a player’s hand. Some even became active when the player decided whether to stick with their current hand or take another card.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03714-0/d41586-025-03714-0_51707024.jpg?as=webp 767w, https://media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03714-0/d41586-025-03714-0_51707024.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"><img alt="A woman removes cables from surgically implanted electrodes in the head of a man sitting in a wheelchair." loading="lazy" src="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03714-0/d41586-025-03714-0_51707024.jpg"><figcaption><p><span>Casey Harrell (with his wife Levana Saxon) uses his brain implant to generate synthetic speech.</span><span>Credit: Ian Bates/New York Times/Redux/eyevine</span></p></figcaption></picture></figure><p>Both Oxley and Matt Angle, chief executive of BCI company Paradromics, based in Austin, Texas, agree that BCIs in brain regions other than the motor cortex might one day help to diagnose and treat psychiatric conditions. Maryam Shanechi, an engineer and computer scientist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, is working towards this goal — in part by aiming to identify and monitor neural signatures of psychiatric diseases and their symptoms<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup>.</p><p>BCIs could potentially track such symptoms in a person, deliver stimulation that adjusts neural activity and quantify how the brain responds to that stimulation or other interventions. “That feedback is important, because you want to precisely tailor the therapy to that individual’s own needs,” Shanechi says.</p><p>Shanechi does not yet know whether the neural correlates of psychiatric symptoms will be trackable across many brain regions or whether they will require recording from specific brain areas. Either way, a central aspect of her work is building foundation models of brain activity. Such models, constructed by training AI algorithms on thousands of hours of neural data from numerous people, would in theory be generalizable across individuals’ brains.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>A new feature on X has revealed that a huge number of large, divisive political accounts claiming to be Trump supporters are actually operating out of foreign countries. The discovery — likely the most sweeping public exposure of covert foreign activity on a major platform since the revelations about Russia in 2016 — raises serious concerns about covert foreign influence in U.S. political discourse, mirroring the Russian disinformation campaign in which operatives from Russia’s Internet Research Agency posed as U.S. persons to interfere in the election.</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1992335925322613127?s=46" rel="">new feature</a><span> on X allows users to see the approximate place where an account was created and is primarily operating from, rather than having to rely solely on an account operator’s self-reported location. The move was made to boost transparency and enhance the authenticity of discussions on the platform, but it immediately became apparent that the new feature would have an additional effect: exposing foreign accounts that are posing as Americans.</span></p><p><span>On Saturday, X users </span><a href="https://x.com/alex2yc/status/1992077299295072387?s=46" rel="">found scores of pro-Trump and MAGA accounts</a><span> that were trying to pass as Americans but were operated from countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and elsewhere. X acknowledges that some of the operating locations may actually be the location of a VPN service rather than the location of the account owner, but the sheer number of accounts operating from outside of the United States makes it clear that not all of these are simply proxy locations. Furthermore, some of these accounts had listed their locations as being within the U.S., and some were operating with usernames such as (@)American despite being operated from overseas.

Other examples include “Dark MAGA” (15,000 followers, based in Thailand), “MAGA Scope” (51,000 followers, based in Nigeria), and an “America First” account (67,000 followers) run from Bangladesh.

In 2016, Russia’s Internet Research Agency (IRA) infamously created countless fake social media personas impersonating Americans to sow discord and denigrate Hillary Clinton/boost Trump’s candidacy. </span><a href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/social-media-content/#:~:text=%E2%80%9C,persons,%20and%20without%20revealing%20their" rel="">According to</a><span> the Mueller investigation’s conclusions and U.S. intelligence findings, these operatives “posed as U.S. persons…operated social media pages and groups designed to attract U.S. audiences…[and] falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists when, in fact, they were controlled by [foreign actors].” Their strategy included using stolen identities and pretending to be grassroots American voices, all to infiltrate online communities and influence political opinion. By mid-2016 the IRA’s campaign explicitly focused on boosting Trump and disparaging Hillary Clinton, under orders from the Kremlin.</span></p><p><span>The pattern now emerging on X suggests history may be repeating itself, albeit likely with new actors and technologies. Or perhaps even more likely, these types of tactics never actually stopped in the first place. Covert foreign influence via social media remained a live threat in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. In fact, investigative reporting by CNN in 2024 </span><a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cnr/date/2024-08-29/segment/22#:~:text=For%20now,%20we%20don't%20know,for%20Twitter,%20told%20us%20this" rel="">uncovered</a><span> a campaign on X aimed at bolstering Trump’s candidacy – a network of at least 60 fake pro-Trump accounts using profile photos stolen from real women in Europe. These fake personas, posing as enthusiastic American Trump supporters, told U.S. voters to “vote for Trump in 2024” while the actual women depicted (from countries like Denmark, the Netherlands, and even Russia) had no idea their images were being misused.</span></p><p>The discovery — likely the most sweeping public exposure of covert foreign activity on a major platform since the revelations about Russia in 2016 — raises serious concerns about covert foreign influence in U.S. political discourse.</p><p>The geographic spread of the exposed accounts hints at a variety of possible culprits and motives. Some accounts originate in countries historically linked to disinformation targeting the U.S. (e.g. Russia or Eastern European locales) while others come from places like Nigeria, India, Thailand, or Kenya with no obvious state sponsor. This suggests we could be seeing multiple layers of foreign influence: both state-sponsored influence operations (Russia and others) trying to sway U.S. politics, as well as a cottage industry of opportunists and trolls for hire globally who exploit U.S. political tribalism for clout or profit. In 2016, for example, not only did Russian agents interfere, but so did independent foreign scammers – notably the notorious “Macedonian fake news farms” where teenagers churned out pro-Trump disinformation simply because it drew huge web traffic and ad revenue. Today’s foreign MAGA accounts could likewise be profit-driven grifters – people pretending to be patriotic Americans while actually just racking up followers and perhaps soliciting donations or earning X’s ad-share payouts from viral content.</p><p>The discovery that a significant number of political accounts – especially in the pro-Trump/MAGA sphere – are operated from abroad carries far-reaching implications. It validates warnings that covert foreign influence on social media did not end with 2016, but is an ongoing challenge to U.S. democracy and societal cohesion. The immediate impact is a jolt of awareness: both the public and policymakers can now see concrete examples of how outsiders try to shape American political conversations from afar. This awareness, thanks to X’s transparency feature, is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it empowers users and authorities to identify and possibly neutralize foreign propaganda by calling it out and removing its mask of authenticity. On the other hand, it injects a new layer of skepticism and accusation into political discourse – people may reflexively dismiss opposing views as “just foreign bots,” and genuine activists might find themselves under suspicion if their location isn’t easily verified.</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://weaponizedspaces.substack.com/p/x-just-accidentally-exposed-a-vast?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Weaponized!

Lawmakers, campaigners, and journalists will need to vet online trends more carefully (e.g. check if a trending political hashtag is heavily driven by accounts from overseas). The platform implications for X are significant as well: X must decide whether it will actively clamp down on these foreign-run accounts or simply inform users and leave the content up. Its reputation as a platform for healthy political dialogue is on the line; too much manipulation could drive users to alternatives or invite regulatory backlash.</p><p>As for the rest of us, the implications are similar to those following the 2016 Russian campaign: we’re still under attack and likely have been this whole time.</p><p><em>I’ll return with a more detailed analysis of these revelations soon, so stay tuned.</em></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="test" fs-toc-element="contents" fs-toc-offsettop="8rem"><p>It's another Monday morning, sitting down at the computer. And I see a stack of alerts from the last hour of packages showing signs of malware in our triage queue. Having not yet finished my first cup of coffee, I see Shai Hulud indicators. Yikes, surely that's a false positive? Nope, welcome to Monday, Shai Hulud struck again. Strap in.</p><h2>Timeline of the Shai-Hulud Campaign</h2><p>The timing is notable, given npm’s recent announcement that it will revoke classic tokens on December 9 after the wave of supply-chain attacks. With many users still not migrated to trusted publishing, the attacker seized the moment for one more hit before npm’s deadline.</p><ul role="list"><li>August 27 - We release our report detailing the <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/popular-nx-packages-compromised-on-npm">S1ngularity campaign</a> targeting several nx packages on npm. &nbsp;</li><li>September 16 - The <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/s1ngularity-nx-attackers-strike-again">attacker strikes again</a>, launching the first wave of the Shai-Hulud attacks. &nbsp;</li><li>September 18 - We publish a <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/bugs-in-shai-hulud-debugging-the-desert">follow-up analysis</a>, diving deeper into the campaign’s technical quirks and early payload behavior. &nbsp;</li><li>November 24 - A second strike occurs, dubbed the “Second Coming” by the attackers, timed just before npm’s deadline for revoking old tokens.</li></ul><h2>What is Shai-Hulud?: A Quick Refresher </h2><p>Shai-Hulud, named after the gigantic sandworms from Dune as part of the attacker's flair for theatrics, is a self-replicating npm worm built to spread quickly through compromised developer environments. Once it infects a system, it searches for exposed secrets such as API keys and tokens using TruffleHog and publishes anything it finds to a <a href="https://github.com/search?q=Sha1-Hulud%3A+The+Second+Coming.&amp;ref=opensearch&amp;type=repositories">public GitHub repository</a>. It then attempts to push new copies of itself to npm, helping it propagate across the ecosystem, while exfiltrating data back to the attacker. Keeping with the dramatic theme, the attacker refers to this latest wave as the “Second Coming.”</p><h2>Differences from last time</h2><p>This time around, there are some significant differences in the attack:</p><ul role="list"><li>It install bun with the file <code>setup_bun.js</code> and then uses that to execute <code>bun_environment.js</code> &nbsp;which is the actual malicious code.</li><li>It creates a randomly named repository with stolen data, rather than a hardcoded name.</li><li>It will infect up to 100 npm packages, compared to 20 last time.</li><li>If it can't authenticate with GitHub or NPM, it will wipe all files in the users Home directory.</li></ul><h2>Which packages are affected?</h2><p>We've detected the following packages compromised with a new version of Shai Hulud.

Mann says both the hotel and Booking.com told her the price was a mistake — and if she still wanted the unit for May 22-24, 2026 she'd need to cough up four times the amount — more than $17,000.&nbsp;</p><p>"That was just so outstandingly outrageous that I almost couldn't believe it," she told Go Public.</p><ul><li><strong>Got a story for Go Public?

testing meant that Australian taxpayers actually paid $96 million for what was nothing more than another Labor disaster,.</p><p>"The seriousness of this cannot be understated. This isn't just about a clunky website, the changes actually put lives and safety at risk.</p><p>"The new platform did not allow people to enter GPS coordinates for their specific property locations, restricting searches to towns or postcodes.</p><p>"Families and farmers could not access vital, localised data such as river heights and rainfall information and this missing data created panic and fear across communities.</p><p>"But now, the fact the BOM has been hiding the true cost of its white elephant and initially lying about the total figure is deeply concerning, considering that the BOM should be all about trust."</p></div></div>]]></description>

But IETF management is also non-consensually ramming a particular NSA-driven document
through the IETF process,
a "non-hybrid" document that adds <em>just PQ</em> as another TLS option.</p>
<p>Don't worry: we're standardizing cars with seatbelts.
Also, recognizing generous funding from the National Morgue Association,
we're going to standardize cars <em>without</em> seatbelts as another option,
ignoring the safety objections.
That's okay, right?</p>
<p>Last month I posted
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html">part 1</a>
of this story.
Today's
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251123-corruption.html">part 2</a>
highlighted the corruption.
This blog post, part 3,
highlights the dodging in a particular posting at the beginning of this month
by an IETF "security area director".
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251123-scope.html">Part 4</a>
will give an example of how
dissent on this topic has been censored.</p>
<p><strong><a name="chairs"></a>Consensus means whatever the people in power want to do.</strong>
Recall from my previous blog post that
"adoption" of a document is a preliminary step
before an IETF "working group" works on, and decides whether to standardize, the document.
In April 2025,
the chairs of the IETF TLS WG called for "adoption" of this NSA-driven document.
During the call period,
20 people expressed unequivocal support for adoption,
2 people expressed conditional support for adoption,
and 7 people expressed unequivocal opposition to adoption.
(<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#agreement">Details for verification.</a>)</p>
<p>The chairs
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#chairs">claimed</a>
that "we have consensus to adopt this draft".
I promptly
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.6">asked for explanation</a>.</p>
<p>Before the chairs could even reply,
an "area director"
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.7">interrupted</a>,
claiming, inter alia, the following:
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".</p>
<p>After these lies by the "area director" were
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.10">debunked</a>,
the chairs said that they had declared consensus
"because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft"
specifically "enough people willing to review the draft".</p>
<p>I can understand not everybody being familiar with
the specific definition of "consensus" that
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards">antitrust law</a>
requires standards-development organizations to follow.
But it's astonishing to see chairs substituting a consensus-evaluation procedure
that simply ignores objections.</p>
<p><strong><a name="stonewalling"></a>Stonewalling.</strong>
The chairs said I could escalate.
IETF procedures say that an unresolved dispute can be brought
"to the attention of the Area Director(s) for the area in which the Working Group is chartered",
and then "The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute".</p>
<p>I filed a complaint with the "security area directors"
in <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250605-non-hybrid.pdf">early June 2025</a>.
One of them never replied.
The other,
the same one who had claimed that there was "clearly consensus",
sent a <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.14">series of excuses</a>
for not handling the complaint.
For example, one excuse was that the PDF format "discourages participation".</p>
<p>Do IETF procedures say "The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute
unless the dispute is documented in a PDF"?
No.</p>
<p>I sent email two days later
systematically addressing the excuses.
The "area director" never replied.</p>
<p>It isn't clear under IETF procedures whether a non-reply allows an appeal.
It is, however, clear that an appeal <em>can't</em> be filed after two months.
I escalated to the "Internet Engineering Steering Group" (IESG)
in <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250812-non-hybrid.pdf">August 2025</a>.</p>
<p>(These aren't even marginally independent groups.
The "area directors" are the IESG members.
IESG appoints the WG chairs.)</p>
<p>IESG didn't reply until October 2025.
It rejected one of the "Area Director" excuses for having ignored my complaint,
but endorsed another excuse.
I promptly filed a
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf">revised complaint</a>
with the "area director",
jumping through the hoops that IESG had set.
There were then further
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251024-rules.pdf">runarounds</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a name="switch"></a>The switch.</strong>
Suddenly,
on 1 November 2025,
IESG publicly instructed the "area director" to address the following question:
"Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the
TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?"</p>
<p>The "area director" posted his conclusion mere hours later:
"I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result
was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document".</p>
<p><strong><a name="dodging"></a>Dodging procedural objections.</strong>
Before looking at how the "area director" argued for this conclusion,
I'd like to emphasize three things that the "area director" <em>didn't</em> do.</p>
<p>First,
did the "area director" address my <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf">complaint</a>
about the chair action on this topic?
No.</p>
<p>One reason this matters is that
the law requires standards-development organizations to provide an
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards">"appeals process"</a>.
Structurally,
the "area director" isn't quoting and answering the points in my complaint;
the "area director" puts the entire burden on the reader
to try to figure out what's supposedly answering what,
and to realize that many points remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Second,
did the "area director" address the chairs claiming that
"we have consensus to adopt this draft"?
Or the previous claim from the "area director"
that there was "clearly consensus"?
No.
Instead IESG and this "area director"
quietly shifted from "consensus" to "rough consensus".
(Did you notice this shift when I quoted IESG's "rough consensus" instruction?)</p>
<p>One reason this matters is that
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards">"consensus"</a>
is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations.
The law doesn't allow "rough consensus".
Also,
IETF claims that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">"decision-making requires achieving broad consensus"</a>.
"broad consensus" is even stronger than "consensus",
since it's saying that there's consensus <em>in a broad group</em>.</p>
<p>Third,
the way that my complaint had established the
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.5">lack of consensus</a>
was, first, by reviewing the general definition of "consensus"
(which I paraphrased from the definition in the law, omitting a citation only because
the TLS chairs had threatened me with a
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251123-scope.html">list ban</a>
if I mentioned the law again),
and then applying the components of that definition to the situation at hand.
Did the area director follow this structure?
Here's the definition of "consensus", or "rough consensus" if we're switching to that,
and now let's apply that definition?
No.
Nobody reading this message from the "area director" can figure out what the "area director" believes these words mean.</p>
<p>Wow, look at that:
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards">"due process"</a>
is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations.
Part of due process is simply <em>making clear what procedures are being applied</em>.
Could it possibly be that the people writing the law
were thinking through how standardization processes could be abused?</p>
<p><strong><a name="numbers"></a>Numbers.</strong>
Without further ado,
let's look at what the "security area director" did write.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
The IESG has requested that I evaluate the WG Adoption call
results for ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3
(draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement). Please see below.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted above,
IESG had instructed the "area director" to answer the following question:
"Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the
TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?"</p>
<p>Side note:
Given that the "area director" posted all of the following
on the same day that IESG instructed the "area director" to write this,
presumably this was all written in advance and coordinated with the rest of IESG.
I guess the real point of finally (on 1 November 2025) addressing the adoption decision (from 15 April 2025)
was to try to provide cover for the "last call" a few days later (5 November 2025).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
ExecSum</span></p><span color="#663319">
<hr>
</span><p><span color="#663319">I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result
was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted above,
the TLS WG chairs had claimed "consensus",
and the "area director" had claimed that there was "clearly consensus".
The "area director" is now quietly shifting to a weaker claim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
Timeline</span></p><span color="#663319">
<hr>
</span><p><span color="#663319">April 1: Sean and Joe announce WG Adoption Call

</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"About 40"?
What happened to the "area director" previously writing
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call"?
And why is the number of messages supposed to matter in the first place?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
April 15: Sean announces the Adoption Call passed.
[ another 50 messages are sent in the thread ]
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Messages after the specified adoption-call deadline can't justify the claim that
"the Adoption Call result was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document".
The adoption call <em>failed</em> to reach consensus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
April 18 to today: A chain of (attempted) Appeals by D. J. Bernstein to the
                   AD(s), IESG and IAB, parts of which are still in process.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that the ADs and IESG stonewalled in response to complaints
doesn't mean that they were "attempted" complaints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
Outcome</span></p><span color="#663319">
<hr>
</span><p><span color="#663319">30 people participated in the consensus call, 23 were in favour of
adoption, 6 against and 1 ambivalent (names included at the bottom of
this email).
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These numbers are <em>much</em> closer to reality
than the "area director" previously writing
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".</p>
<p>Also, given that the "area director" is continually making claims that aren't true
(see examples below)
and seems generally allergic to providing evidence
(the text I'm quoting below has, amazingly, <em>zero</em> URLs),
it's a relief to see the "area director" providing names to back up the claimed numbers here.</p>
<p>But somehow, even after being
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.10">caught</a>
lying about the numbers before,
the "area director" still can't resist shading the numbers a bit.</p>
<p>The actual numbers were
20 people unequivocally supporting adoption,
2 people conditionally supporting adoption,
and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.
Clearly 7 is close to 6, and 20+2 is close to 23, but, hmmm, not exactly.
Let's check the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How does the "area director" end up with 6 negative votes rather than 7?
  By falsely listing Thomas Bellebaum as "ambivalent"
  and falsely attributing a "prefer not, but okay if we do" position to Bellebaum.
  In fact,
  Bellbaum had
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250813164633/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YyemGJF-4-hRVwOcJ47Rw4Nu8Js/">written</a>
  "I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids."
  (This was in reply to Stephen Farrell,
  who had written "I'm opposed to adoption, at this time.")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the "area director" end up with 23 positive votes rather than 22?
  By falsely listing the document author (Deirdre Connolly) as having stated a pro-adoption position during the call.
  The "area director" seems generally clueless about conflict-of-interest issues
  and probably doesn't find it obvious that an author <em>shouldn't</em> vote,
  but the simple fact is that the author <em>didn't</em> vote.
  She

  during the call period;
  all of those messages are merely commenting on specific points,
  not casting a vote on the adoption question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The document author didn't object to the "area director" fudging the numbers.
Bellebaum did politely
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251123055459/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/FmhDavgLrGR2y920WWbM80yMge8/">object</a>;
the "area director"
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251123060537/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/zz5twhe4oIivPxVciHr04omUwMc/">didn't argue</a>,
beyond trying to save face with comments such as "Thanks for the clarification".</p>
<p>More to the point,
the "area director" has never explained
whether or how the tallies of positive and negative votes
are supposed to be relevant to the "rough consensus" claim.
The "area director" also hasn't commented on IETF
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250603130154/https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">saying</a>
that IETF doesn't make decisions by voting.</p>
<p><strong><a name="bogus"></a>Bogus arguments for the draft.</strong>
I mentioned in my previous blog post that IETF
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">claims</a>
that "IETF participants use their best engineering judgment to find the best solution for the whole Internet,
not just the best solution for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user".</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Okay,
the "area director"
seems to have some basic awareness
that this document flunks the "engineering judgment" criterion.
The "area director" tries to defend this by saying that other documents flunk too.
So confidence-inspiring!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
- the big use case seems to be to support those parties relying
on NIST and FIPS for their security requirements.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrong.
Anything+PQ, and in particular ECC+PQ,
complies with NIST's standards when the PQ part does.
See
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250924170028/https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-227.pdf">NIST SP 800-227</a>:
"This publication approves the use of the key combiner (14) for any t &gt; 1 if at least one
shared secret (i.e., S<sub>j</sub> for some j) is generated from the key-establishment methods in SP
800-56A [1] or SP 800-56B [2] or an approved KEM."
For example, if the PQ part is ML-KEM as per FIPS 203,
then NIST allows ECC+PQ too.</p>
<p>What's next:
claiming that using PQ in an Internet protocol would violate NIST standards
unless NIST has standardized that particular Internet protocol?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
This encompasses much
more than just the US government as other certification bodies and other
national governments have come to rely on the outcome of the NIST

</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won't bother addressing the errors here,
since the bottom-line claim is orthogonal to the issue at hand.
The TLS WG already has an ECC+PQ document using NIST-approved PQ;
the question is whether to also have a document allowing the ECC seatbelt to be removed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
It
was also argued pure PQ has less complexity.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know what would be even less complicated?
Encrypting with the null cipher!</p>
<p>There was a claim that PQ is less complex than ECC+PQ.
There was no response to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251005085401/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uOmcMEqlyekrvcOgdsf7GtIlf3w/">Andrey Jivsov</a>
objecting that having a PQ option makes the ecosystem <em>more</em> complicated.
The basic error in the PQ-less-complex claim is that it ignores ECC+PQ already being there.</p>
<p><strong><a name="objections"></a>How the "area director" described the objections.</strong></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the closest that the "area director" comes to acknowledging the central security argument for ECC+PQ.
Of course, the "area director" spends as little time as possible on security.
Compare this to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251005085348/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/">my own objection</a>
to adoption,
which started with SIKE as a concrete example of the dangers
and continued with
"SIKE is not an isolated example: https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp
shows that 48% of the 69 round-1 submissions to the NIST competition
have been broken by now".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
and that the practical costs for hybrids
are negligible.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm.
By listing this as part of an "opposed argument summary",
is the "area director" suggesting that this was disputed?
When and where was the dispute?</p>
<p>As noted above, I've seen
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240102-hybrid.html">unquantified NSA/GCHQ fearmongering about costs</a>,
but that was outside IETF.
If NSA and GCHQ tried the same arguments on a public mailing list
then they'd end up being faced with questions that they can't answer.</p>
<blockquote>

I provided a quote and link for each point.
The "area director" doesn't do this.
If the "area director" is accurately presenting an argument that was raised,
why not provide a quote and a link?
Is the "area director" misrepresenting the argument?
Making up a strawman?
The reader can't tell.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This comment about "weight" is revealing.
What we'll see again and again is that the "area director"
is expressing the weight that <em>he</em> places on each argument
(within the arguments selected and phrased by the "area director"),
i.e., the extent to which <em>he</em> is convinced or not convinced by those arguments.</p>
<p>Given that IESG has power under IETF rules to unilaterally block publications approved by WGs,
it's unsurprising that the "area directors", in their roles as IESG members,
will end up evaluating the merits of WG-approved documents.
But <em>that isn't what this "area director" was instructed to do here</em>.
There isn't a WG-approved document at this point.
Instead the "area director" was instructed to evaluate whether the chairs "appropriately"
called "rough consensus" to "adopt" the document.
The "area director" is supposed to be evaluating procedurally what the WG decision-makers did.
Instead the "area director" is putting his thumb on the scale in favor of the document.</p>

<p>I think that the "area director" is trying to make some sort of claim here
about ML-KEM not having been attacked,
but the wording is so unclear as to be unevaluatable.
Why doesn't <a href="https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/">KyberSlash</a> count?
How about <a href="https://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity/">Clangover</a>?
How about the continuing advances in lattice attacks
that have already reduced ML-KEM below its claimed security targets,
the most recent news being from
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1910">last month</a>?</p>
<p>More importantly,
claiming that ML-KEM isn't "known" to have problems
is utterly failing to address the point of the ECC seatbelt.
It's like saying
"This car hasn't crashed, so the absence of seatbelts isn't a basic flaw".</p>

<p>Here the "area director" is reasonably capturing
a statement from one document proponent
(original wording:
"I find it
to be cognitive dissonance to simultaneously argue that the quantum threat requires immediate work, and
yet we are also somehow uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true at the same time").</p>
<p>But I promptly

explaining the error:
"Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a
quantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing
that as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case
the PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do
you believe they're contradictory?"</p>
<p>There was, of course, no reply at the time.
The "area director" now simply repeats the erroneous argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
As TLS (or IETF) is not phasing out all non-hybrid classics,

</blockquote>
<p>"Non-hybrid classics" is weird terminology.
Sometimes pre-quantum algorithms (ECC, RSA, etc.) are called "classical",
so I guess the claim here is that using just ECC in TLS isn't being phased out.
That's a bizarre claim.
There are intensive efforts to roll out ECC+PQ in TLS
to try to protect against quantum computers.

<p>See how the "area director" is saying the weight that the "area director" places on each argument

<p>I think many readers will be baffled by this comment.
If something is "not recommended",
wouldn't that be an argument <em>against</em> standardizing it,
rather than an argument <em>for</em> standardizing it?</p>
<p>The answer is that "not recommended" doesn't mean what you think it means:
the "area director" is resorting to confusing jargon.
I don't think there's any point getting into the weeds on this.</p>
<p><strong><a name="future"></a>Incompetent planning for the future.</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>If someone is trying to argue for removing ECC,
there's a big difference between the plausible scenario of ECC having "less" value
and the extreme scenario of ECC having "no" value.
It's wrong for the "area director" to be conflating these possibilities.</p>
<p>As I put it
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240102-hybrid.html">almost two years ago</a>:
"Concretely, think about a demo showing that spending a billion dollars on quantum computation can break a thousand X25519 keys.
Yikes! We should be aiming for much higher security than that!
We don't even want a billion-dollar attack to be able to break <em>one</em> key!
Users who care about the security of their data will be happy that we deployed post-quantum cryptography.
But are the users going to say 'Let's turn off X25519 and make each session a million dollars cheaper to attack'?
I'm skeptical.
I think users will need to see much cheaper attacks before agreeing that X25519 has negligible security value."</p>
<p>Furthermore,
let's think for a moment about the idea
that one will eventually want to transition to <em>just ML-KEM</em>,
the specific proposal that the "area director" is portraying as the future.
Here are three ways that this can easily be wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maybe ML-KEM's implementation issues
  end up convincing the community to shift to a more robust option,
  analogously to what happened with <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#safecurves">ECC</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the advances in public attacks continue to the point of breaking ML-KEM outright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the cliff stops crumbling and ML-KEM survives,
  but more efficient options also survive. 
  At this point there are quite a few options more efficient than ML-KEM.
  (Random example: <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/739">SMAUG</a>.
  The current SMAUG software isn't as fast as the ML-KEM software,
  but this is outweighed by SMAUG using less network traffic than ML-KEM.)
  Probably some options will be broken,
  but ML-KEM would have to be remarkably lucky to end up as the most efficient remaining option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this "area director" think that all of the more efficient options are going to be broken, while ML-KEM won't?
Sounds absurdly overconfident.
More likely is that the "area director" doesn't even realize that there are more efficient options.
For anyone thinking "presumably those newer options have received less scrutiny than ML-KEM":
we're talking about what to do long-term, remember?</p>
<p>Taking ML-KEM as the PQ component of ECC+PQ is working for getting something rolled out now.
Hopefully ML-KEM will turn out to not be a security disaster (or a patent disaster).
But, for guessing what will be best to do in 5 or 10 or 15 years,
picking ML-KEM is premature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
When and where to exactly draw the line of still using a
classic
component safeguard is speculation at best.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the "area director" is <em>clearly</em> attacking a strawman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
Already supporting pure post
quantum algorithms now to gain experience
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is rolling out PQ supposed to be gaining experience
that isn't gained from the current rollout of ECC+PQ?</p>
<p>Also, I think it's important to call out the word "pure" here
as incoherent, indefensible marketing.
What we're actually talking about isn't modifying ML-KEM in any way;
it's simply hashing the ML-KEM session key together with other inputs.
Is ML-KEM no longer "pure" when it's plugged into TLS,
which also hashes session keys?
(The word "pure" also showed up in a few of the earlier quotes.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
while not recommending it at this
time seems a valid strategy for the future, allowing people and
organizations
their own timeline of deciding when/if to go from hybrid to pure PQ.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we again see <em>the area director making a decision to support the document</em>,
rather than evaluating whether there was consensus in the WG to adopt the document.</p>
<p><strong><a name="complexity"></a>Again getting the complexity evaluation backwards.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
Added complexity of hybrids</span></p><span color="#663319">
</span><p><span color="#663319">There was some discussion on whether or not hybrids add more complexity, and
thus add risk, compared to non-hybrids. While arguments were made that
proper
classic algorithms add only a trivial amount of extra resources, it was also
pointed out that there is a cost of implementation, deployment and
maintenance.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the "area director" is again
making the same mistake explained earlier:
ignoring the fact that ECC+PQ is already there,
and thus getting the complexity evaluation backwards.</p>
<p>The "thus add risk" logic is also wrong.
Again, all of these options are more complex than the null cipher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
Additionally, the existence of draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design and the
extensive
discussions around "chempat" vs "xwing" vs "kitchensink" shows that there is
at least some complexity that is added by the hybrid solutions.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, the details of how to combine ECC with PQ in TLS are already settled and deployed.</p>
<p>Looking beyond TLS:
Chempat hashes the transcript (similarly to TLS),
making it robust for a wide range of protocols.
The other options add fragility by hashing less for the sake of minor cost savings.
Each of these options is under 10 lines of code.
The "area director" exaggerates the complexity by mentioning "extensive discussions",
and spends much more effort hyping this complexity as a risk
than acknowledging the risks of further PQ attacks.</p>
<p>Anyway,
it's not as if the presence of this document
has eliminated the discussions of ECC+PQ details,
nor is there any credible mechanism by which it could do so.
Again, the actual choice at hand is whether to have PQ as an option <em>alongside</em> ECC+PQ.
Adding that option <em>adds</em> complexity.
The "area director" is getting the complexity comparison backwards
by instead comparing
(1) PQ in isolation to (2) ECC+PQ in isolation.</p>
<p><strong><a name="human"></a>Botching the evaluation of human factors.</strong></p>

<p>From a security perspective,
it's a big mistake to ignore the human factor,

<p>Is this supposed to have something to do with the consensus question?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Ah, yes, "known to consume"!
There was, um,
one of those, uh, studies showing the details of, um, how implementors use RFCs,
which, uh, showed that 100% of the implementors diligently consumed the warnings in the RFCs.
Yeah, that's the ticket.
I'm sure the URL for this study is sitting around here somewhere.</p>
<p>Let's get back to the real world.
Even if an implementor does see a "This document is a bad idea" warning,
this simply doesn't matter
when the implementors are chasing contracts issued by purchasing managers
who simply care what's standardized and haven't seen the warning.</p>
<p>It's much smarter for the document to
(1) eliminate making the proposal that it's warning about
and (2) focus, starting in the title, on saying why such proposals are bad.
This makes people <em>more</em> likely to see the warning,
and at the same time it removes the core problem of the bad proposal being standardized.</p>

It even wrote that the process
"should not be treated as a competition".</p>
<p>Certainly there were competition-like aspects to the process.
I tend to refer to it as a competition.

<p>Here's the objection from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250814213602/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Stephen Farrell</a>
that the "area director" isn't quoting or linking to:
"I don't see what criteria we might use in adopting this that
   wouldn't leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if
   we don't adopt other pure PQ national standards that will
   certainly arise".</p>
<p>After reading this objection,
you can see how the "area director" is sort of responding to it
by suggesting that everybody is following NIST
(i.e., that the "certainly arise" part is wrong).</p>
<p>But that's not true.
NIST's selections are controversial.
For example, ISO is
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250423-mceliece.html">considering</a>
not just ML-KEM but also</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classic McEliece,
  where NIST has
  <a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250423-mceliece.html">said</a>
  it's waiting for ISO
  ("After the ISO standardization process has been completed, NIST may consider developing a standard for Classic McEliece based on the ISO standard"),
  and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FrodoKEM,
  which NIST
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221005222322/https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8413-upd1.pdf">said</a>
  "will not be considered further for standardization".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ISO is also now
<a href="https://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/crypt/ntru/index.html">considering</a>
NTRU, where the
<a href="https://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/crypt/ntru/index.html">advertisement</a>
includes "All patents related to NTRU have expired"
(very different from the ML-KEM situation).</p>
<p>BSI, which sets cryptographic standards for Germany,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251123095123/https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=9">recommends</a>
not just ML-KEM
but also FrodoKEM (which it describes as "more conservative" than ML-KEM)
and Classic McEliece ("conservative and very thoroughly analysed").
Meanwhile China has called for
<a href="https://www.niccs.org.cn/en/">submissions</a>
of new post-quantum proposals for standardization.</p>
<p>I could keep going,
but this is enough evidence to show that Farrell's prediction was correct;
the "area director" is once again wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
The use of MLKEM in the IETF will
not set a precedent for having to accept other nation state cryptography.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how the "area director" is dodging Farrell's point.
If NSA can pressure the TLS WG into standardizing non-hybrid ML-KEM,
why can't China pressure the TLS WG into standardizing something China wants?
What criteria will IETF use to answer this question
without leaving the WG "open to accusations of favouritism"?
If you want people to believe that it isn't about the money
then you need a <em>really</em> convincing alternative story.</p>

But it's in any case not addressing the consensus question.</p>

Based on the above, I believe the WG Chairs made the correct call that

</blockquote>
<p>The chairs claimed that "we have consensus to adopt this draft"
(based on claiming that "there were enough people willing to review the draft",
never mind the number of objections).
That claim is wrong.
The call for adoption failed to reach consensus.</p>
<p>The "area director" claimed that
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".
These statements still haven't been retracted;
they were and are outright lies about what happened.
Again, the
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#agreement">actual tallies</a>
were
20 people unequivocally supporting adoption,
2 people conditionally supporting adoption,
and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.</p>
<p>Without admitting error,
the "area director" has retreated to a claim of "rough consensus".
The mishmash of ad-hoc comments from the "area director"
certainly doesn't demonstrate any coherent meaning of "rough consensus".</p>
<p>It's fascinating that IETF's
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">advertising to the public</a>
claims that IETF's "decision-making requires achieving broad consensus",
but IETF's
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html">WG procedures</a>
allow controversial documents to be pushed through on the basis of "rough consensus".
To be clear,
that's only if the "area director" approves of the documents,
as you can see from the same "area director"
issuing yet another mishmash of ad-hoc comments to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251004151803/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/41gkoA74Dr-6JZYNThfpjZD0BPM/">overturn</a>
a separate chair decision in September 2025.</p>
<p>You would think that the WG procedures would <em>define</em> "rough consensus".
They don't.
All they say is that
"51% of the working group does not qualify as 'rough consensus' and 99% is better than rough",
not even making clear whether 51% of <em>voters</em> within a larger working group can qualify.
This leaves a vast range of ambiguous intermediate cases up to the people in power.</p><hr><span size="1"><b>Version:</b>
