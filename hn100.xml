<h2>Apple's unlawful evil (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/06/america-with-chinese-characteristics/#orphaned-syrian-refugees-need-not-apply">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>Apple has removed ICEBlock, a totally legal app that helps people track the movements of the masked snatch-squads who illegally terrorize brown people in America's cities, capitulating to a warrantless demand from Trump's DoJ boss Pam Bondi:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.404media.co/iceblock-owner-after-apple-removes-app-we-are-determined-to-fight-this/">https://www.404media.co/iceblock-owner-after-apple-removes-app-we-are-determined-to-fight-this/</a></p>
<p>In killing ICEBlock, Apple insists that it is only complying with lawful orders, which is patently untrue. Pam Bondi has no authority to order the censorship of this legal speech tool, which is likely why she didn't seek a court order and instead merely rage-tweeted about it. This was sufficient to get Apple CEO Tim Cook, the billionaire who moved Apple's manufacturing to Chinese sweatshops where working conditions are so brutal that they require suicide nets, to cave in.</p>
<p>Apple does not permit its iPhone customers to install software unless it is delivered via their App Store. They claim they do so in order to protect their customers from their customers' own bad choices about which apps to install. But time and again, Apple has shown that they exercise this control over their users to pursue their own ends, blocking:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dictionary (because it contained swear words);
</li>
<li>
<p>A game that simulated working in an Apple sweatshop;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An informative app that cataloged civilian casualties of US drone strikes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Tumblr app because some Tumblr blogs contained adult content; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working VPN apps for the entire nation of China.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple uses its app store control to extract 30 cents out of every dollar spent by its customers in the apps they use. That's a 30%, economy-wide, worldwide tax on news outlets and podcasts that collects subscriptions through apps, Patreon performers whose subscribers pay by app and games publishers who sell via the app store.</p>
<p>Apple also uses its app store control to block rival browser engines (every browser on iOS is just a reskinned version of Safari). Apple's own browser engine, Webkit, is riddled with longstanding, grave security vulnerabilities, and there is no way to distribute more secure browsers on iOS:</p>
<p><a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apples-browser-engine-ban-persists-even-under-the-dma/">https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apples-browser-engine-ban-persists-even-under-the-dma/</a></p>
<p>Apple claims that it must be able to override its customers' choices about which software they'd like to run, lest those customers make foolish software choices and compromise their own security. Bruce Schneier calls this "feudal security," in which a digital warlord offers you sanctuary from the internet's roving bandits within the mercenary-studded walls of his impenetrable fortress. The problem is that when the <em>warlord</em> decides to attack <em>you</em>, the fortress becomes a prison, and you are rendered helpless:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained</a></p>
<p>Normally, the safety problems of feudal security are <em>digital</em>, but with ICEBlock, they are very, very physical. ICE is kidnapping our neighbors and sending them to offshore and onshore gulags. Of the 1,600 people illegally detained in Alligator Auschwitz, <em>two thirds</em> cannot be located. They have disappeared:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2025/9/25/alligator_alcatraz">https://www.democracynow.org/2025/9/25/alligator_alcatraz</a></p>
<p>In removing ICEBlock, Apple has deprived its customers of a vital tool for evading these kidnapping, murdering, masked thugs.</p>
<p>ICE moved from targeting "the worst of the worst" to targeting "people here illegally" to "people who look foreign" to "people who live in cities":</p>
<p><a href="https://federate.social/@mattblaze/115323465203575305">https://federate.social/@mattblaze/115323465203575305</a></p>
<p>You know who would have been at the top of that list? Steve Jobs, who died 14 years ago today:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/05/remembering-steve/">https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/05/remembering-steve/</a></p>
<p>Steve Jobs was "the anchor baby of an activist Arab muslim who came to the US on a student visa and had a child out of wedlock":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/09/09/how-tim-cook-sold-out-steve-jobs/">https://www.anildash.com/2025/09/09/how-tim-cook-sold-out-steve-jobs/</a></p>
<p>He is <em>exactly</em> the sort of person that Trump wants to deport.</p>
<p>Jobs isn't the only foreigner whose company is helping Trump round up and disappear foreigners. Google – co-founded by Soviet refugee Sergey Brin – has also killed ICEBlock. Google has <em>also</em> announced that they will nonconsensually update every Android device in the world to prevent their owners from installing software that Google hasn't approved:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/01/fulu/#i-am-altering-the-deal">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/01/fulu/#i-am-altering-the-deal</a></p>
<p>When China hacked Gmail in order to target dissidents, Sergey Brin unilaterally pulled the company out of China, gripped by visceral horror of his platform being used for totalitarian oppression. Today, Brin is taking away his customers' best tool for evading ICE kidnappers on behalf of a self-declared "dictator." Hey, Sergey, one Soviet refugee's son to another, that's some pretty <em>Vichy</em> bullshit, <em>landsman</em>.</p>
<p>Under Trump's policies, neither Apple nor Google would exist today. These companies both claim that they have to "obey the law" but this isn't following a lawful order – it's going above and beyond the law to help a dictator kidnap their customers.</p>
<p>When China turned on Google's users, Google left the country. When the <em>European Union</em> ordered Apple to open up to third party app stores, Apple <em>threatened to leave Europe</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/26/empty-threats/#500-million-affluent-consumers">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/26/empty-threats/#500-million-affluent-consumers</a></p>
<p>But when Pam Bondi ordered Apple and Google to help her round up <em>their own customers</em>, Brin and Cook didn't even ask for a court order.</p>
<p>You could not ask for a better example of the failure of feudal security. Nor could you ask for a better rebuttal to the "Surveillance Capitalism" claim that Google is a "rogue capitalist" (because it spies on you for profit) while Apple is a good capitalist (because they extract money, not private data):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/HowToDestroySurveillanceCapitalism">https://pluralistic.net/HowToDestroySurveillanceCapitalism</a></p>
<p>Apple spies on you, of course. And because they trap you in the App Store's airtight bubble, they block you from installing any software that would protect you from Apple's surveillance. And now, Apple has thrown in with the Trump regime's most violent, human-rights invading program: mass kidnappings and disappearances of thousands of our neighbors.</p>
<p>Truly, everyone's a "rogue capitalist" now. It's almost like the problem with companies isn't whether their business model is based on showing you ads or charging you money, but rather, whether they can abuse you for profit and get away with it.</p>

        <p dir="auto">We're excited to announce <strong>Monorepo Tasks</strong>, a powerful new feature that brings first-class monorepo support to mise tasks! 🚀</p>
<h2 dir="auto">What is it?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Monorepo Tasks allows you to manage tasks across multiple projects in a single repository, with each project maintaining its own tools, environment variables, and tasks. Think of it as bringing the power of tools like Bazel or Turborepo to mise's task system, but with mise's signature simplicity.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Key Features</h2>
<h3 dir="auto">🎯 <strong>Unified Task Namespace</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">All tasks across your monorepo are automatically discovered and prefixed with their location:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mise //projects/frontend:build
mise //projects/backend:test
mise //services/api:deploy"><pre>mise //projects/frontend:build
mise //projects/backend:test
mise //services/api:deploy</pre></div>
<h3 dir="auto">🌳 <strong>Smart Tool &amp; Environment Inheritance</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">Define common tools at the root, override them where needed:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Root mise.toml
[tools]
node = &quot;20&quot;      # Inherited everywhere
python = &quot;3.12&quot;

# projects/legacy-app/mise.toml
[tools]
node = &quot;14&quot;      # Override just for this project
# python still inherited!"><pre><span><span>#</span> Root mise.toml</span>
[<span>tools</span>]
<span>node</span> = <span><span>"</span>20<span>"</span></span>      <span><span>#</span> Inherited everywhere</span>
<span>python</span> = <span><span>"</span>3.12<span>"</span></span>

<span><span>#</span> projects/legacy-app/mise.toml</span>
[<span>tools</span>]
<span>node</span> = <span><span>"</span>14<span>"</span></span>      <span><span>#</span> Override just for this project</span>
<span><span>#</span> python still inherited!</span></pre></div>
<h3 dir="auto">🎭 <strong>Powerful Wildcard Patterns</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">Run tasks across multiple projects with ease:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Run tests in ALL projects
mise //...:test

# Run all build tasks under services/
mise //services/...:build

# Run ALL tasks in frontend (wildcards need quotes)
mise '//projects/frontend:*'

# Run all test:* tasks everywhere
mise '//...:test:*'"><pre><span><span>#</span> Run tests in ALL projects</span>
mise //...:test

<span><span>#</span> Run all build tasks under services/</span>
mise //services/...:build

<span><span>#</span> Run ALL tasks in frontend (wildcards need quotes)</span>
mise <span><span>'</span>//projects/frontend:*<span>'</span></span>

<span><span>#</span> Run all test:* tasks everywhere</span>
mise <span><span>'</span>//...:test:*<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<h3 dir="auto">✨ <strong>Consistent Execution Anywhere</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">Run tasks from anywhere in the monorepo - they always execute with the correct context, tools, and environment from their config_root.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">🔒 <strong>Automatic Trust Propagation</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">Trust your monorepo root once, and all descendant configs are automatically trusted.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Quick Start</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>1. Enable the feature in your root <code>mise.toml</code>:</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="experimental_monorepo_root = true

[tools]
node = &quot;20&quot;
python = &quot;3.12&quot;"><pre><span>experimental_monorepo_root</span> = <span>true</span>

[<span>tools</span>]
<span>node</span> = <span><span>"</span>20<span>"</span></span>
<span>python</span> = <span><span>"</span>3.12<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2. Set the experimental flag:</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="export MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1"><pre><span>export</span> MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>3. Add tasks to your projects:</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# projects/frontend/mise.toml
[tasks.build]
run = &quot;npm run build&quot;

[tasks.test]
run = &quot;npm test&quot;"><pre><span><span>#</span> projects/frontend/mise.toml</span>
[<span>tasks</span>.<span>build</span>]
<span>run</span> = <span><span>"</span>npm run build<span>"</span></span>

[<span>tasks</span>.<span>test</span>]
<span>run</span> = <span><span>"</span>npm test<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>4. Run tasks from anywhere:</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mise //projects/frontend:build
mise //...:test  # Run tests in all projects!"><pre>mise //projects/frontend:build
mise //...:test  <span><span>#</span> Run tests in all projects!</span></pre></div>
<h2 dir="auto">Example Monorepo Structure</h2>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="myproject/
├── mise.toml (experimental_monorepo_root = true)
├── services/
│   ├── api/mise.toml
│   ├── worker/mise.toml
│   └── scheduler/mise.toml
└── apps/
    ├── web/mise.toml
    └── mobile/mise.toml"><pre><code>myproject/
├── mise.toml (experimental_monorepo_root = true)
├── services/
│   ├── api/mise.toml
│   ├── worker/mise.toml
│   └── scheduler/mise.toml
└── apps/
    ├── web/mise.toml
    └── mobile/mise.toml
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Run all service builds: <code>mise //services/...:build</code><br>
Run all app tests: <code>mise //apps/...:test</code><br>
Run everything: <code>mise '//...:*'</code> (if you're brave! 😄)</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Why This Matters</h2>
<p dir="auto">Managing monorepos is hard. Coordinating tools, tasks, and environments across dozens of projects is even harder. With Monorepo Tasks, you get:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>No more repetitive scripts</strong> - Define once, run anywhere</li>
<li><strong>Consistent environments</strong> - Each project gets exactly the tools it needs</li>
<li><strong>Powerful automation</strong> - Wildcards make CI/CD pipelines a breeze</li>
<li><strong>Better developer experience</strong> - Clear, discoverable task namespacing</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="auto">How Does This Compare to Other Tools?</h2>
<p dir="auto">The monorepo ecosystem is rich with excellent tools, each with different strengths. Here's how mise's Monorepo Tasks compares:</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Simple Task Runners</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Taskfile</strong> and <strong>Just</strong> are fantastic for single-project task automation. They're lightweight and easy to set up, but they weren't designed with monorepos in mind. While you can have multiple Taskfiles/Justfiles in a repo, they don't provide unified task discovery, cross-project wildcards, or automatic tool/environment inheritance across projects.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>mise's advantage:</strong> Automatic task discovery across the entire monorepo with a unified namespace and powerful wildcard patterns.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">JavaScript-Focused Tools</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Nx</strong>, <strong>Turborepo</strong>, and <strong>Lerna</strong> are powerful tools specifically designed for JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Nx</strong> offers incredible features like dependency graph visualization, affected project detection, code generation, and computation caching. It has a massive plugin ecosystem and excels at frontend monorepos.</li>
<li><strong>Turborepo</strong> focuses on blazing-fast task caching and parallel execution with minimal configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Lerna</strong> pioneered JavaScript monorepo management with package versioning and publishing workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>mise's advantage:</strong> Language-agnostic support. While these tools excel in JS/TS ecosystems, mise works equally well with Rust, Go, Python, Ruby, or any mix of languages. You also get unified tool version management (not just tasks) and environment variables across your entire stack.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Large-Scale Build Systems</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Bazel</strong> (Google) and <strong>Buck2</strong> (Meta) are industrial-strength build systems designed for massive, multi-language monorepos at companies with thousands of engineers.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Bazel</strong> offers incredible features like distributed caching, remote execution, and hermetic builds with fine-grained dependency tracking.</li>
<li><strong>Buck2</strong> is a modern rewrite with a clean architecture and impressive performance optimizations.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Both are extremely powerful but come with significant complexity:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Hermetic builds require strict isolation and complete dependency control</li>
<li>Steep learning curve with specialized DSLs (Starlark, etc.)</li>
<li>Complex configuration requiring dedicated build engineers</li>
<li>Heavy investment in infrastructure for remote caching</li>
<li>Stricter constraints on how you structure your code</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>mise's advantage:</strong> Simplicity through non-hermetic builds. mise doesn't try to control your entire build environment in isolation - instead, it manages tools and tasks in a flexible, practical way. This "non-hermetic" approach means you can use mise without restructuring your entire codebase or learning a new language. You get powerful monorepo task management with simple TOML configuration - enough power for most teams without the enterprise-level complexity that hermetic builds require.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Other Notable Tools</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Rush</strong> (Microsoft) offers strict dependency management and build orchestration for JavaScript monorepos, with a focus on safety and convention adherence.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Moon</strong> is a newer Rust-based build system that aims to be developer-friendly while supporting multiple languages.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">The mise Sweet Spot</h3>
<p dir="auto">mise's Monorepo Tasks aims to hit the sweet spot between simplicity and power:</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>When to choose mise:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>✅ Polyglot monorepos (multiple languages)</li>
<li>✅ You want unified tool + task management</li>
<li>✅ You prefer simplicity over maximum performance</li>
<li>✅ You're already using mise for tool management</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>When to consider alternatives:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You're exclusively JavaScript/TypeScript → Nx or Turborepo might offer more JS-specific features</li>
<li>You're at Google/Meta scale with thousands of engineers → Bazel or Buck2 offer distributed build infrastructure</li>
<li>You need advanced task caching → Nx, Turborepo, or Bazel offer sophisticated caching systems</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The best tool is the one that fits your team's needs. mise's Monorepo Tasks is designed for teams who want powerful monorepo management without the complexity overhead, especially when working across multiple languages.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Try It Out!</h2>

our uploaded files are sold for advertising or what purpose ever and the chance our social messengers leak our private data is
incredibly high. It is about time to work against this.</p><p>Since 3 years the European Commission works on a plan to automatically monitor all chat,
email and messenger conversations.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> If this is going to pass, and I strongly hope it will not, the European Union
is moving into a direction we know from states suppressing freedom of speech.</p><p>I went for setting up my own XMPP server, as this does not have any big resource requirements
and still support clustering (for high-availabilty purposes), encryption via OMEMO, file sharing
and has support for platforms and operating systems. Also the ecosystem with clients and multiple use cases evolved
over the years to provide rock-solid software and solutions for multi-user chats or event audio and video calls.</p><p>All code snippets written below work in either Debian os Raspberry Pi OS.</p><h2 id="setting-up-your-own-xmpp-server">Setting up your own XMPP server<a href="#setting-up-your-own-xmpp-server"><svg width=".8em" height=".8em" viewBox="0 0 2048 2048"><path fill="currentColor" d="M1536 768v128q76 0 145 17t123 56 84 99 32 148q0 66-25 124t-69 101-102 69-124 26h-512q-66 0-124-25t-101-69-69-102-26-124q0-87 31-147t85-99 122-56 146-18V768h-64q-93 0-174 35t-142 96-96 142-36 175q0 93 35 174t96 142 142 96 175 36h512q93 0 174-35t142-96 96-142 36-175q0-93-35-174t-96-142-142-96-175-36zm-640 512v-128q76 0 145-17t123-56 84-99 32-148q0-66-25-124t-69-101-102-69-124-26H448q-66 0-124 25t-101 69-69 102-26 124q0 87 31 147t85 99 122 56 146 18v128h-64q-93 0-174-35t-142-96-96-142T0 832q0-93 35-174t96-142 142-96 175-36h512q93 0 174 35t142 96 96 142 36 175q0 93-35 174t-96 142-142 96-175 36z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>The connection from your client to the XMPP server is encrypted and we need certificates for our server.

And that’s extremely worrying. It suggests that many people don’t realize how fast and aggressively the Trump administration is moving to end rule of law and convert America into a full-fledged autocracy.</p><p><span>So while I’d like to devote today’s post to economics — you have no idea how happy I felt while writing </span><a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/tech-and-the-wealth-of-nations" rel="">yesterday’s primer</a><span> about agglomeration and productivity — I couldn’t in good conscience avoid writing about the terrible things happening in Chicago and elsewhere, and what they may portend.</span></p><p><span>About that raid: It was reported in mainstream media, but didn’t get the screaming banner headlines it deserved. Here’s what happened, according to </span><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/us-border-patrol-raid-sweeps-100831785.html" rel="">Reuters</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>U.S. Border Patrol agents deployed to Chicago led a late-night raid on an apartment building this week, rappelling from helicopters onto rooftops and breaking down doors in an operation authorities said targeted gang members but which swept up U.S. citizens and families.</p><p>…</p><p>As part of the raid, some U.S. citizens were temporarily detained and children pulled from their beds, according to interviews with residents and news reports. Building hallways were still littered with debris two days later.</p><p>…</p><p>Hundreds of agents swarmed the apartment building during the raid on Tuesday, including some rappelling down to the roof from Black Hawk helicopters, according to NewsNation.</p><p>…</p><p>One resident, who asked not to be named, reported being made to lie down on the ground by agents during the raid and having his hands zip-tied.</p></blockquote><p><span>ICE claimed that the building was targeted because it was “</span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/03/us/chicago-apartment-ice-raid" rel="">known to be frequented</a><span> by Tren de Aragua (a Venezuelan gang) members and their associates” — that is, although ICE carried out the raid, it was supposedly about crime. And they arrested two suspected gang members, while also rounding up some undocumented immigrants.

To me, it says that even “alarmists” who warned about the threat a Trump administration would pose to democracy underestimated just how evil this administration would be.</span></p><p><span>Until recently, most warnings about the decline of democracy envisaged a scenario something like Hungary’s “</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/world/europe/hungary-orban-democracy-far-right.html" rel="">soft autocracy</a><span>”: Subversion of institutions from the media to the courts, rigged elections, crony capitalism that favors regime supporters, and so on. We didn’t expect America to become a country where masked secret policemen smash down your door in the middle of the night and take you away. Yet that’s where we are.</span></p><p><span>And don’t expect the attacks to be limited to immigrants. A recent White House </span><a href="https://time.com/7322106/trump-nspm-7-domestic-terrorism/" rel="">memo</a><span> directs the FBI to investigate groups as potential domestic terrorists based on incredibly expansive criteria, including “anti-capitalism” and “anti-Christianity” views. This would basically empower going after any kind of dissent.</span></p><p><span>One reason things have gotten so extreme, so fast may be that Trump, Miller and company are in a </span><a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/trump-is-racing-against-time" rel="">race against time</a><span>. Foreign autocrats like Orban or Vladimir Putin could afford to chip away gradually at the foundations of democracy because they were, at least initially, quite popular. Trump — although he won’t admit it — has very low approval, and the public opposes him on every major issue. Yet he and his minions control much of the machinery of government, and are trying to use it to intimidate — you might say terrorize — their opponents before public anger catches up with them.</span></p><p>Moreover, Miller and Tom “Cava bag” Homan clearly like inflicting suffering.</p><p>What all this suggests to me is that there will be many more incidents as bad or worse than the Chicago apartment raid. If you think I’m overreacting, remember: The alarmists have been right about Trump every step of the way.</p><p>So what can people and institutions do? Resist. Don’t make concessions in the hope of buying MAGA off. Don’t mute your criticisms in an attempt to seem even-handed. As far as I know, no wannabe autocrat has managed to consolidate power while being as unpopular as Trump is right now. Don’t help him become the first to pull it off.</p><p>MUSICAL CODA</p><div id="youtube2-veiJLhXdwn8" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;veiJLhXdwn8&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/veiJLhXdwn8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

																														<p>6 October 2025</p>
																														<p><a href="http://nobelprizemedicine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet</a> has decided to award the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to:</p>
																														<p><strong>Mary E. Brunkow</strong><br>Institute for Systems Biology,<br>Seattle, USA</p>
																														<p><strong>Fred Ramsdell</strong><br>Sonoma Biotherapeutics,<br>San Francisco, USA</p>
																														<p><strong>Shimon Sakaguchi</strong><br>Osaka University,<br>Osaka, Japan</p>
																														<p><em>“for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”</em></p>
																														<h2>They discovered how the immune system is kept in check</h2>
																														<p>The body’s powerful immune system must be regulated, or it may attack our own organs. Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi are awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 for their groundbreaking discoveries concerning <em>peripheral immune tolerance</em> that prevents the immune system from harming the body.</p>
																														<p>Every day, our immune system protects us from thousands of different microbes trying to invade our bodies. These all have different appearances, and many have developed similarities with human cells as a form of camouflage. So how does the immune system determine what it should attack and what it should defend?</p>
																														<p>Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi are awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 for their fundamental discoveries relating to peripheral immune tolerance. The laureates identified the immune system’s security guards, <em>regulatory T cells</em>, which prevent immune cells from attacking our own body.</p>
																														<p>“Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,” says Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.</p>
																														<p>Shimon Sakaguchi was swimming against the tide in 1995, when he made the first key discovery. At the time, many researchers were convinced that immune tolerance only developed due to potentially harmful immune cells being eliminated in the thymus, through a process called <em>central tolerance</em>. Sakaguchi showed that the immune system is more complex and discovered a previously unknown class of immune cells, which protect the body from autoimmune diseases.</p>
																														<p>Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell made the other key discovery in 2001, when they presented the explanation for why a specific mouse strain was particularly vulnerable to autoimmune diseases. They had discovered that the mice have a mutation in a gene that they named <em>Foxp3</em>. They also showed that mutations in the human equivalent of this gene cause a serious autoimmune disease, IPEX.</p>
																														<p>Two years after this, Shimon Sakaguchi was able to link these discoveries. He proved that the <em>Foxp3</em> gene governs the development of the cells he identified in 1995. These cells, now known as regulatory T cells, monitor other immune cells and ensure that our immune system tolerates our own tissues.</p>
																														<p>The laureates’ discoveries launched the field of peripheral tolerance, spurring the development of medical treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. This may also lead to more successful transplantations. Several of these treatments are now undergoing clinical trials.</p>

<p>There is also a new restriction for battery-powered models. They may only be used from October to December. Use in other months is only permitted in exceptional cases, for example for street cleaning after the Street Parade.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-democracy/blown-out-of-proportion-zurich-votes-on-how-to-deal-with-fallen-leaves/89898017"><strong>+ Has Swiss democracy become decadent with vote on leaf blowers?</strong></a></p>



<p>These new restrictions apply to both private individuals and municipal employees. Some 75,248 of voters were in favour of the necessary partial revision of the police ordinance, while 46,717 rejected the leaf blower ban. The turnout was 52.8%.</p>



<h2 id="h-years-of-fighting">Years of fighting </h2>



<p>This referendum came about after a group of parliamentary parties launched a referendum to challenge the city parliament’s decision to ban leaf blowers. They argued that the ban was an “expression of a culture of prohibition”.</p>



<p>The fight against leaf blowers has been going on in Zurich for a long time. Back in 2013, the Greens submitted a petition with 4,329 signatures. The initiative that led to the current ban was submitted by the Greens and Social Democrats in 2022.</p>

<p id="quotes">``. . . anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn't the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment."
 -- Robert Benchley,  in Chips off the Old Benchley, 1949
</p>
	  <p>I have been intending to write this essay for months. Why am I finally doing it? Because I finally found some uncommitted time? Wrong. I have papers to grade, textbook orders to fill out, an NSF proposal to referee, dissertation drafts to read. I am working on this essay as a way of not doing all of those things. This is the essence of what I call structured procrastination, an amazing strategy I have discovered that converts procrastinators into effective human beings, respected and admired for all that they can accomplish and the good use they make of time. All procrastinators put off things they have to do. Structured procrastination is the art of making this bad trait work for you. The key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing. Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing; they do marginally useful things, like gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they get around to it. Why does the procrastinator do these things? Because they are a way of not doing something more important. If all the procrastinator had left to do was to sharpen some pencils, no force on earth could get him do it. However, the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important.</p>

<p>Structured procrastination means shaping the structure of the tasks one has to do in a way that exploits this fact. The list of tasks one has in mind will be ordered by importance. Tasks that seem most urgent and important are on top. But there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower down on the list. Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher up on the list. With this sort of appropriate task structure, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen. Indeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.</p>

<p>The most perfect situation for structured procrastination that I ever had was when my wife and I served as Resident Fellows in Soto House, a Stanford dormitory. In the evening, faced with papers to grade, lectures to prepare, committee work to be done, I would leave our cottage next to the dorm and go over to the lounge and play ping-pong with the residents, or talk over things with them in their rooms, or just sit there and read the paper. I got a reputation for being a terrific Resident Fellow, and one of the rare profs on campus who spent time with undergraduates and got to know them. What a set up: play ping pong as a way of not doing more important things, and get a reputation as Mr. Chips.</p>

<p>Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this goes contrary to the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be by definition the most important, and the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is a way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being.</p>

<p>At this point you may be asking, "How about the important tasks at the top of the list, that one never does?" Admittedly, there is a potential problem here.</p>

<p>The trick is to pick the right sorts of projects for the top of the list. The ideal sorts of things have two characteristics, First, they seem to have clear deadlines (but really don't). Second, they seem awfully important (but really aren't). Luckily, life abounds with such tasks. In universities the vast majority of tasks fall into this category, and I'm sure the same is true for most other large institutions. Take for example the item right at the top of my list right now. This is finishing an essay for a volume in the philosophy of language. It was supposed to be done eleven months ago. I have accomplished an enormous number of important things as a way of not working on it. A couple of months ago, bothered by guilt, I wrote a letter to the editor saying how sorry I was to be so late and expressing my good intentions to get to work. Writing the letter was, of course, a way of not working on the article. It turned out that I really wasn't much further behind schedule than anyone else. And how important is this article anyway? Not so important that at some point something that seems more important won't come along. Then I'll get to work on it.</p>

<p>Another example is book order forms. I write this in June. In October, I will teach a class on Epistemology. The book order forms are already overdue at the book store. It is easy to take this as an important task with a pressing deadline (for you non-procrastinators, I will observe that deadlines really start to press a week or two after they pass.) I get almost daily reminders from the department secretary, students sometimes ask me what we will be reading, and the unfilled order form sits right in the middle of my desk, right under the wrapping from the sandwich I ate last Wednesday. This task is near the top of my list; it bothers me, and motivates me to do other useful but superficially less important things. But in fact, the book store is plenty busy with forms already filed by non-procrastinators. I can get mine in mid-Summer and things will be fine. I just need to order popular well-known books from efficient publishers. I will accept some other, apparently more important, task sometime between now and, say, August 1st. Then my psyche will feel comfortable about filling out the order forms as a way of not doing this new task.</p>

<p>The observant reader may feel at this point that structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self-deception, since one is in effect constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself. Exactly. One needs to be able to recognize and commit oneself to tasks with inflated importance and unreal deadlines, while making oneself feel that they are important and urgent. This is not a problem, because virtually all procrastinators have excellent self-deceptive skills also. And what could be more noble than using one character flaw to offset the bad effects of another?</p>

<p>Here are the answers you get if you ask several models whether a seahorse emoji exists, yes or no, 100 times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a seahorse emoji, yes or no? Respond with one word, no punctuation.</p>

</ul>
<p>Needlessly to say, popular language models are <em>very</em> confident that there's a seahorse emoji. And they're not alone in that confidence - here's a Reddit thread with hundreds of comments from people who distinctly remember a seahorse emoji existing:</p>
<p><img src="https://vgel.me/posts/seahorse/reddit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There's tons of this - Google "seahorse emoji" and you'll find TikToks, Youtube videos, and even (now defunct) memecoins based around the supposed vanishing of a seahorse emoji that everyone is pretty sure used to exist - but of course, never did.</p>
<p>Maybe LLMs believe a seahorse emoji exists because so many humans in the training data do. Or maybe it's a convergent belief - given how many other aquatic animals are in Unicode, it's reasonable for both humans and LLMs to assume (generalize, even) that such a delightful animal is as well. A seahorse emoji was even <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/emoji-proposals-status.html">formally proposed at one point</a>, but was rejected in 2018.</p>
<p>Regardless of the root cause, many LLMs begin each new context window fresh with the mistaken latent belief that the seahorse emoji exists. But why does that produce such strange behavior? I mean, I used to believe a seahorse emoji existed myself, but if I had tried to send it to a friend, I would've simply looked for it on my keyboard and realized it wasn't there, not sent the wrong emoji and then gone into an emoji spam doomloop. So what's happening inside the LLM that causes it to act like this?</p>

<p>We can take the model's <code>lm_head</code>, which is usually only used on the output of the last layer, and apply it to <em>every</em> layer to produce intermediate token predictions. That process produces this table, showing for every fourth layer what the most likely token would be for the next three positions after the prefix (tokens 0, 1, and 2), and what the top 5 most likely predictions for the first position is (token 0 topk 5):</p>

<p>This is the logit lens: using the model's <code>lm_head</code> to produce logits (token likelihoods) as a way to investigate its internal states. Note that the tokens and likelihoods we get from the logit lens here are not equivalent to the model's <em>full</em> internal states! For that, we would need a more complex technique like representation reading or sparse autoencoders. Instead, this is a <em>lens</em> on that state - it shows what the output token would be <em>if</em> this layer were the last one. But despite this limitation, the logit lens is still useful. The states of early layers may be difficult to interpret using it, but as we move up through the stack we can see that the model is iteratively refining those states towards its final prediction, a fish emoji.</p>
<p><small>(Why do the unmerged tokens look like that 'ĠðŁ', 'Ĳ', 'ł' nonsense? It's because of a tokenizer quirk - those tokens encode the UTF-8 bytes for the fish emoji. It's not relevant to this post, but if you're curious, ask Claude or your favorite LLM to explain this paragraph and this line of code: <code>bytes([bpe_byte_decoder[c] for c in 'ĠðŁĲł']).decode('utf-8') == ' 🐠'</code>)</small></p>
<p>Take a look at what happens in the middle layers, though - it's not the early-layer weirdness <em>or</em> the emoji bytes of the final prediction! Instead we get words relating to <em>useful concepts</em>, specifically the concept of a seahorse. For example, on layer 52, we get "sea horse horse" - three residual positions in a row encoding the "seahorse" concept. Later, in the top-k for the first position, we get a mixture of "sea", "horse", and an emoji byte sequence prefix, "ĠðŁ".</p>
<p>So what is the model thinking about? "seahorse + emoji"! It's trying to construct a residual representation of a seahorse combined with an emoji. Why would the model try to construct this combination? Well, let's look into how the <code>lm_head</code> actually works.</p>
<h2 id="lm_head"><a href="#lm_head">
  <img src="https://vgel.me/permalink.svg" alt="permalink for lm_head">
</a><code>lm_head</code></h2>
<p>A language model's <code>lm_head</code> is a huge matrix of residual-sized vectors associated with token ids, one for every token in the vocabulary (~300,000). When a residual is passed into it, either after flowing through the model normally or early because someone is using the logit lens on an earlier layer, the <code>lm_head</code> is going to compare that input residual with each residual-sized vector in that big matrix, and (in coordination with the sampler) select the token id associated with the vector that matrix contains that is most similar to the input residual.</p>
<p>(More technically: <code>lm_head</code> is a linear layer without a bias, so <code>x @ w.T</code> does dot products with each unembedding vector to produce raw scores. Then your usual log_softmax and argmax/temperature sample.)</p>
<p>That means if the model wants to output the word "hello", for example in response to a friendly greeting from the user, it needs to construct a residual as similar as possible to the vector for the "hello" token that the <code>lm_head</code> can then turn into the hello token id. And using logit lens, we can see that's exactly what happens in response to "Hello :-)":</p>

<p>Likewise, if the model wants to output a seahorse emoji, it needs to construct a residual similar to the vector for the seahorse emoji output token(s) - which in theory could be any arbitrary value, but in practice is "seahorse + emoji", word2vec style. We can see this in action with a real emoji, the fish emoji:</p>

<p>Here, everything works perfectly. The model constructs the "fish + emoji" residual - look at the layer 72 topk, where we have both "fish" and the emoji byte prefix "ĠðŁ" - meaning that the residual at this point is similar to both "fish" and "emoji", just like we'd expect. Then when this vector is passed into the <code>lm_head</code> after the final layer, we see a 🐟 just as the model expected.</p>
<p>But unlike with 🐟, the seahorse emoji doesn't exist. The model tries to construct a "seahorse + emoji" vector just as it would for a real emoji, and on layer 72 we even get a very similar construction as with the fish emoji - " se", "horse", and the emoji prefix byte prefix:</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>But alas, there's no continuation to ĠðŁ corresponding to a seahorse, so the <code>lm_head</code> similarity score calculation maxes out with horse- or sea-animal-related emoji bytes instead, and an unintended emoji is sampled.</p>
<p>Now, that sampling is valuable information for the model! You can see that in, e.g. the Claude 4.5 Sonnet example below, when the tokens get appended into the context autoregressively, the model can tell that they don't form the intended seahorse emoji. The previous, fuzzy "seahorse + emoji" concept has been "snapped" by the <code>lm_head</code> to an emoji that actually exists, like a tropical fish or horse.</p>
<p><img src="https://vgel.me/posts/seahorse/sonnet45.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once this happens, it's up to the model how to proceed. Some models like 4.5 Sonnet try again, and eventually update on the evidence, changing mid-response to a statement about how the seahorse emoji doesn't exist. Other models like gpt-5-chat spiral for longer, sometimes never recovering. Other models will either blissfully ignore that the emoji is incorrect, and some will even correct themselves instantly after seeing only a single incorrect sample.</p>
<p>But until the model gets the wrong output token from <code>lm_head</code>, it just <em>doesn't know</em> that its initial belief about a seahorse emoji existing was wrong. It can only assume that "seahorse + emoji" will produce the tokens it wants.</p>

</a>Some speculation</h2>
<p>To speculate a bit more, I wonder if this problem is part of the benefit of reinforcement learning for LLMs - it gives the model information about its <code>lm_head</code> that's otherwise difficult for it to get at because it's at the end of the layer stack.</p>
<p>(Remember that base models are not trained on their own outputs / rollouts. That only happens in RL.)</p>

<p>Matthias Weyland loves having people ask about his balcony. A pair of solar panels hang from the railing, casting a sheen of dark blue against the red brick of his apartment building. They’re connected to a microinverter plugged into a wall outlet and feed electricity directly into his home. On a sunny day, he’ll produce enough power to supply up to half of his family’s daily needs.</p>



<p>Weyland is one of hundreds of thousands of people across Germany who have embraced <em>balkonkraftwerk</em>, or balcony solar. Unlike <a href="https://grist.org/energy/commercial-roof-space-is-an-untapped-trove-of-clean-energy-for-low-income-communities/">rooftop photovoltaics</a>, the technology doesn’t require users to own their home, and anyone capable of plugging in an appliance can set it up. Most people buy the simple hardware online or at the supermarket for about $550 (500 euros.)</p>



<p>The ease of installation and a potent mix of government policies to encourage adoption has made the wee arrays hugely popular. More than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-gives-apartment-dwellers-legal-right-solar-power-2024-07-05/">550,000 of them</a> dot cities and towns nationwide, half of which were installed in 2023. During the first half of this year, Germany added <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/07/19/germanys-balcony-pv-installations-hit-200-mw-in-h1/">200 megawatts</a> of balcony solar. Regulations limit each system to just 800 watts, enough to power a small fridge or charge a laptop, but the cumulative effect is nudging the country toward its clean energy goals&nbsp;while giving apartment dwellers, who make up <a href="https://www.destatis.de/Europa/EN/Topic/Population-Labour-Social-Issues/Social-issues-living-conditions/RentedAccommodation.html">more than half</a> of the population, an easy way to save money and address the climate crisis.</p>



<p>“I love the feeling of charging the bike when the sun is shining, or having the washing machine run when the sun is shining, and to know that it comes directly from the sun,” Weyland said. “It’s a small step you can take as a tenant” and an act of “self-efficacy, to not just sit and wait until the climate crisis gets worse.”</p>



<p>Balcony solar emerged around a decade ago, but didn’t catch on until four or five years ago, thanks in part to <a href="https://www.pvplug.de/">years of lobbying</a> by solar and clean energy advocates for policies to foster its adoption. The German government enacted the first technical regulations for plug-in solar devices in 2019, allowing balcony solar systems to use standard electrical plugs and feed into the grid. That prompted an influx of plug-in devices and advocates to promote the technology.</p>



<p>The pandemic helped fuel the surge in popularity as people spent time at home, working on DIY projects. More recently, the escalating energy prices that followed <a href="https://grist.org/article/the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-has-left-a-hole-in-the-global-energy-market/">Russia’s invasion</a> <a href="https://grist.org/health/one-year-in-the-toxic-legacy-of-war-in-ukraine-comes-into-view/">of Ukraine</a> led more Germans to consider balcony solar. “People just did anything they could to reduce their energy bills,” said Wolfgang Gründinger, who works with the clean energy company Enpal.</p>



<p>Federal and local policymakers have redoubled their efforts to make the technology more accessible. In April, the government <a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-simplifies-registration-balcony-photovoltaic-units">simplified permitting and registration requirements</a>, and in July, federal lawmakers passed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-gives-apartment-dwellers-legal-right-solar-power-2024-07-05/">renter protections</a> that prevent landlords from arbitrarily blocking installations. Cities throughout Germany, including Berlin and Weyland’s home city of Kiel, have offered <a href="https://www.berlin.de/en/news/8025956-5559700-solar-power-balcony-subsidy-program-frid.en.html">millions of euros</a> in subsidies to install balcony solar.</p>



<p>Gründinger and experts at the German Solar Industry Association noted that the devices don’t generate enough power to strain the grid, and their standardized design and safety features allow them to integrate smoothly and easily.</p>

<p>Despite the hype, most users concede that balcony solar provides modest cost and energy savings. Weyland spent around $530 for his 600-watt-capacity system. While he’s happy with how his south-facing panels perform during balmy weather, such days are rare in northern Germany. He estimates that he’ll save around $100 in annual electricity costs and recoup his investment in about five years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s fairly typical, although advocates of the technology say a system’s efficacy — and, therefore, payback timeline — varies widely depending upon the number of panels, their location and direction, and how much shade surrounds them. A household with a “comparatively large well-positioned balcony system in a sunny spot facing south” can produce 15 percent of its electricity with balcony solar, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/balcony-solar-panels-renewable-energy-for-all/video-68520021">according to Peter Stratmann</a>, head of renewables at German Federal Network Agency, the country’s utility regulator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While that can put a dent in a household’s utility bill, its impact on Germany’s consumption is far smaller. “Even if we attached panels to all suitable balconies across the country, we’d still only manage to meet 1 percent or less of our overall energy needs,” Stratmann told <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/balcony-solar-panels-renewable-energy-for-all/video-68520021">Deutsche Welle</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if balcony solar doesn’t generate a lot of power or save a lot of money, why are so many people flocking to it? Many of them like the idea of producing energy at home and gaining a bit of independence from the grid. It also provides <a href="https://grist.org/health/one-year-in-the-toxic-legacy-of-war-in-ukraine-comes-into-view/">a tangible way to take climate action</a>. “It makes the energy transition feel a little more concrete and not so abstract,” said Helena Holenweger of the nonprofit Deutsche Umwelthilfe, or Environmental Action Germany. She installed a balcony solar system on top of her garage about a year ago. “You can literally do something about it.”</p>



<p>Holenweger and others who have tapped the sun said balcony solar led them to reevaluate their understanding of electricity consumption and take steps to reduce it. “For lots of people, energy is just something that comes out of your socket,” Holenweger said. “You never think about how it gets there or how it works.” The systems don’t include battery storage, so the juice they generate must be used immediately, leading people to plan the best time to, say, run the washing machine to ensure they’re using renewable energy. In that way, it becomes something of a game. Many balcony solar kits feature an app to track daily energy generation, providing what has, for many people, become a scorecard. “They screenshot that, they send it around to their Facebook groups, family WhatsApp groups. They’re super proud,” Gründinger said.</p>



<p>Germany is unique in its rabid embrace of the tech. Although increasingly popular in <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Austria-facilitates-balcony-power-plants-9797327.html">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/business/germany-solar-panels-climate-change.html">the Netherlands, France</a>, and elsewhere in Europe, plug-in solar devices aren’t viable in the United States <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038092X16301815?via%3Dihub">due to costly permitting requirements and other local regulations</a>. Beyond that, most systems are designed to European electrical standards, making them <a href="https://cybernews.com/tech/germany-balcony-solar-craze/">incompatible with U.S. power systems</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even in Germany, balcony solar still faces hurdles, including fierce resistance from landlords worried about electrical fires or put off by the aesthetics of the panels. Last year, Weyland sued his building’s property management company for imposing what he deemed unreasonable requirements to install a system, including a formal inspection of the building’s electrical system. A court <a href="https://www.duh.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilung/balkonkraftwerk-darf-angebracht-werden-von-deutscher-umwelthilfe-vor-gericht-unterstuetzte-mieter-ko/">sided with him in October 2023</a>, but similar cases pop up regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weyland hopes that as more people adopt balcony solar, that will soon change. Already, people in his life regularly ask him about his panels, and two friends are buying systems of their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So many people talk to me in our neighborhood and ask about the system when they see it,” Weyland said. “It’s kind of like a snowball that gets bigger and bigger.”</p>

        <p>It’s often said that what’s inside matters more than one’s looks, but it’s hard to argue that a product’s looks and its physical user experience are what makes it instantly recognizable. When you think of something like a Walkman, an iPod music player, a desktop computer, a car or a TV, the first thing that comes to mind is the way&nbsp; that it looks along with its user interface. This is the domain of industrial design, where circuit boards, mechanisms, displays and buttons are put into a shell that ultimately defines what users see and experience.</p>
<p>Thus industrial design is perhaps the most important aspect of product development as far as the user is concerned, right along with the feature list. It’s also no secret that marketing departments love to lean into the styling and ergonomics of a product. In light of this it is very disconcerting that the past years industrial design for consumer electronics in particular seems to have wilted and is now practically on the verge of death.</p>
<p>Devices like cellphones and TVs are now mostly flat plastic-and-glass rectangles with no distinguishing features. Laptops and PCs are identified either by being flat, small, having RGB lighting, or a combination of these. At the same time buttons and other physical user interface elements are vanishing along with prominent styling, leaving us in a world of basic geometric shapes and flat, evenly colored surfaces. Exactly how did we get to this point, and what does this mean for our own hardware projects?</p>

<p>Industrial design is less of a science and more of an art, limited only by the available materials, the constraints of the product’s internals and the goal of creating a positive user experience. Although design has always played a role with many products over the millennia, these were generally quite limited due to material and tooling constraints. As both plastics and electronics began their stratospheric rise during the 20th century, suddenly it felt like many of these constraints had been removed.</p>
<p>No longer was one limited to basic materials like stone, metal, wood and paint, while internals got ever smaller and more flexible in terms of placement. Enclosures now could take on any shape, while buttons, knobs and dials could be shaped and placed to one’s heart’s content. This change is clearly visible in consumer devices, with the sixties and subsequent<a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" data-attachment-id="609624" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2023/08/18/a-quarter-century-of-the-imac/imac-25-thumbnail/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg" data-orig-size="600,600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="imac-25-thumbnail" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg?w=600" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg?w=400" alt="" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg 600w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg?resize=250,250 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg?resize=400,400 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a> decades seeing a veritable explosion in stylish transistorized radios, home computers and portable entertainment devices, with industrial designers getting the hang of all these new materials and options.</p>
<p>The peak here was arguably achieved during the 1990s and early 2000s, as electronic miniaturization and manufacturing chops led to device manufacturers basically just showing off. Personal Hi-Fi systems and portable devices along with computer systems and laptops grew curved, translucent and transparent plastic along with a dazzling array of colors.</p>
<p>These days we refer to this era as the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y2K_aesthetic" target="_blank">Y2K Aesthetic</a>‘, which was followed around the mid-2000s to early 2010s by the sweetly named ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frutiger_Aero" target="_blank">Frutiger Aero</a>‘ era. During this time both hardware and software underwent a transition from mostly utilitarian looks into something that can be defined as tasteful to over the top, depending on your perspective, but above all it embraced the technologies and materials in its industrial design. Futurism and literal transparency were the rule, as a comfortable, colorful and stylish companion in daily life.</p>

<p>Ask someone to visualize a Nokia 3310 and even if they’re born after 2000, there’s a good chance that they will be able to tell you what it is, what it does and what it looks like. Then ask that same person to describe any modern cellphone, and while the feature list should be quite easy, asking them to draw what differentiates, say, an iPhone 16 from a Samsung Galaxy S25 is effectively impossible unless they have memorized the layout of the cameras on the back and perhaps the side button placement.</p>

<p>Over the decades, cellphones have seen their displays grow larger and larger. With voracious appetite, these displays have consumed bezels, front speakers, keyboards and home buttons.</p>
<p>Along with the demise of these features, front facing cameras were only preserved by literally punching a hole in the display, but notification LEDs vanished right along with headphone jacks, IR blaster LEDs, swappable covers, removable batteries, etc.</p>
<p>The current scuttlebutt is that Apple will be the first to drop any and all connectors from its iPhone cellphones, with the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/a-truly-portless-iphone-just-got-the-all-clear-from-the-eu" target="_blank">iPhone 17</a> reportedly nearly becoming the first to do so. Along with eSIMs, this would leave smartphones as glued-together slabs of plastic-and-glass with only a screen, some cameras and a couple of buttons.</p>
<p>In marketing shots smartphones are always shown with a lock- or home screen open on the screen, because otherwise there would be just a lifeless black slab of glass to look at from the front. From the side you can see the same slab, which easily wobbles on its ever-growing camera hump that’s sticking out of the razor-thin case like a bad case of optical melanoma. At this point in time, the most exciting thing about cellphones is whether it can flip or not, followed by whatever subdued color is applied to the slippery glass back that you want to cover up with something concealing and grippy as soon as possible anyway.</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s not just phones either, but also computers, with the iMac’s evolution showing a clear ‘evolution’ from colorful and bold designs to geometric slabs:</p>

<p>Whether you call it ‘modern’ or ‘clean’ design, the trend is quite clear. Curves are removed, colors are purged or at the very least muted and the overall design reduced to the level of excitement experienced while being stuck at an Ikea showroom during a busy weekend with the family.</p>

<p>There was a time when televisions had a recognizable look to them, with a stylish bezel, a real power button, as well as a couple of front input connectors and buttons to adjust basic settings like volume and the current channel, which could also be hidden behind a small flap. This is now all gone, and TVs have become as visually striking from the front as modern smartphones, with the speakers fully nerfed since there’s no space on the front any more.</p>
<p>All inputs and any remaining controls are now hidden on the back where reaching them is borderline impossible after installation, never mind if you mounted it on a wall. You’re not supposed to find the TV visually appealing, or marvel at the easy user interface, just consume whatever content is displayed on the bezel-less screen.</p>
<p>The rest of any home entertainment setup has undergone the same process, with the HiFi stacks and mid-sized sets of yesteryear replaced by the same smartphones and TVs, along with a bit of plastic that you can stick into a slab TV to stream content with from some internet-based service.</p>

<p>Rather than a stereo – or better – HiFi setup, most people will have a bunch of usually mono Bluetooth speakers scattered around, each of which possessing the visual appeal of a radar dome. If you’re lucky there are still a couple of touch buttons to fondle, but virtually all of your interactions with such devices will go via an app on your slab phone.</p>
<p>Touch controls are also all that you will get these days, as physical buttons, dials, sliders and switches are almost completely faux pas in modern-day product design. Everything has to be smooth, stealthy, invisibly present and yet always there when you crave that entertainment fix.</p>
<p>This design language isn’t just afflicting home electronics either, as over the past years car interiors have seen physical user controls vanish in favor of one or more touch screens, with cars like those from Tesla being the most extreme example with just a single large touch screen on the center console as the sole user interface. Users are however <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/car-buttons/" target="_blank">pushing back against this change</a>, with a number of studies also showing that touch-only controls are less effective and less safe than fumbling around on a big screen while driving to adjust something like the climate controls or radio station.</p>
<h2>There Is An App For That</h2>
<p>Want to set up your new formless slab of plastic or fabric? Please download this special mobile app to do anything with it. Got a new pair of headphones? Better pray that the mobile app works well on your slab phone or you’ll be stuck with whatever preset defaults it came with, as physical controls on the device are for dummies.</p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the human user interface part of industrial design has been mostly taken out back and replaced with software running on a slab phone. Whatever vestigial controls still remain on the device itself will only be a small subset of what its electronics and firmware are capable of. The slab phone has thus become the user interface, with that part of industrial design often outsourced to some third-party mobile app developer.</p>
<p>This has massively backfired for some companies already, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342282/sonos-app-redesign-controversy-full-story" target="_blank">Sonos in 2024 releasing</a> a ‘new and improved’ version of its slab phone app that was so buggy and plagued with issues that it rendered the Sonos speaker hardware effectively useless. While physical user interfaces have their issues, sinking an entire company due to a badly arranged set of knobs is not as easy as with a slab phone app or equivalent, not to mention the potential to retroactively brick the user interface of devices that people have already purchased.</p>
<h2>Yearning For That Human Touch</h2>

<p>Here we can see <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/09/03/a-windows-control-panel-retrospective-amidst-a-concerning-ux-shift/">parallels with computer user interfaces</a>, where much like with industrial design there’s a big push to reduce shapes to the most basic geometric forms, remove or reduce color and remove any ‘superfluous’ styling including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skeuomorph" target="_blank">skeuomorphism</a>. These parallels are perhaps not that surprising, as companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft produce both consumer hardware and software.</p>
<p>Google, for example, has heavily invested in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design" target="_blank">Material Design</a> design language, which can be summarized as having flat color backgrounds with the most simplistic UI elements suspended in said void. UI elements like the ‘hamburger’ icon are used to hide menus not just on phones, but also on desktop systems, where a form of extreme minimalism is being pushed to its ultimate extremes.</p>
<p>In the case of consumer electronics that means devices that lack any distinguishable features, as minimalism is a poor way to distinguish one product from another. The removal of visually pleasing and physically practical elements also means a dull, stimulation-free experience.</p>
<p>There are no pleasing elements to rest your eyes on, no curves or colors that invoke an emotional response, no buttons to press, or any kind of auditory or physical response. Just lifeless touch controls on slabs of plastic and glass with maybe a sad beep as confirmation of a touch control having been triggered.</p>
<p>In this context, what is often called <a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/04/22/why-physical-media-deserved-to-die/">the revival of physical media</a> can be interpreted as not just a yearning for a more visceral audio-visual experience, but would together with so-called retro-computing be a way to experience personal electronics in a way that stimulates and invigorates. Where physical buttons are pressed, sliders slid, dials turned and things go click and whirr as one’s fingers touch and manipulate the very real user interface elements.</p>
<p>We know that chronic boredom can be extremely harmful to non-human animals, with enrichment toys and activities prescribed to make them happier and more content. With modern day consumer electronics having become incredibly dull due to the death of industrial design, it would seem that us human mammals are seeking out our own enrichment activities, modern design sensibilities be damned. If this means repeating the sins of early 2000s or 1990s industrial design in our personal hobbyist projects, it’s a price worth to pay for keeping ourselves and our fellow humans happy and enriched.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/landley/toybox">https://github.com/landley/toybox</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45484284">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><pre>Toybox: all-in-one Linux command line.

--- Getting started

You can download static binaries for various targets from:

  <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/bin" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/toybox/bin</a>

The special name "." indicates the current directory (just like ".." means
the parent directory), and you can run a program that isn't in the $PATH by
specifying a path to it, so this should work:

  wget <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/bin/toybox-x86_64" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/toybox/bin/toybox-x86_64</a>
  chmod +x toybox-x86_64
  ./toybox-x86_64 echo hello world

--- Building toybox

Type "make help" for build instructions.

Toybox uses the "make menuconfig; make; make install" idiom same as
the Linux kernel. Usually you want something like:

  make defconfig
  make
  make install

Or maybe:

  LDFLAGS="--static" CROSS_COMPILE=armv5l- make defconfig toybox
  PREFIX=/path/to/root/filesystem/bin make install_flat

The file "configure" defines default values for many environment variables
that control the toybox build; if you export any of these variables into your
environment, your value is used instead of the default in that file.

The CROSS_COMPILE argument above is optional, the default builds a version of
toybox to run on the current machine. Cross compiling requires an appropriately
prefixed cross compiler toolchain, several example toolchains (built using
the file "scripts/mcm-buildall.sh" in the toybox source) are available at:

  <a href="https://landley.net/toybox/downloads/binaries/toolchains/latest" rel="nofollow">https://landley.net/toybox/downloads/binaries/toolchains/latest</a>

For the "CROSS_COMPILE=armv5l-" example above, download
armv5l-linux-musleabihf-cross.tar.xz, extract it, and add its "bin"
subdirectory to your $PATH. (And yes, the trailing - is significant,
because the prefix includes a dash.)

For more about cross compiling, see:

  <a href="https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#cross" rel="nofollow">https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#cross</a>
  <a href="http://landley.net/writing/docs/cross-compiling.html" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/writing/docs/cross-compiling.html</a>
  <a href="http://landley.net/aboriginal/architectures.html" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/aboriginal/architectures.html</a>

For a more thorough description of the toybox build process, see:

  <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/code.html#building" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/toybox/code.html#building</a>

--- Using toybox

The toybox build produces a multicall binary, a "swiss-army-knife" program
that acts differently depending on the name it was called by (cp, mv, cat...).
Installing toybox adds symlinks for each command name to the $PATH.

The special "toybox" command treats its first argument as the command to run.
With no arguments, it lists available commands. This allows you to use toybox
without installing it, and is the only command that can have an arbitrary
suffix (hence "toybox-armv5l").

The "help" command provides information about each command (ala "help cat"),
and "help toybox" provides general information about toybox.

--- Configuring toybox

It works like the Linux kernel: allnoconfig, defconfig, and menuconfig edit
a ".config" file that selects which features to include in the resulting
binary. You can save and re-use your .config file, but may want to
run "make oldconfig" to re-run the dependency resolver when migrating to
new versions.

The maximum sane configuration is "make defconfig": allyesconfig isn't
recommended as a starting point for toybox because it enables unfinished
commands, debug code, and optional dependencies your build environment may
not provide.

--- Creating a Toybox-based Linux system

Toybox has a built-in simple system builder (scripts/mkroot.sh) with a
Makefile target:

  make root
  sudo chroot root/host/fs /init

Type "exit" to get back out. If you install appropriate cross compilers and
point it at Linux source code, it can build simple three-package systems
that boot to a shell prompt under qemu:

  make root CROSS_COMPILE=sh4-linux-musl- LINUX=~/linux
  cd root/sh4
  ./qemu-sh4.sh

By calling scripts/mkroot.sh directly you can add additional packages
to the build, see scripts/root/dropbear as an example.

--- Contributing

The three important URLs for communicating with the toybox project are:

  web page: <a href="http://landley.net/toybox" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/toybox</a>

  mailing list: <a href="http://lists.landley.net/listinfo.cgi/toybox-landley.net" rel="nofollow">http://lists.landley.net/listinfo.cgi/toybox-landley.net</a>

  git repo: <a href="http://github.com/landley/toybox">http://github.com/landley/toybox</a>

The maintainer prefers patches be sent to the mailing list. If you use git,
the easy thing to do is:

  git format-patch -1 $HASH

Then send a file attachment. The list holds messages from non-subscribers
for moderation, but I usually get to them in a day or two.

I download github pull requests as patches and apply them with "git am"
(which avoids gratuitous merge commits). Sometimes I even remember to close
the pull request.

If I haven't responded to your patch after one week, feel free to remind
me of it.

Android's policy for toybox patches is that non-build patches should go
upstream first (into vanilla toybox, with discussion on the toybox mailing
list) and then be pulled into android's toybox repo from there. (They
generally resync on fridays). The exception is patches to their build scripts
(Android.mk and the checked-in generated/* files) which go directly to AOSP.

(As for the other meaning of "contributing", <a href="https://patreon.com/landley" rel="nofollow">https://patreon.com/landley</a> is
always welcome but I warn you up front I'm terrible about updating it.)

                <p>19th of September 2025</p>
                
                <section>
                    <!--<blockquote>
                      <span ><i>Show me your model weights, and I'll tell you who you are.</i></span>
                    </blockquote>-->

                    <p><span>O</span>penAI recently released their open-weights model. Here we'll discuss how that inevitably leaks some information about their model training stack, and, on the way, show that GPT-5 was trained on phrases from adult websites.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <p>What data does OpenAI train their models on? That is a well-protected trade secret of course, one with vested interest for the answer. While GPT-oss's weights are openly available, the sources of training data are not clearly described in the model card. It is stated that the model was trained on a "text-only dataset with trillions of tokens, with a focus on STEM, coding, and general knowledge". However, as we will see, the model parameters can tell us more than that.</p>

                    <p>A demonstration to start with: 
                        Let's have OpenAI's GPT-5<label for="sn-GPT5-version"></label><span>We use version GPT-5-2025-08-07 for these experiments. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68ca1a9c-0d2c-8011-b50e-a0bb21ff2a83">Here</a> is a link to the completion.</span>
                        do the simplest kind of task possible for a language model, repeating a string of Unicode text. Let's choose something random, like the Abkhaz word for "population", which is "ауааԥсыра". Upon asking <code>Repeat after me: "ауааԥсыра"</code>, it replies something completely different, "ആളുകൾ", which apparently means people in Malayalam<label for="sn-1"></label><span><a href="https://glosbe.com/ml/en/%E0%B4%86%E0%B4%B3%E0%B5%81%E0%B4%95%E0%B4%B3%E0%B5%8D">According to this dictionary.</a> Subsequent translations here are patched together with web searches, online dictionaries and translation software.</span>. As you might have guessed, we did not choose that string randomly at all, it is a special adversarial input belonging to a class of glitch tokens. But how did we identify such a glitch token among the 200,000 tokens that GPT-5 uses?
                            
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                          <img src="https://fi-le.net/oss/figures/screen.png">
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                        All of OpenAI's models since GPT-4o use the o200k tokenizer. This means that we can use the GPT-oss embeddings to study the token list without having to look at each token's text content.
                        Let's make a histogram of the L2 norm of each row of the embedding matrix.

                        
                    There are about 936 tokens with very low L2 norm, centered at about 2. This likely means that they did not occur in the training process of GPT-oss and were thus depressed by some form of weight decay. This range consists of reserved special tokens and the Unicode bytes <code>b'\xc4'</code>, <code>b'\xbf'</code>, as well as <code>b'\xf5'</code> through to <code>b'\xff'</code>, plus token 20373, a highly anomalous byte sequence <code>b'\xbe\xb3\xe9\x97\xa8'</code><label for="sn-2"></label><span>One explanation might be that the first two bytes are "境" in the <a href="https://www.khngai.com/chinese/charmap/tblgbk.php?page=3">GBK encoding</a> and the last three are "门" in UTF-8. Together these mean "border gate" in Mandarin, which is apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dajingmen">part of the Great wall of China</a>.</span>.</p>

                    <p>This low L2-norm token group could be useful for two things. Its (1) variance gives an estimate of the variance used in the initialization and (2) its mean would give an estimate of how many gradient descent steps were taken in total, if we assume standard weight decay and know the learning rate.</p>

                    <p>The right tail of the distribution is not quite Gaussian either. Looking at the English tokens with the highest norm, we find:</p>

                    <p>These tokens are either very common, or appear especially in reasoning tasks, in particular those with code. This might mean that coding reinforcement learning was the last step in the training process, and that all other tokens got slightly weight decayed. It could also mean that in general, reasoning tokens are treated as so important by gradient descent that their updates are extra large.</p>

                    <p>Filtering for non-ASCII tokens with the highest norm, we find a different picture:</p>

                    <p>Mandarin speakers will have understood that the above contains an unwholesome sublist of spammy and adult-oriented website terms, with some being too explicit to make the list here. Indeed, o200k, the tokenizer used for 4o, o1, o3, o4, oss, and GPT-5 contains a lot of junk tokens. This means that every time ChatGPT runs, a matrix containing all the strange tokens we are talking about here are patiently waiting on Microsoft Azure to be multiplied with. Some of my personal favorite tokens are "北京赛车怎么" (How to play Beijing Racing), "天天中彩票的" (Winning the lottery every day), and of course "《凤凰大参考" (Phoenix Reference). Another token is "铁血网", the name of a Chinese nationalism and military enthuiasm website, which is ironic given the geopolitical considerations that are usually raised in connection with OpenAI. It is unexpected that this type of political content not just made it into the tokenizer training data, but was even overrepresented. </p>

                    <p>There are also some oddball high-norm tokens in Abkhaz, Armenian, Gujarati, Thai, and more. Some interesting examples are ",ಂಗಳೂರು" (The city Mangaluru in Kannada) along with other cities in Kerala, "ถวายสัตย์ฯ" ("Oath of Allegiance" in Thai), "แขวงคลองเตยเหนือ" (a district in Bangkok with less than 10,000 inhabitants), "วิเคราะห์บอลวันนี้" ("today's football analysis" in Thai) along with a handful of other football-related tokens.</p>

                    <p>The question is, why do these tokens have a higher, not lower, norm than the normal tokens? If they are unused, weight decay should bring them all the way down to the other unused tokens.</p>

                    <p>In <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation">this post</a>, Jessica Rumbelow identified similar glitch tokens in GPT-2 and GPT-3, most famously the "SolidGoldMagicarp" token. Her finding was that the tokens closest to the mean of all embeddings were the glitch tokens, not necessarily those with low norm. But that's not the case here: Tokens with comparatively high norm are always far away from the mean. Further, computing cosine similarity between two of these embeddings gives higher similarity on average.</p>

                    <p>One way to get closer to the answer is to observe the models' behavior when given these tokens. We ask GPT-oss and GPT-5 about the not-so-classy token 162657: <code>What does this mean: "毛片免费观看"</code>. With some euphemism, it means "watching explicit videos for free" in Mandarin. </p>

                            See the full completion <a href="https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68cb619f3c10819192432d4a99431792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. To verify that the string was tokenized as expected, we can use <a href="https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/">tiktokenizer</a>.
                        </span>, GPT-5 correctly states that the token contains Chinese text, and that it is related to watching something. It can also enumerate some of the characters in it. This means that the token was seen during training, at least once! Interestingly, the model seems to be aware of the inappropriate meaning of the token, but plays it down and in particular does not refuse to answer. Presumably this is because the token only occurs a few times in the training corpus.
                    </p>

                    <p>In other words, we can say that a certain string, in this case a sensitive one, was part of the GPT-5 training corpus. This is called membership inference in the machine learning literature. Membership inference with high confidence is generally considered to be impractical in production LLMs, so this is a surprising finding.</p>

                    <p>Automating this process through the API, we can find which glitch tokens were seen during training of the GPT-oss and GPT-5 model families. We ask the models to give a translation of the token to English and ask for the language the token is in. For now, we simply filter for the Chinese tokens, and pass 50 tokens with highest L2 embedding norm to the models. For a control, we also ask Claude 4 and can confirm that it always answers correctly. Since a few of these tokens could technically be Japanese, we count this as a correct answer, too. For cost reasons, we ask about each token only 4 times per model, and denote 4 correct answers with a ✓, 3 and 2 with a !, 1 with a ?, and 0 with a ✗.

                    <p>We can read off that the explicit token we already found is recognized by all models, and identify a few more anomalous tokens that were likely seen during training. Many others however are not recognized, and thus unlikely to have been in the training data.</p>

                    <p>We try to identify a pattern in the tokens that are recognized. It generally seems that recognized tokens yield many more hits on GitHub. Indeed, there often are some spam repositories on GitHub that contain these recognized strings, as well as some repositories containing lists of strings to block for content moderation.</p>

                    <p>The membership inference only tells us that the model saw the string, not where it was sourced from. To test whether GitHub was a likely source, we therefore correlate the number of search hits on GitHub with the number of correct answers across the GPT models. We find a significant Spearman's ρ of 0.448. This does not prove that GitHub was the source, because the high search hit count on GitHub could just be indicative that the token is more common across the internet. Nonetheless, the setup demonstrates how glitch tokens could be used to make broader statements about the training data.

                    <p>In summary, we have found strong evidence that models in the GPT-5 and GPT-oss family were trained on phrases from adult websites. We have also found weak evidence that part of the GPT training corpus was scraped off of GitHub. The search was made easier via access the weights of GPT-oss, showing how the open-weights paradigm opens up new attack vectors on production models. It seems advisable for frontier labs to mitigate this problem by excluding uncommon strings from their tokenizer vocabularies.</p>

                    <h3>Appendix</h3>
                    <p>These glitch tokens have more uses than was described above. If you want to work with these concepts, the <a href="https://github.com/lennart-finke/gpt-oss">companion repository</a> provides a starting point. Some ideas that could be interesting to explore:

                    </p><ul>
                        <li>Use glitch tokens to identify which model is behind a proprietary pipeline: I found that Cursor has issues with documents containing the glitch tokens listed here in Auto mode, but not with Claude selected, meaning Auto mode was using an OpenAI model in that case.</li>
                        <li>Study the implications on sample efficiency of GPT. Glitch tokens only occur a few times in training corpus, so the fact that GPT-5 only knows a little bit about their content gives a kind of upper bound on its sample efficiency.</li>
                        <li>Go beyond the embeddings and incorporate the first layers of the model, which could conceivably give information about bigram frequencies.</li>
                        <li>For the older gpt-4o model family, some glitch tokens induce infinitely looping completions. This could risk a denial-of-service-style token wasting attack, where a malicious user sends a glitch token to have the application use too many tokens. See below for a table of glitch tokens with links to gpt-4o and 4o-mini completions.</li>

                    <p>As more research on glitch tokens becomes available, I will try to list it here. The most comprehensive report to date is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/05/17/1092649/gpt-4o-chinese-token-polluted/">this</a> article in MIT Technology Review, and there are many articles in Chinese, such as <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/697685138">this one</a>. However, these  discuss the tokenizer itself, not how the models behave. </p>

                    <p>Finally, if you are in a position to fix the issue in the OpenAI API, I presume you already know how, else I'm happy to help. Note that a fix could even lower inference cost a bit. You can mail to <a href="mailto:lennart@finke.dev">lennart@finke.dev</a>.</p>

[YONHAP]</p>              </div>        &nbsp;  <p>   A fire at the National Information Resources Service (NIRS)'s Daejeon headquarters destroyed the government’s G-Drive cloud storage system, erasing work files saved individually by some 750,000 civil servants, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety said Wednesday.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     The fire broke out in the server room on the fifth floor of the center, damaging 96 information systems designated as critical to central government operations, including the G-Drive platform. The G-Drive has been in use since 2018, requiring government officials to store all work documents in the cloud instead of on personal computers. It provided around 30 gigabytes of storage per person.  </p><div><p><h2><strong>Related Article</strong></h2></p></div>  &nbsp;  <p>   However, due to the system’s large-capacity, low-performance storage structure, no external backups were maintained — meaning all data has been permanently lost.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     The scale of damage varies by agency. The Ministry of Personnel Management, which had mandated that all documents be stored exclusively on G-Drive, was hit hardest. The Office for Government Policy Coordination, which used the platform less extensively, suffered comparatively less damage.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     The Personnel Ministry stated that all departments are expected to experience work disruptions. It is currently working to recover alternative data using any files saved locally on personal computers within the past month, along with emails, official documents and printed records.  </p><div>              <p><img alt="A firefighter cools down burnt batteries at the National Information Resources Service (NIRS) in Daejeon on Sept. 27.

[YONHAP]</p>              </div>        &nbsp;  <p>   The Interior Ministry noted that official documents created through formal reporting or approval processes were also stored in the government’s Onnara system and may be recoverable once that system is restored.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     “Final reports and official records submitted to the government are also stored in OnNara, so this is not a total loss,” said a director of public services at the Interior Ministry.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     The Interior Ministry explained that while most systems at the Daejeon data center are backed up daily to separate equipment within the same center and to a physically remote backup facility, the G-Drive’s structure did not allow for external backups. This vulnerability ultimately left it unprotected.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     Criticism continues to build regarding the government's data management protocols.  </p><p> <i>This article was originally written in Korean and translated by a bilingual reporter with the help of generative AI tools.
