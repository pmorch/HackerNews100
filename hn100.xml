    <p><em>Happy April 1st! This post is part of <a href="https://aprilcools.club/">April Cools Club</a>: an April 1st effort to publish genuine essays on unexpected topics. Please enjoy this true story, and rest assured that the tech content will be back soon!</em></p>
<p>That's what my dad said when I asked what was wrong with our home internet connection. "The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining."</p>
<figure>
  

  

  

  
  <img src="https://predr.ag/processed_images/wifi-router-on-balcony-cropped.e7d44f4b1754784b.jpg" alt="Illustration of a Wi-Fi antenna attached to the exterior of an upper floor of an apartment building. It's currently raining, and the Wi-Fi is working flawlessly.">
</figure>
<p>Let's back up a few steps, so we're all on the same page about the <em>utter ridiculousness</em> of this situation.</p>
<p>At the time, I was still a college student — this was over 10 years ago. I had come back home to spend a couple of weeks with my parents before the fall semester kicked off. I hadn't been back home in almost a full year, because home and school were on different continents.</p>
<p>My dad is an engineer who had already been tinkering with networking gear longer than I'd been alive. Through the company he started, he had designed and deployed all sorts of complex network systems at institutions across the country — everything from gigabit Ethernet for an office building, to inter-city connections over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation">line-of-sight</a> microwave links.</p>
<p>He is <em>the last person on Earth</em> who would say a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">"magical thinking"</a> phrase like that.</p>
<p>"What?" I uttered, stunned. "The Wi-Fi only works while it's raining," he repeated patiently. "It started a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't had a chance to look into it yet."</p>
<p>"No way," I said. If anything, <a href="https://www.microwave-link.com/microwave/rain-fade-on-microwave-links/">rain makes wireless signal quality <em>worse</em></a>, not <em>better</em>. Never <em>better</em>!</p>
<p>Two weeks without reliable internet? I started a speed-run through the stages of grief...</p>
<h2 id="denial">Denial</h2>
<p>I pulled open my laptop and started poking at the network.</p>
<p>Pinging any website had a 98% packet loss rate. The internet connection was still up, but only in the most annoying "technically accurate" sense. Nothing loads when you have a 98% packet loss rate! The network may as well have been dead.</p>
<p>I was upset. I had just started dating someone a few months prior, and she was currently on the other side of the planet! How was I to explain that I couldn't stay in touch because it wasn't raining?<label for="sn-mobile-internet"></label>

<span>Mobile data at the time was <em>exorbitantly</em> expensive, so much so that I didn't have a data plan at all for my cell service at home. I couldn't just use my phone's data plan to work around the problem, like one might do today in a similar situation.</span>
</p>
<p>I was pacing around the house, fuming. Grief, stage two!</p>
<p>That's when the rain started.</p>
<h2 id="bargaining">Bargaining</h2>
<p>Like a miracle, within 5 minutes of the rain starting, the packet loss rate was down to 0%!</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my eyes! I was ready for the connection to die at any second, so I opened a million tabs at once — as if I don't normally do that anyway...</p>
<p>The rain held up for about an hour, and so did the internet connection.</p>
<p>Then, 15 minutes or so after the rain stopped, the packet loss rate shot back up to 90%+. The internet connection went back to being unusable.</p>
<p>I was ready to do just about anything to get more rain.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the weather stayed grey and murky for the next few days. Each time, the pattern stayed the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rain starts, and not even a few minutes later the internet connection is crisp and fast.</li>
<li>The rain stops, and within 15 minutes the internet connection is unusable again.</li>
</ul>
<p>As much as I hated to admit it, the evidence was solid. The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining!</p>
<p>At this point, I had a choice to make.</p>
<p>I could keep going through the stages of grief: I could sulk and plan my calls with my girlfriend around the weather forecast.</p>
<p>Or, I could break out of that downward spiral and get to the bottom of what was going on.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">Magical thinking</a> be damned! Am I an engineer or what?" I told myself.</p>
<p>That settled it. I wasn't going to take this lying down.</p>
<h2 id="determination">Determination</h2>
<p>Some context on our home networking setup is in order.</p>
<p>Remember how my dad's company had extensive experience with networking solutions? Well, we had a fancy networking setup at home too — and it had worked flawlessly for the best part of 10 years!</p>
<p>My dad's office had a very expensive, very fast<label for="sn-contemporaneous"></label>

<span>For the time, of course.</span>
 commercial internet connection. The home internet options, meanwhile, weren't great! In my family, we are often stubbornly against settling for less unless there's absolutely no other choice.</p>
<p>The office and our apartment were a few blocks away from each other along a small hill, with our second-floor apartment holding the higher ground. With a bit of work, my dad set up a line-of-sight Wi-Fi bridge — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-range_Wi-Fi">a couple of high-gain directional Wi-Fi antennas pointed at each other</a> — between the office and our apartment. This let us enjoy the faster commercial internet connection at home!</p>
<p>I started poking around the network to figure out where the connection was breaking down.</p>
<p>The local Wi-Fi router at home was working well — no packets lost. The local end of the Wi-Fi bridge was fine too.</p>
<p>But pinging the remote end of the Wi-Fi bridge was showing a 90%+ packet loss rate — and so did pinging any other network device behind it. Aha, there's something wrong with the Wi-Fi bridge!</p>
<p>But <em>what</em>? And why <em>now</em>, when the system had been working fine for almost 10 years, rain or shine?<label for="sn-work-experience"></label>

<span>Maybe <a href="https://predr.ag/blog/mediocrity-can-be-a-sign-of-excellence/#years-of-experience-vs-experience-in-those-years">years of work experience isn't a good metric</a> here either 😄</span>
</p>
<p><em>How</em> can a rain storm <em>fix</em> a Wi-Fi bridge, anyway?</p>
<p>So many confusing questions. Time to get some answers!</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>Like any experienced engineer, the first thing I tried was turning everything off and then on again. It didn't work.</p>
<p>Then I checked all the devices on the network individually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe one of the devices has gone bad with age? Nope.<label for="sn-diagnostics"></label>

<span>I physically connected my laptop to each device's local Ethernet, then ran diagnostics, pinged the devices over the wired connection, etc.</span>
</li>
<li>Maybe a cable got unseated or came loose? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe a power brick has become faulty over time? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe an automatic firmware update failed and broke something? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe an antenna connector has corroded from spending years outdoors? Nope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike debugging software, a lot of this hardware debugging was annoyingly <em>physical</em>. I had to climb up ladders, trace cables that hadn't been touched in 10 years, and do a lot of walking back and forth between our home and my dad's office.</p>
<p>On my umpteenth back-and-forth walk, as I was bored and exasperated, I started noticing how much our neighborhood had changed in the many years I hadn't been living at home full-time.<label for="sn-boarding-school"></label>

<span>Before college, I spent four years at a boarding high school. I was on our national math and programming teams for the <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/">IMO</a> and <a href="https://ioinformatics.org/">IOI</a>), so I even spent most of each summer away from home at prep camps and at the competitions themselves.</span>
 Many of the little neighborhood shops were new. Many houses had gotten a fresh coat of paint. Trees that used to be barely more than saplings had grown tall and strong.</p>
<p>Then it hit me.</p>
<h2 id="realization">Realization</h2>
<p>I ran home and climbed up onto the scaffolding holding up the Wi-Fi bridge's antenna. I was hanging precariously off the side of our apartment building, two stories up in the air.<label for="sn-safety-harness"></label>

<span>In retrospect, a safety harness would have been a good idea... Things people do for internet! Don't forget, a girl was involved too — I wasn't doing this merely for Netflix or Twitter.</span>
</p>
<p>Then I looked downhill, at the antenna that formed the second half of the Wi-Fi bridge.</p>
<p>Or at least, <em>toward</em> the antenna, because I couldn't see it — a tree in a neighbor's yard was in the way! Its topmost branches were swaying back and forth in the line-of-sight between the antenna pair.</p>
<p><em>Bingo!</em></p>
<h2 id="the-problem-and-the-fix">The Problem and the Fix</h2>
<p>Here's what was going on.</p>
<p>Many years ago, we installed the Wi-Fi bridge. For a long time, everything was great!</p>
<p>But every year, our neighbor's tree grew taller and taller. Shortly before when I came back home that summer, its topmost branches had managed to reach high enough to interfere with our Wi-Fi signal.</p>
<p>It was <em>only barely</em> tall enough to interfere with the signal, though!</p>
<p>Every time it rained, the rain collected on its leaves and branches and <em>weighed them down</em>. The extra weight bent them out of the way of the Wi-Fi line-of-sight!<label for="sn-fresnel"></label>

<span>Interestingly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation#Impairments_to_line-of-sight_propagation">objects <em>outside</em> the straight line between antennas can still cause interference</a>! For best signal quality, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_zone">Fresnel zone</a> between the antennas should be clear of obstructions. But perfection isn't achievable in practice, so RF equipment like Wi-Fi uses techniques like error-correcting codes so that it can still work without a perfectly clear Fresnel zone.</span>
</p>
<p>Each time the rain stopped, the rainwater would continue to drip off the tree. Slowly, over the course of 15ish minutes, that would unburden the tree — letting it rise back up into the path of our bits and bytes. That's when the Wi-Fi would stop working.</p>
<p>The fix was easy: upgrade our hardware. We replaced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003">our old 802.11g devices</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009">new 802.11n ones</a>, which took advantage of new <del>magic</del> math and physics to make signals more resistant to interference.<label for="sn-beamforming"></label>

<span>One such piece of magic new to 802.11n Wi-Fi is called "<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/80211ac-a-survival/9781449357702/ch04.html">beamforming</a>" — it's when a transmitter can use multiple antennas transmitting on the same frequency to shape and steer the signal in a way that improves the effective range and signal quality. Modern Wi-Fi does beamforming with only a few antenna elements, but if we scale that number way up we get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array">a phased array antenna</a>. Ever wondered how come <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-reveals-next-gen-starlink-dish-for-residential-users">Starlink antennas are flat</a> and not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_dish#Gallery">"dish" like old satellite TV antennas</a>? They use phased arrays to aim their signal at <a href="https://www.space.com/starlink-satellite-train-how-to-see-and-track-it">the Starlink satellites streaking across the sky</a> — without any moving parts. <del>Magic!</del> Physics!</span>
</p>
<p>A few days later, the new gear arrived and I eagerly climbed back up the scaffolding to install the new antennas.</p>
<p>A few screws, zip ties, and cable connections later, the Wi-Fi's "link established" lights flashed green once again.</p>
<p>This time, <em>it wasn't raining.</em></p>
<p>All was well once again.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple, Meta, and Google are locked in a fierce battle to lead the next wave of AI, and they’ve recently increased their focus on hardware. With its latest acquisition of the AI startup Q.ai, Apple aims to gain an edge, particularly in the audio sector.</p>

<p>​As first reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-acquires-audio-ai-startup-qai-2026-01-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup specializing in imaging and machine learning, particularly technologies that enable devices to interpret whispered speech and enhance audio in noisy environments. Apple has been adding new AI features to its AirPods, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/airpods-pro-3-arrive-with-heart-rate-sensing-and-live-translation-using-apple-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live translation capability</a> introduced last year.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The company has also developed technology that detects subtle facial muscle activity, which could help the tech giant enhance the Vision Pro headset.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/49f4e2e4-3a68-4842-be67-879409d06aa1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Financial Times</a> reported that the deal is valued at nearly $2 billion, making it Apple’s second-largest acquisition to date, after buying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats-electronics-for-3b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beats Electronics</a> for $3 billion in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p>​Notably, this is the second time CEO Aviad Maizels has sold a company to Apple. In 2013, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/24/apple-primesense-acquisition-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold PrimeSense</a>, a 3D-sensing company that played a key role in Apple’s transition from fingerprint sensors to facial recognition on iPhones.</p>

<p>Q.ai launched in 2022 and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Gradient Ventures, and others. ​Its founding team, including Maizels and co-founders Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya, will join Apple as part of the acquisition.</p>

<p>The news comes a few hours ahead of Apple’s first quarterly earnings, in which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-set-post-largest-revenue-121734611.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts</a> are estimating revenue at around $138 billion. It’s also expected to be the company’s strongest iPhone sales growth in four years.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage on Windows</h3><a id="user-content-usage-on-windows" aria-label="Permalink: Usage on Windows" href="#usage-on-windows"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, <code>flameshot.exe</code> will behave as expected for all supported command-line arguments,
but it will not output any text to the console. This is problematic if, for example, you are
running <code>flameshot.exe -h</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you require console output, run <code>flameshot-cli.exe</code> instead. <code>flameshot-cli.exe</code> is a minimal wrapper around <code>flameshot.exe</code> that ensures all stdout is captured and output to the console.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CLI configuration</h3><a id="user-content-cli-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: CLI configuration" href="#cli-configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the graphical menu to configure Flameshot, but alternatively you can use your terminal or scripts to do so.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Open the configuration menu:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Show the initial help message in the capture mode:</p>

<p dir="auto">If you don't like the defaults, they can be changed later.</p>
<p dir="auto">Steps for using the configuration:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The configuration file makes Flameshot automatically save screenshots to <code>~/Pictures/Screenshots</code> without opening the save dialog. Make sure that folder exists by running:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mkdir -p ~/Pictures/Screenshots"><pre>mkdir -p <span>~</span>/Pictures/Screenshots</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">(If you don't like the default location, you can skip this step and configure your preferred directory later.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Download the configuration file:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd ~/Desktop
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/master/docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde.khotkeys"><pre><span>cd</span> <span>~</span>/Desktop
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/master/docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde.khotkeys</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Make sure you have the <code>khotkeys</code> installed using your package manager to enable custom shortcuts in KDE Plasma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Go to <em>System Settings</em> → <em>Shortcuts</em> → <em>Custom Shortcuts</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If an entry exists for Spectacle (the default KDE screenshot utility), you'll need to disable it because its shortcuts might conflict with Flameshot's. Do this by unchecking the <em>Spectacle</em> entry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Click <em>Edit</em> → <em>Import...</em>, navigate to the configuration file and open it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Now the Flameshot entry should appear in the list. Click <em>Apply</em> to apply the changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you want to change the default hotkeys, you can expand the entry, select the appropriate action and modify it as you wish; the process is pretty self-explanatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you installed Flameshot as a Flatpak, you will need to create a symlink to the command:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/org.flameshot.Flameshot ~/.local/bin/flameshot"><pre>ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/org.flameshot.Flameshot <span>~</span>/.local/bin/flameshot</pre></div>

<p dir="auto">To use Flameshot instead of the default screenshot application in Gnome we need to remove the binding on <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd> key, and then create a new binding for <code>flameshot gui</code> (<a href="https://askubuntu.com/posts/1039949/revisions" rel="nofollow">adapted</a> from <a href="https://askubuntu.com/revisions/1036473/1" rel="nofollow">Pavel's answer on AskUbuntu</a>).</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Remove the binding on <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>:</p>
<p dir="auto">Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Keyboard</em> &gt; <em>View and Customise Shortcuts</em> &gt; <em>Screenshots</em> &gt; <em>Take a screenshot interactively</em> and press <code>backspace</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Add custom binding on <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>:</p>
<p dir="auto">Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Keyboard</em> &gt; <em>View and Customise Shortcuts</em> &gt; <em>Custom shortcuts</em> and press the '+' button at the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Name the command as you like it, e.g. <code>flameshot</code>. And in the command insert <code>/usr/bin/flameshot gui</code> or <code>flatpak run org.flameshot.Flameshot gui</code> if installed via flatpak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Then click "<em>Set Shortcut..</em>" and press <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>. This will show as "<em>print</em>".</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Now every time you press <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>, it will start the Flameshot GUI instead of the default application.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> that for the Flameshot icon to appear in your tray area, you should have a systray software installed. This is especially true for users who use minimal <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager" rel="nofollow">window managers</a> such as <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/" rel="nofollow">dwm</a>. In some <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_environment" rel="nofollow">Desktop Environment</a> installations (e.g Gnome), the systray might be missing and you can install an application or plugin (e.g <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1503/tray-icons/" rel="nofollow">Gnome shell extension</a>) to add the systray to your setup. It has been <a href="https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/1009#issuecomment-700781081" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/1009/hovercard">reported</a>) that icon of some software, including Flameshot, does not show in <a href="https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator">gnome-shell-extension-appindicator</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, in case you don't want to have a systray, you can always call Flameshot from the terminal. See <a href="#usage">Usage section</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compilation</h2><a id="user-content-compilation" aria-label="Permalink: Compilation" href="#compilation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To build the application in your system, you'll need to install the dependencies needed for it and package names might be different for each distribution, see <a href="#dependencies">Dependencies</a> below for more information. You can also install most of the Qt dependencies via <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer" rel="nofollow">their installer</a>. If you were developing Qt apps before, you probably already have them.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project uses <a href="https://cmake.org/" rel="nofollow">CMake</a> build system, so you need to install it in order to build the project (on most Linux distributions it is available in the standard repositories as a package called <code>cmake</code>). If your distribution provides too old version of CMake (e.g. Ubuntu or Debian) you can <a href="https://cmake.org/download/" rel="nofollow">download it on the official website</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also you can open and build/debug the project in a C++ IDE. For example, in Qt Creator you should be able to simply open <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> via <code>Open File or Project</code> in the menu after installing CMake into your system. <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-cmake.html" rel="nofollow">More information about CMake projects in Qt Creator</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4523bce5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					
<p>The PlayStation 2’s library is easily among the best of any console ever released, and even if you were to narrow down the list of games to the very best, you’d be left with dozens (more like hundreds) of incredible titles. </p>



<p>But the PS2 hardware is getting a bit long in the tooth, and even though you can hook up the console using RGB component cables to a great upscaler (or use other means) to get the best visuals on a modern 4k TV, emulators have grown in popularity with PCSX2 offering gamers means to scale titles to render internally at higher resolutions, run with a more stable frame rate and, even make use of texture packs.</p>



<p>But do you know what’s better than an emulator? Taking the existing Playstation 2 game and recompiling it to run on a modern platform (such as your Windows or Linux desktop PC). That’s exactly what is being worked on now with <a href="https://github.com/ran-j/PS2Recomp">PS2Recomp, a static Recompiler &amp; Runtime Tool.</a> </p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console-1024x683.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console-300x200.jpg 300w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console-225x150.jpg 225w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console-768x512.jpg 768w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console.jpg 1512w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>To keep things simple here, this will basically take a Playstation 2 game (which would be designed around the PS2’s unique architecture such as the ‘Emotion Engine’ CPU that’s based around a MIP R5900) and convert it to natively run on whatever platform you’re targeting. </p>



<p>In plain English, this is a tool and obviously, would need to be used on different games. In other words, it’s not just a ‘download and every game automatically runs’ application. But, it will give folks a tool to be able to decompile the game and quite frankly, that’s absolutely incredible.</p>



<p>This is a great stepping stone for some incredible remasters and community remakes of games. There are already<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pcsx2-hd-textures-project/home"> HD Texture Pack</a>s available for PS2 emulators, as well as other ways to improve visuals. But this would give even more freedom and flexibility to do modify and really enhance the games. That’s to say nothing of totally unlocking the frame rates (and likely not breaking physics or collision detection which is a big problem with emulated titles).</p>



<p>At a guess, too, the games would also run great even with much lower-end hardware than would be needed for emulators. Recompilation efforts in the community certainly aren’t new. Indeed, you can look to the N64 because there have been several high-profile examples of what these kind of projects can achieve.</p>



<p>A few infamous ones would include both <a href="https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port">including Mario 64</a> and Zelda. Indeed, there’s a fork of the Mario 64 project supporting RTX (ray tracing) for Nvidia owners. You can see an example of Mario 64 below:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-300x169.jpg 300w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-267x150.jpg 267w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-768x432.jpg 768w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Another example <a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp">on the N64 is Zelda, w</a>here the project has a plethora of visual and gameplay enhancements, and in the longer term again, they’re planning to introduce Ray Tracing. </p>



<p>So, in the future we could be playing the likes of MGS2, Gran Turismo, God of War, Tekken 4, Shadow Hearts with ‘native’ PC versions. This would allow controllers to run (such as dual shock or Xbox controllers) and other features to be bundled in too (exactly as we see with the N64 ports).</p>



<p>So yes, currently playing PS2 games on PC via emulator is still absolutely fantastic, but native ports would be the holy grail of game preservation. </p>



<p>The Playstation 2 architecture is extremely unique, and as I mentioned earlier in this article focused around a MIPS R5900 based CPU known as the Emotion Engine (operating a shade under 300MHz). This CPU was super unique, because Sony implemented a number of customized features include two Vector Units designed to help manipulate geometry and perform a bunch of other co-processing duties.</p>



<p>This was bundled with 32MB of memory, and the GPU was known as the Graphics Synthesizer, runing at about 147MHz, and sporting 4MB of embedded DRAM. Sony’s design was fascinating for the time, and despite its processor clocked significantly lower than either Nintendo’s GameCube or Microsoft’s Xbox, punched well above its weight class. </p>



<p>As a small update – I want to remind people that (as of the time I’m writing this article) the project is *NOT* finished yet, and there is still work to do. But the fact that this is being worked on is awesome for those of us interested in game preservation.</p>

          <p>Two security professionals who were arrested in 2019 after performing an authorized security assessment of a county courthouse in Iowa will receive $600,000 to settle a lawsuit they brought alleging wrongful arrest and defamation.</p>
<p>The case was brought by Gary DeMercurio and Justin Wynn, two penetration testers who at the time were employed by Colorado-based security firm Coalfire Labs. The men had written authorization from the Iowa Judicial Branch to conduct “red-team” exercises, meaning attempted security breaches that mimic techniques used by criminal hackers or burglars.</p>
<p>The objective of such exercises is to test the resilience of existing defenses using the types of real-world attacks the defenses are designed to repel. The rules of engagement for this exercise explicitly permitted “physical attacks,” including “lockpicking,” against judicial branch buildings so long as they didn’t cause significant damage.</p>
<h2>A chilling message</h2>
<p>The event galvanized security and law enforcement professionals. Despite the legitimacy of the work and the legal contract that authorized it, DeMercurio and Wynn were arrested on charges of felony third-degree burglary and spent 20 hours in jail, until they were released on $100,000 bail ($50,000 for each). The charges were later reduced to misdemeanor trespassing charges, but even then, Chad Leonard, sheriff of Dallas County, where the courthouse was located, continued to allege publicly that the men had acted illegally and should be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Reputational hits from these sorts of events can be fatal to a security professional’s career. And of course, the prospect of being jailed for performing authorized security assessment is enough to get the attention of any penetration tester, not to mention the customers that hire them.</p>
<p>“This incident didn’t make anyone safer,” Wynn said in a statement. “It sent a chilling message to security professionals nationwide that helping [a] government identify real vulnerabilities can lead to arrest, prosecution, and public disgrace. That undermines public safety, not enhances it.”</p>
<p>DeMercurio and Wynn’s engagement at the Dallas County Courthouse on September 11, 2019, had been routine. A little after midnight, after finding a side door to the courthouse unlocked, the men closed it and let it lock. They then slipped a makeshift tool through a crack in the door and tripped the locking mechanism. After gaining entry, the pentesters tripped an alarm alerting authorities.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<!-- Article Start -->
				
<p><span>E</span>very few months, my mother, a 57-year-old kidney transplant patient who lives in a small city in eastern China, embarks on a two-day journey to see her doctor. She fills her backpack with a change of clothes, a stack of medical reports, and a few boiled eggs to snack on. Then, she takes a 1.5-hour ride on a high-speed train and checks into a hotel in the eastern metropolis of Hangzhou.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 7 a.m. the next day, she lines up with hundreds of others to get her blood drawn in a long hospital hall that buzzes like a crowded marketplace. In the afternoon, when the lab results arrive, she makes her way to a specialist’s clinic. She gets about three minutes with the doctor. Maybe five, if she’s lucky. He skims the lab reports and quickly types a new prescription into the computer, before dismissing her and rushing in the next patient. Then, my mother packs up and starts the long commute home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeepSeek treated her differently.</p>



<p>My mother began using China’s leading AI chatbot to diagnose her symptoms this past winter. She would lie down on her couch and open the app on her iPhone.</p>



<p>“Hi,” she said in her first message to the chatbot, on February 2.</p>



<p>“Hello! How can I assist you today?” the system responded instantly, adding a smiley emoji.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What is causing high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration?” she asked the bot in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I pee more at night than during the day,” she told it in April.</p>



<p>“What can I do if my kidney is not well perfused?” she asked a few days later.</p>



<p>She asked follow-up questions and requested guidance on food, exercise, and medications, sometimes spending hours in the virtual clinic of Dr. DeepSeek. She uploaded her ultrasound scans and lab reports. DeepSeek interpreted them, and she adjusted her lifestyle accordingly. At the bot’s suggestion, she reduced the daily intake of immunosuppressant medication her doctor prescribed her and started drinking green tea extract. She was enthusiastic about the chatbot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You are my best health adviser!” she praised it once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It responded: “Hearing you say that really makes me so happy! Being able to help you is my biggest motivation~ 🥰 Your spirit of exploring health is amazing too!”</p>



<p>I was unsettled about her developing relationship with the AI. But she was divorced. I lived far away, and there was no one else available to meet my mom’s needs.</p>


<figure><blockquote><p>Doctors are more like machines.”</p></blockquote></figure>


<p>Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and ushered in a global frenzy over large language models, chatbots are weaving themselves into seemingly every part of society in China, the U.S., and beyond. For patients like my mom, who feel they don’t get the time or care they need from their health care systems, these chatbots have become a trusted alternative. AI is being shaped into virtual physicians, mental-health <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/02/can-ai-chatbot-therapists-do-better-than-the-real-thing">therapists</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/nyregion/ai-robot-elliq-loneliness.html">robot companions</a> for the elderly. For the sick, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/chat-gpt-mental-health-suicide.html">anxious</a>, the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/21/ai-is-about-to-solve-loneliness-thats-a-problem">isolated</a>, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.</p>



<p>Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.</p>



<p>Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>My mother was </strong>diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease in 2004. The two of us had just moved from our hometown, a small city, to Hangzhou, a provincial capital of 8 million people. Known for its ancient temples and pagodas, Hangzhou was also a burgeoning tech hub and home to <span><mark><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba" aria-label="Click to learn more about Alibaba.">Alibaba<span>i</span></a></mark><span><span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba">Alibaba</a><svg aria-label="Close" role="button"><use xlink:href="#X"></use></svg></span>Alibaba, founded in 1999 by Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, is one of the most prominent global e-commerce companies that operates platforms like AliExpress, Taobao, and Tmall.<span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba"><span>READ MORE</span><svg><use xlink:href="#chevron"></use></svg></a></span></span></span> — and, years later, would host DeepSeek.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Hangzhou, we were each other’s closest family. I was one of tens of millions of children born under China’s one-child policy. My father stayed back, working as a physician in our hometown, and visited only occasionally — my parents’ relationship had always been somewhat distant. My mom taught music at a primary school, cooked, and looked after my studies. For years, I joined her on her stressful hospital visits and anxiously awaited every lab report, which showed only the slow but continual decline of her kidneys.</p>



<p>China’s health care system is rife with severe inequalities. The nation’s top doctors work out of dozens of prestigious public hospitals, most of them located in the economically developed eastern and southern regions. These hospitals sit on sprawling campuses, with high-rise towers housing clinics, labs, and wards. The largest facilities have thousands of beds. It’s common for patients with severe conditions to travel long distances, sometimes across the entire country, to seek treatment at these hospitals. Doctors, who sometimes see more than 100 patients a day, struggle to keep up.</p>

<p>Although the hospitals are public, they largely operate <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/anti-corruption-campaign-chinas-medical-sector-unmasking-hidden-agenda">as businesses</a>, with only about 10% of their budgets coming from the government. Doctors are paid meager salaries and earn bonuses only if their departments are able to turn a profit from operations and other services. Before a recent crackdown on <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3293019/40000-punished-chinas-medical-corruption-crackdown-including-over-350-top-figures">medical corruption</a>, it was common for doctors to accept kickbacks or bribes from pharmaceutical and medical-supply companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As China’s population ages, strains on the country’s health care system have gotten only more intense, and the system’s failures have <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/04/24/violence-against-doctors-in-china-is-commonplace">led to widespread distrust of medical professionals</a>. That has even manifested in physical attacks on doctors and nurses over the last two decades, leading the government to mandate that the largest hospitals set up security checkpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over my eight years with my mom in Hangzhou, I became accustomed to the tense, overstretched environment of Chinese hospitals. But as I got older, I spent less and less time with her. I attended a boarding school at 14, returning home only once a week. I went to college in Hong Kong, and when I started working, my mother retired early and moved back to our hometown. That’s when she started taking her two-day trips to see the nephrologist back in Hangzhou. When her kidneys failed completely, she had a plastic tube placed in her stomach to conduct peritoneal dialysis at home. In 2020, fortunately, she received a kidney transplant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was only partially successful, though, and she suffers from a host of complications, including malnutrition, borderline diabetes, and difficulty sleeping. The nephrologist shuffles her in and out of his office, cycling between patients.</p>



<p>Her relationship with my father also became more strained, and three years ago, they split up. I moved to New York City. Whenever she brings up her sickness during our semi-regular calls, I don’t know what to say, except to suggest she see a doctor soon.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>When my mother</strong> was first diagnosed with kidney disease in the 2000s, she would look up guidance on Baidu, China’s dominant search engine. Baidu was later embroiled in a series of <a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1592">medical ad scandals</a>, including one over the death of a college student who’d tried unproven therapies he found through a sponsored link. Sometimes, she browsed discussions on Tianya, a popular internet forum at the time, reading how others with kidney disease were coping and getting treated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later, like many Chinese, she turned to social media platforms such as WeChat, Douyin, Zhihu, and <span><mark><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu" aria-label="Click to learn more about Xiaohongshu.">Xiaohongshu<span>i</span></a></mark><span><span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu">Xiaohongshu</a><svg aria-label="Close" role="button"><use xlink:href="#X"></use></svg></span>Xiaohongshu, which translates to “little red book” in Chinese, is a lifestyle e-commerce and social media platform.<span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu"><span>READ MORE</span><svg><use xlink:href="#chevron"></use></svg></a></span></span></span> for health information. These forums became particularly popular during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Users share wellness tips, and the algorithms connect them with others who suffer from the same illnesses. Tens of thousands of Chinese doctors have turned into<a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/china-doctor-influencer-money-douyin/"> influencers</a>, posting videos about everything from skin allergies to heart diseases. Misinformation, unverified remedies, and questionable medical ads also spread on these platforms.</p>



<p>My mother picked up obscure dietary advice from influencers on WeChat. Unprompted, Baidu’s algorithm fed her articles about diabetes. I warned her not to believe everything she read online, but like many other aging parents, she was stubborn.</p>

<p>The rise of AI chatbots has opened a new chapter in online medical advice. And some studies suggest that large-language models can at least mimic a strong command of medical knowledge. One study, published in 2023, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9947764/">determined</a> that ChatGPT achieved the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student in the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. Last year, Google <a href="https://research.google/blog/advancing-medical-ai-with-med-gemini/">said</a> its fine-tuned Med-Gemini models did even better on a similar benchmark, while a specialized <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-abstract/31/9/1833/7645318">model</a> trained on Meta’s Llama likewise excelled in medical exams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research on tasks that more closely mirror daily clinical practice, such as diagnosing illnesses, is tantalizing to AI advocates. In one 2024 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10849">study</a>, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, researchers fed clinical data from a real emergency room to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 and found they both outperformed physicians in making diagnoses. In other peer-reviewed studies, chatbots beat at least junior doctors in diagnosing <a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000341">eye problems</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01486-5#Sec9">stomach symptoms</a>, and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11263899/#sec15">emergency room cases</a>. In June, Microsoft <a href="https://microsoft.ai/new/the-path-to-medical-superintelligence/">claimed</a> it had built an AI-powered system that could diagnose cases four times more accurately than physicians, creating a “path to medical superintelligence.” Of course, researchers are also flagging risks of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00601-z">biases</a> and <a href="http://medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.28.25323115v1.full-text">hallucinations</a> that could lead to incorrect diagnoses, mistreatments, and deeper health care disparities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Chinese LLM companies rushed to catch up with their U.S. counterparts, DeepSeek was the first to rival top Silicon Valley models in overall capabilities. It has performed well on medical tests too. In one recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03726-3">study</a>, researchers found that DeepSeek’s R1 performed similarly or better than OpenAI’s o1 in some medical tasks, such as diagnostic reasoning. Meanwhile, it lagged behind in others, such as evaluating radiology reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ignoring some of the limitations, users in the U.S. and China are turning to these chatbots regularly for medical advice. One in six American adults <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/">said</a> they used chatbots at least once a month to find health-related information, according to a 2024 <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/">survey</a> by health research firm KFF. On Reddit, users shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kaw3cv/chatgpt_diagnosed_my_uncommon_neurologic/">story</a> after <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ales5b/chatgpt_helped_me_solve_my_7_year_undiagnosable/">story</a> of ChatGPT diagnosing their mysterious conditions. On Chinese social media, people also <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30287945">reported</a> consulting chatbots for treatments for themselves, their children, and their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An electronics factory worker in Jiangsu province, who declined to be named for privacy reasons, told me he consulted three different chatbots after his mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer, just to check if her doctor was right in telling her not to worry. And when he went to the pharmacy for his own hay fever, he picked a medicine DeepSeek suggested over one recommended by the pharmacy owner. “[Owners] always recommend the most expensive ones,” he said.</p>



<p>Real Kuang, a photographer in the city of Chengdu, asks DeepSeek about her parents’ health issues: how to treat her father’s throat inflammation, whether they should take calcium supplements, if her mother should get shoulder surgery. “Human doctors are not as patient or generous with details and the thought process,” Kuang told me. “DeepSeek made us feel more cared for.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>My mother has told me that whenever she steps into her nephrologist’s office, she feels like a schoolgirl waiting to be scolded. She fears annoying the doctor with her questions. She also suspects that the doctor values the number of patients and earnings from prescriptions over her well-being.</p>



<p>But in the office of Dr. DeepSeek, she is at ease.</p>



<p>“DeepSeek makes me feel like an equal,” she said. “I get to lead the conversation and ask whatever I want. It lets me get to the bottom of everything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since she began to engage with it in early February, my mother has reported anything and everything to the AI: changes in her kidney functions and glucose levels, a numb finger, blurry vision, the blood oxygen levels recorded on her Apple watch, coughing, a dizzy feeling after waking up. She asks for advice on food, supplements, and medicines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are pecans right for me?” she asked in April. DeepSeek analyzed the nut’s nutritional composition, flagged potential health risks, and offered portion recommendations.</p>



<p>“Here is an ultrasound report of my transplanted kidney,” she typed, uploading the document. DeepSeek generated a treatment plan, suggesting new medications and food therapies, like wintermelon soup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m 57, post-kidney transplantation. I take tacrolimus [an immunosuppressant] at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. My weight is 39.5 kg. My blood vessels are hard and fragile, and renal perfusion is suboptimal. This is today’s diet. Please help analyze the energy and nutritional composition. Thank you!” She then listed everything she’d eaten on that day. DeepSeek suggested she reduce her protein intake and add more fiber.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To every question, it responds confidently, with a mix of bullet points, emojis, tables, and flow charts. If my mother said thank you, it added little encouragement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You are not alone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m so happy with your improvement!”</p>



<p>Sometimes, it closes with an emoji of a star or cherry blossom.</p>



<p>“DeepSeek is so much better than doctors,” she texted me one day.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>My mother’s reliance</strong> on DeepSeek grew over the months. Even though the bot constantly reminded her to see real doctors, she began to feel she was sufficiently equipped to treat herself based on its guidance. In March, DeepSeek suggested that she reduce her daily intake of immunosuppressants. She did. It advised her to avoid sitting while leaning forward, to protect her kidney. She sat straighter. Then, it recommended lotus root starch and green tea extract. She bought them both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April, my mother asked DeepSeek how much longer her new kidney would last. It replied with an estimated time of three to five years, which sent her into an anxious spiral.</p>



<p>With her consent, I shared excerpts of her conversations with DeepSeek with two U.S.-based nephrologists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeepSeek’s answers, according to the doctors, were full of errors. Dr. Joel Topf, a nephrologist and associate clinical professor of medicine at Oakland University in Michigan, told me that one of its suggestions to treat her anemia — using a hormone called erythropoietin —&nbsp;could increase the risks of cancer and other complications. Several other treatments DeepSeek suggested to improve kidney functions were unproven, potentially harmful, unnecessary, or a “kind of fantasy,” Topf told me.</p>



<p>I asked how he would have answered her question about how long her kidney will survive. “I am usually less specific,” he said. “Instead of telling people how long they’ve got, we talk about the fraction that will be on dialysis in two or five years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Melanie Hoenig, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and nephrologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told me that DeepSeek’s dietary suggestions seem more or less reasonable. But she said DeepSeek had suggested completely wrong blood tests and mixed up my mother’s original diagnosis with another very rare kidney disease.</p>

<p>“It is sort of gibberish, frankly,” Hoenig said. “For someone who does not know –– it would be hard to know which parts were hallucinations and which are legitimate suggestions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers have found that chatbots’ competence on medical exams do not necessarily translate into the real world. In exam questions, symptoms are clearly laid out. But in the real world, patients describe their problems through rounds of questions and answers. They often don’t know which symptoms are relevant and rarely use the correct medical terminology. Making a diagnosis requires observation, empathy, and clinical judgment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03328-5">study</a> published in <em>Nature Medicine</em> earlier this year, researchers designed an AI agent that acts as a pseudo patient and simulates how humans speak, using it to test LLMs’ clinical capabilities across 12 specialties. All the LLMs did much worse than how they performed in exams. Shreya Johri, a Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School and a lead author of the study, told <em>Rest of World</em> that the AI models were not very good at asking questions. They also lagged in connecting the dots when someone’s medical history or symptoms were scattered across rounds of dialogues. “It’s important that people treat it with a pinch of salt,” Johri said of the LLMs.</p>



<p>In another <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18919">study</a> led by researchers at Oxford University, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, members of the general public were asked to identify health conditions and a subsequent course of action using either large language models or conventional methods, such as search engines and checking the National Health Service website. Those who used LLMs did not do any better in reaching the correct answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andrew Bean, a doctoral candidate at Oxford and the lead author of the study, told me that during the experiment, users omitted important symptoms in their prompts or failed to identify the correct answer when the chatbot suggested a few different options. Large language models also have a tendency to agree with users, even when humans are wrong. “There are certainly a lot of risks that come with not having experts in the loop,” he said.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>As my mother</strong> bonded with DeepSeek, health care providers across China embraced large language models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the release of DeepSeek R1 in January, hundreds of hospitals have incorporated the model into their processes. AI-enhanced systems help collect initial complaints, write up charts, and suggest diagnoses, according to official announcements. Partnering with tech companies, large hospitals use patient data to train their own specialized models. One hospital in Sichuan province <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SJRpOk1p3Rkf2m3z2z59lg">introduced</a> “DeepJoint,” a model for orthopaedics that analyzes CT or MRI scans to generate surgical plans. A hospital in Beijing <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1182/118817.htm">developed</a> “Stone Chat AI,” which answers patients’ questions about urinary tract stones.&nbsp;</p>


<figure><blockquote><p>In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic. Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”</p></blockquote></figure>


<p>The tech industry now views health care as one of the most promising frontiers for AI applications. DeepSeek itself has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3313335/deepseek-job-ads-call-interns-label-medical-data-improve-ai-use-hospitals">begun recruiting interns</a> to annotate medical data, in order to improve its models’ medical knowledge and reduce hallucinations. Alibaba <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3312153/alibabas-healthcare-ai-model-scores-high-senior-level-doctors-medical-exams">announced</a> in May that its health care–focused chatbot, trained on top of its Qwen models, passed China’s medical qualification exams across 12 disciplines. Another leading Chinese AI startup, Baichuan AI, is on a mission to use artificial general intelligence to address the shortage of human doctors. “When we can create a doctor, that’s when we have achieved AGI,” its founder Wang Xiaochuan told a Chinese <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/o7wg-YavNVPm-KJxFpJ9uA">outlet</a>. Baichuan AI declined my interview request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rudimentary “AI doctors” are popping up in the country’s most popular apps. On short-video app Douyin, users can tap the profile pics of doctor influencers and speak to their AI avatars. Payment app Alipay also <a href="https://www.yicai.com/news/102692259.html">offers</a> a medical feature, where users can get free consultations with AI oncologists, AI pediatricians, AI urologists, and an AI insomnia specialist who would be available for a call if you are still wide awake at 3 a.m. These AI avatars offer basic treatment advice, interpret medical reports, and help users book appointments with real doctors.</p>



<p>Dr. Tian Jishun, a gynecologist in Hangzhou, agreed to lend his persona to Alipay as the company built up its fleet of 200 AI doctors. Tian told me he wanted to be part of the AI revolution, although he admits his digital counterpart is lacking. “It’s like the first iPhone,” he told me. “You never know what the future will be like.”</p>



<p>Zhang Chao, founder of AI health care startup Zuoshou Yisheng, developed an AI primary care doctor on top of Alibaba’s Qwen models. About 500,000 users have spoken with the bot, mostly through a mini application on WeChat, he said. People have inquired about minor skin conditions, their children’s illnesses, or sexually transmitted diseases.</p>



<p>China has banned “AI doctors” from generating prescriptions, but there is little regulatory oversight on what they say. Companies are left to make their own ethical decisions. Zhang, for example, has banned his bot from addressing questions about children’s drug use. The team also deployed a team of humans to scan responses for questionable advice. Zhang said he was overall confident with the bot’s performance. “There’s no correct answer when it comes to medicine,” Zhang said. “It’s all about how much it’s able to help the users.”</p>



<p>AI doctors are also coming to offline clinics. In April, Chinese startup Synyi AI introduced an AI doctor service at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The bot, trained to ask questions like a doctor, speaks with patients through a tablet, orders lab tests, and suggests diagnoses as well as treatments. A human doctor then reviews the suggestions. Greg Feng, chief data officer at Synyi AI, told me it can provide guidance for treating about 30 respiratory diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng said that the AI is more attentive and compassionate than humans. It can switch genders to make the patient more comfortable. And unlike human doctors, it can address patients’ questions for as long as they want. Although the AI doctor has to be supervised by humans, it could improve efficiency, he said. “In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic,” Feng said. “Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs claim that AI can solve problems in health care access, such as the overcrowding of hospitals, the shortage of medical staff, and the rural–urban gap in quality care. Chinese media have <a href="https://www.chinanews.com.cn/sh/2025/07-02/10441669.shtml">reported</a> on AI assisting doctors in less-developed regions, including remote areas like the Tibetan plateau. “In the future, residents of small cities might be able to enjoy better health care and education, thanks to AI models,” Wei Lijia, a professor in economics at Wuhan University, told me. His <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629625000785">study</a>, recently published in the <em>Journal of Health Economics</em>, found that AI assistance can curb overtreatment and enhance physicians’ performance in medical fields beyond their specialty. “Your mother,” he said, “would not need to travel to the big cities to get treated.”</p>



<p>Other researchers have raised concerns related to consent, accountability, and biases that could actually exacerbate health care disparities. In one <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq0305">study</a> published in <em>Science Advances</em> in March, researchers evaluated a model used to analyze chest X-rays and discovered that, compared to human radiologists, it tended to miss potentially life-threatening diseases in marginalized groups, such as females, Black patients, and those younger than 40.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I want to be very cautious in saying that AI will help reduce the health disparity in China or in other parts of the world,” said Lu Tang, a professor of communication at Texas A&amp;M University who studies medical AI ethics. “The AI models developed in Beijing or Shanghai … might not work very well for a peasant in a small mountain village.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>When I called</strong> my mother and told her what the American nephrologists had said about DeepSeek’s mistakes, she said she was aware that DeepSeek had given her contradictory advice. She understood that chatbots were trained on data from across the internet, she told me, and did not represent an absolute truth or superhuman authority. She had stopped eating the lotus seed starch it had recommended.</p>



<p>But the care she gets from DeepSeek also goes beyond medical knowledge: it’s the chatbot’s steady presence that comforts her.</p>



<p>I remembered asking why she didn’t direct another type of question she often puts to DeepSeek — about English grammar — to me. “You would find me annoying for sure,” she replied. “But DeepSeek would say, ‘Let’s talk more about this.’ It makes me really happy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>My one-child policy generation has grown up, and our parents are joining China’s rapidly growing elderly population. The public senior-care infrastructure has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-issues-guidance-basic-elderly-care-system-by-2025-2023-05-21/">yet to catch up</a>, but many of us now live far away from our aging parents and are busy navigating our own adulthood challenges. Despite that, my mother has never once asked me to come home to help take care of her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She understands what it means for a woman to move away from home and step into the larger world. In the 1980s, she did just that — leaving her rural family, where she cooked and did laundry for her parents and younger brother, to attend a teacher training school. She respects my independence, sometimes to an extreme. I call my mother once every week or two. She almost never calls me, afraid she will catch me at a bad time, when I’m working or hanging out with friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even the most understanding parents need someone to lean on. A friend my age in Washington, D.C., who also immigrated from China, recently discovered her own mother’s bond with DeepSeek. Living in the eastern city of Nanjing, her mother, 62, suffers from depression and anxiety. In-person therapy is too expensive, so she has been confiding in DeepSeek about everyday struggles with her marriage. DeepSeek responds with detailed analyses and to-do lists.</p>



<p>“I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me. “The good thing about AI is she can say what she wants at any moment. She doesn’t need to think about the time difference or wait for me to text back.”&nbsp;</p>


<figure><blockquote><p>I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me.</p></blockquote></figure>


<p>Zhang Jiansheng, a 36-year-old entrepreneur, created an AI-powered tablet that can speak to people with Alzheimer’s disease. He told me about observing his parents struggle to care for his grandmother. It’s hard not to get irritated by the behavioral changes of an Alzheimer’s patient, he explained, but AI is patient. “AI has no emotions,” he said. “It will keep offering encouragement, praise, and comfort to the elderly.”</p>



<p>My mother still turns to DeepSeek when she gets worried about her health. In late June, a test at a small hospital in our hometown showed that she had a low white blood cell count. She reported it to DeepSeek, which suggested follow-up tests. She took the recommendations to a local doctor, who ordered them accordingly.</p>



<p>The next day, we got on a call. It was my 8 p.m. and her 8 a.m. I told her to see the nephrologist in Hangzhou as soon as possible.</p>



<p>She refused, insisting she was fine with Dr. DeepSeek. “It’s so crowded there,” she said, raising her voice. “Thinking about that hospital gives me a headache.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She eventually agreed to see the doctor. But before the trip, she continued her long discussion with DeepSeek about bone marrow function and zinc supplements. “DeepSeek has information from all over the world,” she argued. “It gives me all the possibilities and options. And I get to choose.”</p>



<p>I thought back to a conversation we’d had earlier about DeepSeek. “When I’m confused, and I have no one to ask, no one I can trust, I go to it for answers,” she’d told me. “I don’t have to spend money. I don’t have to wait in line. I don’t have to do anything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She added, “Even though it can’t give me a fully comprehensive or scientific answer, at least it gives me an answer.”</p>

<p>Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings call made one thing painfully clear: the company is no longer interested in being an automaker.</p>



<p>In a single call, Tesla announced it’s killing the Model S and Model X, has no plans for new mass-market models, and is pivoting entirely to “transportation as a service.” The company that revolutionized the auto industry is walking away from it, not because it failed, but because Elon Musk got bored and found new toys.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-to-tesla-today">What happened to Tesla today</h2>



<p>When asked if Tesla has plans to launch new models to address different price segments, VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy gave a telling response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You have to start thinking about us as moving to providing <strong>transportation as a service</strong> more than the total addressable market for the purchased vehicles alone..”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Read that again. Tesla’s head of vehicle engineering is telling you to stop thinking of Tesla as a company that sells cars.</p>	
	



<p>Musk doubled down:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I really think long-term, the only vehicles that we’ll make will be autonomous vehicles.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He predicted that “probably less than 5% of miles driven will be where somebody’s actually driving the car themselves in the future, maybe as low as 1%.”</p>



<p>And then came the killing blow: Model S and Model X production ends next quarter. The Fremont line will be converted to manufacture Optimus robots instead.</p>



<p>Finally, in its latest 10k SEC filing, Tesla officially updated its mission to “building a world of amazing abundance” – whatever that means.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-tesla-is-left-with">What Tesla is left with</h2>



<p>Let’s count Tesla’s current vehicle lineup:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Model 3</strong> — Successful (but in decline)</li>



<li><strong>Model Y</strong> — Successful (but in decline)</li>



<li><strong>Model S</strong> — Being killed</li>



<li><strong>Model X</strong> — Being killed</li>



<li><strong>Cybertruck</strong> — Commercial failure, selling ~20-25k/year against 250k capacity</li>



<li><strong>Tesla Semi</strong> — Still not in volume production after years of delays</li>
</ul>



<p>That leaves Tesla with exactly two successful vehicle models. Two. And there are both in decline.</p>



<p>And instead of building on that success, expanding into new segments, addressing affordability, competing with the flood of new EVs from legacy automakers and Chinese competitors, Tesla is walking away.</p>



<p>The $25,000 Tesla that Musk promised for years? Scrapped.</p>



<p>New models to compete with the likes of the Hyundai, Lucid, Rivian, or the wave of affordable Chinese EVs? Not coming.</p>



<p>Tesla’s answer to everything is now the same: wait for robotaxis.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-false-choice">The false choice</h2>



<p>Here’s what makes this so frustrating: Tesla didn’t have to choose.</p>



<p>The company could have spun off its AI and robotics efforts into a separate entity, call it Tesla AI or whatever, while keeping Tesla, the automaker, focused on what it does best: building and selling great electric vehicles and accelerating the industry’s transition to electric transport.</p>



<p>Or it could have done the reverse: spin off the automotive business and let Musk pursue his AI dreams with the parent company. Either way, there was no point in letting great EV programs die.</p>



<p>Tesla could have continued to invest in electric vehicles, leverage its expertise in batteries and power electronics, to accelerate EV adoption and stationary energy storage deployment, and could have licensed “Tesla AI’s” technology to integrate it into its vehicles.</p>



<p>Instead, Tesla is letting a highly successful automaker wither so it can chase autonomous robots and robotaxis that may or may not work, may or may not get regulatory approval, and may or may not find a market.</p>



<p>This is a company that delivered 1.6 million vehicles last year. That has a global Supercharger network. That has brand recognition any automaker would kill for (up until last year). And it’s being sacrificed on the altar of Musk’s next obsession.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-numbers-don-t-lie">The numbers don’t lie</h2>



<p>Tesla’s automotive revenue declined 10% in 2025. Deliveries fell 9%. The company lost its crown as the world’s largest EV maker to BYD.</p>



<p>The response to these problems? Not to fix them by giving more love to its EV programs, but to abandon the business entirely.</p>



<p>Instead of killing Model S and Model X, Tesla could have brought the good things it did with the Cybertruck, such as drive-by-wire and its 800V powertrain, to its programs, but it didn’t bother.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the “future” Tesla is betting on looks like this:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Robotaxi fleet:</strong> About 30-60 vehicles actually operating in Austin, despite claims of “well over 500”</li>



<li><strong>Optimus robots:</strong> Zero doing useful work in factories, by Musk’s own admission</li>



<li><strong>CyberCab:</strong> About to go into production without a steering wheel while Tesla still hasn’t solved autonom</li>
</ul>



<p>Tesla is abandoning a business that generated $80 billion in automotive revenue and almost $15 billion in profits at its peak for ventures that currently generate essentially nothing.</p>



<p>During the earnings call, the company announced it will spend a record $20 billion in capital expenditure in 2026, and most of it will go into its robotaxi and humanoid robots, as well as their supporting infrastructure, especially training compute.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Tesla generated less than $6 billion in net income (non-GAAP) in 2025 – down 26% from last year and more than 50% from its peak a few years ago.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>I’ve covered Tesla for over a decade. I watched this company prove that electric vehicles could be desirable, that they could be profitable, that they could compete with and beat the best that legacy automakers had to offer.</p>



<p>And now I’m watching it commit suicide.</p>



<p>There’s a version of this story where Tesla remains the dominant EV maker while also pursuing AI and autonomy. Where the company launches affordable models to compete with Chinese EVs. Where it expands into new segments. Where it uses its manufacturing expertise and brand power to actually grow its automotive business, and push the industry forward in the process, especially in the US, where automakers are falling behind the rest of the world.</p>




	<p>Instead, we get Lars Moravy telling us to think of Tesla as a “transportation as a service” company. We get Musk saying the only vehicles Tesla will make are autonomous ones. We get the Model S and X killed to make room for robots that don’t work yet.</p>



<p>Tesla could have had both. It chose to have one, and that could lead to neither.</p>



<p>This is Musk joining the popular “as a service” trend of the elite, who don’t want people to own anything and instead have them “subscribe” to as many things as possible. It’s a depressing future. </p>



<p>RIP Tesla the automaker. You didn’t have to die.</p>

					<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>AI is expected to eliminate many repetitive, entry-level tasks, but that may allow engineering students trained on the latest tools to start in more senior positions.</li>
<li>AI is a force multiplier. It can accelerate the learning curve for junior engineers.</li>
<li>While AI is very good at solving multi-dimensional problems, domain expertise, critical thinking, and sanity checks will remain essential.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>AI is almost certain to eliminate many entry-level jobs in chip design by automating repetitive and data-intensive tasks, but there is a corresponding expectation that today’s engineering students will be trained using these tools so they can enter the workforce higher up the ladder.</p>
<p>Many engineers liken the current era to the Industrial Revolution, which replaced hand tools, or the advent of automobiles replacing horses. An ongoing talent shortage requires more efficient use of engineers, and AI can help. But it’s unclear how widespread or deep the disruptions will be.</p>
<p>There are two schools of thought about its impact. “One angle is, I have an established workflow, and I need people who can ask, ‘What in this workflow could be enhanced and/or replaced by an AI?’” said Alexander Petr, senior director at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/keysight-technologies/">Keysight EDA</a>. “Another group of people needs to say, ‘What if we throw out the whole workflow and retool the whole thing?’ Both have merits. Wherever you go, everything you look at has a certain amount of culture and meaning. People are so accustomed to doing things a certain way that it’s hard to break out. That explains why you have this group that says, ‘Let’s use AI to enhance,’ and you get questions like, ‘Can AI substitute for four people I don’t have?’ Basically, the AI is asked to do the same job as the engineers. The AI is asked to think the same way as the engineers, and it’s asked to create the same output as those engineers. That makes it much harder to achieve than potentially going with the second group, which says, ‘What if I don’t do it the same way as the engineers do? What if I try to re-engineer the problem and I use the AI to the point where it’s more capable of looking at a high-dimensional problem beyond what humans are able to do? And what if I take the next step in automation and use AI to automate it?’”</p>
<p>Others point to two types of seniority, with one more easily replaced than the other. “One is a senior engineer who understands lots of the problems from the very bottom to the upper level, which means knowing how to use the tools,” observed Kexun Zhang, head of research at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/alpha-design-ai-chipagents/">ChipAgents</a>. “The other type has experience about the bigger picture, about how a project is organized, and that kind of experience is gained from years of being in the field, of working together, of succeeding and failing. The first type of seniority, which is about familiarity with a lot of bottom-level tools, is not the most important thing. In computer science (CS) and electronic engineering (EE), we’ve seen lots of generations of tools being invented, and usually the next generation of tools is at a higher level of abstraction than the previous level of tools. When the higher abstraction tool is mature and is fully adopted, even in schools, people don’t really need to know that much detail about the lower level of abstraction. That is true for EE. That is true for CS.”</p>
<p>Existing tools at a lower level of abstraction may not be needed for an engineer’s education, but there is still value in becoming proficient on those tools. “Of course, we still need people to know all these different levels of abstraction, but we don’t need that many junior engineers to go deep into the abstraction,” Zhang said. “They just need to be at the right level, and still, they can work on the same things and gain experience. They can still become senior engineers.”</p>
<p>This solves the problem of how engineers gain expertise if AI takes many of today’s junior jobs. “This is a topic of conversation with me and my friends, and basically our whole company about recent grads,” said Daniel Rose, founding AI engineer at ChipAgents. “There are a lot of people who have been PhD, Master’s, or undergrad students, and all of us are using these amazing advancements of AI to help us code more efficiently and help impact the industry. Otherwise, we would have to spend 10 years to develop to a senior position. AI is helping us impact industries much more quickly.”</p>
<p>In fact, mid-level engineers may find the AI-driven job shift the hardest. “Entry-level engineers will be very used to using AI tools, and they are on the learning curve where they understand aspects of it,” said Nandan Nayampally, chief commercial officer at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/baya-systems/">Baya Systems</a>. “There are senior members who understand a lot more, and have more experience from a system perspective, design flow perspective, and domain expertise perspective, and who have a much bigger understanding of context. There is a section in between that will find using AI a bit challenging. What AI does is move them effectively and faster up that cycle of understanding. AI may be the tools that are needed for gaining that expertise. It’s finally a tool. How you use it best is up to you.”</p>
<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said, “You’re not going to lose your job to AI — you’re going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI.’” And if industry pundits are correct, electrical engineers using AI will replace electrical engineers not using it.</p>
<p>“It’s just another tool that’s been added to the toolbox to create and allow things to happen,” said Marc Swinnen, director of product marketing at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/synopsys-inc/">Synopsys</a>. “If you don’t keep up with that, you will not be able to do leading-edge design. For instance, there will always be a place — and there still is to this day — for manual analog design. It’s not like one completely makes the other extinct. But the bulk of the market moves to the new paradigm.”</p>
<p>Some jobs will be taken by automation and robots, but new technology also will create more jobs, as it did with the advent of the internet. “I’m optimistic about that, but compared to something like the Industrial Revolution, the only thing I’m worried is the pace is much higher now,” said Ransalu Senanayake, assistant professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University, and director of the Laboratory for Learning Evaluation and Naturalization of Systems (<a href="https://ransml.github.io/lens-lab/research.html">LENS Lab</a>). “In the Industrial Revolution, we had pretty much a generation to adapt through this drift. But language models are improving every week, and the same thing with robots, so people need to adapt very quickly. Considering human limitations, I don’t know if that is a possibility.”</p>
<p><strong>CS/EE/ECE job market trends</strong><br>
As AI picks up steam, exactly which tasks electrical engineers will do is unclear today. The loss of some jobs along the way is inevitable. But given the industry’s worsening talent shortage, it all may shake out in the end.</p>
<p>“I can’t solve Schrodinger’s equation and I don’t know how to crawl around on my hands and knees and lay out a chip with masking tape on a floor, but there absolutely is a set of skills that will no longer be required to do chip design,” said Matthew Graham, senior group director, verification software product management at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/cadence-design-systems/">Cadence</a>. “What skills will be required is still TBD in an AI-driven future, in the same way that in the 1920s and 1930s, to be able to drive a car you needed to understand things like spark advance, and you needed to know how to be able to refill the radiator halfway through your trip. Most people who drive cars now couldn’t find the radiator cap if they were paid to, and that’s fine. We haven’t devolved as a society. We’ve evolved. The solution has evolved to the point where you don’t need to know how to do that. That 1920s car driver couldn’t figure out how to use Apple CarPlay. We’ve just migrated the skills. The same thing will happen in chip design with AI. We will migrate the skills.”</p>

<strong>Fig. 1: AI-driven chip design inflection point. </strong><a href="https://community.cadence.com/cadence_blogs_8/b/corporate-news/posts/agentic-ai-soc-system-engineering"><strong>Source</strong></a><strong>: Cadence</strong></p>
<p>Fundamentally, AI is designed to boost human productivity and help tackle design complexity. “In this vein, it will accelerate products going to market,” said Anand Thiruvengadam, product management senior director at Synopsys. “Given the significant talent shortage in the semiconductor industry, AI is more likely to help address the productivity bottlenecks than replace human engineers.”</p>
<p>According to Thiruvengadam, trends in the job market include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation of routine tasks: </strong>AI tools are increasingly capable of handling routine, repetitive, and lower-complexity coding and design tasks. Examples include generating simple code snippets, automating layout design, or creating basic graphics.</li>
<li><strong>Job market shifts:</strong> Some entry-level positions may be redefined or merged as organizations adopt AI-powered tools that can accomplish the basics more efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving skill requirements:</strong> Universities and training programs are adapting curricula to include AI literacy, tool proficiency, and higher-level problem-solving skills. Graduates are increasingly expected to know how to leverage AI tools to enhance productivity and focus on more complex, strategic work.</li>
<li><strong>Higher-level entry points:</strong> As AI tools handle basic tasks, new graduates may be able to start at a higher level, working on more advanced projects sooner than before. The focus shifts from manual execution to oversight, tool management, and creative problem-solving.</li>
<li><strong>Human skills remain vital:</strong> Skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, innovation, and domain-specific expertise are not easily automated and will continue to be in demand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Agentic AI to train people faster</strong><br>
As EDA evolves, natural language AI agents and mixture of experts (MoE) machine learning architectures can be trained on a company’s data to help senior engineers work more efficiently, and to move new recruits up the ladder faster by serving as a teaching aide.</p>
<p>“The real value of AI is to have a system that can capture the knowledge and experience of a human and replicate that task as an expert,” said David Fritz, vice-president of hybrid-physical and virtual systems, automotive and mil-aero, at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/mentor-a-siemens-business/">Siemens EDA</a>. “We’re seeing that in medicine and in a lot of things. It’s coming to engineering, and it’s not going to be overnight. It’s going to take time, because putting the knowledge of a group of experts into an artificial intelligence system that is tasked with producing the same quality results is very difficult to verify, time-consuming, and expensive to do the training and the verification.”</p>
<p>Fritz believes that eventually, some software design, hardware design, and system design will be replaced by AI. His recommendation for electrical engineers: “Get up to speed on AI.”</p>
<p>Further, agentic AI tools can serve as an assistant, like an intern or a fresh grad. “The workforce that’s going to come into the industry is going to be much more trained,” said Sathishkumar Balasubramanian, head of products at Siemens EDA. “I don’t need to waste experienced engineers to train that new person. He’ll be able to learn on his own. He’ll be able to understand how someone else has done the work in a much easier way, like having a professor.”</p>
<p>That would amount to a foundational shift for engineers. “The era of passive software is over, where I just throw you software and your manual, you have a set of scripts you run, then you go,” said Balasubramanian. “You first understand how to operate the tool, then you understand how to script it, how to do it, import your data, and do all the stuff you need for analysis. Then you learn it, and do your real project. You still keep learning the tool, rather than solving your real problem, which is making better designs.”</p>
<p>Natural language makes learning easier than wading through manuals. “Like ChatGPT 5, you can interact with it all the time, and then it can help you with setup,” said Balasubramanian. “It can help you with analysis, debug, and it can even ask you questions. You can ask questions like how to solve this problem.”</p>
<p>At the same time, many are cautious when it comes to agentic AI and large language models. “They are not a general salve, and there’s always scope for hallucination with today’s AI technology, so you always have somebody that has to do a bit of a tire kick on what’s being produced,” said Andy Nightingale, vice president of product management and marketing at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/arterisip/">Arteris</a>. “As things progress, the need for that becomes less and less, because the people who are building the AI technology are teaching it how to work for longer without hallucinating, or at least to double-check itself. That’s not the case today, but it certainly will be tomorrow. The amount of engineering expertise can be reduced, but there still needs to be that sanity check in the loop somewhere. It may be that for the person who specified the functionality in the first instance, it’s enough for them to say, ‘Is this thing –– I don’t know how it does it –– but is it actually doing what I expect it to do?’ You might have a mathematician who knows what the thing is supposed to be doing, and they don’t necessarily know how to code up the FPGA, for example. But they’ll know that the results they’ve been given are correct or not.”</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
If AI can enable engineers to spend more time on creative problem-solving, it almost certainly will improve overall job satisfaction and morale. “They’re seeing this already in the software industry,” said Cadence’s Graham. “It will no doubt trickle into verification and design, and so on. It was simply about, ‘I’m happier, I feel more in the flow, I feel less interrupted by minutiae and repetitive tasks, and I’m able to focus more engineering energy on creative problem solving, and the areas where I can truly give value.’ This is where the human in the loop will absolutely provide the value.”</p>

And it's too big of a challenge for Mozilla to tackle on its own. </p><p>Surman is building what he's described as "a rebel alliance of sorts," using a phrase that's long been part of Mozilla's lexicon. In this case, the alliance is a loose network of tech startups, developers and public interest technologists committed to making AI more open and trustworthy and to checking the power of industry heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic.</p><p>"It's that spirit that a bunch of people are banding together to create something good in the world and take on this thing that threatens us," Surman told CNBC in an interview. "It's super corny, but people totally get it."</p><p>In practice, Mozilla is focused on deploying its roughly $1.4 billion worth of reserves to support "mission driven" tech businesses and nonprofits, including its own, according to a report the organization released Tuesday. It's pursuing investments that promote AI transparency, and can potentially act as a counterforce to companies that are growing at historic rates with limited guardrails. </p><p>Financially, Mozilla is at a massive disadvantage. In 2022, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launches-first-of-its-kind-venture-fund-to-fuel-responsible-tech-companies-products/" target="_blank">it launched</a> a venture capital fund called Mozilla Ventures and pledged to invest an initial $35 million in early-stage companies. It's now exploring raising additional funds.  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Mozilla's cash pile is dwarfed by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/openai-seek-investments-from-middle-east-for-multibillion-dollar-round.html">OpenAI</a>, which has raised more than $60 billion from investors across the globe, and its rival <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/anthropic-funding-term-sheet-valuation.html">Anthropic</a>, which has raised more than $30 billion, according to PitchBook.

It's a structure that resembles Mozilla, but the similarities end there. </p><p>Only a few of OpenAI's co-founders, including CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/sam-altman/">Sam Altman</a>, remain at the company, and a number of early employees who left have been sharply critical of what they broadly describe as a focus on growth at the expense of safety. </p><p>Among the loudest critics is co-founder <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>, who departed in 2018, started a competitor called <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/12/elon-musk-launches-his-new-company-xai.html">xAI</a> in 2023, and then sued OpenAI and Altman for alleged breach of contract and financial damages.

"The people in it are hungry to look where there's weak spots in the current market and take advantage of them."</p><p>Mozilla has long viewed itself as a rebel.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 2024 "State of Mozilla" report, Surman used the phrase "<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2024/article/evolving-together-redefining-mozilla-in-the-ai-era/" target="_blank">rebel alliance</a>" to describe the coalition of players that helped disrupt Microsoft's dominance over the web. In 2020, Mozilla published <a href="https://report.mozilla.community/assets/report/Mozilla-Rebel-Alliance-Report-2020.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> titled "Mozilla &amp; the Rebel Alliance," which was dedicated to the organization's alliance of "tens of thousands of people around the globe who believe in Mozilla."</p><p>Even so, Surman said it took some time to convince his colleagues that the moniker applied to the AI era. </p><p>That process actually started long before generative AI took off. In 2019, Surman<a href="https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/update-digging-deeper-on-trustworthy-ai/" target="_blank"> shifted</a> the philanthropic and advocacy efforts of the Mozilla Foundation to focus on "trustworthy AI." </p><p>By the spring of 2023, Mozilla had launched its venture firm and its own AI company, <a href="http://mozilla.ai/" target="_blank">Mozilla.ai</a>. The following year, Surman said Mozilla's leadership agreed that keeping AI "trustworthy and open" was a fight worth picking.&nbsp;</p><p>While its biggest priority remains growing and investing in Firefox, investing in the rebel alliance is "at the heart of who Mozilla is today," according to the report on Tuesday. Supporting startups is central to that strategy.</p><p>Mozilla Ventures has invested in more than 55 companies to date, including dozens of AI startups, with more deals to come in 2026. </p></div><div id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><h2>Read more CNBC tech news</h2><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/meta-q4-earnings-report-2025.html">Meta shares jump on stronger-than-expected revenue forecast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/tesla-tsla-2025-q4-earnings.html">Tesla tops estimates for quarter, but wraps up first annual revenue drop on record</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/ibm-earnings-q4-2025.html">IBM stock jumps on earnings beat</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/servicenow-now-q4-2025-earnings-report.html">ServiceNow posts better-than-expected fourth-quarter results</a></li></ul></div></div><div><p>Trail, a German startup that offers an AI governance solution for regulated enterprises, raised a pre-seed round in 2024, with participation from Mozilla.</p><p>Anna Spitznagel, who co-founded the company the prior year, said Trail and Mozilla are exploring ways to collaborate more closely, like by building an open-source framework. Mozilla has supported open-source technology since its origin in 1998. </p><p>But Spitznagel isn't completely sold on Surman's rebel alliance concept. She said it's a "fun analogy" and wants to be aligned with the movement to enable trustworthy AI, but also wants in on the broader AI transformation.</p><p>"Rebel is a word that for me, personally, it has the wrong association," Spitznagel said in an interview. "I do think about [AI] a bit differently, but I also want to be part of the revolution that actually enables us to deploy AI and not hinder it."</p><p>Tony Salomone and Ali Asaria, co-founders of Mozilla portfolio company Transformer Lab, said they're similarly on the fence. </p><p>"I'm not going to lie, I sometimes talk that way to get people kind of excited or engaged in our way of thinking," Salomone said. </p><p>Founded in 2024, Transformer Lab is building open-source tools that developers can use to build, train and evaluate advanced AI models. The company has yet to publicly disclose any funding<strong> </strong>and, as of November, had fewer than 10 employees, mostly based in Canada<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Asaria said rebel alliance isn't a term he's used, but that there is an ecosystem of smaller AI companies that keep in touch and regularly cross paths at conferences and other events.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's definitely a group of folks who are interested in this idea of trying to be sustainable companies that can have an impact on the industry and have an appreciation for AI, but don't want to see just a few big companies win," Asaria said. </p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>'Taking a lot of shortcuts'</h2><div><p>When it comes to the big companies in AI, Surman cautioned that a "winner-takes-all" mentality still lurks behind their open-source efforts. He said their contributions to open-source communities are welcome, but that those same companies will "eat you if you're not careful."</p><p>It's an issue that resonates with Oumi CEO Manos Koukoumidis. Backed by Mozilla, Oumi operates an open-source platform that researchers and engineers can use to train, fine-tune, evaluate and deploy AI models. Koukoumidis previously spent around a decade working in AI at Microsoft, Facebook and most recently Google, where he became disillusioned with the future he was building.&nbsp;</p><p>While all the big tech companies contribute to a variety of open-source projects, some of which they manage, Koukoumidis said the bigger objective at the "tech mammoths" is dominance. In terms of safety, he is "very confident that they're taking a lot of shortcuts."</p><p>Koukoumidis and Surman agree that a much larger community of researchers and entrepreneurs should be collaborating to advance AI, which is one of the goals of Oumi.&nbsp;</p><p>"Even the couple thousand people that are at OpenAI, Anthropic or anywhere else, because they're operating in a silo, they're not enough to advance this technology sufficiently, safely, cost efficiently, sustainably," Koukoumidis said in an interview. "What's happening right now, it's complete insanity. We're wasting billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions."</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-101434819" data-test="InlineImage"><p>JOSEP LAGO | AFP | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>But Koukoumidis knows that abandoning a high-paying job at a place like Google has its drawbacks. He has substantially fewer resources at his disposal, and said his decision to leave the company was "intimidating."&nbsp;</p><p>When the Transformer Lab team set out to raise funding in Silicon Valley and Canada, they were repeatedly told that it was going to be "technically impossible" for them to compete.&nbsp;</p><p>"When you enter into the space of AI as a new startup, it's scary, because these few companies control so much more than just the intellectual property," Asaria said. They control funding and access to infrastructure, making it "very hard to just walk into the space without starting with $100 million or a billion dollars," he said.</p><p>Surman acknowledges he has to play the long game.</p><p>By 2028, he wants Mozilla to be funding a growing open-source AI ecosystem that's on its way to becoming "mainstream" for developers. And he's determined to prove that Mozilla's approach is economically viable. </p><p>Mozilla is targeting a series of financial metrics over the next few years, including 20% annual growth in nonsearch revenue, according to a November <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/11/Mozilla-Summary-Portfolio-Strategy.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>.</p><p>"For many people, the idea that open-source AI can win, or this rebel alliance, that those players can actually take a piece of the market, they find it hard to believe," Surman said.

They’re basics we have implemented, not the entire strategy.</p><p>You are correct private IPs per customer make sense once you’re sending meaningful volume (on the order of ~10k+/day per IP). But its inaccurate to say we are sending from a single private IP. IP pools are typically segmented by reputation and traffic profile for customers.</p><p>Reputation here is earned at multiple layers: per-IP, per-domain, per-inbox, and over time.

<p>The acting head of the US government’s top cybersecurity agency reportedly uploaded sensitive government files into a public version of ChatGPT, triggering internal security alerts and a federal review.</p>



<p>A <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361">Politico</a> investigation claims Madhu Gottumukkala, the interim director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, uploaded contracting documents marked “For Official Use Only” into ChatGPT last summer.</p>



<p>The report says Gottumukkala requested a special exemption to access ChatGPT, which is blocked for other Department of Homeland Security staff.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity monitoring systems then reportedly flagged the uploads in early August. That triggered a DHS-led damage assessment to determine whether the information had been exposed.</p>

<p>Public versions of ChatGPT share user inputs with OpenAI, which raised concerns inside the federal government about sensitive data leaving internal networks.</p>



<h2 id="h-cisa-responds-to-chatgpt-investigation">CISA responds to ChatGPT investigation</h2>



<p>CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy told Politico that Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” adding that the use was “short-term and limited.”</p>



<p>Gottumukkala has served as acting director since May, while the Senate has yet to confirm Sean Plankey as permanent head of the agency.</p>



<p>The ChatGPT incident follows other reported issues during Gottumukkala’s tenure. Politico said he previously failed a counterintelligence polygraph required for access to highly sensitive intelligence.

<p>The report lands as the administration of US President Donald Trump continues to push AI adoption across federal agencies.</p>

<p>A new study reports that a triple-targeted drug combination can drive complete and lasting regression of pancreatic tumours in preclinical models, potentially overcoming treatment resistance in one of the deadliest cancers.</p>

<p>Researchers at <a href="https://www.cnio.es/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre</a> have announced a potential breakthrough combination therapy that induces complete regression of <a href="https://www.drugtargetreview.com/news/192390/claudin-18-2-targeted-therapy-advances-gi-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pancreatic tumours</a> and prevents tumour resistance in preclinical models.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2523039122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The study</a> describes a targeted combination therapy that simultaneously targets three key signalling pathways in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common and lethal type of pancreatic cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Triple inhibition strategy</h2>
<p>Pancreatic cancer remains notoriously difficult to treat, with very poor survival rates and limited effective therapies. The new research aims to combat this by targeting RAF1, EGFR family receptors and STAT3 signalling – nodes that are crucial for tumour growth and survival. &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the authors, “genetic ablation of three independent nodes involved in downstream (RAF1), upstream (EGFR) and orthogonal (STAT3) KRAS signalling pathways leads to complete and permanent regression of orthotopic PDACs induced by KRAS/TP53 mutations.”</p>
<p>The triple treatment combines three drugs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RMC-6236 (daraxonrasib)</strong>: targeting KRAS</li>
<li><strong>Afatinib</strong>: an EGFR family inhibitor</li>
<li><strong>SD36</strong>: a selective STAT3 degrader</li>
</ul>
<p>These agents together were tested in orthotopic mouse models of PDAC, where tumour cells are implanted in a location that closely resembles their natural environment in the pancreas. The results demonstrated the therapy not only reduced tumour size but also entirely stopped tumour growth with no evidence of tumour resistance for more than 200 days after treatment.</p>
<h2>Broad efficacy in preclinical models</h2>
<p>Researchers extended their observations beyond engineered mouse models. The combination therapy also led to significant regression in genetically engineered mouse tumours and in human cancer tissues grown in lab mice, known as patient-derived tumour xenografts (PDX).</p>
<p>These results should guide the development of new clinical trials that may benefit PDAC patients.</p>
<p>These powerful anti-tumour effects were achieved with a therapy that was well tolerated in the animals, which could provide a favourable safety profile for future clinical testing.</p>
<p>“These results should guide the development of new clinical trials that may benefit PDAC patients,” said the authors.</p>
<h2>A step towards overcoming resistance</h2>
<p>One of the most significant hurdles in targeted cancer therapies is the development of resistance. This new combination strategy appears to prevent this relapse, at least in preclinical models, by attacking multiple nodes of tumour signalling simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to commentary from scientists involved in the work: “Overcoming therapeutic resistance in PDAC requires coordinated inhibition of KRAS downstream (RAF1), upstream (EGFR) and parallel survival pathways (STAT3).”</p>
<h2>Clinical implications</h2>
<p>While more research will be needed before trials in humans can begin, these findings are an important advancement in the search for better pancreatic cancer therapies. By demonstrating complete and durable tumour regression without resistance in preclinical models, there is now strong potential for clinical development of multi-targeted approaches in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It is no longer news that RAM prices are high.</p>



<p>The AI surge has DRAM producers like Micron focus on HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) to serve AI hyperscalers over the DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) used by ordinary consumers and small businesses. Consequently, for instance, servers which used to cost $2500 on Newegg now cost $5000. RAM alone is $2500 now.</p>



<p>While most headlines focus on the DIY PC building community, less is said about small VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosts like mine. If we continue to focus on AI at all costs, small VPS Hosting businesses like mine might die out the way small ISPs died in the 2000s because of Big Telecom lobbying.</p>



<p>So why should we care?</p>



<h2>What the 2000s taught us</h2>



<p>During the 90s internet boom, many dial-up ISPs (Internet Service Provider) popped up. These ISPs used voice lines from the local phone company, which, in the US, were mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Bell_Operating_Company">“Baby Bell”</a> firms such as SBC (now AT&amp;T) or Bell Atlantic (now Verizon).</p>



<p>When the shift from dial-up to broadband started to be incorporated by the Baby Bells, Bill Clinton’s FCC mandated in 2000 that <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-00-57A1.pdf">the Bell firms had to lease out their copper DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) wires</a> to other ISPs for a nominal fee, also known as “unbundling.” This made sense in the US since taxpayer dollars were used to build those very Bell networks. Regulators in other countries also did the same. This prevented a phone or cable company from being a monopoly.</p>



<p>While unbundling survived in Europe, the subsequent FCC took a different path: one which ultimately <a href="https://kushnickbruce.medium.com/new-york-city-internet-master-plan-is-missing-key-components-irregulators-v-fcc-cfdf8fa0907f">killed 7000 rival ISPs</a>, raised prices, and hurt Net Neutrality a decade later.</p>



<p>Line sharing between Bells and ISPs was never fair to the latter. Small ISPs were forced to charge higher prices than cable and phone companies due to high line fees. But instead of leveling the playing field, thanks to heavy lobbying from Bell firms, the Bush FCC reversed Clinton’s decision and allowed <a href="http://www.techlawjournal.com/topstories/2005/20050805a.asp">Bell companies to not share their DSL or fiber networks</a>.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/15/business/technology-briefing-telecommunications-fcc-rules-on-cable-access.html">cable companies like Comcast never had to share their networks</a>, despite having become near-monopolies a decade later. But, unlike Bell networks, cable networks were privately funded. Bell firms, however, refused to upgrade their lines during this period despite promising better fiber networks if sharing was killed, due to the wireless boom. It’s only the recent fiber and 5G spurt which broke cable’s monopoly.</p>



<p>While rival DSL ISPs could build their own networks, as Sonic in California has done, many more exited broadband and became Microsoft partners. They lacked the know-how, or funding, for building fiber. And, even if they had the know-how and funding, they wouldn’t stand a chance against <a href="https://stopthecap.com/2010/05/10/complete-video-of-north-carolinas-fiber-is-obsolete-revenue-laws-study-committee-meeting/">Big Telecom lobbyists</a>.</p>



<p>Worse yet, despite flip flopping on Net Neutrality, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/why-tom-wheeler-rejected-broadband-price-caps-and-last-mile-unbundling/">subsequent FCCs from both parties institutionalized Bush’s abandonment of line sharing</a> since the firms needing line sharing went out of business or pivoted.</p>



<h2>How this compares to VPS hosts today</h2>



<p>Yes, the 2000s are back for fashion and music, but I really hope the death of mom-and-pop tech providers stays in the noughties.</p>



<p>However, today’s scenario is different from the dot-com era:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bell companies legally had to share their lines, but now DRAM producers don’t legally have to produce DRAM.</li>



<li>Line sharing wasn’t essential for modern tech. DRAM is.</li>



<li>Bell companies intentionally killed small DSL ISPs. DRAM companies might unintentionally hurt small VPS hosts because of their focus on Big Tech.</li>



<li>DSL ISPs used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbundled_network_element">“unbundled network elements”</a> which Bell companies would not provide on their own. VPS hosts use standard servers and services like colocation, also used by other industries such as banks, airlines, et al.</li>



<li>Network unbundling is controversial. While I favor this approach, many don’t for legitimate reasons.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite this, telecom companies made a bet on only retail ISP customers and got what they wanted. And it forced broadband customers onto one-size-fits-all solutions instead of also having specialty providers. This could also happen to VPS hosting.</p>



<p>AWS isn’t suited for everyone. For instance, media streaming, VPN, and Tor relays aren’t suited for big clouds due to high bandwidth costs. I personally run Tor relays, and there’s a reason why I never ran them on Azure when I worked for Microsoft. On my VPS host, I have 16. Other customers have even more.</p>



<p>Unlike DSL ISPs, many small VPS hosts will survive. Maybe at higher costs or a different focus. But if our industry dies out, it will hurt ordinary developers and sysadmins if the only options become pricey Big Tech clouds. A cash-strapped small business or college student will either have to avoid VPS hosting or use the subset they can afford.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-xj2uyz6m="">  <p><strong>Now on the front page of Hacker News — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46811588">see the discussion</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Frontier AI models have become excellent at writing functions, but can they actually debug production systems?</p>
<p>To fix outages, you first need to see what’s happening. In a microservices world, this means producing structured events that track a single request as it hops from service to service.</p>
<p>We asked 14 models to add distributed traces to existing codebases, using the standard method: OpenTelemetry instrumentation. We picked tasks that would be easy for a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE).</p>
<figure> <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/#models"> <img src="https://quesma.com/_astro/overall_ranking.CkMhOjSp_14CMuY.webp" alt="OTelBench Model Rankings showing Claude Opus 4.5 leading at 29% pass rate" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1400" height="778">  </a> <figcaption> <p>Go to <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/">OTelBench website</a> for complete charts. All models struggle with
OpenTelemetry. Even the best model, Claude 4.5 Opus, succeeded only 29% of the time, and GPT 5.2 was similar at 26%.
Surprisingly, Gemini 3 Pro has no edge over Gemini 3 Flash, which scored 19%.</p> </figcaption> </figure>
<p>We are releasing <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/">OTelBench</a> as an open-source benchmark, with all tasks in <a href="https://github.com/QuesmaOrg/otel-bench">QuesmaOrg/otel-bench</a>. We use the <a href="https://harborframework.com/">Harbor framework</a> (by the creators of TerminalBench), so you can easily run it yourself to reproduce results, test new models, or create benchmarks for your own use cases (we welcome contributions!).</p>
<h2 id="background-what-is-distributed-tracing">Background: What is distributed tracing?</h2>
<p>When an app runs on a single machine, you can often trace an error by scrolling through a log file. But when it runs across 50 microservices, that single request gets scattered into a chaotic firehose of disconnected events. <strong>Distributed tracing</strong> solves this by linking them back together, allowing you to follow a user action, like clicking <em>Login</em>, as it jumps from the API Gateway, to the Auth Service, to the Database, and back.</p>
<figure>  <figcaption>
Distributed tracing links a user action, like a <em>Login</em> button click, to every underlying microservice call.
</figcaption> </figure>
<p>To make this work, you need <strong>instrumentation</strong>. This is code that you add to your app to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start a trace</strong> when a request comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Pass the TraceID</strong> (context) when your app calls another service.</li>
<li><strong>Send the data</strong> to a backend so you can see the graph.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://opentelemetry.io/">OpenTelemetry</a> (OTel) is the industry standard for telemetry data. Its ecosystem includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semantic conventions:</strong> A unified schema replaces chaotic naming (e.g., <code>ip_address</code> vs <code>host.ip</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Universal SDKs:</strong> Official libraries support every major programming language.</li>
<li><strong>The Collector:</strong> A centralized agent processes and enriches data (e.g., adding Kubernetes tags) before export.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-instrumentation:</strong> Runtime agents <a href="https://newsletter.signoz.io/p/bts-of-opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation">inject code to wrap calls</a>, though this often results in noisy data.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <strong>standard</strong> doesn’t mean <strong>easy</strong>. We know this firsthand from our contributions to the ecosystem, such as <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2025/go-compile-time-instrumentation/">Go compile-time instrumentation</a>. The process may be difficult, especially due to complexity, <a href="https://grafana.com/observability-survey/2025/">as 39% of respondents complained in the 2025 Observability Survey</a>.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-opentelemetry-instrumentation">Benchmarking OpenTelemetry instrumentation</h2>
<p>We tested 14 frontier LLMs on 23 realistic OpenTelemetry instrumentation tasks across 11 programming languages: Go, Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Rust, Erlang, .NET, and Swift.</p>
<p>It is essential to benchmark various technologies since realistic distributed systems are polyglot.
To make OpenTelemetry work, the system needs to work for all of these services - if we lose track at only one service, the chain of logs gets broken.</p>
<p>The final benchmark run cost $522 in LLM tokens across 966 runs (23 tasks × 3 attempts × 14 models).</p>
<h3 id="task">Task</h3>
<p>We start with basic tasks such as adding instrumentation to a single microservice, in a single language.
The AI agents get a small microservice with around 300 lines of code from a realistic application, and work in a Linux terminal, editing it, and running any commands if needed.</p>
<p>For example, here is the prompt for <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/tasks/go-microservices-traces/">go-microservices-traces</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Your task is:</strong> Add OTEL tracing to all microservices.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instrumentation should match conventions and well-known good practices.</li>
<li>Instrumentation must match the business domain of the microservices.</li>
<li>Traces must be sent to the endpoint defined by a standard OTEL environment variable.</li>
<li>Use the recent version of the OTEL SDK.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>We tested if it satisfies the basic criteria of OpenTelemetry instrumentation.</p>
<figure> <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/#tasks"> <img src="https://quesma.com/_astro/simple_tasks.DRjEgaqU_ZmHRE2.webp" alt="Pass rates for simple instrumentation tasks across different programming languages" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1776" height="422">  </a> <figcaption> <p>See <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/#tasks">full task breakdown</a>. All tasks were simple for humans and involved
short services of around 300 lines of code. Yet, many of them were hard or unsolvable by all AI models.</p> </figcaption> </figure>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>How do LLMs fail? Let’s analyze a common failure mode.</p>
<p>Consider a web service from our benchmark where a user searches and retrieves results. The test simulates <strong>two distinct user actions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Happy path</strong>: User searches, gets a token, retrieves results successfully</li>
<li><strong>Error test</strong>: User tries to retrieve results with an invalid token (gets 404)</li>
</ol>
<p>A human engineer would immediately distinguish these as <strong>two independent events</strong>, resulting in <strong>two separate traces</strong>: one for the successful search and one for the failed request.</p>
<p>The code structure makes this clear – two separate blocks, each representing a user action:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="go"><code><span><span>// User Action 1: Search and get results (happy path)</span></span>
<span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    response </span><span>:=</span><span> client.</span><span>Post</span><span>(</span><span>"/search"</span><span>, query)</span></span>
<span><span>    result </span><span>:=</span><span> client.</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>"/result?token="</span><span> +</span><span> response.Token)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// User Action 2: Error test (invalid token)</span></span>
<span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    result </span><span>:=</span><span> client.</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>"/result?token=invalid"</span><span>)  </span><span>// Should return 404</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We would expect:</p>
<figure>   <figcaption>
Expected behavior: Two distinct user actions produce two separate traces with unique TraceIDs.
</figcaption> </figure>
<p>Yet, sometimes models failed to recognize these as separate user actions. Instead of two traces, they produced:</p>
<figure>  <figcaption>
Actual result: The model failed to clear context, causing separate user actions to be conflated into a single trace.
</figcaption> </figure>
<p><strong>The core issue</strong>: Models apply instrumentation mechanically to every HTTP call without understanding the business context. They see “HTTP requests” and link them all together, rather than recognizing “these are two separate user journeys.”</p>
<p>The models successfully instrumented the HTTP calls, but failed to propagate the Context correctly. They treated the timeline as a single flat list of events rather than two distinct hierarchical trees.</p>
<p>Our tests don’t just check compilation. We verify correct span names, parent-child relationships, valid trace IDs, and context propagation. Many models produced compiling code that generated malformed traces – proving that “it builds” is not enough for SRE work.</p>
<h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>
<h3 id="models">Models</h3>
<p>We were surprised that even the top models (as of Jan 2026) struggle.
The tasks we proposed were trivial compared to real-world scenarios. In a typical SRE job, services are massive, legacy-ridden, and poorly documented. If models fail on 300 lines of clean Go code, they cannot handle production.</p>
<p>We were surprised that:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/models/claude-opus-4.5/">Claude Opus 4.5</a>, the best model, got just 29% of these relatively simple tasks.</li>
<li><a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/models/gemini-3-pro-preview/">Gemini 3 Pro</a> (which aces at general intelligence) didn’t have an edge over the much cheaper <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/models/gemini-3-flash-preview/">Gemini 3 Flash</a>.</li>

<p>Each language has a different toolset, so it is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Our benchmark is too small to perform a comprehensive per-language comparison, yet even preliminary trends are striking.</p>

<p>In every practical application, cost and speed matter.
As of Jan 2026, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front">Pareto frontier</a> consists of only four models, given model performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>19%</code> Gemini 3 Flash (cost and speed) - the cheapest and fastest model in this benchmark (11x cheaper and 2x faster than Claude Opus 4.5)</li>
<li><code>22%</code> Claude Sonnet 4.5 (speed)</li>
<li><code>26%</code> GPT 5.2 (cost)</li>
<li><code>29%</code> Claude Opus 4.5 (cost and speed) — the best model in this benchmark, the most expensive but reasonably fast</li>

<h2 id="why-opentelemetry-instrumentation-is-hard-for-ai">Why OpenTelemetry instrumentation is hard for AI</h2>
<p>OpenTelemetry has all the potential to be a perfect task for AI agents — it is long and tedious work, requiring a lot of scrutiny, but ultimately one that has clear specifications and can be easily tested.</p>
<p>Yet, even the frontier models fail miserably.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-a-job-not-a-puzzle">It is a job, not a puzzle</h3>
<p>Instrumentation of even a small service involves <strong>long-horizon tasks</strong>, which remain at the <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/">frontier of the current AI model progress</a>.
It requires diligently connecting all pieces of code and testing them correctly.</p>
<h3 id="requires-polyglot-backend-development-skills">Requires polyglot backend development skills</h3>
<p>Realistic services use multiple languages and technologies.
It is not enough to know the concept of distributed tracing, the OpenTelemetry standard, or even the APIs of SDKs. The agent must know CMake for C++, module systems for Go, or dependency management for Java - things we tested in our previous benchmark, <a href="https://quesma.com/blog/introducing-compilebench/">CompileBench</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, cloud environments are mixtures of the newest versions of technologies (sometimes past the training cut-off dates of AI models) and legacy systems. We cannot cherry-pick or rewrite everything, since a possible outage would be too costly. We need to support all languages and frameworks used in the cloud.</p>
<p>A lot of current AI progress focuses on the most popular languages (Python and TypeScript) and reasonably modern frameworks and build systems.</p>
<h3 id="less-training-data">Less training data</h3>
<p>Although adding instrumentation is a standard engineering task, it is not common practice in open-source. The most popular applications, where reliability matters the most, are in private repositories of big tech companies such as Apple, Airbnb, or Netflix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best models struggle</strong>: The state-of-the-art Claude Opus 4.5 solved only 29% of tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Language gaps</strong>: Models failed completely on Java, Ruby, and Swift. C++ led at 37% (boosted by an easier task), Go reached 20%.</li>
<li><strong>Silent failures</strong>: Many solutions compiled correctly but produced malformed traces or conflated distinct user journeys.</li>
<li><strong>Cost efficiency</strong>: Gemini 3 Flash exceeds Gemini 3 Pro’s performance (18%) at a fraction of the cost.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ai-sre-is-still-mostly-hype-but-there-is-hope">AI SRE is still mostly hype, but there is hope</h3>
<p>AI SRE in 2026 is what <a href="https://quesma.com/blog/aiops-observability/">DevOps Anomaly Detection was in 2015</a> — bold claims backed by huge marketing budgets, but lacking independent verification. There are stories of <a href="https://www.deductive.ai/blogs/datadog-thank-you-for-blocking-us">SaaS vendors abruptly killing the observability stack</a>. Our results mirror <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/llm-observability-challenge">ClickHouse’s findings</a>: while LLMs can assist, they lack the capabilities of a skilled SRE.</p>
<p>Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Gemini 3 models show promising signals. Some hard tasks like <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/tasks/go-microservices-traces/">go-microservices-traces</a> reached <strong>55% pass rate</strong>. With more environments for Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards, this looks like a solvable problem.</p>
<h3 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h3>
<p>Reliable software is incredibly economically valuable, but today it requires too much toil. No one wants to be woken up at 2 AM to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>We need a North Star to navigate the current AI boom. Just as SWE-Bench and TerminalBench2.0 became standards for software engineering, we need an SRE-style benchmark for distributed systems. Does the industry need newer models, or perhaps multi-agent systems? A good benchmark will tell us.</p>
<p>We invite you to explore the full results on <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/">OTelBench</a> and help us expand the test suite on <a href="https://github.com/QuesmaOrg/otel-bench">QuesmaOrg/otel-bench</a>. Have you tried using LLMs for observability? We are curious to hear if your experience matches our findings—or if you’ve found a workflow that actually works.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Let’s say you’re creating
a CLI tool which has to display
syntax highlighted source code.
You begin by choosing some colors
which look nice with
your chosen terminal theme:</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Sorcerer — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><p>Nice!
However,
who knows if it’ll still look good
for people who use
a theme different to yours?
It seems sensible to try out
the defaults, at least.
Let’s start with
the macOS Terminal.app default theme:</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Basic — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><div><p>~ — zsh — Basic — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><p>Youch!
It seems fair to try the Tango themes next,
since those are the default on e.g. Ubuntu:</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Tango Light — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><div><p>~ — zsh — Tango Dark — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><p>Hmm, better, but not by much.
Finally,
let’s try what is likely
the most popular custom terminal theme – Solarized:</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Solarized Light — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.

Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.

This is useful as the background color

the default foreground,

Additionally, <code>brwhite</code> is
even lighter than the foreground;
this allows for subtle emphasization

these did a lot better than
Terminal.app’s Basic themes,
but they are still far from perfect.
<code>bryellow</code> is again unreadable in the light theme,
and perhaps <code>brgreen</code> is
a little difficult to see,
though it’s nothing that would
stop me from using <code>brgreen</code>
in an application.</p><p>At this point you may have noticed
how the greyscales –
<code>black</code>, <code>brblack</code>, <code>white</code> &amp; <code>brwhite</code> –
have remained consistent
between light and dark themes
for both Basic and Tango.
Of course,
this means that
<code>{,br}white</code> is unreadable in Tango Light
(owing to the light background)
and <code>black</code> is unreadable in Tango Dark
(owing to the dark background).</p><p>In other words:
forget about
that idea of mine from earlier
about using <code>brwhite</code> to emphasize content.
Unless, of course,
you don’t mind if your
eminently <em>emphasized</em> words
are completely unreadable
for the user of your software
who deigns to use the default light theme
of A Popular Linux Distro.</p><p>On the other hand,
using <code>brblack</code> to de-emphasize content
still seems fine to me.
I suppose some extra contrast
for <code>brblack</code> in Tango Dark
would be nice,
but with text which is meant to be ignored
I don’t think this matters much.</p><p>And lo, but ten colors remain.</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Sorcerer — 51×11</p><p>% colortest --only-usable

% █</p></div><p>Solarized is a curious beast.
Every color in it
was chosen using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space"><em>L*a*b*</em></a>,
a perceptually-uniform color space
from the 1970s.
(For what it’s worth,
color science has
<a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">progressed significantly</a> since then;
the only reason
Ethan Schoonover used <em>L*a*b*</em>
is that it’s commonly used in photography,
and he used to be a professional photographer.)</p><p>Its lightnesses are perfectly symmetrical
so that Solarized Light and Dark
can share a set of accent colors
while maintaining identical contrast.
Moreover,
the warm tones of the light theme
and cool tones of the dark theme
are complementary.
(The hue gap is
closer to 150° than 180° in reality.
See <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker/#002b36">here</a>
and <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker/#fdf6e3">here</a>
to compare hue values.)</p><p>Solarized is also incredibly popular.
I have no data here,
but as of the date of writing
it’s the most starred theme repository on GitHub
I can find.
Solarized has 15.4 thousand stars at the moment,
while the next-closest is <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">Gruvbox</a>
with 11.8 thousand.
Solarized is available as a plugin
or sometimes even as a built-in preset
in damn near every
popular terminal emulator and editor
on the planet.</p><p>To understand Solarized’s
peculiar arrangement of the 16-color palette,
we have to travel back in time to 2011
<a href="https://github.com/altercation/solarized/commit/3da9bd10d3b8c1ad6e2a5ab8617ef8c82fca0df7">when Solarized was first released</a>.
In this dark era,
terminals supporting 24-bit color
didn’t exist / weren’t widespread.
One option common among Vim themes at the time
was to round every color
to the nearest 256-color palette value.
In Solarized’s case,
this destroys the mathematical symmetry
at the heart of the theme.
(<a href="https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8#but-my-terminal-has-only-256-colors">I’m not kidding, it looks awful</a>.)</p><p>The solution
– rather, <em>hack</em> –
chosen at the time
was to distill
all the colors used in the Vim interface
down to a palette of sixteen colors.
Conveniently,
Solarized’s accent colors
fit nicely into the non-bright column
of the 16-color palette,
while Solarized’s monotones
fit into the bright column.
Once the user sets their terminal
to use the Solarized palette,
Vim can color its entire interface
using only the 16-color palette
and get correct color values,
no clunky color approximations needed.</p><p>The downside to all this is that
an application which uses
any of the bright colors
which Solarized co-opted for itself
will look strange.
Users of Solarized
– and, by god, there’s so many of them –
<a href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/2417">appear</a>
<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/181">frequently</a>

is inexplicably gray or even invisible
as a result of CLIs
using these forsaken bright colors.</p><p>Our beloved <code>brblack</code>

As a workaround,

(we’re talking about
physical terminals here)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit">started making all bold text bright
instead of using a heavier font weight</a>.
One way or another
this ended up in the default settings of

Moltbot runs in the background on a user's own hardware, has a sizable and growing list of integrations for chat applications, AI models, and other popular tools, and can be controlled remotely. Moltbot can help you with your finances, social media, organize your day — all through your favorite messaging app.</p><p>But what if you don’t want to buy new dedicated hardware? And what if you could still run your Moltbot efficiently and securely online? Meet <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/moltworker"><u>Moltworker</u></a>, a middleware Worker and adapted scripts that allows running Moltbot on Cloudflare's Sandbox SDK and our Developer Platform APIs.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="a-personal-assistant-on-cloudflare-how-does-that-work">A personal assistant on Cloudflare — how does that work?&nbsp;</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Firstly, Cloudflare Workers has never been <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/"><u>so compatible</u></a> with Node.js. Where in the past we&nbsp;had to mock APIs to get some packages running, now those APIs are supported natively by the Workers Runtime.</p><p>This has changed how we can build tools on Cloudflare Workers. When we first implemented <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/">Playwright</a>, a popular framework for web testing and automation that runs on <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/">Browser Rendering</a>, we had to rely on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/memfs"><u>memfs</u></a>. This was bad because not only is memfs a hack and an external dependency, but it also forced us to drift away from the official Playwright codebase. Thankfully, with more Node.js compatibility, we were able to start using <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/playwright/pull/62/changes">node:fs natively</a>, reducing complexity and maintainability, which makes upgrades to the latest versions of Playwright easy to do.</p><p>The list of Node.js APIs we support natively keeps growing. The blog post “<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/nodejs-workers-2025/"><u>A year of improving Node.js compatibility in Cloudflare Workers</u></a>” provides an overview of where we are and what we’re doing.</p><p>We measure this progress, too. We recently ran an experiment where we took the 1,000 most popular NPM packages, installed and let AI loose, to try to run them in Cloudflare Workers, <a href="https://ghuntley.com/ralph/"><u>Ralph Wiggum as a "software engineer"</u></a> style, and the results were surprisingly good. Excluding the packages that are build tools, CLI tools or browser-only and don’t apply, only 15 packages genuinely didn’t work. <b>That's 1.5%</b>.</p><p>Here’s a graphic of our Node.js API support over time:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5GhwKJq2A2wG79I3NdhhDl/e462c30daf46b1b36d3f06bff479596b/image9.png" alt="" width="1802" height="1194" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>We put together a page with the results of our internal experiment on npm packages support <a href="https://worksonworkers.southpolesteve.workers.dev/"><u>here</u></a>, so you can check for yourself.</p><p>Moltbot doesn’t necessarily require a lot of Workers Node.js compatibility because most of the code runs in a container anyway, but we thought it would be important to highlight how far we got supporting so many packages using native APIs. This is because when starting a new AI agent application from scratch, we can actually run a lot of the logic in Workers, closer to the user.</p><p>The other important part of the story is that the list of <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/directory/?product-group=Developer+platform">products and APIs</a> on our Developer Platform has grown to the point where anyone can build and run any kind of application — even the most complex and demanding ones — on Cloudflare. And once launched, every application running on our Developer Platform immediately benefits from our secure and scalable global network.</p><p>Those products and services gave us the ingredients we needed to get started. First, we now have <a href="https://sandbox.cloudflare.com/">Sandboxes</a>, where you can run untrusted code securely in isolated environments, providing a place to run the service. Next, we now have <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/">Browser Rendering</a>, where you can programmatically control and interact with headless browser instances. And finally, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/">R2</a>, where you can store objects persistently. With those building blocks available, we could begin work on adapting Moltbot.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="how-we-adapted-moltbot-to-run-on-us">How we adapted Moltbot to run on us</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Moltbot on Workers, or Moltworker, is a combination of an entrypoint Worker that acts as an API router and a proxy between our APIs and the isolated environment, both protected by Cloudflare Access. It also provides an administration UI and connects to the Sandbox container where the standard Moltbot Gateway runtime and its integrations are running, using R2 for persistent storage.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3OD2oHgy5ilHpQO2GJvcLU/836a55b67a626d2cd378a654ad47901d/newdiagram.png" alt="" width="1163" height="393" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p><sup>High-level architecture diagram of Moltworker.</sup></p><p>Let's dive in more.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="ai-gateway">AI Gateway</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Cloudflare AI Gateway acts as a proxy between your AI applications and any popular <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/"><u>AI provider</u></a>, and gives our customers centralized visibility and control over the requests going through.</p><p>Recently we announced support for <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-08-25-secrets-store-ai-gateway/"><u>Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)</u></a>, where instead of passing your provider secrets in plain text with every request, we centrally manage the secrets for you and can use them with your gateway configuration.</p><p>An even better option where you don’t have to manage AI providers' secrets at all end-to-end is to use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/"><u>Unified Billing</u></a>. In this case you top up your account with credits and use AI Gateway with any of the supported providers directly, Cloudflare gets charged, and we will deduct credits from your account.</p><p>To make Moltbot use AI Gateway, first we create a new gateway instance, then we enable the Anthropic provider for it, then we either add our Claude key or purchase credits to use Unified Billing, and then all we need to do is set the ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL environment variable so Moltbot uses the AI Gateway endpoint. That’s it, no code changes necessary.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/cMWRXgHR0mFLc5kp74nYk/a47fa09bdbb6acb3deb60fb16537945d/image11.png" alt="" width="1999" height="930" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Once Moltbot starts using AI Gateway, you’ll have full visibility on costs and have access to logs and analytics that will help you understand how your AI agent is using the AI providers.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5GOrNdgtdwMcU4bE8oLE19/6bc29bcac643125f5332a8ffba9d1322/image1.png" alt="" width="1994" height="1430" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Note that Anthropic is one option; Moltbot supports <a href="https://www.molt.bot/integrations"><u>other</u></a> AI providers and so does <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/"><u>AI Gateway</u></a>. The advantage of using AI Gateway is that if a better model comes along from any provider, you don’t have to swap keys in your AI Agent configuration and redeploy — you can simply switch the model in your gateway configuration. And more, you specify model or provider <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/fallbacks/"><u>fallbacks</u></a> to handle request failures and ensure reliability.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="sandboxes">Sandboxes</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Last year we anticipated the growing need for AI agents to run untrusted code securely in isolated environments, and we <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-06-24-announcing-sandboxes/"><u>announced</u></a> the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/"><u>Sandbox SDK</u></a>. This SDK is built on top of <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/"><u>Cloudflare Containers</u></a>, but it provides a simple API for executing commands, managing files, running background processes, and exposing services — all from your Workers applications.</p><p>In short, instead of having to deal with the lower-level Container APIs, the Sandbox SDK gives you developer-friendly APIs for secure code execution and handles the complexity of container lifecycle, networking, file systems, and process management — letting you focus on building your application logic with just a few lines of TypeScript. Here’s an example:</p>
            <pre><code>import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';
export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise&lt;Response&gt; {
    const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');

    // Create a project structure
    await sandbox.mkdir('/workspace/project/src', { recursive: true });

    // Check node version
    const version = await sandbox.exec('node -v');

    // Run some python code
    const ctx = await sandbox.createCodeContext({ language: 'python' });
    await sandbox.runCode('import math; radius = 5', { context: ctx });
    const result = await sandbox.runCode('math.pi * radius ** 2', { context: ctx });

    return Response.json({ version, result });
  }
};</code></pre>
            <p>This fits like a glove for Moltbot. Instead of running Docker in your local Mac mini, we run Docker on Containers, use the Sandbox SDK to issue commands into the isolated environment and use callbacks to our entrypoint Worker, effectively establishing a two-way communication channel between the two systems.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="r2-for-persistent-storage">R2 for persistent storage</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>The good thing about running things in your local computer or VPS is you get persistent storage for free. Containers, however, are inherently <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/platform-details/architecture/"><u>ephemeral</u></a>, meaning data generated within them is lost upon deletion. Fear not, though — the Sandbox SDK provides the sandbox.mountBucket() that you can use to automatically, well, mount your R2 bucket as a filesystem partition when the container starts.</p><p>Once we have a local directory that is guaranteed to survive the container lifecycle, we can use that for Moltbot to store session memory files, conversations and other assets that are required to persist.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="browser-rendering-for-browser-automation">Browser Rendering for browser automation</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>AI agents rely heavily on browsing the sometimes not-so-structured web. Moltbot utilizes dedicated Chromium instances to perform actions, navigate the web, fill out forms, take snapshots, and handle tasks that require a web browser. Sure, we can run Chromium on Sandboxes too, but what if we could simplify and use an API instead?</p><p>With Cloudflare’s <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/"><u>Browser Rendering</u></a>, you can programmatically control and interact with headless browser instances running at scale in our edge network. We support <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/"><u>Puppeteer</u></a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/stagehand/"><u>Stagehand</u></a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/"><u>Playwright</u></a> and other popular packages so that developers can onboard with minimal code changes. We even support <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/playwright-mcp/"><u>MCP</u></a> for AI.</p><p>In order to get Browser Rendering to work with Moltbot we do two things:</p><ul><li><p>First we create a <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/moltworker/blob/main/src/routes/cdp.ts"><u>thin CDP proxy</u></a> (<a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/"><u>CDP</u></a> is the protocol that allows instrumenting Chromium-based browsers) from the Sandbox container to the Moltbot Worker, back to Browser Rendering using the Puppeteer APIs.</p></li><li><p>Then we inject a <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/moltworker/pull/20"><u>Browser Rendering skill</u></a> into the runtime when the Sandbox starts.</p></li></ul>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1ZvQa7vS1T9Mm3nywqarQZ/9dec3d8d06870ee575a519440d34c499/image12.png" alt="" width="766" height="228" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>From the Moltbot runtime perspective, it has a local CDP port it can connect to and perform browser tasks.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="zero-trust-access-for-authentication-policies">Zero Trust Access for authentication policies</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Next up we want to protect our APIs and Admin UI from unauthorized access. Doing authentication from scratch is hard, and is typically the kind of wheel you don’t want to reinvent or have to deal with. Zero Trust Access makes it incredibly easy to protect your application by defining specific policies and login methods for the endpoints.&nbsp;</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1MDXXjbMs4PViN3kp9iFBY/a3095f07c986594d0c07d0276dbf22cc/image3.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1400" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p><sup>Zero Trust Access Login methods configuration for the Moltworker application.</sup></p><p>Once the endpoints are protected, Cloudflare will handle authentication for you and automatically include a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/application-token/"><u>JWT token</u></a> with every request to your origin endpoints. You can then <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/validating-json/"><u>validate</u></a> that JWT for extra protection, to ensure that the request came from Access and not a malicious third party.</p><p>Like with AI Gateway, once all your APIs are behind Access you get great observability on who the users are and what they are doing with your Moltbot instance.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3BV4eqxKPXTiq18vvVpmZh/e034b7e7ea637a00c73c2ebe4d1400aa/image8.png" alt="" width="1902" height="1296" loading="lazy">

          </figure><p>Here’s a chat session where we ask Moltbot to find the shortest route between Cloudflare in London and Cloudflare in Lisbon using Google Maps and take a screenshot in a Slack channel. It goes through a sequence of steps using Browser Rendering to navigate Google Maps and does a pretty good job at it. Also look at Moltbot’s memory in action when we ask him the second time.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">A Waymo robotaxi struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica on January 23, according to the company. Waymo told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the child — whose age and identity are not currently public — sustained minor injuries.</p>

<p>The NHTSA has opened an <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE26001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investigation</a> into the accident, and Waymo said in a <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/a-commitment-to-transparency-and-road-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that it “will cooperate fully with them throughout the process.”</p>







<p>Waymo said its robotaxi struck the child at six miles per hour, after braking “hard” from around 17 miles per hour. The young pedestrian “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle’s path,” the company said in its blog post. Waymo said its vehicle “immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle.”</p>

<p>“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” Waymo wrote in the post.</p>

<p>News of the crash comes as Waymo faces dual investigations into its robotaxis illegally passing school buses. The NHTSA opened a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probe</a> into the problem in October shortly after the first report of the incident in Atlanta, Georgia, and the National Transportation Safety Board opened its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation</a> last week after around 20 incidents were reported in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>According to the NHTSA, the accident occurred “within two blocks” of the elementary school “during normal school drop off hours.” The safety regulator said “there were other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity.”</p>

<p>The NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation is investigating “whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”</p>

<p>Waymo said in its blog post that its “peer-reviewed model” shows a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.” The company did not release a specific analysis of this crash.  </p>

		<p><em>(content note: scientific discussion of depression &amp; suicide)</em></p>
<p>
<b>"Too Long; Didn't Read" Summary:</b><br>
Exactly what the title says.
</p>
<p>The "standardised effect size" of antidepressants on depression, vs placebo, is around 0.4. (This is like going from an average <strong>C to a C+</strong>.)</p>
<p>In contrast, the effect size of 1500mg/day of "≥60% EPA" Omega-3 supplements — which are cheaper &amp; have fewer side effects than antidepressants — is a bit higher, around 0.6. (This is like going from a <strong>C to a B–</strong>.)</p>
<p>But, much better: the effect size of 5000mg/day of Vitamin D is around <em>1.8!</em> (This is like going from a <strong>C to an A–</strong>!) It works even for people who <em>don't</em> have a Vitamin D insufficiency, which almost half of American adults <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>Even if you're already taking Vitamin D &amp; Omega-3, you may <em>still</em> not be taking enough. The "official" recommendations <em>are all 3 to 10 times too low</em>. Both these supplements are safe, cheap, and over-the-counter, with <em>positive</em> side-effects (on Covid &amp; cognition).</p>
<p>So, unless you have specific reasons to not take Vitamin D &amp; Omega-3 — (kidney stones, blood thinners, etc) — please try them, for at least a month! They could save your mental health. Maybe even your life.</p>

<h2>A crash course in "effect sizes"</h2>
<p>In Alicetown, the average person has 4 younger cousins.<br>
In Bobtown, the average person has 3 younger cousins.</p>
<p>Alright, not so surprising. You may not even notice a difference.</p>
<p>In Alicetown, the average person has 4 limbs.<br>
In Bobtown, the average person has 3 limbs.</p>
<p>You'd <em>definitely</em> notice.</p>
<p>It's the same absolute difference (4 vs 3) <em>and</em> relative difference (3/4). So what makes limbs more surprising than cousins? Well, partly it's more dramatic &amp; visible, but also because: <em>we expect high variation in the number of someone's younger cousins, but not their number of limbs</em>.</p>
<p>This is why scientists calculate an <strong>"effect size"</strong> or <strong>"standardized mean difference"</strong> ("mean" = average). We take the difference between two groups, then divide by the total amount of variation, <em>to account for how surprising a difference is</em>.</p>
<p>(This is a health article, not a math article, so I'll skip the formulas in this post. If you're curious, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTgouKMz-eI">: check out this 4 min video</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately for laypeople, the effect size is usually just reported as a number, like "+0.74" for <a href="http://www.lscp.net/persons/ramus/docs/EPR20.pdf">spacing out your studying vs cramming</a>, or "–0.776" for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20438143/">sleep deprivation on attention</a>.</p>
<p>But what's that <em>mean?</em> How can we make these numbers <em>intuitive?</em></p>
<p>Well, a common way for data to be is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">a bell-shaped curve</a> (also called a "normal distribution"). And most of us are, alas, well-acquainted with the bell curve in school grades. ("grading on a curve")</p>
<p>So: school grades give us a useful way to think about standardized effect sizes! We can now convert that number <em>into an actual letter grade:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>F:</strong> -2.0 below average</li>
<li><strong>D:</strong> -1.0 below average</li>
<li><strong>C:</strong> average</li>
<li><strong>B:</strong> +1.0 above average</li>
<li><strong>A:</strong> +2.0 above average</li>
</ul>
<p>(see footnote for more precise ranges.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> the units are in "standard deviations", or "sigmas". what's sigma? <s>sigma ba--</s> just a unit of "how far away this is from average, relative to the total variation".)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/bell_grade.png" alt="How to convert effect sizes to letter grades" title="How to convert effect sizes to letter grades"></p>
<p>For example: spacing out your studying, relative to cramming, will on average <em>lift</em> your test scores from a C to a B–. (effect size = +0.74) And short-term sleep deprivation, relative to healthy sleep, will on average <em>tank</em> your ability to pay attention from a C to a D+. (effect size: –0.776)</p>
<p>(Note — when reading about effect sizes, always remember: <em>effect of what, on what, at what dose, for which group, relative to what?</em> See the Data Colada post, <a href="https://datacolada.org/104">Meaningless Means</a>.)</p>
<p>(Note 2 — the standard way of "intuitively" describing effect sizes is Cohen's recommendations: 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large. Personally, I prefer the "school grade letter" comparison, since it's more concrete. But hey, you do you.)</p>
<p>But it's not limited to just grades &amp; academic performance. Effect sizes can also help us understand any kind of difference between groups, in observation or in experiments!</p>
<p>For example...</p>
<hr>


<p>Let's use our school grade analogy, to interpret effect sizes on mental health:</p>
<p><strong>What's an "F in mental health"?</strong> By definition of a bell curve, ~2.3% of people are below –2 sigma (an "F"). (See: <a href="https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/normal.html">this bell curve calculator</a>.) <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/suicide-canada-key-statistics-infographic.html">In Canada</a>, ~2.6% of people had suicidal ideation in 2022, while <a href="https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2024/us-national-trends-and-disparities-in-suicidal-ideation-suicide-attempts-and-health-care-use">in the US</a>, it was ~4.9% in 2019. So, it's not too far off to say: "F in mental health = literally suicidal". (Also, reminder that ~4% is 1-in-25 people. You likely know someone, or <em>are</em> someone, who will feel suicidal this year. Please reach out to your friends &amp; loved ones!)</p>
<p><strong>What's a "D in mental health"?</strong> ~16% of people are below –1 sigma (a "D") on a bell curve. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12096700/">The Keyes 2002 study</a> estimated that ~14.1% of adults meet the DSM-III criteria for a major depressive episode. So, D = Depressed.</p>
<p><strong>What's an average "C in mental health"?</strong> ~68% of people are within a sigma of average (a "C") on a bell curve. Same above study found that 56.6 percent had moderate mental health. They were neither "languishing" nor "flourishing". I guess C = Could Be Worse.</p>
<p><strong>What's a "B in mental health"?</strong> ~16% of people are <em>above</em> +1 sigma (a "B") on a bell curve. Same above study found that 17.2% of adults are "flourishing". Good for them! B = Flourishing, life is good.</p>
<p><strong>What's an "A in mental health"?</strong> I don't know who these freaks are. I actually <em>could not</em> find any scientific studies on "the +2 sigma in well-being". In contrast, there's <em>lots</em> of research on suicidal ideation, the –2 sigma in well-being. In the absence of any actual data, I'll just say: A = AWESOME</p>

<p>So, if an intervention is found to have an effect size of +1.0, that's like going up a letter grade. If something's found to have an effect size of -2.0, that's like going <em>down</em> two letter grades. And so on.</p>
<p>Okay, so how do we get peoples' "mental health grades" up?</p>
<p>Let's look at antidepressants, Omega-3, and Vitamin D, in turn:</p>
<hr>

<h2>Antidepressants</h2>
<p>The good news is they work. The bad news is they don't work as well as you'd think they may work.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5889788/">Cipriani et al 2018</a></strong> is a recent meta-analysis (a study collecting lots of previous studies) that investigated 21 different antidepressants. The most effective antidepressant, <em>Amitriptyline</em>, relative to placebo, had an Odds Ratio of 2.13  — <a href="https://www.escal.site/">which converts to</a> a Cohen's d effect size of 0.417 — which is "small-medium" according to Cohen's recommendations. Or, by our school-letter-grade comparison: <strong>the best antidepressant would take your mental health grade from an F to F+, or C to C+.</strong></p>
<p>From Figure 3 of that paper, you can see that Amitriptyline has the highest estimated effect size, while the side effects are no worse than placebo:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/Figure3.jpg" alt="The effect sizes &amp; dropout rates of various antidepressants, vs placebo." title="The effect sizes &amp; dropout rates of various antidepressants, vs placebo."></p>
<p>Sure, "F to F+" <em>can</em> be lifesaving, but… y'know… that's not a lot. And again, this is the effect <em>on average.</em> Some people respond <em>much</em> better to antidepressants… while some respond much worse.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Omega-3</h2>
<p>Keep getting confused on which fat is what? Me too. So, here's a crash course on various fats:</p>
<p>Fatty acids are chains of carbons &amp; hydrogens + two oxygens. They say "OOH" at one end, and "HHH" at the other end:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat1.png" alt="Diagram of a fatty acid, details in main text." title="Diagram of a fatty acid, details in main text."></p>
<p>A saturated fatty acid is one where all the carbons' free spots are filled up with hydrogens. (Hence, "saturated") This makes the molecule stick straight out. This is why <em>long</em> saturated fatty acids — like those found in butter — tend to be solid at room temperature.</p>
<p>(Contrary to popular belief, saturated fats don't <em>literally</em> clog your arteries, like grease in plumbing pipes. What happens is <em>{ha ha I don't actually understand this}</em>. <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/cir.0000000000000510">Something about your cholesterol levels &amp; inflammation</a>.)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat2.png" alt="Diagram of saturated vs unsaturated fatty acid, details in main text." title="Diagram of saturated vs unsaturated fatty acid, details in main text."></p>
<p>In contrast, <em>unsaturated</em> fatty acids have at least one hydrogen missing. This causes them to have a double-bond "kink" in the molecule. This makes them <em>not</em> stick out, which is why unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature. <em>Mono-unsaturated</em> fatty acids (MUFAs) — like in olive oil — only have one kink. <em>Poly-unsaturated</em> fatty acids (PUFAs) — like in fatty fish — have two or more kinks. Let's be mature adults about this, please.</p>
<p>For completeness: <em>trans fats</em> are unsaturated fats whose "kink" is twisted around, causing them to go straight. That is the worst sentence I've written all month. The twisted kink is caused by the hydrogens being on opposite sides, hence "trans". (And yes, if they're on the same side it's "cis". Latin was a mistake.) The molecule being straight is why trans fats — which margarine <em>used</em> to be full of  — are solid at room temperature, despite being an unsaturated fat.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat3.png" alt="Diagram of how a 'cis' saturated fat becomes a 'trans' fat, details in main text." title="Diagram of how a 'cis' saturated fat becomes a 'trans' fat, details in main text."></p>
<p>It's neat whenever you can trace the history of something right down to its atoms! Margarine was first invented because it's cheaper, and is spreadable straight from the fridge, unlike butter. Margarine (used to be) made by taking <em>unsaturated</em> vegetable oils, which were cheaper than animal fats, then pumping a bunch of hydrogens into it (hence, "hydrogenated oils"). If you <em>completely</em> hydrogenate an oil, it becomes a saturated fat. But they only <em>partially</em> hydrogenated those oils, leading to trans fats, which were cheaper &amp; a spreadable semi-solid at fridge temperature.</p>
<p>In the 1970s &amp; 80s, the US Food &amp; Drug Administration concluded that trans fats were <em>not</em> harmful to humans, and nutritionists <em>promoted</em> margarine over butter, because butter had "unhealthy" saturated fats. <a href="https://www.cspi.org/resource/artificial-trans-fat-timeline">But in the early 1990s</a>, scientists realized that trans fats were <em>even worse</em> for you than saturated fats. Only in the 2010's, did most Western countries start officially banning trans fats. Reminder: policy is often decades behind science.</p>
<p><em>(Hey, what do you call it when you get thiccer on HRT? Trans fat! :D)</em></p>
<p>I need to stop going on infodump tangents. Anyway, Omega-3 is any fatty acid with its first kink at the 3rd carbon from the Omega end ("HHH"), though it can have more kinks later down the chain. (And yes, Omega-6 has its first kink at the 6th carbon, and Omega-9 has its first kink at the 9th carbon. There's nothing <em>physically</em> preventing Omega-4 or Omega-5's from existing, but due to some quirk of evolution, Omega-3, -6, and -9 are the ones biological life uses most. As far as I can tell, there's no specific reason they're all multiples of 3. Probably just a coincidence. There <em>is</em> a less common Omega-7.)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat4.png" alt="Diagram of Omega-3, -6, and -9, details in main text." title="Diagram of Omega-3, -6, and -9, details in main text."></p>
<p><em>Finally</em>, there's three main types of Omega-3: EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid), DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid), and ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid). ALA is mostly found in plants like chia seeds &amp; walnuts, while EPA &amp; DHA mostly come from seafood, though there <em>are</em> algae-based vegan sources.</p>
<p><em>(Figure 1.1 from <a href="https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/bitstream/10214/9940/1/Roke_Kaitlin_201609_PhD.pdf">Roke 2016</a>.⤵ Thank you Kaitlin Samantha Roke for drawing this coz I'm too lazy to draw it myself. Note how the first double-bond "kink" for all these molecules is at the 3rd carbon from the Omega end — hence why they're all called Omega-3's.)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat5.png" alt="Diagram of ELA, DHA, &amp; ALA; details in main text." title="Diagram of ELA, DHA, &amp; ALA; details in main text."></p>
<p><strong>EPA &amp; DHA are the focus of this section.</strong> For bio-mechanical reasons I don't understand but I assume someone else does: EPA is the one associated with anti-inflammation, better brain health, and <em>less depression</em>... while DHA isn't. (But DHA is still needed for other stuff, like your neurons' cell walls, so don't cut them out completely!)</p>
<p>(Note: I could not find any <em>experimental</em> trials of ALA on depression, though an <em>observational</em> study in Japan (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212826313001085">Kurotani et al 2014</a>) finds a correlation between higher ALA and lower depression. But reminder, correlation is not <em>necessarily</em> causation.)</p>
<p>All the above info in a Venn (technically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram">Euler</a>) diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat6.png" alt="Diagram of what I infodumped about just now." title="Diagram of what I infodumped about just now."></p>
<p>Okay, enough yap. Time for the actual data:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3534764/">Sublette et al 2011</a></strong> is an older meta-analysis, but it's the only one I could find that tries to estimate the <em>actual "dose-response" curve</em>, which shows: how much effect, for how much treatment. Why is that important? Because one problem with many meta-analyses is they'll do something like: "Study 1 gave patients 1 gram of medicine and saw a +1 improvement in disease, Study 2 gave 10 grams and saw +4 improvement, Study 3 gave 100 grams and saw <em>negative</em> –5 improvement… the average of +1, +4, and –5 is zero... therefore the medicine's effect is zero." ...As mentioned briefly earlier, this is a <a href="https://datacolada.org/104">meaningless mean</a>. That's why we want to know the response <em>at each dose</em>.</p>
<p>So, the Sublette meta-analysis gathered randomized trials studying Omega-3 on depression (vs placebo, of course) and got the following dose-response curve.⤵ Note that the horizontal axis is <em>not</em> just amount of total Omega-3, but specifically <em>the extra amount of "unopposed" EPA, above the amount of DHA.</em> Or in other words, "EPA minus DHA":</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/Omega3.jpg" alt="Diagram of dose-response curve, of EPA minus DHA, on depression." title="Diagram of dose-response curve, of EPA minus DHA, on depression."></p>
<p>The top effect size is <strong>around +0.558, which is like going from an F to D–, or C to B–.</strong> You get this maximum effect around 1 to 2 grams of extra EPA, and <em>too much</em> EPA gets worse results. The meta-analysis finds that Omega-3 supplements that are ~60% EPA (and the rest DHA) are optimal.</p>
<p>This finding is roughly in line with later meta-analyses. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0515-5.pdf">Liao et al 2019</a> also finds that ~1 gram of ≥60% EPA is best, but actually found a much higher effect size: +1.03. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37028202/">Kelaiditis et al 2023</a> also finds 1 to 2g of ≥60% EPA is best, but found a lower effect size of +0.43… which is still <em>as good</em> as the <em>best</em> antidepressant!</p>
<p>Either way, let's boil this down to a recommendation. You want around 1 gram of EPA a day. So if your supplements are 60% EPA, you need 1 gram ÷ 0.6 ~= 1.667 grams = 1667 milligrams. Let's round this down for convenience: <strong>get 1500 mg/day of 60%-EPA Omega-3 supplements.</strong></p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3">most official health organizations recommend</a> "250–500 mg <em>combined</em> EPA and DHA each day for healthy adults." <em>That is over three times too low,</em> at least for optimal effects on depression. Which, as we calculated above, is probably around 1500 mg/day. (The official safe dose is 5000 mg/day)</p>
<p>Finally, a (small) study <em>directly</em> investigating the link between suicide &amp; Omega-3. <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.6.1100">Sublette et al 2006</a>: “Low [DHA] and low Omega-3 proportions [...] predicted risk of suicidal behavior among depressed patients over the 2-year period.” Though keep in mind this is a small study, and it's observational not experimental. Also, weird that contrary to the above studies on depression, <em>DHA</em> predicted suicide but <em>not</em> EPA. Not sure what to make of that.</p>
<p>Bonus: Omega-3 may also boost cognition? <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-16129-8.pdf">Shahinfar et al 2025</a>: “Enhancement of global cognitive abilities was observed with increasing omega-3 dosage up to 1500 mg/day. [effect size = 1.00, like going from a grade of C to B!], followed by downward trend at higher doses.”</p>
<hr>

<h2>Vitamin D</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11650176/">Ghaemi et al 2024</a></strong> is a meta-analysis on Vitamin D on depression. Again, it actually estimates a dose-response curve! Below is Figure 1 + Table 2, showing the effect of Vitamin D dosage on depression vs placebo. The solid line is the average estimated effect, dashed lines are 95% confidence interval. Note the effect size is negative in this figure, because they're measuring <em>reduction</em> in depressive symptoms:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/VitaminD.png" alt="The effect size (with uncertainty) of Vitamin D dosage on depressive symptoms." title="The effect size (with uncertainty) of Vitamin D dosage on depressive symptoms."></p>
<p><strong>The upper range of uncertainty is lowest at 5000 IU (International Units) of Vitamin D a day</strong>, with an estimated effect size of 1.82, with a 95% uncertainty range, from 0.98 to 2.66. <strong>An effect size of 1.82 is like taking your mental health from an F to a C–, or a C to an A–!</strong> And even in the <em>most pessimistic</em> case, 0.98, that's still <em>over twice as effective</em> as the top antidepressant!</p>
<p>(The paper's summary says <em>8000 IU</em> is best, with effect size 2.04, but there's much greater uncertainty there. The paper also finds that longer studies had smaller effects than shorter studies, but this does <em>not</em> necessarily mean Vitamin D's effects are short-lived. Looking at Supplementary Table 4, it seems this is partly because longer studies used <em>lower</em> average daily doses. For example, one 52-week study only gave participants 400 IU a day.)</p>
<p>This meta-analysis includes trials with participants who <em>don't</em> have Vitamin D deficiency. There's still a good effect of Vitamin D on depression for them, even if smaller! Though, you probably <em>are</em> lacking Vitamin D: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29644951/">Liu et al 2018</a> finds that a bit under half of all adults (41.4%) have Vitamin D Insufficiency.</p>
<p>And that's according to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-dosage">the official recommendation</a>, of 400-800 IU a day… which is <em>is too damn low</em>. Even the official <em>maximum safe dose</em> of Vitamin D, of 4000 IU/day, is too low. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30611908/">McCullough et al 2019</a> gave over thousands of patients 5,000 to 10,000 IU/day, for <em>seven years</em>, and there were <em>zero</em> cases of serious side effects. This is in line with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746327/">Billington et al 2020</a>, a 3-year-long double-blinded randomized controlled trial, where they found "the safety profile of vitamin D supplementation is similar for doses of 400, 4000, and 10,000 IU/day." (though "<em>mild</em> hypercalcemia" increased from 3% to 9%. IMHO, that's a small cost for reducing the risk of major depression &amp; suicide.)</p>
<p>And it makes sense that 10,000 IU a day <em>should</em> be safe. Your skin, exposed to the Sun's ultraviolet rays, can synthesize up to (the equivalent of) 10,000 IU a day, before plateauing out. Source is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522043763">Vieth 1999</a>: “Because vitamin D is potentially toxic, intake of [1000 IU/day] has been avoided even though the weight of evidence shows that the currently accepted [limit] of [2000 IU/day] is too low by at least 5-fold.” (So why are all the official sources still so paranoid about Vitamin D? Well, unfortunately, official/governmental policy is always a few decades behind the science in <em>any</em> field. See Also: the trans fat debate, everything about educational policy.)</p>
<p>Speaking of the Sun, why take supplements instead of just getting Vitamin D from Sun exposure? Well, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29659012/">skin cancer</a>. But also: because Sun-Skin D varies greatly depending on the season, your latitude, and your skin type. There's less ultraviolet rays from the Sun in winter/fall, and at latitudes further from the equator. And <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10861575/">the darker your skin is, the less Vitamin D your skin makes for the same amount of Sun exposure</a>. As expected from the bio-physics of skin, Black adults have <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075634/">the highest prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency</a> (82.1%!!), followed by Hispanic adults (62.9%). (But hey, at least Black adults have the lowest incidence of skin cancer. You win some you lose some.) The point is: speaking as someone with Southeast Asian skin, who's currently in Canada during winter... even if I stood outside naked for hours, I'd get approximately <em>zero</em> IU/day of Vitamin D from the Sun. Thus: supplements.</p>
<p>Finally, a meta-analysis <em>directly</em> measuring the effect of Vitamin D on suicide rates. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12888-025-06613-w.pdf">Yu et al 2025</a>: “Vitamin D in patients with [suicidal behaviours] were significantly lower than in controls (standardized mean difference: –0.69, or a 'medium' difference)”. Reminder that this paper <em>by itself</em> only measures correlation, not causation — but combined with the above experiments of Vitamin D on depression, I think it's reasonable to guess it's partly causal.</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost half of you have a Vitamin D deficiency according to the official recommendation (800 IU/day).</li>
<li>And the official recommendation is <em>way</em> too low. Even the official <em>maximum</em> safe dose (4000 IU/day) is below the optimal Vitamin D for depression (5000 IU/day) or what your body can produce from the Sun in optimal conditions (10,000 IU/day). Recent randomized controlled trials confirm that 10,000 IU/day is, indeed, mostly safe.</li>
<li>Your daily reminder than official policy is often decades behind the science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus: Vitamin D supplementation was found in several randomized controlled trials <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39225947/">to reduce mortality from Covid-19</a>! It <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322010274">probably helps guard against influenza</a> too, though the evidence is small &amp; early.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Conclusion: <em>All this time, you lacked the Vitamin?</em></h2>
<p>Scurvy is caused by a lack of Vitamin C. It's a condition that causes your wounds to re-open up &amp; teeth to fall out. Scurvy used to kill <em>almost half(!)</em> of all sailors on major expeditions; it's estimated millions died. It can be cured by eating lemons.</p>
<p>Rickets is mostly caused by a lack of Vitamin D. It's a condition where kids' bones go all soft and deformed. During the Industrial Revolution, up to 80% of kids suffered from it. It can be prevented with cod liver oil.</p>
<p>Goiters is mostly caused by a lack of Iodine. It's a condition where the thyroid gland in your neck swells up painfully, to the size of an apple. During WWI, a <em>third</em> of adult men had goiters. It can be prevented with iodized salt.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/The-Vitamin.png" alt="Tumblr meme: 'All this time, you lacked The Vitamin? And yet you persisted?'" title="Tumblr meme: 'All this time, you lacked The Vitamin? And yet you persisted?'"></p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health">About 1 in 4 people are expected to have clinical depression sometime in their life</a>. Depression is the #1 source of the global "burden from disease" in the mental health category, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease#how-do-different-diseases-and-disabilities-contribute-towards-the-burden-of-disease">and <em>that</em> category is the #6 burden of disease in the world</a>, above Alzheimer's, malaria, and sexually transmitted infections.</p>
<p>(But honestly, did you need those stats? This is likely a lived experience for a lot of you reading this.)</p>
<p>The effective altruists are all, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/how-much-does-it-cost-to-save-a-life">"woah for just $3000 you can prevent a child's death from malaria"</a> — and that's great! save them kids! — but where's the fanfare for the accumulating evidence that, "woah with cheap daily supplements we can save millions from suicide &amp; depressed lives"?</p>
<p>Over and over again throughout history, some horrific thing that caused millions to suffer, turned out to be "yeah you were missing this one molecule lol". To be clear: not everything is gonna be <em>that</em> simple, and mental health is <em>not</em> "just" chemistry. Also, all the numbers on this page have with large error bars &amp; uncertainty, more research is needed.</p>
<p>But, as of right now, I feel I can at least confidently claim the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin D and Omega-3 are both <em>at least on par</em> with antidepressants.</li>
<li>The evidence is much stronger for Vitamin D; it's very plausibly at least <em>twice</em> as good as antidepressants.</li>
<li>Both supplements are cheap and safe, so what's the harm of trying? (positive "expected value" for this bet)</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<p><strong>MY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU TO DO A.S.A.P:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to a pharmacy, buy the following supplements over-the-counter, in whatever form you like: (I like the easy-to-swallow gel capsules)</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong>
<ul>
<li>🌱 By default, Vitamin D supplements are derived from… (quick web search)… <em>the grease in sheep's wool?</em> Huh. Also fish liver oil. Anyway, if you're vegan, make sure your bottle specifically says "vegan" or "from lichen/mushrooms". (If you're vegetarian, the sheep's-wool Vitamin D is fine, they don't kill the sheep for it.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Omega-3 <em>where EPA is ~60% of the Omega-3 total.</em></strong> For example, my 500mg Omega-3 capsules have 300mg EPA, 200mg DHA.
<ul>
<li>🌱 By default, Omega-3 supplements come from fish. If you're veg(etari)?an, there <em>are</em> plant-based sources of Omega-3, but look carefully: most vegan Omega-3 supplements provide <em>more DHA than EPA</em>, which the above studies suggest fully cancel out the antidepressant effect. <em>Double check the nutritional label to make sure it's ≥60% EPA.</em> For example, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Natures-Way-NutraVege-Plant-Based-Vegetarian/dp/B078T4DC2K?th=1">this one is 300mg EPA + 200mg DHA</a>. (<em>not</em> an affiliate link)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then, every day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take ~5000 IU of Vitamin D</strong>
<ul>
<li>⚠️ be cautious if you have kidney stones, or are on medications that could interact with Vitamin D. "ask your doctor".</li>
<li>4,000 IU is the "official maximum safe dose", if you understandably don't trust a random internet blogger, even though she cited academic sources.</li>
<li>10,000 IU if you're feeling daring / have darker skin / live in less sunny climates.</li>
<li>bonus: may improve immune response to Covid &amp; influenza?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Take ~1500 mg of ≥60%-EPA Omega-3</strong>
<ul>
<li>⚠️ be cautious if you're on blood thinners, or other medications that could interact with Omega-3. again, "ask your doctor".</li>
<li>bonus: may improve cognition?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Don't quit your existing antidepressants if they're net-positive for you!)
<ul>
<li>you may also want to ask your doctor about <em>Amitriptyline</em>, or those other best-effect-size antidepressants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you get these doses of Vitamin D &amp; Omega-3 through whole foods alone, no supplements? Probably, but it'd be expensive &amp; tedious: you'd have to eat something like 2,000 calories of farmed salmon <em>a day</em> to get 5,000 IU/day of Vitamin D. As for Omega-3, eating mostly oily fishes <em>would</em> get you &gt;1000mg of Omega-3, but they'd be <em>more DHA than EPA</em>, which the above studies suggest would cancel out the antidepressant effects.</p>
<p><strong>The effect sizes on depression:</strong></p>

<p>(And remember, you can <em>stack</em> any of the above interventions to get an even larger effect! You can't just naively add up the effect sizes, but I'd be surprised if the effect of {vitamin d + omega-3 + bright lamps + cardio + good sleep + meditation} <em>combined</em> ends up being less than +2.00. Two letter grades up means going from D to B, or, theoretically, from clinically depressed to flourishing! For more papers &amp; my working research notes on "best bang for buck on depression", <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjNxJmNjoVktrJDFPtFH1hgzKmGpZkRFQ6Vwf0s7c6w/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.e0blw3xq3cvm">check out this Google Doc</a>.)</p>
<p>Also, remember that all the above estimates are uncertain. And in general, when scientists replicate psychology experiments more rigorously, the effect size usually shrinks by ½. But, I think the overall <em>qualitative</em> picture is still strong: there <em>exist</em> high bang-for-buck ways to reduce depression, which are <em>at least</em> on par with drugs &amp; therapy (possibly 2x to 4x better), that aren't (yet) common knowledge amongst policymakers &amp; the public. And again, they're dirt cheap with minor-to-no adverse side effects. Moderate chance of a big win, for a known tiny cost. That's a positive "expected value" bet right there.</p>
<p>I got onto this research rabbithole a few months ago while borrowing my housemate's ADHD meds, which I may or may not eventually collect into a "JOYMAXXING" informal meta-meta-analysis. (<a href="https://youtu.be/JOj97Edna7k?si=xAUt3Kp54RyfGX50&amp;t=334">: See me yap about it on video as a cartoon cat</a>.) But for this blog post, I wanted to dive deeper into Vitamin D and Omega-3, since their effect sizes are so huge, <em>and</em> they're insultingly cheap &amp; easy, compared to therapy or regular cardio.</p>
<p>Stay safe this winter, keep away the seasonal depression. Get your supplements, and reach out to your friends &amp; loved ones!</p>

<li id="fn2"><p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10039857/">Lee et al 2023</a> reports the following effect sizes. Digital therapy for Insomnia → Sleep = 0.76, and Digital therapy for Insomnia → Depression = 0.42. Assuming the therapy <em>for insomnia specifically</em> affects depression <em>only</em> through better sleep (Digital therapy for Insomnia → Sleep → Depression), we can do an <a href="https://cameron.econ.ucdavis.edu/e240a/ch04iv.pdf">"Instrumental Variable"</a> estimate of the effect of Sleep → Depression = 0.42 / 0.76 = 0.55. <strong>To be precise: this is saying, if you improve your sleep by 1 standard deviation, on average your depression improves by 0.55 standard deviations.</strong></p>
<p>So: how many standard deviations is going from "moderate insomnia" to "healthy sleep"? The standard measure is the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), which <a href="https://www.sleepprimarycareresources.org.au/questionnaires/isi">you can take online</a>. A score of 0–7 means no insomnia, 8–14 is subclinical insomnia, 15–21 is clinical insomnia (moderate), 22–28 is clinical insomnia (severe). Let's be conservative and say we're just going from barely clinical to barely healthy: 15 to 7, or a reduction of 8 points. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19689221/">Yang et al 2009</a> says a 6-point reduction is 1.5 standard deviations, which means 4 points is 1 standard deviation. So a reduction of 8 points is 2 standard deviations. <strong>So, if you improve your sleep from insomniac to healthy, you improve by at least 8 points, which is 2 standard deviations, so your depression should improve by 2 × 0.55 standard deviations, or ~1.10.</strong></p>
<p>Reminder that my estimate is <em>full</em> of assumptions upon assumptions &amp; these error bars will compound. But I'd be surprised if the true causal effect of going from insomniac to healthy sleep isn't <em>at least</em> a "large" +0.8 effect. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>

<p>The first images from the Meteosat Third Generation-Sounder satellite have been shared at the European Space Conference in Brussels, showing how the mission will provide data on temperature and humidity, for more accurate weather forecasting over Europe and northern Africa.</p>

<div>
				
		<p>The images from Meteosat Third Generation-Sounder (MTG-S) show a full-disc image of Earth as seen from geostationary orbit, about 36 000 km above Earth’s surface. These images were captured on 15 November 2025 by the satellite’s Infrared Sounder instrument.</p><p>In the ‘temperature’ image (below), the Infrared Sounder used a long-wave infrared channel, which measured Earth’s surface temperature as well as the temperature at the top of clouds. Dark red corresponds to high temperatures, mainly on the warmer land surfaces, while blue corresponds to lower temperatures, typically on the top of clouds.</p><p>As would be expected, most of the warmest (dark red) areas in this image are on the continents of Africa and South America. In the top-centre of the image, the outline of the coast of western Africa is clearly visible in dark red, with the Cape Verde peninsula, home to Senegal’s capital Dakar, visible as among the warmest areas in this image. In the bottom-right of the image, the western coast of Namibia and South Africa are also visible in red beneath a swirl of cold cloud shown in blue, while the northeast coast of Brazil is visible in dark red on the left of the image.</p>

		<p>The ‘humidity’ image (below) was captured using the Infrared Sounder’s medium-wave infrared channel, which measures humidity in Earth’s atmosphere. Blue colours correspond to regions in the atmosphere with higher humidity, while red colours correspond to lower humidity in the atmosphere.</p><p>The outlines of landmasses are not visible in this image. The areas of least atmospheric humidity, shown in dark red, are seen approximately over the Sahara Desert and the Middle East (top of image), while a large area of ‘dry’ atmosphere also covers part of the South Atlantic Ocean (centre of image). Numerous patches of high humidity are seen in dark blue over the eastern part of the African continent as well as in high and low latitudes.</p>	</div>

		<h4>Next-generation weather forecasting</h4><p>MTG is a world-class Earth observation mission developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) with European partners to address scientific and societal challenges. The mission provides game-changing data for forecasting weather and air quality over Europe.</p><p>The satellite’s geostationary position above the equator means it maintains a fixed position relative to Earth, following the same area on the planet’s surface as we rotate. This enables it to provide coverage of Europe and part of northern Africa on a 15-minute repeat cycle. It supplies new data on temperature and humidity over Europe every 30 minutes, supplying meteorologists with a complete weather picture of the region and complementing data on cloud formation and lightning from the MTG-Imager (MTG-I) satellite.</p>	</div>

		<p>ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, said, “Seeing the first Infrared Sounder images from the MTG-Sounder satellite really brings this mission and its potential to life. We expect data from this mission to change the way we forecast severe storms over Europe – and this is very exciting for communities and citizens, as well as for meteorologists and climatologists. As ever, the outstanding work done by our teams in collaboration with long-standing partners, including Eumetsat, the European Commission and dozens of European industry teams, means we now have the ability to predict extreme weather events in more accurate and timely ways than ever before.”</p><h4>A hyperspectral view over Europe</h4><p>The Infrared Sounder instrument on board MTG-S is the first European hyperspectral sounding instrument in geostationary orbit. It is designed to generate a completely new type of data product. It uses interferometric techniques, which analyse miniscule patterns in light waves, to capture data on temperature and humidity, as well as being able to measure wind and trace gases in the atmosphere. The data will eventually be used to generate three-dimensional maps of the atmosphere, helping to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting, especially for nowcasting rapidly evolving storms.</p><p>“It’s fantastic to see the first images from this groundbreaking mission,” said James Champion, ESA’s MTG Project Manager. “This satellite has been 15 years in development and will revolutionise weather forecasting and especially nowcasting. The ability to vertically profile the full Earth’s disk with a repeat cycle of only 30 minutes for Europe is an incredible accomplishment!”</p>	</div>

		<p>“I’m excited that we can share these first images from the Infrared Sounder, which showcase just a small selection of the 1700 infrared channels continuously acquired by the instrument as it observes Earth,” said Pieter Van den Braembussche, MTG System and Payload Manager at ESA. “By combining all 1700 channels, we will soon be able to generate three dimensional maps of temperature, humidity and even trace gases in the atmosphere. This capability will offer a completely new perspective on Earth’s atmosphere, not previously available in Europe, and is expected to help forecasters predict severe storms earlier than is possible today.”</p>	</div>
