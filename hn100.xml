  <p>Discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37313493">HackerNews</a>.<br>
Some people pointed out some flaws in my modelling (eg: assuming zero distance from swing to floor) which I’ve tried to fix.  The original maximum distance estimation was around $1m$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This summer I’ve spent an absurd amount of time reading and learning about the physics of swings. Yes, you read it right, I’ve been learning about the physical processes that happen when a kid is playing with a swing in the park. Blame it on my kids and the countless hours spent enjoying these moments with them. In particular, I read about the physics of pumping a swing and about the physics of jumping from a swing. Amidst my deep dive into swing physics, I came up with a new Olympic sport in which you start seated on a swing with length $L$, your feet comfortably touching the ground. As a countdown of $T$ seconds commences, you embark on the art of swing-pumping. Your challenge is to execute a skillful leap before the countdown reaches zero. With your jump, you travel a distance $d$ from your initial point, aiming to achieve the greatest possible $d$.</p>

<p>The question is then, which is the best method to maximize $d$?</p>

<p>Before I present you with the answer to the question I’ll summarize the learnings I got from reading about the physics of a swing. As usual, you can find all the code I used for this post in my <a href="https://github.com/alexmolas/alexmolas.github.io/tree/master/notebooks/swing">repo</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Notice that <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> answer a very similar question: what is the optimal time $t$ to jump off, so as to reach farthest. However, these references do not deal with the pumping of a swing, they just assume that you start swinging at some angle $\lambda$ and jump at an angle $\phi$, without pumping the swing at any point. Solving this problem is interesting, but I think it’s more exciting to solve it when the person swinging can control the system. This makes it feel more like a real game that you can play in a park or at the Olympic Games.</p>

<h2 id="pumping-a-swing">Pumping a swing</h2>

<p>There are several papers about the pumping of a swing <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, and <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and much more. In this section, I’ll focus in particular on <sup id="fnref:2:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The model for a swing I’ll use is a rigid dumbbell made up of three masses, suspended by a rigid rod of length $l_1$ attached to the middle mass $m_1$. The distances from $m_1$ to the other masses $m_2$ and $m_3$ are $l_2$ and $l_3$ respectively. The angle of the rod $l_1$ with the vertical is $\phi$ and the angle of the dumbbell with the rod is $\theta$. In the next figure, you can see a diagram of the system</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.alexmolas.com/docs/swing/swing_diagram.png" alt="Swing diagram" width="500">
</figure>

<p>The Lagrangian of this system is</p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} = &amp; \frac{1}{2} I_1 \dot\phi^2 + \frac{1}{2} I_2 \left(\dot\phi + \dot\theta\right)^2 - l_1 N \dot\phi\left( \dot \phi + \dot\theta \right) \cos \theta \\
&amp;+ M l_1 g \cos \phi - N g \cos\left(\phi + \theta\right)
\end{align}\]

<p>where $M = m_1 + m_2 + m_3$, $N = m_3 l_3 - m_2 l_2$, $I_1 = M l_1^2$, and $I_2 = m_2 l_2^2 + m_3 l_3^2$. Therefore, the Lagrange’s equation for $\phi$ is</p>

\[\begin{align}
(I_1 + I_2) \ddot \phi + M l_1 \sin \phi = &amp; -I_2 \ddot \theta - l_1 N \dot\theta^2 \sin \theta \\
&amp; + l_1 N \dot\theta^2 \cos \theta + N g \sin(\phi + \theta) \\
&amp; - 2 l_1 N \dot \theta \dot \phi \sin \theta \\
&amp; + 2l_1 N \ddot \phi \cos \theta
\end{align}\]

<p>The paper proceeds by assuming the swinger pumps the swing by forcing $\theta(t) = \theta_0 \cos(\omega t)$, where $\omega$ is the natural angular frequency of the pendulum. Then, they show that there are two regimes, one where $\phi &lt; \phi_{\text{crit}}$ where the movement is like an harmonic driven oscillator, and another one where $\phi &gt; \phi_{\text{crit}}$ where the movement is an harmonic oscillator with parametric terms. They then analyze the different regimes and solve their equations. In summary, they show that for small amplitudes the swing follows the equation</p>

\[\ddot \phi + \omega_0^2\phi = F \cos(\omega t)\]

<p>where</p>

\[\begin{align}
&amp;\omega_0= K_0/I_0\\
&amp;I_0=I_1 + I_2 - 2l_1 N (1 - \theta_0^2/4 )\\
&amp;K_0=Ml_1g - Ng(1 - \theta_0^2/4)\\
&amp;F=\theta_0 \left[ (\omega^2 I_2 + N(g - \omega_0^2l_1)(1 - \theta_0^2/8)\right]/I_0
\end{align}\]

<p>The differential equation has the solution</p>

\[\phi(t) = \left(\frac{F}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}\right)\left(\cos \omega t - \cos \omega_0t\right)\]

<p>which looks like for small $t$</p>

  <figcaption>Solution for $\phi(t)$, with $F=0.085$, $\omega=2.21$, $\omega_0=2.23$</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This solution is good enough for our approach since I assume $T$ to be small enough to avoid the swinger pumping the swing to big $\phi$ values.</p>

<h2 id="jumping-from-a-swing">Jumping from a swing</h2>

<p>Now let’s study how should a swinger jump from a swing to maximize the traveled distance. The analysis presented here is based on the work of Jason Cole <sup id="fnref:4:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and Hiroyuki Shima <sup id="fnref:5:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Notice that the naive solution of jumping at $\phi=\pi/4$ is not optimal. For instance, imagine a swing that oscillates in the range $\pm \pi/4$, then it’s clear that jumping at $\pi/4$ is suboptimal since the swinger will start its flight with a speed of zero.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.alexmolas.com/docs/swing/swing_jump.png" alt="Jumping from a swing" width="500">
  <figcaption>Diagram showing the situation just after jumping from the swing. Notice that instead of $h$ I'm using $l_1$, and I'm using $h$ as the distance from the swing to the ground, sorry for the confusing notation. Image from [^4]. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Notice I’m adding a new variable $h$ that represents the distance from the swing to the ground. This variable is not present on Jason’s blog but it’s on Hiroyuki paper. Once you jump from the swing, the equations of motion for the horizontal and the vertical directions are</p>

\[\begin{cases}
x(t) = l_1 \sin \phi + v t\cos\phi \\
y(t) = h + l_1(1 - \cos \phi) + vt \sin \phi - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 
\end{cases}\]

<p>Now, we can compute the total flight time by solving $y(t_{\text{flight}})=0$ and then compute the flight distance as $d = x(t_{\text{flight}})$. The flight time is then</p>

\[t_{\text{flight}} = \frac{v\sin\phi \pm\sqrt{v^2\sin^2\phi+2g(h+l_1(1-\cos\phi))}}{g}\]

<p>now notice that only the positive root has physical meaning (we don’t want negative times), so the distance is</p>

\[\begin{align}
d = &amp; l_1 \sin\phi + \frac{v^2 \sin\phi\cos\phi}{g} \\
&amp; + \sqrt{\frac{2v^2\cos^2\phi(h+l_1(1-\cos\phi))}{g}+\left(\frac{v^2\sin\phi\cos\phi}{g}\right)^2}
\end{align}\]

<h2 id="putting-everything-together">Putting everything together</h2>

<p>We have now all the pieces we need to solve the problem. On one hand, we can compute the swinger angle $\phi$ for any given $t$, and we can also compute the distance that the swinger will travel when leaving the swing at an angle $\phi$.</p>

<p>Notice that to compute $d$ we need to know $v$. In other sources that study this problem, they get $v$ by using energy conservation, however, in our case, we know $\phi(t)$ and we can get the initial velocity after leaving the swing as $v(t) = l_1 \frac{d}{dt} \phi(t)$</p>

\[v(t) = \frac{l_1F}{\omega^2_0 - \omega^2}(\omega\cos\omega t - \omega_0\cos \omega_0 t)\]

<p>Now, putting everything together we have this set of equations</p>

\[\begin{cases}
d(t) =l_1 \sin\phi(t) + \frac{v^2 \sin\phi(t)\cos\phi(t)}{g} + \sqrt{\frac{2v^2\cos^2\phi(h+l_1(1-\cos\phi))}{g}+\left(\frac{v(t)^2\sin\phi(t)\cos\phi(t)}{g}\right)^2} \\

\phi(t) = \frac{F}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}\left(\cos \omega t - \cos \omega_0t\right) \\

v(t) = \frac{l_1F}{\omega^2_0 - \omega^2}(\omega\cos\omega t - \omega_0\cos \omega_0 t)
\end{cases}\]

<p>To compute $d(t)$ we just need to compute $\phi(t)$ and $v(t)$ and substitute the values in the first equation. I’ll use the following constants: $M=1$, $m_1=0.4M$, $m_2 = 0.2M$, $m_3 = 0.4M$, $l_1 = 2$, $l_2 = 0.4$, $l_3 = 0.4$, $h=l_3$, $\theta_0=1$, $g= 9.8$, $T=2 \pi \sqrt{l1 / g}$, and $\omega= 2\pi/T$</p>

<p>With these parameters, we can now plot the traveled distance as a function of the jumping time.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.alexmolas.com/docs/swing/distance_vs_t.svg" alt="Traveled distance as a function of jumping time" width="500">
</figure>

<p>Let’s remember that we’re interested in the optimal jumping time $t^*$ for a given maximum time $T$. To do so we just need to fix a time $T$ and find at which $t^* &lt; T$ the distance $d(t)$ is maximized. I did that numerically and plotted the results in the next image</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.alexmolas.com/docs/swing/optimal_time.svg" alt="Optimal jumping time" width="500">
</figure>

<p>Of course, the optimal jumping time follows a ladder-like curve. This is because you’re not interested in jumping backward, and sometimes it’s better to jump some seconds before $T$ than to wait for $T$ and find yourself in a worse position.</p>

<p>Finally, we can get also the maximum traveled distance as a function of $T$.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.alexmolas.com/docs/swing/max_distance.svg" alt="Traveled distance as a function of jumping time" width="500">
</figure>

<p>For example, if $T=20s$, which seems like a reasonable value to make the sport interesting, one would expect to achieve $d\approx 2m$.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, that’s all for today. In this post, I’ve presented a new Olympic sport that consists of pumping on a swing during a given amount of time and then jumping and trying to achieve the maximum distance. With the parameters used in my simulations, I would expect the world record to be around two meters.</p>

<p>The analysis presented here is full of simplifications. Here I list some of the ones I’m aware of</p>

<ul>
  <li>The swinger model is oversimplified. For instance, authors in <sup id="fnref:3:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> present a model which is more accurate than the one used here. However, I wanted to keep the analysis “simple”.</li>
  <li>The swinger is assumed to operate in the regime of small $\phi$, which allows us to use an analytical equation for $\phi(t)$. However, an experimented swinger could achieve big oscillation angles in a short amount of time, and then our simplification wouldn’t be valid anymore.</li>
  <li>As a good physicist I’ve neglected any kind of friction (swing-rod, swinger-air, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>Even with all this simplification, I think the analysis stills bring some light to the problem of maximizing the flight distance. Now, the only step still missing is the experimental one: go to a park and try to beat the theoretical maximum distance. According to my numbers, you wouldn’t be able to beat the 2-meter mark.</p>

<p>All of this reminds me of the anecdote of the mathematician and his wife moving a sofa. The mathematician spent a lot of time computing if it was possible to move the sofa from one room to the other, and finally proved it was impossible. Then he went to show it to his wife, which had already moved the sofa to the other room. So I’m pretty sure that it’s going to be possible to beat my theoretical maximum distance. Unfortunately, I don’t have a swing near me right now, so I’ll have to wait until the next visit to the park.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="appendix-1-optimal-distribution-of-masses">Appendix 1: optimal distribution of masses</h2>

<p>Some days after publishing this post I started wondering which was the combination of masses $m_1$, $m_2$, and $m_3$ that allowed for the best results, aka how should a Swing Jumping world champion look like. To do so I have fixed all the parameters except the masses, and I’ve forced $1 = m_1 + m_2 + m_3$ since the behavior of the system is independent of the total mass $M$.</p>

<p>In the next plot we see how the maximum distance depends on $m_2$ and $m_3$. The red star shows where the combination of masses that maximized the distance.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.alexmolas.com/docs/swing/distance_vs_masses.png" alt="$m1$ &amp; $m2$ vs max distance" width="500">
</figure>

<p>The best combination of masses is $m_1=0$, $m_2 \approx 0.625$ and $m_3 \approx 0.375$. Of course this is not a solution that’s feasible - maybe . Setting a minimum value for $m_1 &gt; 0.1$ we get a different optimal distribution of masses, ie: $m_1\approx 0.2$, $m_2 \approx 0.5$, and $m_3 \approx 0.3$. So we see that the optimal solution is always to minimize $m_1$.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.alexmolas.com/docs/swing/distance_vs_masses_clipped.png" alt="$m1$ &amp; $m2$ vs max distance for a clipped value of $m1$" width="500">
</figure>

<p>With these new masses the maxiumum distance is around $3m$ which is considerably higher than our first result.</p>

<p>We could also analyze the best combination of lengths $l_*$ and masses $m_*$ that maximize the distance, however I don’t think it’s going to add a lot of value to the study so I’ll leave the analysis as it is now.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p>Entrusting our speech to multiple different corporate actors is always risky. Yet given how most of the internet is currently structured, our online expression largely depends on a set of private companies ranging from our direct Internet service providers and platforms, to upstream ISPs (sometimes called Tier 2 and 3), all the way up to Tier 1 ISPs (or the Internet backbone) that have no direct relationships with most users.</p>
<p>Tier 1 ISPs play a unique role in the internet “stack,” because numerous other service providers depend on Tier 1 companies to serve their customers. As a result, Tier 1 providers can be especially powerful chokepoints—given their reach, their content policies can affect large swaths of the web. At the same time given their distant relationship to speakers, Tier 1 ISPs have little if any context to make good decisions about their speech.</p>
<p>At EFF, we have long represented and assisted people from around the world—and across various political spectrums—facing censorship. That experience tells us that one of the most dangerous types of censorship happens at the site of a unique imbalance of power in the structures of the internet: when an internet service is both necessary for the web to function and simultaneously has no meaningful alternatives. That’s why EFF has long argued that we must “<a href="https://protectthestack.org/">protect the stack</a>” by saying no to infrastructure providers policing internet content. We’ve warned that endorsing censorship in one context can (and does) come back to bite us all when, inevitably, that same approach is used in another context. Pressure on basic infrastructure, as a tactic, will be re-used, inevitably, against unjustly marginalized speakers and forums. <a href="https://protectthestack.org/">It already is</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we were concerned when we started hearing from multiple sources that Hurricane Electric, a Tier 1 ISP, is interfering with traffic. Confirmation of the details has been difficult, in part because Hurricane itself has refused to respond to our queries, but it appears that the company is partially denying service to a direct customer, a provider called Crunchbits, in order to disrupt traffic to a site that is several steps away in the stack. And it is justifying that action because activity on the site reportedly violates Hurricane’s “acceptable use policy”—even though Hurricane has no direct relationship with that site. Hurricane argues that the policy requires its direct customers to police <em>their </em>customers as well as themselves.</p>
<p>If the site in question were Reddit, or Planned Parenthood, or even EFF, the internet would be up in arms. It is not, and it’s not hard to see why. The affected site is an almost universally despised forum for hateful speech and planning vicious attacks on vulnerable people: Kiwi Farms. For many, the natural response is to declare good riddance to bad rubbish—and understandably so.</p>
<p>At EFF, our mission and history requires us to look at the bigger picture, and sound the alarm about the risks even when the facts are horrific.</p>
<p>That means we need to say it even if it’s not comfortable: Hurricane Electric is wrong here.&nbsp; It gives us no joy to call Hurricane on this, not least because many will perceive it as an implicit defense of the KF site. <em>It is not.</em> A site that provides a forum for gamifying abuse and doxxing, whose users have celebrated on its pages the IRL deaths of the targets of their harassment campaigns, deserves no sympathy.&nbsp; We fully support criminal and civil liability for those who abuse and harass others.</p>
<p>But just because there’s a serious problem doesn’t mean that every response is a good one.&nbsp; And regardless of good intentions, Hurricane’s role as a Tier 1 ISP means that their interference is a dangerous step. Let us explain why.</p>
<p>For one thing, Tier 1 ISPs like Hurricane are often monopolies or near-monopolies, so users have few alternatives if they are blocked. Censorship is more powerful if you don’t have somewhere else to go.&nbsp; To be clear, at time of writing, there are two mirrored instances of KF online: one on the clear web at a country code top-level domain, and the other an onion service on the Tor network. So right now this isn’t a “lights out” situation for KF, and generally the Tor network will prevent that from happening entirely. The so-called “dark web” has plenty of deserved ill repute, however, so although it is resistant to censorship by Tier 1 ISPs, it is not a meaningful option for many, much less an accessible one.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the second point: this approach is usually a one-way ratchet. Once an ISP indicates it’s willing to police content by blocking traffic, more pressure from other quarters will follow, and they won’t all share your views or values. For example, an ISP, under pressure from the attorney general of a state that bans abortions, might decide to interfere with traffic to a site that raises money to help people get abortions, or provides information about self-managed abortions. Having set a precedent in one context, it is very difficult for an ISP to deny it in another, especially when even considering the request takes skill and nuance.&nbsp; We all know how lousy big user-facing platforms like Facebook are at content moderation—and that’s with significant resources. Tier 1 ISPs don’t have the ability or the incentive to build content evaluation teams that are even as effective as those of the giant platforms who know far more about their end users and yet <a href="https://www.onlinecensorship.org/">still engage in harmful censorship</a>. ISPs like Hurricane Electric are bound to be far <em>worse</em> than Facebook and its peers at sorting bad content from good, which is why they should not open this door.</p>
<p>Finally, site-blocking, whatever form it takes, almost inevitably cuts off legal as well as illegal speech. It cuts with a chain saw rather than a scalpel.</p>
<p>We know that many believe that KF is uniquely awful, so that it is justifiable to take measures against them that we wouldn’t condone against anyone else. The thing is, that argument doesn’t square with reality, online or offline.&nbsp; Crossing the line to Tier 1 blocking won’t just happen once.</p>
<p>To put it even more simply: When a person uses a room in a house to engage in illegal or just terrible activity, we don’t call on the electric company to cut off the light and heat to the entire house, or the post office to stop delivering mail. We know that this will backfire in the long run. Instead, we go after the bad guys themselves and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>That’s what must happen here. The cops and the courts should be working to protect the victims of KF and go after the perpetrators with every legal tool at their disposal. We should be giving them the resources and societal mandate to do so. Solid enforcement of existing laws is something that has been sorely lacking for harassment and abuse online, and it’s one of the reasons people turn to censorship strategies. Finally, we should enact strong data privacy laws that target, among others, the data brokers whose services help enable doxxing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Tier 1 ISPs like Hurricane should resist the temptation to step in where law enforcement and legislators have failed. The firmest, most consistent approach infrastructure chokepoints like ISPs can take is to simply refuse to be chokepoints at all. Ultimately, that’s also the best way to safeguard human rights. We do not need more corporate speech police, however well-meaning.</p>

      <p><a href="https://griffin.com/">Griffin</a> is a banking-as-a-service platform and part of the new wave of API-driven banking. Their services allow Fintech businesses to integrate banking features quickly and securely. In March 2023, Griffin was granted their UK banking license by the Financial Conduct Authority, making them a fully-regulated UK bank.</p>
<p>We caught up with Allen Rohner, Griffin Co-founder and CTO (also Co-founder of CircleCI), to discuss how they’ve built a bank, from the ground up, using Clojure.</p>

<p><strong>Joe: So what does Griffin do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> We are a fully regulated UK bank. We call it <em>“the bank you can build on”</em>. That means we’re like AWS for banking. So there’s an API to onboard a customer, an API to create a bank account, an API to make a payment.</p>
<p>By law, fintechs must work with a bank to do these things, and right now that means a legacy high street bank with mainframes. Griffin is the bank <em>plus</em> technology platform that all future fintechs would build on.</p>
<p>We got our license in March and we’re still in what’s called ‘mobilization’, which is basically like training wheels. The training wheels come off when we complete an audit, raise some more money, and finish writing the code. That should be Q3 or Q4 this year.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: So presumably, the mission of Griffin would be to disrupt the market, have a more modern set of technologies, a better, faster delivery capability than some of the existing banks?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> Yeah, exactly. We kind of joke that we’re a tech company that happens to have a banking license.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: How did Clojure end up becoming the language of choice for the platform?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> I mean, the flippant answer is: because I liked it. The serious answer is: Clojure is the right choice because it’s immutable, it’s powerful; it’s a good fit for financial services and anything that needs an audit log.</p>
<span text-content="Clojure is the right choice because it’s immutable, it’s powerful; it’s a good fit for financial services and anything that needs an audit log."></span>
<p>There is a longer story about how I arrived at Clojure. I graduated from college (you UK folks would say ‘university’) in 2005, and I got a boring enterprise software job and, uh, was pretty unhappy with it. Then I started reading Paul Graham, and he was writing about how you should both start a startup and work in Lisp. And so I said, Hey, let’s do both of those. At the time he was saying, don’t use Common Lisp because it’s old, fragmented, and there wasn’t a good implementation that did everything. There was like one implementation that was good at threads and another implementation that was good at, let’s say, graphics. And if you wanted to do graphics and threads, you were outta luck. He was saying, <em>“Wait, wait, I’m gonna work on this”</em>.</p>
<p>The problem with Common Lisp is that it needed a BDFL like Python, and there wasn’t one yet. And so PG was saying, well, <em>“I’ll start Arc”</em>, but he’d been talking about that for multiple years. So then I started writing my own Lisp, got about halfway into it, and then I saw that Rich released Clojure. That was probably 2007 - one of his first announcements.</p>
<p>I looked at Clojure and I said, <em>“Well, that’s way better than what I would’ve written”</em>. So then I did a startup that didn’t go anywhere, and then I founded CircleCI in 2011. This is also getting into the history of Griffin as well. I hired David [Jarvis], my co-founder at Griffin, as engineer number nine or so at CircleCI.</p>

<p>David later went on to work at Standard Treasury, which was a YC company that was trying to sell modern APIs to US banks. That ended up not working out. Too late in Standard Treasury’s runway, they said, <em>“Instead of trying to sell the banks, let’s <em>become</em> a bank”</em>. They figured that out too late. David always liked the idea and he saw Monzo get authorized in 2017. He said, <em>“Well, if Monzo can get authorized for this retail bank, then we can get authorized for this tech infrastructure bank”</em>.</p>
<p>So, by this point, I’d been using Clojure for a decade and it worked great at CircleCI and it was a very good fit for financial services.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: So you were coming to Clojure from a Lisp background. Had you worked with JVM languages before that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> Not really. I had, maybe, three months of Java before using Clojure. Before that my prior experience was C and C++, Python, and Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: So did you see the JVM as a benefit or a drawback? People talk about the ‘JVM tax’ (on resources like memory). Were you thinking that way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> I did at first, but my perspective has changed. For the first couple of years I didn’t appreciate it [the JVM]. But now I’ve seen other niche startup languages try to grow, and they run into the library problems and run into problems making the compiler and the runtime fast. It’s become obvious to me that the JVM is a huge benefit.</p>
<span text-content="[N]ow I've seen other niche startup languages try to grow, ... it's become obvious to me that the JVM is a huge benefit."></span>
<p><strong>Joe: When you were working on CircleCI and also when you were starting Griffin, were you mindful that this choice of language and technology would have an impact? Did you feel that using Clojure said something about the business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> Yeah, I think it definitely says something about the company, something I thought was good.</p>
<p>If we had picked Python, it’s very boring and reliable, and the same could be said of Java. But you’re picking the lowest common denominator. I would say high performers, and the best programmers are often people that will only work in niche languages.</p>
<p>The problem is, there are good Java programmers, but there are also thousands of terrible Java programmers. If you pick the right niche, it’s easier to find the high-end talent. I think Paul Graham also made a very strong case that in a startup, you should be using the most powerful language you can, and that is Clojure.</p>
<h2 id="foundationdb">FoundationDB</h2>
<p><strong>Joe: How would you describe the architecture of the Griffin platform?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> We’re running Clojure on Kubernetes, on AWS, and we are almost entirely event sourcing.</p>
<p>The database is <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/">FoundationDB</a>, and this additional proprietary thing that I really need to open source (I ported Datascript to FoundationDB). It’s a Datomic-like layer that writes directly to Foundation. I should talk about Foundation, cause it’s awesome.</p>
<p>FoundationDB is a strict-serializable key value store that supports transactions. It was originally a Silicon Valley startup and then got acquired by Apple in 2015. It kind of disappeared, and then Apple re-open-sourced it around 2018.</p>
<p>Apple uses it in production for iCloud. They’ve benchmarked it running like a million transactions a second. It’s strict serializable, which means that it’s at the <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">highest correctness level for databases</a>.</p>
<p>So Foundation is a very good database. It’s very fast, and it’s intentionally built to be built upon. The normal API is just ‘get a key’, ‘set a key’. It’s not SQL. I ported Datascript to that. So now we have atomic queries, reading and writing on this strict serializable data store with transactions.</p>
<p>The database supports concurrent writes (not a single writer), and we need to go over a thousand transactions per second, so we’re very happy with that.</p>

<h2 id="event-sourcing">Event-sourcing</h2>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> We also have an event sourcing model. Every input to the system is an event. So like every API request, every webhook from a third party, it turns into an event. Those go into a message log. For us an event is just a Clojure map with a type field and some keys, values, and specs.</p>
<p>The entire system is just reactions to events. We have these small log processors, or ‘procs’ for short. The proc declares <em>“I listen for message type A, and then in response to that, I will emit either B or C”</em>. And each one has its own little private state.</p>
<p>You can build up a graph of how the messages flow through the system. Events will flow until you reach a terminal node in the graph. For example, a web server says, <em>“I will receive http events and write them. Please make a payment and I will listen for either payment created event or a payment rejected event. When I see one of those, I will respond back to the client”</em>. That’s a Netty asynchronous http handler, so an asynchronous payment response back to the client.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: So you have many independent procs all receiving and acting on those events, and producing their own. Yeah. How are those events conveyed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> They’re all written to Foundation, so they go into the log there and each little log processor has its own private data, like its own namespace in the database, where they emit messages. The procs are watching in Foundation for a certain type of event to be written, and they are writing their own events back to Foundation. Foundation has a feature for watching when DB keys change, so it’s efficient to build a reactive system on top of that.</p>
<p>If you had a database and some separate messaging like ZeroMQ, Rabbit, Kafka, you’re going to get race conditions. There’s always going to be a potential race where you have two messages - one is going to the disk and one is going to the network. If someone else is listening and sees both of them, they could potentially get them in either order. So it’s much, much simpler to just have one path. Foundation is really fast, so it works great.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: Do you have log processors as independent services, or are things more monolithic?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> It’s a monorepo. And right now many log processes run in the same JVM for efficiency. They are independent, so they could be run each one in its own JVM process, but right now we’re running low hundreds of them in a single JVM.</p>
<p>One architectural choice that we made that I highly, highly recommend is: Keep your business logic as dumb and clean as possible. For these individual log processors, if you look at the namespace, it’s almost entirely pure Clojure. No third-party libraries, and very few side effects.</p>
<span text-content="One architectural choice that we made that I highly, highly recommend is: Keep your business logic as dumb and clean as possible... We have a function that takes a Clojure map in and I write a Clojure map out."></span>
<p>A log processor is function that takes a Clojure map in and returns one or more Clojure maps out. There’s a protocol for proc state, but it’s a protocol so you don’t know what’s on the other side of that. So yeah, keep the business logic as clean as possible, with as few dependencies as possible, and then interact with the outside world via protocols.</p>
<p>So for example, for the proc state protocol, it could either write to an in-memory database, or it can write to Foundation. It’s great because you can change out your implementation at test time.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: I see. I guess there are two patterns that people often use, aren’t there?</strong></p>
<p><strong>One is keeping all interactions with the outside world at the outer edges (e.g. functional core, imperative shell). Another is more like dependency injection, where we interact with the outside world from anywhere, but put in some abstractions, so that we can swap out the implementation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So you’re doing the latter? You <em>do</em> allow those interactions to happen within the business logic, but you make sure to always have a protocol in front of those interactions so that you can swap out the implementation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> Exactly. Also, the interface to the outside world is as small as possible.</p>
<p>For the vast majority of procs, the only thing they can do is write to their own internal state and emit messages. That’s it. They can’t make network calls. They can’t call AWS. They don’t do anything else. So when we do wanna talk to the outside world, there’s a special kind of proc that has a dispatch handler that is dedicated to talk to that external system. So, this one talks to AWS, this one talks to our clearing bank, this one talks to some other API.</p>
<p>That separation is very useful.</p>
<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>
<p><strong>Joe: What’s the typical selection of libraries and things from the Clojure ecosystem that you’re using?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> So in the business logic itself, very little. Outside of that, for instance in the API web server or the service gateway (where we talk to the outside world), it’s ring, netty, reitit. We’re using Clojure spec extensively. For AWS we’re using the Cognitect aws-api library.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: And do you use any library for managing the parts that interact with the outside world? Dependency injection or wiring up the application?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> The thing we use is based on a blog post called <a href="https://medium.com/@maciekszajna/reloaded-workflow-out-of-the-box-be6b5f38ea98">closeable</a>. It’s great.</p>
<p>Five years ago, this guy wrote a blog post. His argument was that you don’t need Component or Integrant, or any of that. All you need is <code>with-open</code>. You get lexical scope, you get the right-hand side of declaring your bindings to construct things. And then because of how the introduction of bindings works, it forces you to declare your things in order.</p>
<span text-content="[Y]ou don't need Component or Integrant, or any of that. All you need is with-open."></span>
<p>There’s a couple of little helpers. One of them is for things that have state but don’t implement <code>Closeable</code>, or for things that are stateless, so you can declare them in the <code>with-open</code> block.</p>
<p>And so that’s it. You’re done. It’s very simple, and very clean.</p>
<h2 id="hiring">Hiring</h2>
<p><strong>Joe: You spoke earlier about how, often, the best programmers work in niche languages and it means that using marks your business out. How do you find hiring and finding good engineers? Do you have any issues?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> I’m really happy with it. I joke about it sometimes, but it’s not a joke, it’s real: if we said we were hiring for Java programmers, we’d get like a thousand CVs and you’d have 10 good ones. If we’re hiring for Clojure, we’ll get 13 CVs and 10 good ones. You’re going to find high quality people and you’re gonna do less work for it.</p>
<p>We’re also remote, which I think is important because when you’re dealing with a smaller hiring pool, and you also constrain to geography, that’s hard. If you’re a remote company, then your hiring pool is, either everyone on earth or everyone within three time zones, or everyone in Europe, whatever. You’re at a good sized pool.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: Yes, and it’s very rare that a company needs to hire, say, a hundred engineers in a short space of time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s an anti-pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: What’s the size of your team at the moment? And what is that geographical split?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> There are maybe 70 in the company, and 22-24 or so in Engineering.</p>
<p>In engineering, it’s maybe two thirds in the UK and then a third in the EU. We’ve got, say, four in Germany, four in Sweden, one in Ireland. And then people over most of the UK. Our headquarters are in London, but most of the developers are in the UK <em>outside</em> of London.</p>

<h2 id="testing-for-correctness">Testing for correctness</h2>
<p><strong>Joe: How do you feel about the direction of Clojure at the moment? Are there things that you would like to see happen in the Clojure space? (either in the core or in the ecosystem). Is there anything that you feel is missing, or any new direction you are interested to go in?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> So a thing I’ve been banging around for a while, but haven’t really made any progress on yet is around testing of systems. The FoundationDB team have a great video on how they do testing, but the problem is that this approach is hard to do as a library.</p>
<p>Foundation is a distributed system and almost every system that any of us work with on the internet today is a distributed system. Cause, you know, even if you have one process talking to AWS, then congratulations, you’re now a networked system!</p>
<p>So there are two big problems that we have to deal with. One of them is race conditions, and the other is system errors. As a bank we have to be what is called ‘operationally resilient’, which really just means no downtime. But we’re dealing with people’s money, so we have to actually prove it. So, don’t go down, and when there is a problem, how do you prove that you’re not losing people’s money?</p>
<p>What the Foundation team did was build a simulator of the database. They have something like 20 different process types, so 20 different ‘roles’ within the Foundation cluster, and they wrote them as single-threaded C++ apps. Then they built an actor-model concurrency compiler on top of C++. Every single system call or network call that they make goes through a protocol, so they can inject errors. All of their multi-threading also happens through this actor model with the sending of messages.</p>
<p>With all this in place, they can then say, <em>“Oh, what happens if I send message A and then send message B, but then on the other end it arrives B and then A?”</em>. Or <em>“What happens if, in the middle of processing this message, I try to write to disk and I get an error?”</em>. They can inject errors anywhere in the system, deterministically.</p>
<p>You can think of it as kind of like test.check generative testing, where you have all non-determinism in the system seeded from a single random number that you control. You can control disk errors, network errors, and reordering of messages. I’m really interested in having something like that.</p>
<p>The problem right now is that there’s no way to control the behavior of the underlying Java threading libraries, nio, and writing to disk.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: Similar to Jepsen, in a way, where you can enumerate all of the possible error scenarios for a complex, distributed system, but rather than just controlling the environment to disconnect the network or stop writes to the disk, you also have total control over things like thread scheduling to enumerate all the possible internal outcomes too?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> Yeah. It is very much in the same spirit as Jepsen. In Jepsen you set up like five VMs and say, <em>“Oh, well maybe I’ll kill this process”</em>, and maybe that turns up a bug and maybe it doesn’t. Jepsen is very ‘brute force’, and it’s hard to know when you’re done because you can’t inspect the database’s state, so you don’t know how much coverage you’re getting. How many times do you have to do it before you’re confident that you don’t have any bugs there?</p>
<p>The difference, if you have this environment where you have total control, is that you can enumerate system calls, or say, for all possible interleavings of messages, make sure this thing happens. And because it’s in memory, it’s extremely fast.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: Have you seen this going on successfully outside of Clojure and the JVM?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> No. I don’t know if anyone is doing it aside from the FoundationDB team. They started and built that on day one. I think in the video they said they had that built before they were even writing database tables to disk. This is the kind of thing that gives us a lot of confidence in FoundationDB.</p>
<p><strong>Joe: Thanks a lot for speaking with us Allen. Finally, are you hiring?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allen</strong>: We tend to go into a bit of a lull on interviewing during the summer due to holiday, but yes we’re hiring. Check out the <a href="https://griffin.com/careers">Griffin careers page</a> for info.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the second half of 2022, I dusted off my laptop and travelled to three events for the first time in over two years.

Sensing that 2022 wasn’t an outlier and more travel would be on the cards in 2023 I decided that I wanted some of that thin and light laptop action.

I did do my homework though and will present my creative upgrade solution in a future blog post. <a href="https://wimpysworld.com/posts/rss.xml">Like and Subscribe</a> 😉</p><h3 id="build-quality--design-">Build Quality &amp; Design 💻️</h3><p>Without a doubt, the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is a gorgeous laptop. I do not have enough superlatives to express just how much I love it. It is, in my option, an almost flawless design. Exactly the compact form factor laptop I was seeking; it’s beautiful to look at from any angle and a delight to use. Here are some highlights.</p><p><img src="https://wimpysworld.com/posts/why-i-chose-the-thinkpad-z13-as-my-linux-laptop/ThinkPad_Z13_Gen_1_CT1_02.webp" alt="ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1"><br><em>ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1</em></p><p>The laptop is engineered from 75% recycled aluminium and 95% recycled plastics, then boxed in 100% renewable, compostable packaging. The touchpad is sublime and amazingly 120mm wide on the compact laptop. The haptic touch is simply excellent. The touchpad is the most Macbook-like touchpad I’ve used on any PC and it is so good it has caused me to change what desktop environment I now use. More on this in a future blog post. However, there is currently no Linux software to <a href="https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/datasheet/ThinkPad_Z_Series_Haptic_TouchPad_Settings.pdf">configure the haptic touchpad settings</a> such as click force and touchpad feedback intensity but I’ve been perfectly happy with the defaults. If you do dual boot Windows the haptic settings configured via Windows are stored on the device and carry over to Linux.</p><p>The Keyboard is an excellent low-profile design, each key has ~1.2mm of travel which is the same as the actuation point on my Razer Huntsman V2 TKL keyboards with opto-mechanical switches. Most importantly the Fn key is in the correct place on the Z13 and not where ThinkPads have been incorrectly plonking it for years. Fight me! 🥊 If you are a long-time ThinkPad owner, it is likely you’ll hate the idea of the keyboard and touchpad on the Z13 since it is quite a departure from the traditional design. But I went into this with my eyes 👀 open and have watched and read many reviews.</p><p><img src="https://wimpysworld.com/posts/why-i-chose-the-thinkpad-z13-as-my-linux-laptop/ThinkPad_Z13_Gen_1_CT4_01.webp" alt="Correct Fn key placement on ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1"><br><em>"This is the way"</em></p><p>The Display is bright (400nits), anti-reflective and anti-smudge, covers 100% of the sRGB colour gamut and the laptop is perfectly balanced so it can be opened one-handed. I’m embracing the compact, thin and light lifestyle; so the two USB-C ports are fine with me as I’ve chosen a laptop configuration with excellent battery endurance (more on that in a bit) and plan to use it completely untethered most of the time with cables and adapters only plugged in for very specific tasks and overnight recharging.</p><p>I do have one niggle though; there is an unusable 2242 M.2 slot on the motherboard. It is only intended for use with select models of WWAN cards, none of which are a configuration option for the UK models of the Z13. It doesn’t look like the antenna is wired in either, so even if you do get a supported WWAN card aftermarket it is unlikely to work well; if at all. I can share my iPhone’s mobile service via Wifi, so not a deal breaker in that regard but it is rather annoying to have an M.2 slot on the motherboard and nothing I can do with it.</p><h3 id="ubuntu-pre-install-experience-">Ubuntu pre-install experience 👌</h3><p>It is worth noting that at the time of purchase, selecting Ubuntu or Fedora in the system configuration on the Lenovo website applied a £155 discount! 🤑 Choosing Ubuntu or Fedora across the ThinkPad line applies a discount, although the amount varies based on the model.</p><p>All OEMs that partner with Ubuntu get an OEM designation for each device officially endorsed and supported by Canonical. The ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is known as <em>Sutton Newell Abe</em> and the <code>oem-sutton.newell-abe-meta</code> package (along with the associated OEM PPA) provides the device-specific hardware enablement and power management tuning.</p><p><img src="https://wimpysworld.com/posts/why-i-chose-the-thinkpad-z13-as-my-linux-laptop/oem-name.webp" alt="ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 (Sutton Newell Abe)"><br><em>ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is known as Sutton Newell Abe for OEM enablement</em></p><p>The OEM image of Ubuntu differs from the standard Ubuntu image in a few ways. The most obvious is that OEM image comes with recovery media creation pre-installed. This is a great feature and I highly recommend you use it to create a recovery USB stick, either during the initial setup or post-setup. The OEM image also comes with Chromium and Firefox installed, as opposed to just Firefox in the downloadable release of Ubuntu. IIRC, this is because Chromium has traditionally worked better with touchscreen laptops. The fingerprint reader works. I was able to enrol fingerprints quickly and authenticate GDM logins. But the biometric support does not extend throughout the system; Ubuntu Software doesn’t integrate with the fingerprint reader, nor does <code>snapd</code> or any other privilege escalation.</p><p>I also experienced the touchpad becoming unresponsive, requiring a click to “unfreeze” it. This happens quite frequently and detracts from what is otherwise an excellent, class-leading, touchpad. I suspect it is overly aggressive power management settings in the OEM image, but I didn’t investigate beyond that hunch. Both these issues with the fingerprint reader and touchpad are Ubuntu-specific and nothing related to the actual hardware. Both issues are absent when running NixOS.</p><p>Having a tier-1 vendor such as Lenovo ship a laptop with Ubuntu pre-installed has the benefit of great firmware support. I’ve received several firmware updates since I got the laptop, and they have all applied without issue.</p><p><img src="https://wimpysworld.com/posts/why-i-chose-the-thinkpad-z13-as-my-linux-laptop/firmware-update.webp" alt="ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 firmware updates on Ubuntu"><br><em>Firmware updates for the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 on Ubuntu 20.04</em></p><h4 id="why-not-ubuntu-2204-">Why not Ubuntu 22.04? 🤔</h4><p>My Z13 was shipped with Ubuntu 20.04.4 with OEM optimised Linux kernel 5.14.0-1054-oem. Some might be perplexed (or annoyed) that it didn’t come with Ubuntu 22.04, given it was ordered in late 2022. I used to work for Canonical, and during that time worked with Lenovo to enable Ubuntu on ~60 of their laptops and workstations between 2019 and 2021, so I do have some insight into how this process works. It simply boils down to how the factory image certification process works, and once an image is qualified that is what ships on the device for the duration of its availability. Re-certification adds cost and takes time, so it’s extremely rare for a device to have a revised factory image qualified once it has gone on sale.</p><p>Upgrading to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS worked flawlessly, full audio support was restored and no other hardware supported regressed. Brilliant.</p><h4 id="linux-kernel-61-">Linux Kernel 6.1 🌰</h4><p>The pre-installed Ubuntu and Fedora images for the Z13 come with kernels that have backported patches applied to fully support the device. If you buy a ThinkPad Z13 and plan to run another Linux distro on it, make sure you can install Linux kernel version 6.1 or newer. This is to ensure the Qualcomm Wi-Fi 6E NFA725A 2x2 AX chipset is fully supported and that the required patches to properly suspend and resume are available.</p><h3 id="battery-endurance-">Battery endurance 🔋</h3><p>This is, after all, my most important selection criteria. The conclusion here is simple: <strong>11 hours</strong> ⏱️</p><p>This is 11 hours of mixed-use. Coding in Visual Studio Code. Chatting in Slack and Discord. Video calls in Google Meet and Zoom. Compiling software. Some screen capture with OBS Studio and basic video editing with <a href="https://shotcut.org/">Shotcut</a>. Closing the lid of the laptop and leaving it suspended for 24 hours depletes the battery by ~4% which is about 2 Wh. Very respectable. I haven’t felt the need to profile power consumption or tweak anything as I’m get plenty of untethered compute time. I’m very happy with the battery life, typically charging the laptop overnight while I sleep and running it all day battery only.</p><h2 id="whats-next-">What’s next? 🔮</h2><p>As noted, I did compromise on the 1TB M.2 SSD. I’ve come up with an aftermarket solution to upgrade to 2TB which I will post about soon. I chose a laptop pre-installed with Linux for two reasons:</p><ul><li>Support companies shipping a Linux operating system pre-installed on their laptops and workstations</li><li>Hard proof Linux works on their hardware</li></ul><p>After using Ubuntu for a few weeks I switched to NixOS. I will be posting about my experience with NixOS on the Z13 in a future blog post and <a href="https://twitch.tv/WimpysWorld">will likely livestream about it on Twitch</a> as well. TL;DR NixOS 22.11 has fewer issues than Ubuntu 22.04 on the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1.</p><p>The ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 is an excellent laptop for my requirements, and I have no regrets. If I were to buy I laptop pre-installed with a Linux distro in the future, I might go for Fedora, just so I can see what the OEM experience is like with Fedora.</p><p>Since I purchased the Z13, <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/framework-laptop-13-with-13th-gen-intel-core-and-amd-ryzen-7040-series">Framework has announced AMD 7040-series powered laptops</a> are coming later in 2023; and I’m not sure I can resist…</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="featured">
                         <p>
            August 29th, 2023</p><!-- .entry-meta -->
        <p>By far, <a title="DOS/4GW and Protected Mode" href="https://pikuma.com/blog/what-is-dos4gw-protected-mode"> the most popular so-called DOS Extender in the early 1990’s was DOS/4GW</a>. MS-DOS game compatibility occupied a very large portion of my time during Windows 95 development, so I saw a lot of DOS Extender banners, most frequently the DOS/4GW banner.</p>
<p>Now, you might wonder, “How did these games even run in Windows 95 if they came with a DOS Extender? Wouldn’t the extender try to enter protected mode and fail, because Windows was already managing protected mode?”</p>
<p>The trick is that these extenders were really two programs bundled together. One was a protected mode server, and the other was a protected mode client library.</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was the Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI), which was supported by expanded memory managers like EMM386. These expanded memory managers barely used protected mode at all: The only thing they cared about was getting access to memory above the 1MB boundary, so they set up some page tables in order to map extended memory into the expanded memory page frame, but did no other virtualization. MS-DOS ran in a virtual machine that had full hardware access, and the VCPI interface let an MS-DOS application say, “Hey, I’d like to take over complete control of the system now,” and VCPI would say “Sure, no problem!”</p>
<p>The VCPI interface quickly faded in popularity because no protected mode operating system (like Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode) would let any program take over complete control of the system. You would basically be suspending the old operating system in order to let the MS-DOS program take over as its own new custom operating system. Windows 3.0 introduced a new interface called the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) which let MS-DOS programs request that their code execute in protected mode, but only in user mode. The DPMI provider remained in control of kernel mode.</p>
<p>Okay, so back to DOS/4GW. When it started up, the DOS/4GW extender looked around to see if a DPMI server was already running. If not, then it installed itself as the DPMI server. But if a DPMI server was already running, then it allowed that DPMI server to remain in charge.</p>
<p>The game communicated only with the DPMI client portion of the library, which it used to transition to 32-bit mode, allocate memory, and do all those 32-bit things that these 32-bit game wanted to 32-bit do.</p>
<p>In other words, we have the following block diagram:</p>
<table title="The game code runs in ring 3 and communicates with the DPMI client (the DOS/4GW DPMI client) also in ring 3. The DPMI client communicates with a DPMI server. If running inside Windows, the DPMI server is Window sitself. If running standalone, then the DPMI server is the DOS/4GW DPMI server.">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both Windows and the DOS/4GW DPMI server implement the DPMI interface, so the DOS/4GW DPMI client used standard DPMI calls to communicate with both servers.</p>
<p>This was great for application compatibility, because if there was some issue with how the DOS/4GW client communicated with the DOS/4GW server, we just had to fix it once, and it fixed a lot of games. On the other hand, if the issue couldn’t be fixed, it broke a lot of games.</p>
<p>High risk, high reward.</p>
<p>Miraculously, most games <i>just worked</i> despite running under a different DPMI server from what they were originally developed with. There were occasional issues with specific games. Popular ones include <a title="Getting MS-DOS games to run on Windows 95: Virtual memory" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160328-00/?p=93204"> games which assumed that all memory was physical</a> and <a title="Getting MS-DOS games to run on Windows 95: The interrupt flag" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160404-00/?p=93261"> games which assumed the interrupt flag was unvirtualized</a>, but for the most part, things worked well enough that the remaining issues could be treated as app-specific bugs.</p>

This results in mushy goop coming out or the machine shutting down and refusing to work until it resets and cools down,” Shahram Mokhtari, iFixit’s lead teardown tech, said in iFixit’s teardown. The machine gives error codes that explain what’s wrong with the machine: “error after error means I’m constantly having to refer back to the manual … tiny errors can cause big headaches … the error codes are nonsensical, counterintuitive, and seemingly random, even if you spend hours reading the manual.”</p><p>Broken McDonald’s McFlurry machines has become a meme over the years, with the company itself joking about extended downtime, and the Federal Trade Commission promising to investigate <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jg83e4/the-ftc-is-investigating-why-mcdonalds-mcflurry-machines-are-always-broken-report?ref=404media.co">why they are broken so often</a>.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is Langfuse?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Langfuse is an open source observability &amp; analytics solution for LLM-based applications. It is mostly geared towards production usage but some users also use it for local development of their LLM applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">Langfuse is focused on applications built on top of LLMs. Many new abstractions and common best practices evolved recently, e.g. agents, chained prompts, embedding-based retrieval, LLM access to REPLs &amp; APIs. These make applications more powerful but also unpredictable for developers as they cannot fully anticipate how changes impact the quality, cost and overall latency of their application. Thus Langfuse helps to monitor and debug these applications.</p>

  <p>This blog post presents an overview of Starlink's User Terminal runtime internals, focusing on the communications that happen within the device and with user applications and some tools that can help further research on the same topic.</p>

  

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Starlink is a satellite-based Internet access service provided by Space X. This service already counts more than <a href="https://twitter.com/Starlink/status/1654673695007457280">1.5 million subscribers</a> all around the world, using the very same infrastructure. Starlink relies on 3 components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user terminal, which communicates with the satellites, and on which most of the current research is focused.</li>
<li>A satellite fleet acting as a mesh network.</li>
<li>A gateway that connects the satellites to the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Numerous studies [<a href="https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/starlink_structure.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/blog/dumping-and-extracting-the-spacex-starlink-user-terminal-firmware/">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/Starlink-FI">3</a>] have already been conducted on the subject, mainly on the user terminal.
During my 6-month internship at <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/">Quarkslab</a> as part of my Master's degree program at the <a href="https://www.unitn.it/en">University of Trento</a>, I carried out the analysis of Starlink by reverse-engineering its firmware and the various protocols it uses.
At the end of the internship, I gained a good knowledge of how the device works internally and developed a set of tools that could help other researchers working on the same topic.
These tools will be described and published along with this blog post.</p>
<p>To conduct this study, we analyzed two regular User Terminals version 2 (the round one) and a User Terminal version 3 (the squared one) with root access (researcher access) which was provided by SpaceX's security team toward the end of my internship.</p>
<h2>Firmware overview</h2>
<p>The first step was to dump the firmware of the device since it's not publicly available, and we did that thanks to a <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/blog/dumping-and-extracting-the-spacex-starlink-user-terminal-firmware/">blog post</a> by the <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/">COSIC</a> research group at KU Leuven.
Once we got the firmware, we started inspecting the content, trying to understand how the memory was structured.
We also started looking into the U-Boot version that was customized by SpaceX, and it is being used as the final bootloader stage (BL33) for the User Terminal.
The U-Boot license requires any modification of its code to be published with the same license, hence you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/SpaceExplorationTechnologies/u-boot">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>From the file <a href="https://github.com/SpaceExplorationTechnologies/u-boot/blob/sx_2022_05_03/include/configs/spacex_catson_boot.h"><code>include/configs/spacex_catson_boot.h</code></a> we can see how the memory is partitioned, here is a part of it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>+-----------------+</span><span> 0x0000_0000</span>
<span>| bootfip0 (1 MB) |</span>
<span>+-----------------+</span><span> 0x0010_0000</span>
<span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span><span></span>
<span>+-----------------+</span><span> 0x0060_0000</span>
<span>| fip  a</span><span>.</span><span>0 (1 MB) |</span>
<span>+-----------------+</span><span> 0x0070_0000</span>
<span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span><span></span>
<span>+-----------------+</span><span> 0x0100_0000</span>
<span>| linux a (32 MB) |</span>
<span>+-----------------+</span><span> 0x0300_0000</span>
<span>| linux b (32 MB) |</span>
<span>+-----------------+</span><span> 0x0500_0000</span>
<span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This allows us to split the image into small partitions and analyze each of them separately.
<a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/starlink-tools/tree/main/parts-extractor">This script</a> can help you do that automatically.
From here, we can also see that almost every partition is present multiple times (e.g. <code>linux a/b</code>).
This is because of the software update procedure, which will overwrite the partition that is not currently being used so that in the case of an error, there will still be the original partition that is known to be "correct".
An overview of the main partitions can be seen in the following picture.</p>

    </a>
</center>
<p>Partitions <code>Boot FIP</code> and <code>FIP</code> contain all the bootloader stages that compose the secure boot chain, most of them are based on the <a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-a/">ARM TF-A project</a>, which does not come with a GNU-like license, and the last one (BL33) is the U-Boot bootloader we mentioned above.</p>
<p>Having a clear idea of the boot process is essential to perform the <a href="https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/Starlink-FI">fault injection attack</a> developed by the COSIC research group.
The boot chain follows the classic multi-stage secure boot implemented by ARM TF-A, in the following picture you can see an overview of it.</p>

        <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/boot-chain.png" width="100%">
    </a>
</center>
<p>Boot stages come from different partitions of the eMMC and the first, which represents the Root of Trust, comes from an internal ROM of the main processor, they can be extracted from the partition images by using <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/tree/master/tools/fiptool">fiptool</a>, from ARM TF-A.
At the end of the boot process, BL31 will reside in Exception Level 3 (EL3) and act as a secure monitor, while the Linux kernel will run in Exception Level 1 (EL1), in the normal world running user-land applications in Exception Level 0 (EL0).</p>
<p>Then, the <code>linux</code> partition, as the name suggests, contains the Linux kernel, its ramdisk image and some Flattened Device Trees, one for every hardware version of the User Terminal.
This partition can be unpacked by using <a href="https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/blob/master/tools/dumpimage.c">dumpimage</a> from the U-Boot project, the ramdisk is a <code>cpio</code> image and FDTs come in the form of Device Tree Blobs (DTBs) which can be "decompiled" to Device Tree Sources (DTSs) text with the <a href="https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Reference">Device Tree Compiler</a>.
This partition also comes with some Error Correcting Code (ECC) information in it, you will need to remove it before being able to unpack it.
The ECC mechanism is custom-made by SpaceX and you can understand how it works by looking at the code in U-Boot which handles this verification, the next <a href="#integrity">Section</a> explains how it works and provides a tool to do that.</p>
<p>The <code>sx</code> (SX Runtime) partition contains configuration files and binaries that are specific to the User Terminal.
This partition will be mounted by the Linux's init script on <code>/sx/local/runtime</code> and after that binaries in this volume will be started.
In this case, integrity verification is done with <code>sxverity</code> which is yet another custom tool by SpaceX.
The next section will explain how this works.</p>
<p>Other partitions include some encrypted ones, using the Linux Unified Key System (LUKS), which are the only ones with the write permission, and some other smaller partitions that are not worth mentioning.</p>
<h2><a name="integrity"></a>Data integrity</h2>
<p>As we have seen from a brief analysis of the content of the eMMC dump, SpaceX is using some custom-made mechanisms for data integrity, along with the standard ones already included in ARM TF-A and U-Boot. Here is an overview of the custom-made components.</p>
<h3>ECC</h3>
<p>The Error Correcting code mechanism is only used in the FIT image and only provides data integrity, without considering authenticity. This means that, in theory, you can tamper with some ECC-protected components of the dish if you provide correctly formatted data using your own implementation of the <code>ecc</code> procedure (or using the binary found in the ramdisk). But for the FIT image, this is not possible because authenticity is also checked by the last bootloader stage.
So this is just used to prevent errors in the eMMC storage.</p>
<p>This works similarly to its original ancestor, the ECC RAM, which embeds some additional data in between the actual content of the memory - originally Hamming codes - that are computed as a function of the data they are "protecting".
Then, when some data is accessed, Hamming codes are recomputed and if they do not correspond to the ones saved in memory, an error occurred, and depending on how many bits have been mistakenly flipped, the error can be corrected.
This version of ECC uses Reed-Solomon error correction (instead of Hamming codes) and a final hash (i.e. MD5) to check the integrity of the whole file that is being decoded.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/starlink-tools/tree/main/unecc">Here</a> you can find a simple Python script that strips out ECC information from a file, without checking the correctness of the data, that we used to be able to unpack the FIT image. Inside the ramdisk, there is a binary (<code>unecc</code>) that does the same thing also checking and trying to correct possible errors.</p>
<center>
    <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/ecc.png">
        <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/ecc.png" width="100%">
    </a>
</center>
<p>The content of ECC-protected files is organized into blocks of different types, the above figure shows how each block is structured.
The file starts with a header block (a), which contains the magic number and the version of the protocol, along with some data and the corresponding control codes.
Then, there can be zero or more data blocks (b) containing just data and control codes.
A last data block (c), which is recognized by its block type field (<code>$</code>, instead of <code>*</code>), marks the end of the payload, some padding is added here if needed.
Finally, the footer block (d) contains the size of the payload (needed to know the number of padding bytes), an MD5 checksum of the whole payload and, of course, ECC code words for the footer block itself.</p>
<h3>sxverity</h3>
<p><code>sxverity</code> is a custom wrapper for the device-mapper-verity (dm-verity) kernel feature, which provides transparent integrity checking of block devices.
The source code of the tool is not publicly available, thus we had to reverse the compiled binary to understand the internals.
This provides both data integrity and authenticity thanks to a signature check that verifies the whole content of the device.
<code>sxverity</code> internally uses the dm-verity kernel feature, by directly interacting with it through the <code>/dev/mapper/control</code> device.</p>
<p>SpaceX only tackled the verification of the root hash, everything underneath, which is handled by the kernel, has not been reimplemented, a nice explanation of how this works can be found <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/verifiedboot/dm-verity">here</a>.</p>
<p>As we have seen in previous sections, <code>sxverity</code> is used to verify some of the partitions that reside in the persistent memory, this is to prevent persistent exploits.
But as we'll see in the next sections, it is also used to verify software updates for the dish. Thus, it is a critical component for the overall security of the device.</p>
<center>
    <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/sxverity-header.png">
        <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/sxverity-header.png" width="40%">
    </a>
</center>
<p>In the picture above you can see the structure of a <code>sxverity</code> image.
It is composed of a header, that is repeated 4 times, possibly signed with different public keys, which contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>The magic bytes <code>"sxverity"</code>.</li>
<li>The version and some flags indicating which algorithms have been used for signing and hashing.</li>
<li>The root hash, which indirectly covers the whole payload (through the hash tree).</li>
<li>The public key that has been used to sign the image.</li>
<li>The signature of all the fields above, using an elliptic curve (ED25519).</li>
</ul>
<p>The parsing and verification procedure performed by this process will be described in the <a href="#fuzzing">Fuzzing</a> section.</p>
<h2>Runtime overview</h2>
<p>In this section, we will discuss what happens after the bootloader chain, starting from the Linux's init script to the processes that handle the runtime of the User Terminal.</p>
<p>The <code>init</code> script is the first process started by the kernel and usually has a process identifier (PID) equal to 1.
Its main task is to start all the other runtime processes needed for the system to be useful, and remains running until the system is shut down. It will be the "oldest" ancestor of any other process and it is also used by the user to start, stop and configure daemons once the system is up and running.
The most common init script you can find in an end-user Linux distribution is <code>systemd</code>, which is a collection of tools to manage the whole runtime of the system (e.g. <code>systemctl</code>), among which there is also the <code>init</code> script.</p>
<p>SpaceX's people like to implement their own software, so they implemented their own init script, which can be found in the ramdisk, at <code>/usr/sbin/sxruntime_start</code>. This uses a custom formatted configuration file that contains the instructions of which processes to start, how to start them and in which order.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#######################################</span>
<span># user terminal frontend</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Wait until dish config partition is set up before launching.</span>
<span>#######################################</span>
proc            user_terminal_frontend
apparmor        user_terminal_frontend
start_if        <span>$(</span>cat /proc/device-tree/model<span>)</span> !<span>=</span> <span>'spacex_satellite_starlink_transceiver'</span>
startup_flags   wait_on_barrier
user            sx_packet
custom_param    --log_wrapped
</code></pre></div>

<p>The snippet above shows how a process called <code>user_terminal_frontend</code> is started:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is started only if the condition <code>$(cat /proc/device-tree/model) != 'spacex_satellite_starlink_transceiver'</code> is satisfied.</li>
<li>It is started after the last process marked with the <code>barrier</code> flag has exited.</li>
<li>It is executed as the Linux user <code>sx_packet</code>.</li>
<li>The command line parameter <code>--log_wrapped</code> is passed to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two configuration files that are parsed by the init script can be found at <code>/etc/runtime_init</code> (ramdisk) and <code>/sx/local/runtime/dat/common/runtime</code> (runtime image).
The first one handles system-level services and configurations, such as mounting partitions (e.g. the runtime), and setting up the network, the console and the logger service.
The second one, instead, handles more high-level processes and configurations, such as starting all the processes contained in the runtime image and initializing encrypted devices.</p>
<p>Additionally, the init script also assigns priorities and specific CPU cores to those processes, by following some rules listed in another configuration file, that can be found at <code>/sx/local/runtime/dat/common/runtime_priorities</code>.</p>
<h3>File system &amp; mount points</h3>
<p>First of all, the root filesystem is copied in RAM by the last bootloader (U-Boot, BL33), and is mounted at <code>/</code>.
Partitions of the eMMC can be accessed by the system through the files <code>/dev/blk/mmcblk0pN</code> where <code>mmcblk0</code> is the name of the eMMC and <code>N</code> is the partition index, starting from 1.
For convenience, a script will then create some symbolic links to these partitions to use a more explicit name, as shown below.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># [...]</span>
ln -s /dev/mmcblk0p1 /dev/blk/bootfip0
ln -s /dev/mmcblk0p2 /dev/blk/bootfip1
ln -s /dev/mmcblk0p3 /dev/blk/bootfip2
ln -s /dev/mmcblk0p4 /dev/blk/bootfip3
<span># [...]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since almost every partition is duplicated, another script will then create additional links in the folders <code>/dev/blk/current</code> and <code>/dev/blk/other</code>, the first one containing the partitions that are currently being used by the system and second one containing the other ones, that will be used in case of a software update.
The system knows which partitions have been used for the current boot by looking in <code>/proc/device-tree/chosen/linux_boot_slot</code> which is populated by the bootloader.</p>
<p>Then, the <code>runtime</code> partition is unpacked using <code>sxverity</code> and the content is extracted to <code>/sx/local/runtime</code>.
This partition contains two folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bin</code> contains binaries and executable scripts.</li>
<li><code>dat</code> contains a lot of additional data like AppArmor rules, hardware-specific configurations and generic configuration files, such as <code>dat/common/runtime</code> which is the (second) configuration file used by the init script.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these operations, the root filesystem is remounted with the <code>ro</code> (read-only) flag.
Additional partitions are then mounted, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/dev/blk/current/version_info</code> on <code>/mnt/version_info</code> (through <code>sxverity</code>).</li>
<li><code>/dev/blk/dish_cfg</code> on <code>/mnt/dish_cfg</code> (through <code>LUKS</code>).</li>
<li><code>/dev/blk/edr</code> on <code>/mnt/edr</code> (through <code>LUKS</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Daemons</h3>
<p>After the elaborate boot procedure and system configuration we finally reach a state in which some processes are running, each one with a unique task, to provide the user with the service the device is built for, i.e. a satellite internet connection.
As you may have guessed, many things happen in the background to ensure a stable enough internet connection such as sending and receiving traffic to and from satellites, choosing which satellite to connect to, changing satellite (without disrupting the Internet connection) when the current one moved too far, handling user requests coming from the mobile application, etc.
Furthermore, these processes need to communicate continuously with each other to synchronize and cooperate, and with Starlink's cloud services for backend functionalities.</p>
<p>Most of the binaries have been implemented in C++ and some of them are also statically linked.
Due to this, it was challenging to reverse-engineer these binaries and due to time constraints, we were unable to fully comprehend all of them.
Some work was done to identify statically linked library functions, using the binary diffing technique.
It is also probable that these programs were implemented using the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/68990784/B31-full">State Machine Design Pattern</a>, which makes heavy use of features of Object Oriented Programming such as multiple inheritance, virtual methods and generic types.
This made the reverse-engineering process even more difficult due to the complex structures that are produced by the compiler when using these features.</p>
<p>We tried to compare the network stack of the User Terminal with the known ISO-OSI stack, and the following could be a proper mapping:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>phyfw</code> (Physical Firmware, perhaps) handles the physical layer of the satellite communication, which includes modulation/demodulation of RF signals.</li>
<li><code>rx_lmac</code> and <code>tx_lmac</code> (rx/tx lower Medium Access Control, perhaps) fall in the data link layer, and handle the physical access to the medium, separately for receiving and transmitting.</li>
<li><code>umac</code> (upper Medium Access Control, perhaps), could represent the network layer. It handles the access to the medium, at a higher level, and coordinates between the transmission and reception of frames. It may also be in charge of choosing which satellite to connect to.</li>
<li><code>connection_manager</code> could represent the transport layer and, if it's the case, it handles stateful connections between the dish and satellites, in which the traffic will be exchanged.</li>
<li><code>ut_packet_pipeline</code> is probably used to create an encrypted tunnel in which user traffic will be exchanged using the secure element on the dish for handshakes. This could be associated with the known protocols such as TLS, DTLS, IPsec or, again, a custom one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than these network-related processes there also are some processes that handle system telemetry, software updates, system health status and outage detection/reporting and finally a "control" process that acts as an orchestrator for all the other processes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one of the binaries, namely <code>user_terminal_frontend</code>, is implemented in Go, an open-source (compiled) programming language from Google.
Go binaries are statically linked and they include the go runtime, so they are pretty big, but luckily they also include symbols that are used by the runtime for comprehensive runtime error reporting, which includes function names, source code line numbers and data structures.
All this precious information can be recovered using a plugin for Ghidra called <a href="https://github.com/mooncat-greenpy/Ghidra_GolangAnalyzerExtension">GolangAnalyzer</a> which was quite effective.
The extension also recovers complex data types and creates the corresponding C-like structures in Ghidra, which is extremely useful when working with an OOP language.
Additional manual analysis is needed because of the custom calling convention used by Go, but after this, the resulting disassembled C code is easily readable.
Our primary focus was on the runtime's higher-level components, which include this process.</p>

<p>To summarize this section, in the picture above you can see a sketch of the architecture of the runtime (not complete), in which you can see that processes at the bottom, "closer" to the hardware, are statically linked, probably for performance reasons, and communicate only with the control process, while the other ones also communicate with Starlink's cloud services, through gRPC.
In section <a href="#communications">Communications</a>, we will tackle all the communications shown by this picture in more detail.
And finally, there is the go binary (which is technically statically linked as well, but just because of the language constraint), which communicates with frontend applications used by the user.</p>
<h2>Runtime emulation</h2>
<p>Due to the negative results of our Fault injection attack, we didn't have access to a live device on which to check our findings or perform some dynamic analysis.
Thus, we tried to set up an emulated environment, as similar as possible to the real device, that would be capable of executing runtime binaries.
We are emulating the entire system (full-system emulation), starting from the kernel, using QEMU as an emulator engine.
In the following paragraphs we describe every challenge we had to deal with, including the ones we couldn't solve, while setting up the environment and the final result.</p>
<p>The first choice to be made is which hardware we want QEMU to emulate.
When you want to emulate an IoT device using QEMU you usually look for the hardware implementation of the particular device for QEMU, which is usually available for common, off-the-shelf devices such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and less-known boards as well.
The hardware implementation of our device was, of course, not available, so we used the <code>(aarch64) virt</code> machine, which is the most generic one.
The proper way to emulate the whole device would have been to construct this machine specification for QEMU, as well as implement emulators for every piece of hardware that is present on the board.
The problem is that most of the peripherals present on the device are not open hardware, and even if they were, implementing all of them in QEMU would have been a lot of work.
Instead, using the <code>virt</code> machine and tweaking the Device Tree is much easier, at the cost of not having most of the hardware peripherals and thus some limitations.</p>
<p>Another problem was the choice of the kernel to run in QEMU.
We tried with the original one, extracted from the FIT of the firmware, but that didn't work in the emulated environment. So we decided to compile one ourselves.
Unfortunately, the open-source version of Linux published by SpaceX is 5.10.90, while the one found on the dish was 5.15.55, so we used the mainstream Linux kernel.
A lot of tweaks in the compile-time configuration had to be made for it to boot, some of them required by QEMU and some of them required by Starlink's software.
It is possible to extract this configuration from a compiled Kernel image, using the script <code>extract-ikconfig</code> from the Linux kernel repository, which was used to find differences between the default one and the one configured by SpaceX.</p>
<p>The device tree not only contains information about hardware peripherals but also data that is used by the runtime, such as public keys used by <code>sxverity</code>.
Additionally, the U-Boot bootloader also populates the FDT before booting the Linux kernel, by adding, for example, which set of partitions have been used in the current boot, the name of the main network interface and more.
All this information is of course not included in the FDT set by QEMU for the <code>virt</code> machine, thus we extracted this FDT, using the <code>dumpdtb</code> flag, and added the missing information, as shown below, which can then be recompiled using the Device Tree compiler (<code>dtc</code>) and given to QEMU using the <code>-dtb</code> flag.</p>

<p>As the root filesystem, we used the one we extracted from the dish, with some modifications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since we want to have access to the emulated dish, it must think it is a development version so that password access is enabled, thus we patched the <code>is_production_hardware</code> script. This could have been done in multiple ways, such as directly editing the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file, or adding our public key to the SSH's <code>authorized_users</code> files, but what we did is more effective because emulating development hardware will also enable other debugging features.</li>
<li>We also included the extracted runtime where it would have been mounted and removed the integrity verification and mounting step from the <code>/etc/runtime_init</code> file to be able to also tamper with the contents of that partition.</li>
<li>In the <code>/etc/runtime_init</code> file we also added some custom steps, for example, one that sets up our emulated network, and one that mounts read-write partitions as emulated volumes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional patches will be needed for other programs to start in the emulated environment.
We have also included some additional software that will be used for testing purposes such as <code>gdbserver</code>. But for these programs to be able to run, we either had to cross-compile them using the same build toolchain, or cross-compile them statically.</p>
<p>Even though both the root filesystem and the runtime are already placed in memory when the Linux kernel boots, a lot of processes directly access some partitions of the eMMC.
So we've also instructed QEMU to create a raw virtual block device, containing the original image dumped from the physical board.
However, since it is not seen by the kernel as an eMMC chip, the assigned name is different from the one assigned by the physical device.
Because of this, we had to change every reference to <code>mmcblk0</code> to <code>vda</code>, which is the name assigned by the kernel in the emulator.
Fortunately, as we saw in the previous section, the device only uses the name of the device in a script that creates some symbolic links to every partition, so we just had to patch that script and the command line argument for the kernel.
Partitions that are mounted with write permission, are instead mapped to a folder on the host so that it is possible to inspect their content afterward.</p>
<p>As for the network, it is not necessary to replicate the exact network configuration of the dish (as it is not very clear to us), we just need to have the right interface names and internet access.
This was done by using a tap interface, bridged to the host which acts as a NAT gateway, as shown in the following scripts.</p>
<p>Host:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

ifconfig <span>$1</span> <span>0</span>.0.0.0 promisc up
brctl addbr virbr0
brctl addif virbr0 <span>$1</span>

ip link <span>set</span> dev virbr0 up

ip addr add <span>192</span>.168.100.2/24 dev virbr0
<span>echo</span> <span>1</span> &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlp0s20f3 -j MASQUERADE
</code></pre></div>

<p>Guest:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

ip link <span>set</span> dev eth0 name eth_user
ip link <span>set</span> dev eth_user up
ip addr add <span>192</span>.168.100.1/24 dev eth_user

route add -net <span>0</span>.0.0.0 netmask <span>0</span>.0.0.0 gw <span>192</span>.168.100.2 dev eth_user
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Emulation Results</h3>
<p>As explained in previous sections, most of the hardware is not present in the emulated environment, so every component that tries to use it will fail.
Lower-level processes, such as <code>phyfw</code> and <code>[rx/tx]_lmac</code>, whose main task is to interact with Starlink's hardware won't work in this environment.
But also other binaries require some hardware to be present, the most common one is the secure element, which is used in most of the cryptographic exchanges.
So for those binaries to work we patched every instruction that would make the program crash, but if the hardware is required for substantial parts of the process, this solution is pointless.
In the end, we managed to emulate, among the main processes discussed in the Daemons subsection, only <code>user_terminal_frontend</code>, <code>starlink_software_update</code>, <code>umac</code> and the ones related to telemetry, along with smaller processes.
Further work on this topic could incrementally add support for some peripherals of the board, hence being able to emulate more and more processes.
Here you can see the console output of the final phase of the boot process in the emulated environment.</p>

<p>All the scripts and files presented above are available <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/starlink-tools/tree/main/emulator">here</a>, but we won't publish the whole UT's firmware, so you'll still have to extract it yourself to run the emulator.</p>
<h2><a name="communications"></a>Communications</h2>
<p>In IoT devices, communication with other devices is often a crucial function, if not the main one.
This is also the case for our device, which is basically an internet gateway and, as you can imagine, in this case, communication between the device and the satellites is the main function of the User Terminal.
We briefly analyzed the physical layer of this communication, but we didn't focus on it.
On a higher layer, the communication with satellites is split into two "planes":</p>
<ul>
<li>The Data Plane, which contains user traffic to and from the Internet.</li>
<li>The Control Plane, which contains every other kind of traffic, such as control messages between the antenna and the satellite (e.g. Connection handshake).</li>
</ul>
<p>But these are not the only communications happening in the device, in the following sections we will also see how the device interacts with user front-end applications and also how the different components inside the device communicate with each other.</p>
<h3>Front-end applications</h3>
<p>The communication with front-end applications is handled by the process <code>user_terminal_frontend</code>, which we were able to both run in the emulated environment and reverse-engineer, thanks to the language it has been implemented in (Go).
From the front-end applications, the user can see some statistics of the device and can change some high-level settings such as Wi-Fi credentials, reboot or stow the dish, etc.
These interactions use gRPC (Google's Remote Procedure Calls), which in turn uses <code>protobuf</code> underneath.
Protobuf definitions can be gathered either by extracting them from the binary (using <code>pbtk</code>) or by asking the reflection server of the process itself (using <code>grpcurl</code>, for example).
<a href="https://github.com/sparky8512/starlink-grpc-tools">Some</a> <a href="https://github.com/starlink-community/starlink-cli">tools</a> have been implemented as alternative front-end applications that use this protocol.
The aforementioned applications, implemented in Python, use the gRPC APIs exposed by the frontend binary, providing the user with an alternative user interface to inspect the statistics of the dish.
The authors of these applications probably gathered the protocol definitions from the mobile application or by using the reflection server.</p>
<p>In the following code snippet, you can see the (partial) definition of the <code>Request</code> message, which contains a few ids and one specific request, among the ones listed.
Every inner request has its definition, with the parameters the server needs to process the request, and a corresponding response that will hold the result.</p>

<p>There are two ways to communicate with this gRPC, either by using an insecure channel or by using a secure channel, which involves TLS and mutual authentication using certificates stored in the secure element.
The mobile application and the web interface both use the insecure channel, so the encrypted one must be used by something else.</p>
<p>Among the requests that can be made to the server, many of them are meant for front-end applications, a few examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>FactoryResetRequest</code>, which requests a factory reset of the dish.</li>
<li><code>GetDeviceInfoRequest</code>, which returns some information about the device.</li>
<li><code>GetStatusRequest</code>, which requests the status of the dish.</li>
<li><code>RebootRequest</code>, which asks the dish to reboot.</li>
</ul>
<p>But some requests do not look like they are used by those applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SetTrustedKeysRequest</code>, which supposedly sets the provided public keys for future use by the process or by the SSH agent.</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>message</span><span> </span><span>SetTrustedKeysRequest</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>repeated</span><span> </span><span>PublicKey</span><span> </span><span>keys</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li><code>GetHeapDumpRequest</code>, which supposedly returns a dump of the Heap section of the process.</li>
<li><code>SoftwareUpdateRequest</code>, which supposedly initiates a software update with the provided update bundle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, most of these requests are not implemented in the binary we were analyzing (e.g. <code>SetTrustedKeysRequest</code>, <code>GetHeapDumpRequest</code>), and some of them require authentication (e.g. <code>DishGetContextRequest</code>, <code>DishGetEmcRequest</code>) both on the transport layer (secure gRPC channel) and application layer (by using the <code>AuthenticateRequest</code>).
We are not entirely sure who is supposed to use these requests and why most of them are not implemented in the binary, they could be used by another Stalink product such as the Wi-Fi router, or by Starlink support in the case of a partially bricked device, for remote assistance.
The most interesting request that is both implemented and does not require authentication is the <code>SoftwareUpdateRequest</code>, which will be explained better in Section <a href="#fuzzing">Fuzzing</a>.</p>
<p>Further work on this topic would be to analyze further every request handler for bugs or, better to fuzz them since there exist effective mutators for the protobuf protocol, such as <code>libprotobuf-mutator</code>.</p>
<h3>Inter-Process Communication</h3>
<p>Every process running in the runtime continuously shares information with other processes, to collaborate and share statistics.
As you can see from the figure showing the runtime architecture, every process only communicates with the User Terminal Control, which acts as an orchestrator for the whole runtime.
The protocol they are using is designed by SpaceX and it's called <code>Slate Sharing</code>.</p>
<p>It uses UDP for transport, and every process starts listening on a different port, on the loopback interface and will receive messages from the control process on that port.
On the other hand, the control process starts listening on multiple ports, one for every process that needs to communicate with it, so that the communication is bidirectional and without conflicts between processes.
Port numbers are configured through a configuration file that can be found at <code>/sx/local/runtime/common/service_directory</code>, in the following snippet, you can see a part of it, which lists the port numbers for communications between software update and control, and between frontend and control.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>################################################################################</span>
<span># Software update</span>
software_update_to_control                localhost   <span>27012</span>       udp_proto
control_to_software_update                localhost   <span>27013</span>       udp_proto

<span>################################################################################</span>
<span># Frontend</span>
control_to_frontend                       localhost   <span>6500</span>        udp_proto
frontend_to_control                       localhost   <span>6501</span>        udp_proto
</code></pre></div>

<p>Every couple of processes exchange different kinds of data, and messages do not contain any information about the content nor the structure of the data they transport, unlike other protocols such as JSON or XML.
Thus, to understand the content of messages we had to reverse engineer one of the binaries that makes use of the protocol, and in our case, the best choice was once again the user terminal frontend, which is the one implemented in Go.</p>
<p>Data is exchanged in binary form, by sending raw packed (no padding) C structures, in big-endian.
Every message contains a header, holding some information about the message, and a body, containing the actual data to be shared.
In the following snippet, you can see the data structure representing the message header, from the GolangAnalyzer Ghidra plugin.
With the same technique, we also extracted the structure of the body of messages between the frontend process and control.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>**************************************************************
* Name: sx_slate.SlateHeader                                 *
* Struct:                                                    *
*   +   0x0    0x4 uint BwpType                              *
*   +   0x4    0x4 uint Crc                                  *
*   +   0x8    0x8 longlong Seq                              *
*   +  0x10    0x4 uint Frame                                *
**************************************************************    
</code></pre></div>

<p>The header contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>BwpType</code>, which is a fixed value, acts as a "magic number" for the protocol (<code>00 00 01 20</code>).</li>
<li><code>Crc</code>, whose name suggests it is a Cyclic Redundancy Check, so a sort of error-detecting code for the message body, but by reverse engineering and sniffing messages, this field seems to be fixed as well, but it is different for every couple of messages.</li>
<li><code>Seq</code>, which is a sequence number that is incremented every message, but the protocol does not include any acknowledgment mechanisms to resend lost messages.</li>
<li><code>Frame</code>, which is used in case of fragmentation, i.e. when the message is bigger than the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), which is usually set to 1500 bytes. In this case, the body of the message is split into multiple frames, each one having an identical header, apart from the <code>Frame</code> field, which is incremented each frame, starting from 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>The body of the message is encoded in the same way, as an example, in the following snippet, you can see part of the structure of messages sent by the frontend process to control.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>**************************************************************
* Name: slate.FrontendToControl                              *

<p>Thanks to this information we would already be able to implement a message decoder (which we did), but this would only work for the communication between the frontend process and control. To decode other communications we would need to manually reverse engineer every other binary to find out the structure of messages, perhaps without even finding field names, but as explained in previous sections, it was hard to get useful information from C++ binaries.
Here you can see how we parse the header of Slate messages in Python, using the <code>ctypes</code> package.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>SlateHeader</span><span>(</span><span>BigEndianStructure</span><span>):</span>
    <span>_pack_</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>_fields_</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>(</span><span>'BwpType'</span><span>,</span> <span>c_uint32</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span><span>'Crc'</span><span>,</span> <span>c_uint32</span><span>),</span>

        <span>(</span><span>'Frame'</span><span>,</span> <span>c_uint32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, to understand how the protocol is handled in C++ binaries, we looked for some fields of the structures we knew (the ones of the frontend process) in the control process, which should have them in order to decode those incoming messages.
We couldn't find them in the binary, but we found something way better, in the folder <code>/sx/local/runtime/common</code> there is a set of configuration files, such as <code>frontend_to_control</code>, which contain the structure of every message exchanged by processes.
Here is a snippet containing part of the aforementioned configuration file.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code># Slate share message from gRPC frontend process to main control process.
app_reboot                          bool
tilt_to_stowed                      bool
start_dish_cable_test_requests      uint32
if_loopback_test.enabled            bool
now                                 int64
starlink_wifi_last_connected        int64
# [...]
</code></pre></div>

<p>With this, it is much easier to implement a more generic decoder that parses these protocol definitions and decodes messages accordingly.
Such a tool has been developed and will be discussed in the next section.</p>
<h3>Slate sniffer &amp; injector</h3>
<p>Slate messages are sent very fast, thus it is hard to understand what is happening without a proper visualization tool.
That is why we've implemented the <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/starlink-tools/tree/main/slate-sniffer">Slate sniffer</a>, a tool that sniffs UDP packets on the loopback interface and decodes them on the fly, highlighting differences between consecutive messages.
In the following figure, you can see the overall architecture of the new tool, which we'll describe in more detail.
This tool was implemented for the emulated environment but we designed it keeping in mind that it would need to work also on the real dish.
For this reason, most of the work is done in the Sniffer, which is not in the device, and all the communications between the sniffer and the dish happen through SSH.</p>
<center>
    <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/slate-sniffer.png">
        <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/slate-sniffer.png" width="80%">
    </a>
</center>
<p>The first component that is used when starting the sniffer, is the protocol definition parser, which will parse configuration files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>service_directory</code> to know which "services" (i.e. message definitions) are available and on which UDP ports they will communicate.</li>
<li><code>[P1]_to_[P2]</code> for every available couple of processes <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code>, to know the format of messages that will be exchanged.</li>
</ul>
<p>This component will create <code>SlateMessageParser</code> objects, that will later be used to decode messages.
The decoding is made using the <code>struct</code> python package.</p>
<p>After this, <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/"><code>TCPdump</code></a> will be launched on the dish, through SSH, and will listen on the loopback interface, only capturing UDP packets that have as the destination port one of the ones found by the parser.
The output of <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/"><code>TCPdump</code></a> is piped to <a href="https://scapy.net/"><code>Scapy</code></a> which will decode the packet, understand which service it comes from, by reading the destination port, and will then extract the UDP payload and pass it to the message decoder.
When a message is parsed correctly, it will be stored in the Storage component, which in this case is a simple in-memory database, only holding recent messages (configurable, based on available memory).
On top of all this, there is a Flask server, exposing some APIs, to know which services are available, to know the schema of a message and, of course, to fetch messages.
We also implemented a front end, as a simple web interface, which is shown in the following picture.
From the current front end, it is possible to see messages in real-time, spotting differences thanks to the highlighted changes, selecting which fields to show and filtering or ordering them.
The frontend module is easily replaceable thanks to the exposed APIs, thus more complex interfaces can be integrated into the sniffer, to inspect the acquired data in more ways.</p>

    </a>
</center>
<p>After having a way to see messages, we thought it would be interesting to be able to inject custom messages, by editing the ones we are receiving or by creating new ones from scratch.
For this reason, we implemented the Slate injector, which shares most of the codebase with the sniffer.
The architecture of this tool is shown below.
Messages, to be received by processes, need to come from the loopback interface, thus we cannot send them directly from the Injector (which is external to the device).
This is why the injector will start a <code>socat</code> server on the dish, which will listen for UDP messages on the "external" network interface, and will then forward them to the right UDP port, by changing the source address to localhost.
Some API endpoints have been implemented to be able to inject messages from the front end and the current interface lets you edit and send a message or create a new one.</p>

    </a>
</center>
<p>Being able to inspect messages between processes helped us a lot in understanding what each process does without being able to fully reverse-engineer them.
Additionally, having the protocol definition and an easy way to inject messages, a natural development of the project is to fuzz the protocol, which will be tackled in Section <a href="#fuzzing">fuzzing</a>.
The full code of the Slate sniffer, injector and fuzzer can be found <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/starlink-tools/tree/main/slate-sniffer">here</a>, but again without the protocol definitions, which you'll have to extract from the dish.</p>
<h2><a name="fuzzing"></a>Fuzzing</h2>
<p>In the last part of my internship at Quarkslab, we identified which parts of the software had been analyzed enough to be suitable for fuzz testing.
To find a good fuzzable target, we had to take into account multiple aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The possible attack vector in the case a bug was found:<ul>
<li>Can the bug be triggered by an authenticated user?</li>
<li>Does the attacker need to be connected to the Wi-Fi network of the dish?</li>
<li>Can the bug be triggered directly from the Internet?</li>
<li>Does the attacker need to already have access to the dish? In this case, the bug could be used for lateral movement inside the dish or privilege escalation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the impact of a possible bug in the target?</li>
<li>How easily fuzzable is the target, and which kind of fuzzing is the most suitable for the target:<ul>
<li>How is the input provided?</li>
<li>Can the target program run isolated? If a program makes use of many hardware peripherals and/or interacts with other components of the runtime, it will be hard to fuzz it in an isolated environment.</li>
<li>How deeply have we analyzed the target to know its internal workings?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>sxverity</h3>
<p>As we saw in the communication section,  it is possible to trigger a software update by sending a <code>SoftwareUpdateRequest</code> to the frontend process from the internal network.
This is an interesting request because it is the only one that does not look like it is meant for the user and does not require authentication.
Furthermore, the input of this request is the update bundle, which can be very big, while inputs for other requests are often empty or very simple.
The update bundle has to be split in chunks before being sent to the dish, here is a python script that sends this message.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>CHUNK_SIZE</span> <span>=</span> <span>16384</span>

            <span>)</span>
        <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Every message needs to have the same <code>stream_id</code>, which can be randomly generated, then the first message has the <code>open</code> flag, while the last one has the <code>close</code> flag and all the ones in between don't have any of them.
The receiver of the message is the frontend process, which will save the update bundle in a temporary folder, without reading the content of it, so without performing any kind of input sanitization, it will just check that the size of the bundle does not reach a hardcoded threshold.
After that, the frontend process will notify the control process that a sideload update is ready to be applied, through a Slate message, and the control process will do the same for the software update process.
Once the latter receives the message, the update is ready to be started, the figure below shows the overall flow of messages and actions the <code>SoftwareUpdateRequest</code> triggers.</p>
<center>
    <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/sideload.png">
        <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/sideload.png" width="60%">
    </a>
</center>
<p>After the software update process is notified that a software update bundle is ready to be applied, the update procedure starts.
From this moment, there is no difference between this kind of software update and the standard one, which is downloading the update bundle from Starlink's backend.
The update bundle is a <code>sxverity</code> image, which will be verified by the program with the same name and the inner <code>rom1fs</code> filesystem will be mounted.
Once mounted, the software update process will look for partition images in the mount point.
Every partition image will also have a SHA512 hashsum for additional integrity verification.
Finally, each available partition image will be flashed on the corresponding <code>/dev/blk/other/*</code> eMMC logical partition.</p>
<p>The update bundle is not accessed directly by the software update process, so the first process actually reading the content of the provided input is <code>sxverity</code>. Thus any fuzz test can be performed directly on that binary, skipping all previous steps.
In the following figure, you can see how the verification process is performed by <code>sxverity</code>.
The fuzzable code is very limited because the signature verification is made by a library, which is out of scope, and anything happening after a successful signature verification is to be considered unreachable for us because if we can reach that state, it means we were able to craft an update package that would be flashed so we don't need to find other bugs there.</p>
<center>
    <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/sxverity.png">
        <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2023-08-16_starlink/sxverity.png" width="80%">
    </a>
</center>
<p>The only part of the input that will be parsed by the code under test is the header of the image, thus that will be the only part of the input that the fuzzer will mutate.
Since that part of the program can be executed completely in complete isolation, we've fuzzed it inside <a href="https://www.unicorn-engine.org/"><code>unicorn</code></a>, a lightweight CPU emulator that can be instructed from Python, by using its bindings.
The first step was being able to emulate the code we want to test and setting up the harness for our fuzzer, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loading the binary.</li>
<li>Identifying a good starting point in the code, in which it is easy to set up the whole environment, such as placing the input in the right memory location and setting up every other memory structure that will be used by the code under testing.
  As an example, the following snippet shows how the input is placed in memory and how registers holding the addresses to the input locations are set.</li>

<ul>
<li>Identifying an ending point, which has to be a point in the program in which we stop the emulation because the run was successful (no bugs).</li>
</ul>
<p>The nicest thing about using Unicorn, other than being pretty easy to configure and instruct, is the flawless support with <a href="https://aflplus.plus/"><strong>AFL++</strong></a> (American Fuzzy Lop plus plus) which we used as fuzzer.
AFL++ working with Unicorn can detect crashes and most importantly, gather coverage information, in a transparent manner, so that it can perform coverage-guided mutations and setting up the fuzzer with Unicorn is pretty straightforward.
The fuzzer also needs some initial test cases, called seeds, for that we've used some valid headers, taken from sxverity images found in the dish, and some randomly generated headers.</p>
<p>The fuzzer ran for around 24 hours, performing more than one million executions, but unfortunately, no crash was recorded.
This was expected since the tested codebase was very limited and the structure of the input was very simple, not having complex data structures or variable length fields, the most common memory-related bugs are avoided.</p>
<h3>Slate messages</h3>
<p>The other component we tested with fuzzing was Inter-Process Communication (IPC) - which was deeply analyzed in the previous section - since we already had developed a set of tools to analyze and tamper with this communication.
In this case, we are not going to fuzz a single binary, but rather the whole set of processes that form the runtime of the device, since every one of them is using Slate messages to communicate.
The fuzzing approach was completely different from the one we used for sxverity, which was gray-box fuzzing, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The codebase we are trying to test is enormous.</li>
<li>We weren't able to exactly identify the code that handles slate messages in every binary and, more importantly, bugs can be also found outside this code, because of some inconsistencies in the program state caused by wrongly interpreted inputs.</li>
<li>Binaries need to run in a dish-like environment because they continuously interact with other components of the system, most of them don't even run in our emulated environment.</li>
<li>Also recording coverage would have been challenging, because for that we need to instrument the binaries since we don't have the source code to recompile them, and the fuzzer would need to be run on the dish.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the above reasons, we used black-box fuzzing, without coverage-guided mutations, which is usually called "dumb" fuzzing.
<a href="https://github.com/jtpereyda/boofuzz">Boofuzz</a> was used as fuzzer, it is a simple and easy-to-use fuzzer specifically designed for network protocols, which was a perfect fit for what we were looking for.
Boofuzz does not generate input in a completely random way because you are giving it the protocol definition to be used in the communication, with the possibility of defining sequences of messages using a finite state machine.
In our case, every message was disconnected from the others (apart from the sequence number), so defining the format of messages was enough.
The fuzzer will then mutate every field of the message, by trying some values that could trigger a bug, e.g. for an <code>int32</code> the fuzzer will try values such as <code>{0, 1, -1, INT_MAX, -INT_MAX, ...}</code>.
As an example, here is how some fields of Slate messages are "translated" to Boofuzz protocol definition.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>if</span> <span>param</span><span>.</span><span>dtype</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>==</span> <span>"BOOL"</span><span>:</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Every data type used in the Slate message protocol could be encoded using Boofuzz's standard types, apart from the Sequence number, which needs to store an internal state to increment itself every iteration, you can see its implementation in the following snippet.
Static fields such as the <code>Bwptype</code> and <code>Crc</code> can be encoded using the <code>Static</code> type from Boofuzz.</p>

<p>Once the message structure has been defined, the fuzzer can use the code from the Slate injector to send the messages.
The only component that needs to be implemented at this point is something that can detect if a program has crashed after a message was sent.
At first, we were issuing the <code>pgrep</code> command through SSH, but this was adding an overhead that was slowing the fuzzer.
So we've implemented a simple script that runs on the dish, opening a TCP socket and waiting for a connection which will then be used to directly communicate with the fuzzer.
The part of the process monitor that will run on the client (fuzzer machine) can be integrated into the fuzzer, by inheriting Boofuzz's <code>BaseMonitor</code> and implementing its methods, such as <code>alive</code> (check if the target process is still alive) and <code>restart_target</code> (restart the target process).
The resulting architecture is shown in the following figure.</p>

<p>Some crashes were found by fuzzing the <code>control_to_frontend</code> protocol but none of them appeared to be exploitable in ways other than simply crashing the program, causing a Denial of Service for the frontend applications.
This is because the frontend process is a Go binary and the Go runtime makes the process crash (through the <code>panic</code> function) because it detects that something fishy is going on.</p>
<p>As an example, the following are the details of one of these crashes.
In the following snippet, you can see part of the stack trace produced by the Go runtime upon the crash, from which you can understand that the crash is caused by the function <code>UpdateObstructionMap</code>, which tries to allocate too much memory.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>fatal</span><span> </span><span>error</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>runtime</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>out</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>memory</span><span></span>

<span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>By inspecting further this function, we understood how the obstruction map is transferred to the frontend process.
First of all, the obstruction map is a 3D map of the sky above the antenna, indicating whether the antenna has a clear view of the sky or is obstructed by an obstacle such as a tree or other buildings, that the user can see from the frontend applications.
This map is not produced by the frontend process, thus it has to be sent to it through Slate messages.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>obstruction_map.config.num_rows                                                 uint32
obstruction_map.config.num_cols                                                 uint32
obstruction_map.current.obstructed                                              bool
obstruction_map.current.index                                                   uint32
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the snippet above you can see part of the message structure definition that carries information about the obstruction map.
The obstruction map is represented in memory as a matrix, in which each point can be obstructed or not.
The control process sends this information by sending one Slate message for each point in the matrix, by setting the right <code>index</code> and setting <code>obstructed</code> to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
The size of the matrix is not fixed, and its dimensions can be set by the control process by using the <code>num_rows</code> and <code>num_cols</code> fields in the message.
This is where the bug resides, in fact when sending big values in these two fields, the program tries to allocate enough memory for the matrix and panics for this reason.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>len</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ObstructionMapConfigNumCols</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>ObstructionMapConfigNumRows</span><span>;</span><span></span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The snippet above shows the decompiled and annotated code of the frontend binary which handles the size of the obstruction upon the reception of a slate message.
Line 1 computes the size of the matrix and line 2 compares it with the current size of the matrix the program has in memory, if the two differ then the dimensions are updated in the internal memory structure on Lines 4 and 5, and then the new matrix is allocated using the <code>makeslice</code> method of the Go runtime on Line 6.
As you can see, no checks are performed on the size to be allocated, nor on the result of the multiplication between the two given dimensions.
This would be very dangerous in C, but the Go runtime handles all the corner cases automatically, by checking that the size of the asked memory is positive and not too big.
The Go runtime also checks every array access, otherwise, an arbitrary write would probably be possible by playing with the index and the size of the matrix.</p>
<p>Note that this bug can only be triggered by sending crafted UDP packets to a service bound to localhost only.
Therefore it is not possible to trigger it from an external network.
Additionally, the <code>iptables</code> configuration of the UT filters out incoming UDP packets, so spoofing packets with a localhost source IP would not work either.
Therefore we did not consider this a vulnerability but merely a bug.</p>
<p>After we implemented the fuzzer and used it in the emulator, we were provided a rooted UT by Starlink, then we confirmed the presence of the aforementioned bug on a real device and fuzzed some more processes that weren't working in the emulator.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You can find more details in my master's thesis which will be published at the end of this year, stay tuned!
The presented tools and script can be found in <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/starlink-tools/">this repo</a>.</p>
<p>This work and the tools we have published are meant to be reused for further research on Starlink's User Terminal.
Unfortunately, due to some technical issues and time constraints, we did not manage to fully inspect the network stack and protocols used in the satellite communications, but hopefully, this knowledge base of the higher-level management function of the runtime can be used in the future to assist in that effort.</p>

<p><span>I</span>am honoured and touched that you are celebrating my centenary year. I appreciate your thoughtfulness and kindness.</p>
<p>I started my academic career with a Master’s degree in mathematics. In the early 1940s, the jobs in the field of mathematics were limited. I then stumbled into statistics by chance. Statistics was a relatively new subject in India then. I was one of the first five students to get a Master’s degree in statistics from Calcutta University. My career in statistics progressed as I got a Ph.D. in statistics from Cambridge University and I continued to work at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta. At the Institute, there was a rich, supportive environment to pursue research and to teach, in addition to my administrative responsibilities. After retirement from the Institute, I worked at several universities in the United States, including the University of Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania State University, which further enriched my experiences.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to have made some fundamental contributions to the field of statistics and to see the impact of my work in furthering research. In my lifetime, I have seen statistics grow into a strong independent field of study based on mathematical, and more recently computational, tools. Its importance has spread across numerous areas such as business, economics, health and medicine, banking, management, physical, natural, and social sciences.</p>
<p>Statistics is the science of learning from data. Today is the age of data revolution. There is therefore, a heightened need for statistics—both in terms of training in statistics to help analyze and interpret the data, and in terms of research to answer new questions arising from the data. The demand for statisticians is growing worldwide. For instance, the US Bureau of Labor lists statistics as one of the fastest growing career fields—and predicts it will grow by 33<span data-display="false">\%</span> between 2016 and 2026.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have our work cut out for us as researchers and as teachers. This is the challenge for all of you.</p>
<p>My best wishes and blessings to all of you—my friends and well-wishers. </p>

<p><span>C</span>alyampudi Radhakrishna Rao or C.R.  Rao wrote an autobiographical account “Statistics as a Last Resort”, highlighting the circumstances and influences that led him to a career in statistics and probability. Spending a lifetime putting this chance to work, he has built an inspiring, and a lasting, legacy.</p>
<h3>Early Life </h3>
<p>C.R.  Rao was born to C.D.  Naidu and A.  Laxmikanthamma on 10 September 1920, in Huvvina Hadagalli, then in the integrated Madras Province but now in the state of Karnataka. His father, C.D.  Naidu, was a reputed Inspector of police, working at the Criminal Investigation Department. When Rao was only five years old, in 1925, he was able to memorize multiplication tables up to 16 by 16, which was needed for monetary transactions during the British rule. This was because of the monetary denomination of the Indian rupee at the time, where 16 Annas made a Rupee, 12 Kanis made an Anna and 4 Dammidies made a Kani. Rao’s father’s job required the family to move from place to place every three years, so Rao completed his education in classes two and three at Gudur, classes four and five in Nuzvid and the first and second forms in Nandigrama, all in the present state of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>After retirement, Rao’s father decided to settle down in Visakhapatnam, a coastal city in Andhra Pradesh. Rao finished his high school and obtained his first college degree B.A. (Hons.), with a first class and first rank, in Visakhapatnam. Though Rao’s early childhood involved frequent relocations, they did not affect him since his parents provided him guidance and an environment conducive to excellence in studies and instilled a work ethic that enabled him to achieve higher goals in his life. Rao said that he inherited his father’s analytical ability and his mother’s zeal and industry. His mother was instrumental in instilling a sense of discipline in him. In his book on <i>Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work</i> (1989), Rao acknowledges her contributions to his life with the dedication: </p>
<p>
For instilling in me the quest for knowledge, I owe to my mother, A.  Laxmikanthamma, who, in my younger days, woke me up every day at four in the morning and lit the oil lamp for me to study in the quiet hours of the morning when the mind is fresh.
 </p>
<p>Rao developed a research interest in mathematics during his course of study as a student in the B.A. (Hons.) degree course, at the age of 17, at the Andhra University. He used to solve problems posed in the journal <i>The Mathematics Student</i> and was happy to see his name mentioned as one who solved a problem in a particular issue. His most inspiring teacher was a Cambridge-trained mathematician, Dr.  Vommi Ramaswami, who was the head of the Department of Mathematics. Rao obtained his  B.A. degree at the age of 19 and wanted to pursue a research career in mathematics. With a first class and first rank in his B.A. (Hons.) degree examination, Rao thought he would qualify for a scholarship for further research in mathematics but did not qualify. He then decided to search for a job and saw an advertisement for a mathematician at an army survey unit in North Africa during the Second World War. He went to Calcutta and appeared for an interview for the job but this too eluded him. However, during his stay in Calcutta, he met Mr.  Subramanian, who was employed in Bombay, but had been sent to Calcutta for training in statistics at an institute called the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). This chance encounter led Rao to join this training program in statistics at ISI, hoping that with this additional qualification, he could get a job. </p>

Rao of the Indian Statistical Institute." width="400" height="660"><figcaption>During his ISI days <span><strong> courtesy </strong> B.L.S.P.  Rao </span></figcaption></figure>
<h3>40 years at the Indian Statistical Institute</h3>
<p>Rao joined the ISI in 1941, at the age of 20, and began independent research and published some of these results. He received his M.A. degree in Statistics from Calcutta University in 1943 with a first class, first rank with his score at graduation still an unbroken record. Rao was given the position of a research scholar at ISI in 1943 and a part-time job in Calcutta University to teach a course in statistics. He continued to carry out his independent research on a variety of topics in combinatorics and parametric estimation.</p>
<p>Then, in 1946, the Department of Anthropology at Cambridge University requested the ISI to send a person to analyze measurements made on human skeletons obtained from Jebel Maya in North Africa by the University Museum of Archeology and Anthropology. The goal of the project was to trace the origin of the people who lived there, using the Mahalanobis <span data-display="false">D^2</span> statistic, which was devised by P.C.  Mahalanobis, the founder of the ISI. At that time, the theory behind the statistical analysis of multiple measurements was not well developed. Rao was sent to Cambridge by Mahalanobis as he had the required expertise to work on this problem. Rao worked in Cambridge for two years (1946–48) as a visiting scholar at the Cambridge University Museum of Archeology and Anthropology and developed new methods of analysis of multiple measurements and used them to analyze the data. The results of his work on the skeletal material were published in the book <i>Ancient Inhabitants of Jebel Maya</i> by Cambridge University Press in 1955. During this period, while working in the museum, Rao registered for a Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Sir Ronald A.  Fisher, a towering figure in mathematical statistics. Rao received his Ph.D. in 1948 for his work on developing new multivariate methodology, called Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), which generalized ANOVA, as well as other other multivariate tests that he developed while analyzing skeletal data. Much later, in 1974, Cambridge University awarded him an Sc.D. degree in 1974 based on a peer review of his publications and he was made an Honorary Life Fellow of King’s College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>After his two-year stay at Cambridge, he returned to ISI in 1948 and was appointed as a professor at the young age of 28. He worked at ISI in various positions—Head of Research and Training School (RTS), Director of RTS, Director of ISI, Jawaharlal Nehru Professor and National Professor—over a period of 40 years and took mandatory retirement at the age of 60. During this time, he published 201 research papers. Upon his retirement, he accepted positions of distinguished professorships in the U.S. which had minimal teaching responsibilities. He took an appointment as University Professor at the University of Pittsburgh for eight years, and as Eberly Chair Professor of Statistics at Pennsylvania State University for 13 years, continuing his research in diverse areas of statistics. He then retired from Penn State at the age of 81 but continued his research as Director of the Center for Multivariate Analysis at Penn State until 2008. Over this close to forty-year period after his retirement, Rao published another 274 papers!</p>
<h3>Development of statistical education and training at ISI and across India</h3>
<p>
For its [ISI’s] educational programs, the institute needs leaders of mathematical thought like Professor Rao, who can uphold and maintain the high place in the world opinion that Indians have already won.<br>
 —Sir Ronald A. Fisher during his speech at ISI Calcutta, 1963.
 </p>
<p>During his appointment at ISI, Rao developed numerous courses in statistics which were later converted into Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at ISI when it was declared as an Institute of National Importance by an act of Parliament in 1959 and empowered to offer courses of study leading to degrees in statistics. In fact, the courses that lead to the B.  Stat and M.  Stat degrees at ISI today were worked out by Rao. He also initiated the Ph.D. program in theoretical statistics and probability, with D.  Basu, who is well-known for his seminal contributions to statistics, being Rao’s first Ph.D. student. Over the course of his career, Rao has been as successful with his mentorship of statisticians as he has been with his own research. Rao guided the research work of over fifty doctoral students, and according to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, Rao has nearly 650 academic descendants.</p>
<p>Aside from the B.  Stat and M.  Stat courses, Rao developed other courses to train statisticians to work in different applied areas. These students and trainees, who were deputed by research, government and industrial organizations to study at ISI, were given, in addition to formal lectures, on-the-job training in the design of experiments, biostatistics, industrial quality control and other areas. Rao established research units in ISI to work on special projects in subjects such as economics, sociology, psychology, genetics, anthropology, geology and related areas. The idea of establishing these applied research units was to enable interactions between statisticians and scientists to promote the application of statistical methods in research in other areas and to develop new statistical methods motivated by real problems. Along with Mahalanobis, Rao also played a significant role in establishing an International Statistical Educational Center (ISEC) at ISI in 1950 for training students and statisticians deputed from developing countries. </p>

<p>During the early years of Rao’s stay at ISI, there was no Ministry for Statistics. But Jawaharlal Nehru, who was the Prime Minister at that time, was greatly interested in the development of statistics for economic planning. Mahalanobis, the founding Director of ISI, was appointed as honorary statistical advisor to the cabinet of the central government in 1949. Nehru visited ISI a number of times at the invitation of Mahalanobis. Rao had the opportunity of discussing with Nehru the national statistical system and training of statisticians to work in state statistical bureaus. Under Mahalanobis’ direction, Rao would help set up state statistical bureaus across India. </p>

<p>Rao was also a member of several government committees for the development of national statistical systems, statistical education and research in India. He served as Chairman of the Committee on Statistics (1962–69), Chairman of the Demographic and Communication for Population control (1968–69), Chairman of the Committee on Mathematics, Atomic Energy Commission, AEC (1969–78), Member of the Committee on Science and Technology, COST (1969–71), and a member of the Justice Sarkar Committee to enquire into the overall functioning of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in India.</p>
<h3>Research during 1945-50 at ISI</h3>
<p>
The 1940s were ungrudgingly  C. R. Rao’s. His 1945 paper, which contains the Cramer-Rao Inequality, Rao-Blackwell Theorem, and the beginning of differential geometry of parameter space will guarantee that, even had he done nothing else-but there was much else.<br>
 —Terry Speed, FRS, <i>Institute of Mathematical Statistics Bulletin</i>, Jan–Feb, 2010
 </p>
<p>Rao’s career in statistics is dotted with remarkable achievements. Two of Rao’s papers, written during the 1940s, were reproduced in the book <i>Breakthroughs in Statistics, 1890-1990</i> edited by S. Kotz and N.L. Johnson. One of these papers is “Information and accuracy attainable in the estimation of statistical parameters” (<i>Bull. Cal. Math. Soc</i>. 1945. <b>37</b>: 81–91) and another is “Large sample tests of statistical hypotheses concerning several parameters with applications to problems of estimation” (<i>Cambridge Philos. Soc</i>. 1947. <b>44</b>: 50–57). His 1945 paper opened up several new areas of research and generated several technical terms bearing his name, such as Cramer–Rao inequality and Rao–Blackwellization, concepts which are basic to estimation theory and appear in undergraduate textbooks on statistics and econometrics. The method of Rao–Blackwellization published provides a method by which an unbiased estimator of a parameter can be improved in efficiency when a sufficient statistic for that parameter exists. In fact, in the book <i>Physics from Fisher Information</i>, the author, B.  Roy Frieden, states that “the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is an expression of Cramer–Rao Inequality of <i>classical</i> measurement theory….” Physicists have since derived a quantum version of the Cramer–Rao Bound that provides a more stringent version of the uncertainty principle. </p>
<p>In fact, in this 1945 paper, Rao proposed a differential geometric foundation for statistics by introducing a quadratic differential metric in the space of probability measures. The idea of connecting statistics and differential geometry was too early at that time. However, half a century later, his idea has been developed to become one of the most active and important topics in information science connecting statistics, information theory, control theory and statistical physics. The concept of distance between two probability measures introduced by Rao using differential geometric concepts is known as Rao distance. The metric is known as Fisher–Rao metric, since Rao used the notion of Fisher information in defining the quadratic differential metric.  </p>

<p>The second breakthrough paper published in the <i>Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc.</i> introduced a new asymptotic test, termed as Rao’s Score Test, as an alternative to the likelihood ratio and Wald tests. These three tests together are known as the holy trinity in statistics. The test appears in books on econometrics and its merits are discussed in various conferences. Some features of this test are discussed in a paper by Chandra and Ghosh (<i>Sankhya A</i>. 1983. <b>45</b>: 228–246).</p>
<p>In another series of papers, Rao developed a theory behind a set of combinatorial arrangements called orthogonal arrays,<sup id="footnote-link-2"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> which was accepted by the editor “as a fresh and original piece of work”.<sup id="footnote-link-3"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> Orthogonal arrays have been widely applied in industrial experimentation to determine the optimum mix of factors for maximizing output using observations on a small number of factor combinations. Some of these applications are known as the Taguchi methods, developed by Genichi Taguchi, who learnt about arrays during his visit to ISI. </p>
<p>In another set of papers written during this decade, one of which was on the choice of a minimum set of measurements for analysis,<sup id="footnote-link-4"><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> and another that was the first attempt to represent high-dimensional data in a two- or three-dimensional graph,<sup id="footnote-link-5"><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup> Rao laid the foundation of the modern theory of multivariate statistical analysis. Ultimately, most of the papers Rao published during 1945–49 contributed to the development of statistics as an independent discipline. </p>
<h3>Rao’s research from the 1950s onwards</h3>
<p>In statistical parlance, an estimator is said to be first-order efficient if its asymptotic variance attains the Cramer–Rao lower bound. Under some conditions, the first order efficiency holds for a large class of estimators. In order to choose a subclass amongst these first-order efficient estimators that are better than others, Rao introduced a criterion called second-order efficiency.<sup id="footnote-link-6"><a href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup> This is the first paper which initiated studies on higher-order asymptotics of estimators. In another paper in 1995,<sup id="footnote-link-7"><a href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> Rao used the idea of canonical correlations to estimate dominant factors that explain the correlation between measurements. This method is known as Rao’s canonical factor analysis.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4152"><img src="http://bhavana.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CRRAO2010-90thBD04-1024x768.jpg" alt="c" width="697" height="523" srcset="https://bhavana.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CRRAO2010-90thBD04.jpg 1024w, https://bhavana.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CRRAO2010-90thBD04-300x225.jpg 300w, https://bhavana.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CRRAO2010-90thBD04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bhavana.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CRRAO2010-90thBD04-640x480.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px"><figcaption>The quintessential family man  <span> Tejaswini Rao </span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During his time at ISI, Rao also made significant contributions to results on the characterization of probability distributions. These results are described in the book co-authored by Rao.<sup id="footnote-link-8"><a href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup> Some of the technical terms arising out of his characterization of probability distributions are `Rao’s Damage Model’ (1963), `Rao–Rubin Theorem’ (1964), and the `Kagan, Linnik and Rao Theorems’ (1963). Rao continued his research on the characterization of probability distributions in the U.S. in collaboration with C.G.  Khatri, and D.  Shanbhag. The results are summarized in the book <i>Choquet–Deny Functional Equations with Applications to Stochastic Models</i> by C.R.  Rao and D.N.  Shanbhag, Wiley, New York (1994). In the area of functional equations in mathematics, he introduced a new equation called the Integrated Cauchy functional equation. This equation provided a general technique for characterizing probability measures and solving problems of stochastic modelling of data for statistical analysis, as discussed in the paper “Solution to the integrated Cauchy functional equation on the whole line” (<i>Sankhya</i>. 1984. <b>46</b>: 311–319) by Ka-Sing Lau and C.R.  Rao. This equation provided a general technique for characterizing probability measures and solving problems of stochastic modelling of data for statistical analysis. </p>

Rao being awarded the National Medal of Science in 2002 by President George W. Bush  <span> National Science and Technology Medals Foundation </span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the 1980s, Rao introduced a series of measures that quantify information and variation in data. In collaboration with Jacob Burbea, University of Pittsburgh, he introduced one such series of measures based on information-theoretic notions of entropy.<sup id="footnote-link-9"><a href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup> Rao also developed analysis of diversity (ANODIV), which generalized the idea of analysis of variance (ANOVA). He also introduced what is termed as Rao’s Quadratic Entropy,<sup id="footnote-link-10"><a href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup> a general measure of variance which is used by ecologists. Rao developed the concept of cross-entropy in the paper “Cross entropy, dissimilarity measures and characterizations of quadratic entropy” (<i>IEEE Trans. IT</i>. 1985. <b>31</b>(5): 589–593) written jointly with T.K.  Nayak.  </p>

Rao being awarded the Royal Statistical Society’s Guy Medal in 2011 <span><strong> Courtesy </strong> B.L.S.P.  Rao</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Matrix theory is another branch of mathematics he used in the discussion of statistical problems which in turn gave impetus to research on matrices. His most important contribution to the theory of matrices is the concept of a generalized inverse of a matrix, which is defined for both singular and non-singular matrices.<sup id="footnote-link-11"><a href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup> Using this approach, Rao provided a general technique for characterizing probability measures and solving problems of stochastic modelling of data for statistical analysis. This also allowed him and others since to provide a unified theory of least squares estimation.<sup id="footnote-link-12"><a href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup> Rao also generalized what are known as Kantorovich inequalities on matrices for use in statistics which opened a new area of research in matrix algebra.<sup id="footnote-link-13"><a href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> </p>

Rao being awarded the India Science Prize in 2010 by PM Manmohan Singh <span><strong> courtesy </strong> B.L.S.P.  Rao</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rao had all his education in India and did most of his research by himself without any guidance from others. He is not just a statistician. His other interests include music and dance, and he pursues his hobbies of photography and gardening. When Rao moved from Calcutta to Delhi in 1970 to be at ISI Delhi, he was surprised to find there was no dance school to teach Kuchipudi and that it did not receive the same status as Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kathakali and Odissi. He started a Kuchipudi dance academy at Delhi and was its first president. The academy organized regular performances in Kuchipudi and Rao was its president until 1979, when he left for the U.S.</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that when Rao first joined ISI in the early 1940s, statistics was not considered an independent subject and no university offered courses at the Master’s level. Rao’s contributions have earned him a place in the history of statistics.</p>
<p>
C.R. Rao is among the worldwide leaders in statistical science over the last five decades. His research, scholarship and professional service had a profound influence in the theory and applications of statistics and are incorporated into standard references for statistical study and practice. Rao’s contributions to statistical theory earned him a place in the history of statistics.<br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><nav><h2><a href="https://nicolo.dev/">nicolo.dev</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://nicolo.dev/en/about/">About me</a></li><li><a href="https://nicolo.dev/en/projects/">Projects</a></li><li><a href="https://nicolo.dev/blog/fairplay-apple-offuscamento/" title="it version">IT</a></li></ul></nav></header><p><span>August 28, 2023</span> – 38 min – 8082 words</p><p><strong>FairPlay</strong> comprises a set of algorithms created by Apple for digital rights management (also called DRM, <em>digital rights management</em>). FairPlay is currently used to manage the decryption of iOS applications during their installation on Apple devices. In fact, we know that Apple distributes all applications in the Apple Store through the IPA file format. The IPA file format contains encrypted information that will then be used by the operating system to install an application. All of the encrypted information is handled through FairPlay, which takes care of keeping the decryption key and the whole process secure to avoid the possibility of decrypting the contents of.ipa files to share the contents of an app (perhaps paid for) in the wrong hands.</p><p>In this article, we are going to summarize some static protection measures that I was able to find within user-space daemons running FairPlay, the DRM system used by Apple. All information is believed to be current as of the date of the article; the operating system from which the binaries were extracted is macOS 13.5.1.</p><h2 id="drm-systems-and-the-protection-of-apple-applications">DRM systems and the protection of Apple applications</h2><p>Protecting intellectual property in digital form has always been a goal on the part of companies that distribute copyrighted material. How can content be distributed without users being able to copy, view, edit, and redistribute it? Most current systems use DRM technology. Very briefly, DRM systems work in the following way: they receive as input a secret (it can be a film, an image, or an algorithm) that is not readable, for example, raw files, process the information, and transmit as output the original content. All this is done while trying to keep the process by which the original information was obtained as hidden as possible. DRM systems are most widely used for viewing copyrighted content: the user signs a contract with a service provider that promises to send the requested information (movies, TV series, books). To prevent copying of the content (the contract provides for only one user authorized to view it with that contract), the information must be accessible so that no copying or exporting of the content is expected.</p><p>From an Apple perspective, let’s assume that we want to download a paid application or new game through the Apple Store. We make the transaction, and our device gets a standalone archive, ready to be installed. Technically speaking, if there were no protection measures, a person could copy the app installer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and pass it on to any other person. Result? Loss of revenue on the part of Apple and the developer who published the application since the archive copy is free. Paradoxically, by treating the IPA file format as a kind of container, there would be no technical measure to stop application sharing (archives are standalone). This is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay">FairPlay™</a> technology comes into play.</p><p>How can we protect the information contained within the archive? It is clear that we must somehow hide the contents of the archive; by doing so, even if they were to extract the IPA archive from the iPhone, attackers would not be able to access the contents. The information would have to be read only by the system processes that are in charge of installing the application. The next question would be: how can we hide the content? Here, an unparalleled Pandora’s box opens. One of the simplest and least expensive ideas from an archival point of view is to encrypt the information using a secret key. The information would be made readable again by a simple call to <code>decrypt(content, key)</code>.</p><p>The choice of secret key, however, is not a <strong>banal</strong> problem. If we think about the installation process, we know that the information will at some point have to be decrypted, that is, made readable again. Can we set a static key that applies to all iPhones sold? Certainly not. The choice of a static (i.e., hardcoded) key poses a variety of nuisances: attackers would only have to find a single key in order to gain access to all archives created by the Apple Store. However, once the key was discovered, the rest would come naturally: installers would be decrypted in no time, and the network would find itself flooded with “cracked” archives. The choice of the static key might seem advantageous to apply, perhaps by splitting the “visibility” of a set of keys per device (iPhone 12 will have a certain key, iPhone 13 a different one) by exploiting hardware<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. But even this inventiveness does not work; the key to sharing is across multiple devices!</p><p>The solution actually includes the generation of “dynamic” keys, i.e., depending solely on the installation device, the account of the user who paid for the applications, and a set of metadata exchanged during the transaction (to avoid spoofing). Apple encrypts the contents of the IPA file the moment it receives a new request from the Apple Store: encryption is done with a public key associated with the Apple account. Once received, the archive is decompressed and the individual binary is decrypted using the private key within the device. The application is thus installed in plaintext and remains in plaintext within the Apple device.</p><p>The point at which the decryption takes place constitutes a large centralization point that could be useful to analyze to try to get the IPA decrypted. If attackers could figure out how the private key is generated from the device and associated account, Apple’s protection system would fail instantly. With respect to the risk of spoofing, Apple includes within its devices certain stratagems to declare to cloud services (Apple Store, iCloud, Apple Signing) that indeed the packet exchange originates from an Apple device and not from an <strong>issued</strong> or <strong>simulated</strong> Apple device. Unfortunately due to a number of technical limitations it is not possible to prove 100% “<em>I am not a simulated device, give me the binary, I am [myaccount@icloud.com]</em>”.</p><h2 id="static-analysis-and-obfuscation-techniques">Static analysis and obfuscation techniques</h2><p>FairPlay constitutes a very important technological part of Apple’s technical expertise in intellectual property protection. Several patents have been developed to describe this technology and protect it: <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8934624B2"><em>US8934624B2: Decoupling rights in a digital content unit from download</em></a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/ES2373131T3"><em>ES2373131T3: Safe distribution of content using descifrado keys</em></a>. Protecting how the decryption process works is the main goal of another set of “anti-reverse engineering” technologies named software obfuscation.</p><p>In fact, we know that among the wide range of techniques that any industry insider can devise to analyze software, there is a procedure called static analysis that allows for more specific investigation of certain parts of a piece of software without sending it into execution. The main technique of static analysis is reverse engineering, which is the reconstruction of the original code by inferring information from raw binary code.</p><p>Raw binaries in fact consist of two main pieces of information to function: data and instructions. Through a multitude of steps, programs such as <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a>, <a href="https://hex-rays.com/">IDA</a> or <a href="https://binary.ninja/">Binary Ninja</a> can reconstruct much of the original source code. Although not perfectly, the software analyst is able to infer much of the semantics of the software: how it works, what methods it calls, and what information it uses from the operating system are some of the examples of questions we can answer through reverse engineering.</p><p>Reverse engineering allows one to derive to a good degree of approximation the algorithms that FairPlay uses in order to decrypt the content. Through the data it is then possible to try to figure out how the secret key is constructed, and with enough effort an attacker could figure out how to copy the decryption method to develop a decryption tool. Deriving the algorithm would be a problem for Apple and its investors. The solution to protect the instructions and data is to apply some forms of obfuscation that make the process of reverse engineering analysis more difficult.</p><p>Forms of obfuscation are part of a discipline of computer science called Software Security that aims to protect the code and information contained within a program. Examples of applications of obfuscation include: protecting intellectual property, making reverse engineering more difficult to prevent the discovery of vulnerabilities, and mitigating exploits. These techniques are applied to the syntax of a program (i.e., the raw instructions) and make it possible to hide much of the original semantics. Manipulating raw code is very complex, so it is necessary to have a solid foundation to be able to modify the code without side effects.</p><p>As we will see in the following paragraphs, FairPlay was constructed in a way that hides much of the instruction and data. Are these techniques, however, really effective? We will attempt to answer this at the end of the article. Recall, in fact, that obfuscation and code protection are techniques that must always be changed from release to release since there is no definitive solution to protect a piece of software. Through obfuscation we are able to complicate all attempts at reverse engineering, but we certainly cannot prevent or prevent the analysis of the binary.</p><h3 id="the-fairplayd-daemon">The fairplayd daemon</h3><p>In the next few paragraphs we will attempt to analyze in detail a user-side daemon that can be found within Apple’s family of operating systems. The use of FairPlay is not limited only to the iOS mobile platform: FairPlay is also used by macOS to manage a secure channel through which to convey the digital content to be protected (movies, TV series..). This sub-technology is called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/streaming/fps/">FairPlay Streaming</a> and allows copyrighted content to be distributed by encrypting the content. A document that summarizes at a high level how it works is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/streaming/fps/FairPlayStreamingOverview.pdf"><em>FairPlay Streaming Overview</em></a>.</p><p>We then want to find out more about the use of FairPlay within macOS and see if the algorithms have been protected through obfuscations. We find that much of the management of FairPlay is assigned to a framework called <code>CoreFP.Framework</code> (<strong>Core</strong> <strong>F</strong>air <strong>P</strong>lay) found within the <code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks</code> folder. Private frameworks are a set of libraries dedicated to certain specific macOS features that are considered private, meaning that they have not been released for public use and all methods contained within are to be considered valid only for Apple applications.</p><p>CoreFP.Framework is currently used by some applications and daemons such as Safari and AMPLibraryAgent. Side note before continuing: if you have a private framework and are curious where it is currently being used, you can run the command <code>lsof | grep -i [name_framework]</code> where name_framework is the name of the framework library. As a result we will see a number of active processes that have opened the private framework; in this case, we briefly dwell on AMPLibraryAgent. AMPLibraryAgent is a user-space daemon that is used to manage the user’s media (<code>TV.app</code> and <code>Music.app</code>). AMPLibraryAgent is a kind of intermediate process between the encrypted content coming from Apple’s servers and the end user interacting with the decrypted content through the <code>TV.app</code> and <code>Music.app</code> clients.</p><p>FairPlayd is the daemon that is invoked by AMPLibraryAgent and is used in practice to decrypt the contents. We then begin to analyze the contents of the <code>CoreFP.Framework</code> folder. Although the privateframeworks are contained within a dynamic cache called <code>dyld</code>, the binaries of <code>CoreFP.Framework</code> are available without any special arrangements that the user has to make on the dynamic cache. Within CoreFP, we can find: <code>CoreFP</code> and <code>fairplayd</code>. <code>CoreFP</code> is the binary that is used by system processes and constitutes the library, while <code>fairplayd</code> is the user space daemon. The user space daemon uses the kernel component called <a href="https://github.com/pwn0rz/fairplay_research/blob/master/files/FairPlayIOKit_macOS_11.2_20D64">FairPlayIOKit</a>.</p><p>We extract the x86_64 version of <code>fairplayd</code> and save it to a folder of our choice via the command <code>lipo -extract x86_64 fairplayd ~/fairplayd</code>. The <code>fairplayd</code> file is a classic executable Mach-O file, it has no particular fields within the header worth mentioning. So let`s import it inside one of our reverse engineering tools (at will we can use Ghidra, IDA, Binary Ninja or Hopper). We use IDA for convenience in this article, although we must be especially careful when importing the binary into other tools (we will explain why at the end of the article). We let IDA work to reconstruct the information within the binary (through section parsing, disassembling, decompiling).</p><p><img src="https://nicolo.dev/images/blog/fairplay/ida-screen-0.png" alt="IDA Screenshot"></p><p>By default IDA opens the binary by placing the reader on the main symbol, namely <code>_main</code>, the entry point of the <code>fairplayd</code> daemon. As we can see, we immediately touch on the power of obfuscation, and after a while we realize that the entire binary was actually constructed in such a way as to obfuscate all instructions. Confirmation of this is also given by the decompiler, below is a brief excerpt:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="C"><span><span>v298 <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>v297;

Most people applying obfuscation techniques hope that most of the time the analyst will choose the first path. If it is too complicated to analyze the behavior of an application by reverse engineering, it is not worth it. However, it is necessary for obfuscation to be well done before there can be any major slips. In this article we will try to find out that it actually only takes a simple look at the raw code to identify some common obfuscation patterns. In the next few paragraphs we will introduce some obfuscation techniques and how they are implemented.</p><p>Before continuing, we should mention that there are different obfuscation techniques depending on the resource to be protected. As we will see later, different obfuscation techniques have a different cost: the opaque predicate technique has an entirely different cost than control flow flattening. That said, let’s get started!</p><p><strong>Helpful Tip</strong>: With the presence of obfuscations applied to instructions and data, it is a good idea to try to use the decompiler view as little as possible. In fact, the decompiler deduces some high-level information from how the machine instructions were placed within the binary and what data they work on. Since most of the instructions are intended to complicate the decompiler result, abandoning the decompiler result is always a good idea.</p><h3 id="mixed-boolean-arithmetic-expression">Mixed Boolean Arithmetic Expression</h3><p>The first obfuscation technique we address is data obfuscation using mixed expressions with algebraic (sum, subtraction, multiplication, division) and boolean (logical operations) operators. These types of expressions are used when there is a need to hide a given numeric constant within a program. A constant datum could represent a value used in an encryption algorithm (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing-up-my-sleeve_number">“Nothing-up-my-sleeve-number”</a>), but also a string, a memory address, and more. But not only that! If during processing, such as during decryption, a cryptographic algorithm performs a simple addition, it is possible to make the arithmetic expression more complex.</p><p>Examples of arithmetic-boolean expressions are: <code>v298 &amp; 0x52491520 | (2 * (_DWORD) v298) &amp; 0x80120A40) ^ 0x40090520) + ((-1704077140 - (v298 &amp; 0x8924A850)) &amp; 0x8924A854) + ((((unsigned int) v298 &amp; 0x24924288) + 689062540) &amp;0x24924288 | (2 * v298) &amp; 0x506D9510)</code>. I have already written in a previous post <a href="https://nicolo.dev/blog/introduzione-pocket-offuscatore/">how to be able to create</a> these expressions by applying transformation rules. The process Apple used is the same: take a constant from the code, rewrite the constant using arithmetic operators, and then apply the transformations. Do we already have an expression? We continue to apply the rules of transformations. Note that only some transformations can be applied since they do not change the semantics of the original expression. At the end of the process, the expression is translated back into machine language so that it can be reinserted within the binary.</p><p>In the case of <code>fairplayd</code>, numeric constants most often represent addresses at which to jump from one basic block to another. Addresses refer to other basic blocks or to stubs used to call methods from other libraries. We will discuss this option in more detail in obfuscating the control flow.</p><p>We can actually see two types of obfuscation of Boolean expressions depending on the type of assembly instruction used.

The idea would be to have a series of MBA expressions to compute in parallel to find the result of a constant. This would lower the overhead given by introducing the complication of an expression (and since I have a lower overhead, I can increase the degree of illegibility of the expression). Plus it would be dependent on the Apple Silicon architecture, making it more difficult to emulate the computation. Possible problems with this approach include: finding equations that can be executed in parallel, checking how to interact with parallel cores (via software abstraction?), checking the semantics of expressions.</p><p>The technique of obfuscation by mixed boolean arithmetic expressions has been widely used in the <code>fairplayd</code> binary. An excellent example of how this obfuscation has been used can be found in the function <a href="https://gist.github.com/seekbytes/696f71ec49b7e75728e94f5bea4dee46">sub_1001F5D32</a>: the largest function within which Boolean arithmetic expressions are found. There are currently several methods for trying to summarize arithmetic Boolean expressions, but most rely on a single technique called <strong>symbolic execution</strong> and involve the use of Proof Solvers such as z3 to verify the semantics between the obfuscated expression and the synthesized expression.</p><p>The best tool you can currently use to solve arithmetic Boolean expressions is <a href="https://github.com/HexRaysSA/goomba/">goomba</a>, developed by HexRays and available by default in IDA Pro and IDA Teams versions 8.3.

The defense given by these opaque predicates is proportional to the degree of illegibility and complexity given by the check made between the (high-level) ifs or the various algebraic arithmetic statements given before the <code>cmp</code> statement. Code within the ifs is presented as <em>dead code</em> i.e., code that will never be executed: during decompilation, however, it is not possible to recognize between code that will run and dead code. Opaque predicates therefore add degrees of “confusion” to binary analysis.</p><p>A typical example of this transformation is the procedure <code>sub_100005FC0</code>: after the classical prologue, we can find a function call and then two different execution branches. The condition to jump into a branch or continue is given by the <code>test al, 2</code> instruction: at high level the condition would be equal to <code>if (al % 4 == 0)</code>, i.e. if the number stored inside register <code>al</code> is divisible by 4 continue with the execution, otherwise jump to <code>loc_10000505F</code>. The <code>test</code> instruction actually performs AND between the register <code>al</code> and the immediate value <code>0x2</code>: performing an AND with an immediate value means checking the remainder of the register division with the immediate value <code>al &amp; 2 == al % 4</code>.</p><p>Visualizing the graph tree of the function we can see how the basic block just below the condition is a very large block.</p><p><img src="https://nicolo.dev/images/blog/fairplay/ida-graph-tree.png" alt="Fuction Graph tree on IDA"></p><p>Intuitively one would think that a very large basic block would be an integral part of the processing. If the program were not obfuscated, this is a very real assumption. However, we have to imagine that Apple’s developers have complicated the instructions precisely in order to challenge the automatic binary analysis tools. In this case, the largest basic block (TRUE branch of the condition <code>at % 4 == 0</code>) represents a clear example of <strong>opaque predicate</strong>. In fact, if we saw the most substantial elementary block, we could see a number of useless assembly operations.</p><p><img src="https://nicolo.dev/images/blog/fairplay/ida-basic-block-huge.png" alt="Graph tree on IDA"></p><p>Note that the screenshot has been cropped to avoid filling the entire article with the image of the basic block. We ask: Is it exactly a basic block that is useless for computation purposes? Is the condition <code>al % 4 == 0</code> always true or always false? The job of obfuscation would be to prevent any kind of inference within the condition. And it is: we cannot predict whether the instruction will always have a constant result or not.</p><p>What we can do, however, is to see the basic block present below the basic block of the TRUE condition <code>al % 4 == 0</code>. The basic block we are looking at then represents the FALSE condition (i.e. following <code>jnz loc_100005F2F</code>, we come to analyze the condition <code>loc_100005F2F</code>). A good way to check whether the largest basic block is actually useful or not is to see if there are any dependencies between the data used in the suspect basic block and the other basic blocks.</p><p>In this case, we can see that the basic block loads the address of xmmword_1002B6460, which was previously used in the “suspect” basic block.</p><p><img src="https://nicolo.dev/images/blog/fairplay/ida-block-10005f2f.png" alt="Basic block, false condition of if instruction"></p><p>In the suspect basic block, the memory location <code>xmmword_1002B6460</code> is rewritten by an information present in another memory location.

However, even in uncertainty, the obfuscation given by the opaque predicate turns out to be not very powerful: we have two choices, this means that we can propagate most of the changes in a parallel way (verifying what happens if we enter the TRUE condition block or inside to block the FALSE condition). Other questions that might come to mind:</p><ul><li><p>how are we sure that the assembly code of the largest basic block is composed of “dead code”? The instructions currently show that other data is overwritten, but that data is never used. The question remains open on other procedures that could use this data (even if the analysis of the references has not highlighted this possibility, we cannot trust 100% of the binary analysis tools).</p></li><li><p>how do we make sure that <code>xmmword_1002142F0</code> is not overwritten by other functions? As usual, we use the powerful XREF tool: there are no other procedures that read/write the memory of <code>xmmword_1002142F0</code>. But remember that XREF checks based on information gleaned from automated binary analysis tools. Even just one piece of information lost during the initial parsing can cause major headaches at the end of the parse (ie during reference scanning).</p></li><li><p>how can we be sure that the condition <code>al % 4 == 0</code> is not always satisfied? We could only answer this question when we have invented the crystal ball. What matters to us is not so much verifying whether the condition is true or false: we actually want to carry out an analysis of the data to understand the effects of the “suspect” basic block of being dead code. To verify this, we carried out an analysis on the basic block immediately following the suspected block. If we are in doubt, as in this case, we can also propagate the changes to the following blocks to see if in one way or another we can infer some other data.</p></li></ul><p>To answer the question “so what does <code>sub_100005FC0</code> do in practice?”, just look at the basic block just after the <code>memcpy</code> function call.

Apple needs to review the construction of the opaque predicates to make the basic blocks even more complex.</p><p><strong>Idea</strong>: To make obfuscation even more effective, you would need to make each elementary block more complex (perhaps trying to make the control flow more complicated).

I confess that it was not easy to analyze, but after the analysis of IDA we understand another “obfuscation” technique that Apple has applied to protect <code>fairplayd</code>. Very subtly the stack is moved up (or down, depending on how you want to build the stack). Why would a program want to move the stack?</p><p>All instruction analysis software provides, among the many analysis steps, a particular type of insight called “stack analysis”. This technique allows you to recover how the stack and local variables are composed: it is essential to be able to correctly deduce how the stack is composed, otherwise the analysis software is no longer able to understand the flow control and the various function calls.</p><p>For this procedure, the type of error that IDA reports is <code>sp-analysis failed</code> i.e. it fails to trace how the stack pointer is modified. In our case, IDA fails to realize that the shift is done precisely to confuse the analysis. Indeed with the instruction <code>mov eax, 1010h</code> and <code>sub rsp, rax</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, IDA is led to think that there is a local buffer called <code>var_1020</code> of size 0x1010 bytes. This is just one of many examples where IDA fails to rebuild the original stack.</p><p>Other examples can be found in functions with multiple statements: the procedure <code>sub_10000F620</code> has a parameter on the stack that occupies 0x2CE7AB73 bytes (753380211 bytes = about 753 MB). Such a large parameter on the stack we know cannot exist: the stack can be increased in size, but usually reaches <strong>maximum</strong> 65520kb (higher values cause errors in macOS). The value 753 MB is given by an basic block in which the <code>sub esp, 0x2CE7AB73</code> instruction is used, an unreachable basic block, therefore considered dead code. However, IDA does not have the tools to realize that such a value is too large to exist: IDA does not recognize that its analysis is inaccurate, on the contrary it refuses to decompile the function because the size of the stack frame is too large. With a single instruction, Apple manages to put a major barrier to anyone who wants to decompile the feature.</p><p>Is it so difficult to fix this situation? For a beginner, yes. For a motivated reverse engineering student, no. Fortunately, IDA allows the analyst to be able to modify part of the information that he has deduced. By redefining the stack, much of the 753MB of variable can be ignored. An alternative way is to report a certain path as dead code (just select the bytes of that block and not define it via the option called <em>Undefine</em>). In the case of moving the stack pointer up, when we try to make software analysis complex, we’re not really talking about obfuscation: we’re not affecting the readability of the code. Rather, let’s act on some limitations that these tools have to recover information. A good article grouping some techniques to confuse the analysis techniques applied by IDA was written by Markus Gaasedelen: <a href="https://blog.ret2.io/2017/11/16/dangers-of-the-decompiler/">Dangers of the Decompiler</a>.</p><h3 id="control-flow-flattening">Control Flow Flattening</h3><p>Control Flow Flattening is another obfuscation technique found within the FairPlay binary and is perhaps the most powerful used by Apple in the field of code protection for <code>fairplayd</code>. Flow control indicates how the program evolves over time in terms of instruction flow. What functions a procedure calls, what kind of jumps the check makes (if conditional or unconditional), the link between the various basic blocks, the conditions for which the execution moves and many other information are inferred from the flow control.</p><p>The high-level instructions of flow control are the typical instructions that allow you to divide the execution of a program into one or more cases: <code>if</code>, <code>if else</code>, <code>if else if else</code>, <code>switch</code>, <code>do while</code>, <code>for</code> and many others. Most of these conditions translate into machine language instructions which for Intel become <code>cmp</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>jmp</code>. If the high-level flow control change is dictated by “logical” instructions, the low-level flow control change is to change the address of the next instruction, or rather, jump to a certain instruction.</p><p>Among the information that we can deduce from the flow control, we can derive the various connections between the basic blocks and proceed to carry out the intra-procedural analysis, i.e. try to reconstruct the program execution flow between the various procedures. The flow of control also allows to recover important information (such as loops) to subsequently proceed to the translation from machine code to pseudo C code.</p><p>To more clearly show the power of obfuscation using control flow flattening, let’s take an example function: <code>sub_10003FE60</code>. From IDA, we select the example function, right click and choose the tree view. The tree view is a feature of IDA which allows you to understand: how the basic blocks are connected, the dependencies between the blocks and the execution branches. Often through this view it is possible to get a better idea of what the pseudo code translated by the decompiler will look like.</p><p>The goal of the control flow flattening technique is to flatten the control flow, i.e. to transform the control flow through some conditional and unconditional jumps. The technique was developed by <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/edge-articles/chenxi-wang-from-security-research-to-developing-the-next-generation-of-security-leaders">Chenxi Wang</a> in his doctoral thesis entitled <em>A Security Architecture for Survivability Mechanisms</em>. Normally the control flow of a procedure is almost developed vertically, as you can see in the image below.</p><p><img src="https://nicolo.dev/images/blog/fairplay/ida-vertical.png" alt="IDA vertical control flow"></p><p>With the application of control flow flattening, the procedure graph is heavily modified by making it “more horizontal,” that is, flattened or <em>flatten</em>. Here is a typical example of how a function can be modified by applying (simple) control flow flattening:</p><p><img src="https://nicolo.dev/images/blog/fairplay/control-flow-flattening.png" alt="IDA control flow after applying the control flow flattening"></p><p>We can then see how the basic blocks have all been brought to the same de facto level by horizontally extending the graph of basic blocks. The case of control flow flattening taken to the extreme drives the analyst crazy, such as this function depicted below:</p><p><img src="https://nicolo.dev/images/blog/fairplay/ida-extreme.png" alt="IDA vertical control flow extreme"></p><p>As can be seen from the image just above, control flow flattening can be applied to construct even bogus basic blocks that can confuse the decompiler. The end result is a control flow that is extremely complex to analyze. At a high level, the transformation technique can be translated by a simple switch. Suppose we have a procedure:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="C"><span><span><span>int</span> <span>sum</span>(<span>int</span> a, <span>int</span> b){
</span></span><span><span>	<span>int</span> s <span>=</span> <span>4</span>;
</span></span><span><span>	<span>int</span> c;
</span></span><span><span>	<span>if</span> ( a <span>&gt;</span> <span>500</span> ){
</span></span><span><span>		c <span>=</span> <span>2</span>;
</span></span><span><span>	} <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>		c <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
</span></span><span><span>	}
</span></span><span><span>	<span>int</span> result <span>=</span> s <span>+</span> a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c;
</span></span><span><span>	<span>return</span> result;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The control flow of this simple function is given by the following graph:</p><p><img src="https://nicolo.dev/images/blog/fairplay/cff-before.svg" alt="Control flow graph"></p><p>Now we want this vertical graph to be as flattened as possible! To do this we use another powerful construct of programming languages: the <code>switch</code> instruction. The <code>switch</code> instruction allows the execution to be divided into multiple branches, creating basic blocks arranged horizontally. To switch from one branch to another in the switch, however, we can use an auxiliary variable, called <code>state</code>, which stores the current state we are in. Does this sound familiar? This technique sounds a lot like the synthesis of a finite state machine! The auxiliary variable helps to change state without worrying about some side effects (or without the use of labels and goto). Let us then move on to the actual transformation! For now, let us assume that we do not add any unnecessary basic blocks.</p><p>The steps we perform are as follows:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Creation of the “start”</strong> block: contains the initialization of the state variable and all the variables that will be used within the basic blocks of the switch. It is possible to move the declarations within the switch branches, however, we must pay attention to possible side effects of using local variables internal to a construct.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dispatcher creation</strong>: This basic block will check what state to jump to. It is a simple <code>while</code> with a switch statement inside: this is to avoid that after entering one of the switch branches, the jump out reaches the last statement of the function.</p></li><li><p><strong>Move basic blocks</strong>: I choose a new number for a new state. I insert the code within the identified basic block including the state change. The state variable should point to the next basic block I want to execute. I remind you that I can also create new elementary blocks by subdividing larger basic blocks or adding instructions that will never be executed. The limit for obfuscation is imagination :- )</p></li><li><p><strong>Transformation check</strong>: I check that indeed the function can terminate, paying attention to the last block that is executed. All transformations of obfuscations should actually be checked through some proof solvers and mathematical equations to prevent the original semantics from being changed during the obfuscation process.</p></li></ol><p>Applying control flow flattening:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="C"><span><span><span>int</span> <span>sum</span>(<span>int</span> a, <span>int</span> b){

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The result:</p><p><img src="https://nicolo.dev/images/blog/fairplay/cff-after.svg" alt="Control flow graph"></p><p>Some notes we write per point:</p><ul><li><p>the graph does not contain the while instruction to avoid adding too many arrows and making the graph more confusing. When a branch of a switch ends with the <code>break</code> instruction, execution resumes from the evaluation of the <code>state</code> variable. The graph does not contain the last instruction <code>return -542926392;</code>, it should be inserted with an arrow after dispatcher execution.</p></li><li><p><code>basic block A</code> and <code>basic block B</code> are two basic blocks that were inserted to highlight the difference in the control flow whether the variable <code>a</code> results in greater than 500 or not. If indeed the condition is true, we change state by going to state 4, otherwise we go to state -1. Note that the number for each state is trivially a number chosen at random to identify each state with a label.</p></li><li><p>An attacker could still predict the instruction execution flow by following the evolution of the <code>state</code> variable. There are some gimmicks to obfuscate the value of the <code>state</code> variable such as using MBA expressions and aliasing. It is also possible to introduce unnecessary blocks, opaque predicates and dynamically construct the switch to divert the analyst or hinder the decompiler’s analysis.</p></li><li><p>the variable <code>state</code> is never assigned with the value <code>0x54292639</code>. So how do we ensure that the function terminates by returning <code>result</code>? In the previous code we used a small stratagem: we take advantage of not mentioning <code>break</code> within the switch branch. In this case, execution goes immediately from state <code>5</code> to state <code>0x54292639</code> because the program is executed sequentially (shown as “<strong>C Magic</strong>”). Sometimes it is possible that the compiler applies optimizations to not create the branch of 0x54292639, so be sure to disable the optimizations if you want the graph to be the same as the image above.</p></li></ul><p>Just out of curiosity, let’s try compiling a program that uses both <code>sum</code> functions to see how effective this kind of technique is. The program in fact has two functions <code>sum_1</code>, the obfuscated function, and <code>sum_2</code>, the original function. The <code>sum_2</code> function is decompiled correctly:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="C"><span><span><span>__int64</span> <span>__fastcall</span> <span>sum_2</span>(<span>int</span> a1, <span>int</span> a2){

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>if</span> ( a1 <span>&lt;=</span> <span>500</span> )
</span></span><span><span>    v3 <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;

</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The function is very similar to the original. In addition, the control flow graph constructed by IDA is not suspicious and looks the same as the graph constructed by us manually.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Meanwhile, we can say that we have managed to confuse the IDA decompiler. Indeed, we notice that a for is constructed, then 3 <code>while(1)</code> loops one inside the other. Although the result of the decompiler may not be exactly correct and is different from the original code, the program works. An attacker would then be able to pick up the program logic. This is a typical example of weak obfuscation: the attacker may have some difficulty reconstructing the original control flow, but there is a good chance that the initial logic can be recovered. To make it even more complex, we can use the other techniques: insertion of opaque predicates, transformations of constants, transformations of arithmetic Boolean expressions.</p><p>Returning to <code>fairplayd</code>, the control flow flattening technique is used heavily to try to obfuscate the control flow evolution that fairplay has during execution. We open with IDA the function <code>sub_10003FE60</code> and extract the logic of operation via the decompiler view. In particular, we can see that the decompiler can understand the use of a high-level switch-like structure:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="C"><span><span><span>switch</span> ( (v7 <span>==</span> <span>0</span>) <span>+</span> v2 ){
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>JUMPOUT</span>(<span>0x100035E2CLL</span>);
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>JUMPOUT</span>(<span>0x10004359ELL</span>);
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>JUMPOUT</span>(<span>0x10005BECDLL</span>);
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span>
</span></span><span><span>      v46 <span>=</span> v3;
</span></span><span><span>      v45 <span>=</span> a1;
</span></span><span><span>      v8 <span>=</span> v2 <span>^</span> <span>6u</span>;
</span></span><span><span>      v9 <span>=</span> v8 <span>-</span> <span>5</span>;
</span></span><span><span>      v10 <span>=</span> ((_DWORD)v8 <span>-</span> <span>5</span>) <span>|</span> <span>2u</span>;
</span></span><span><span>      ....
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, by examining all cases within the switch, we will have nonsense instructions! This is because Apple’s developers have managed to heavily obfuscate the state variable, namely <code>v2</code> and <code>v7</code>. On the other hand, the decompiler recognizes the switch construct only by the presence of <strong>jump tables</strong>, particular tables whose entries consist of memory addresses to jump to. Suppose you have 5 branches of a switch, you can store 5 different addresses in memory, each associated with a different branch of the switch. When comparing, you would simply jump to the address pointed to the correct cell in the table. These tables are stored at specific locations in the binary, and with a little luck it is possible to restore them all.</p><p>To raise the bar of analysis difficulty even higher, the developers decided that for some functions the jump table would be recreated dynamically. Very briefly, the program allocates a memory space where addresses can be entered that will later be used as branches of a switch. The calculation of the addresses is done by the usual MBA expressions, and due to a number of technical limitations of static analysis it is not possible to determine the addresses exactly. This in a nutshell completely destroys any possibility for IDA and the analyst to recover the original program logic and structure.</p><p>Typical example of address construction comes from the last portion of code in each basic block (the fact that address construction occurs inline adds complexity to the code):</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="asm"><span><span><span>lea</span>     <span>r12</span>, <span>jpt_10003FF12</span>								<span>; address where to fetch the next address
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>movsxd</span>  <span>rax</span>, <span>ds</span>:(<span>jpt_10003FF12</span> - <span>100218890</span><span>h</span>)[<span>r12</span><span>+</span><span>rax</span>*<span>4</span>] <span>; move the address referred by jpt_10003FF12 - 100218890h
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>lea</span>     <span>rcx</span>, <span>loc_10005A140</span> 								<span>; load the address of loc_10005A140 (base address of jump table)
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>add</span>     <span>rcx</span>, <span>rax</span>										<span>; add the rax value
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>mov</span>     <span>r14</span>, [<span>rbp</span><span>+</span><span>var_58</span>]								<span>; save previous variable on stack
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>jmp</span>     <span>rcx</span>												<span>; jump to next switch case
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The control flow flattening technique thus turns out to be a good obfuscation technique by which Apple is able to prevent static analysis by attackers. Dynamic table construction, combined with the set of techniques mentioned in the previous subsections (opaque predicates, MBA) are the key to fairplayd obfuscation.</p><h2 id="are-further-obfuscation-measures-possible">Are further obfuscation measures possible?</h2><p>Throughout this article we have tried to identify some common obfuscation patterns that can be found in <code>fairplayd</code>, a userspace daemon used by Apple to protect copyrighted content within macOS. Some measures have proved effective: they actually complicate any attempt to accurately reverse engineer the program. The measure that is most complicit in this complication is given by the control flow flattening which eliminates the chances for an attacker to recover the original structure of the program. Attackers are faced with dynamically constructed jump tables, unrecoverable switches, and dynamically generated code.</p><p>Other obfuscation techniques seem to be good ideas, but only in theory: opaque predicates are simple enough to parse, and through a more thorough check of the building blocks it is possible to distinguish between the original code and the modified code to introduce obfuscation.</p><p>Is there a perfect fit to be able to obfuscate the code? Is it possible to devise a technique capable of producing unassailable protection? No. It will always be an ongoing evolution between tools that try to deobfuscate hidden content and new techniques to be able to bypass these tools and apply heavier obfuscation. This is given by the limitation of digital content management: the information must ultimately be able to be visible and therefore deobfuscate, as opposed to other types of information that can be hidden forever inside the devices. It is likely that after yet another article about obfuscation within <code>fairplayd</code> the protection measures will be updated again, causing the article content to be out of date.</p><p>One possible avenue that Apple could pursue to apply more powerful obfuscation is to move much of the execution to an obfuscation technique called “virtualization”. This technique involves writing an interpreter and a completely ad-hoc instruction set architecture to perform the operations necessary to decrypt the content. At the moment the technique doesn’t seem to be used inside <code>fairplayd</code>, but there are some signs (like switches with a lot of branches) that seem to predict the use of data evaluation and dynamic code production. Honestly, I haven’t had time to analyze this part in detail yet.</p><p>As always, if you have any criticisms, suggestions or any other comments, you can write an email to <a href="mailto:seekbytes@protonmail.com">seekbytes@protonmail.com</a><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.

      <p>Recently, I set out on a mission to reconstruct a color system in <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/" target="_blank">Postmark</a>. This project addressed several problems with our design system, involved a lot of research, and even required building a few custom tools. Now that this project is finished, I want to share the most important lessons I learned about color and present a new design and accessibility tool <a href="https://accessiblepalette.com/" target="_blank">Accessible Palette</a> born out of this work.</p>

    
  
    
      <p>The main problems with our old palette were inconsistent perceived lightness of colors (blues and reds are much darker than yellows and greens) and unpredictable contrast ratios between color variants. When picking a color pair, we couldn’t easily tell if it would meet the recommendations from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> (WCAG) and had to manually check the contrast ratio. (Or, most likely… not&nbsp;check.)</p>

      <p>In fact, both of these problems were caused by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#Disadvantages" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">the inherent fault in the HSL color model</a> and lack of support for better alternatives in the design tools. While HSL and HSV are fine choices for choosing a single color, they’re not suitable for building a color system, as they simply transform the RGB model and ignore the complexities of human perception. To see what’s wrong with them and find an alternative, we need to look at color theory and consider other color spaces.</p>
<h2>Stop using HSL for color systems!</h2>
<p>The <strong>RGB</strong> color model reflects how screens work and is not trying to be user-friendly or intuitive. Instead, in the 1970s, researchers came up with <strong>HSL</strong> (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and <strong>HSV/HSB</strong> (Hue, Saturation, Value or Brightness) models as alternative representations of RGB, based on how humans think of colors. The intention was good, but they had to trade off perceptual relevance for computation speed, as more sophisticated models would have been too computationally expensive for that time. The resulting HSL and HSV models are easy mathematical transformations of RGB that don’t reflect a human perception of lightness or saturation.</p>
<p>Consider colors in this scale with the same Saturation (100) and Lightness (50) in&nbsp;HSL:</p>

    
  
    
                              
            
        
                                
          
        
                                    
      

      
              <figure>
          <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-assets.wildbit.com/blog-images/2021/09/_normal/hsl-gradient-l50-s100.png" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-assets.wildbit.com/blog-images/2021/09/hsl-gradient-l50-s100.png 2x" width="610" height="140" itemprop="image" alt="HSL gradient with Saturation set to 100 and Lightness to 50" title="HSL gradient with Saturation set to 100 and Lightness to 50"></p>

          
        </figure>
      
    
  
    
      <p>While this scale may have consistent lightness according to the color model, it definitely feels wrong for a human&nbsp;— visually, blue (<code>#00F</code>) is much darker than yellow (<code>#FF0</code>) or cyan (<code>#0FF</code>). This happens because in HSL, fully saturated colors are mapped to the peak RGB values and placed around a Hue circle at a Lightness value of 50, with values of 0 and 100 corresponding to fully black and white, respectively. When a lighter or darker variant of the color is needed, it gets “mixed” with white or black. The central vertical axis comprises the range of <em>neutral</em> or <em>gray</em> colors with a Saturation of zero. (The difference between HSL and HSV is insignificant for this discussion, but instead of “mixing” colors, HSV represents how colors appear under bright light, so the most saturated colors have a Value of&nbsp;100.)</p>

      <p>Luckily, we’re not limited by computational speed anymore and can use better tools for this&nbsp;job.</p>
<h2>Meet CIELAB and LCh</h2>
<p>By the time HSL and HSV models were formalized, a better alternative already existed. The International Commission on Illumination (abbreviated CIE) defined the <strong>CIELAB or L*a*b*</strong> color space back in 1976. It was designed as a perceptually uniform color space, where a given <em>numerical change</em> corresponds to a similar <em>perceived change</em> in color. Unlike the RGB color model, CIELAB is designed to cover the entire range of visible colors, and its Lightness <em>(L*)</em> component closely matches human perception.</p>
<p>Here is how this color space is defined, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">according to Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The lightness value <em>L*</em> defines black at 0 and white at 100. The <em>a*</em> axis is relative to the green-red opponent colors, with negative values toward green and positive values toward red. The <em>b*</em> axis represents the blue-yellow opponents, with negative numbers toward blue and positive toward yellow.</blockquote>
<p>Earlier, I said that RGB isn’t user-friendly or intuitive. Well, CIELAB really put things into perspective.</p>

      <p>Just as HSL and HSV are easier-to-use cylindrical representations of the RGB, <strong>CIELCh or LCh or Lch(ab)</strong> color space is a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space#Cylindrical_model" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">cylindrical representation of CIELAB</a>. Chromaticity components <em>a*</em> and <em>b*</em> are replaced with <em>Chroma</em> (relative&nbsp;saturation) and <em>Hue</em> angle, while <em>Lightness</em> remains unchanged. The Hue angle is similar to the one in HSL, but they’re not identical&nbsp;— HSL/HSV uses the three additive primary colors red, green, and blue (H&nbsp;= 0, 120, 240°). Instead, the LCh system uses the four colors red, yellow, green, and blue (h&nbsp;= 0, 90, 180, 270°). (It’s worth mentioning there is a similar <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"><strong>HCL or LCh(uv)</strong></a> color space with a Chroma on a uniform scale from 0 to 100, unlike an LCh(ab) where it varies based on Hue and Lightness.)</p>

      <p>You may notice that, unlike HSL and HSV, LCh fits inside a cylinder but doesn’t fill it. This is expected, as some combinations of Lightness, Chroma, and Hue produce impossible colors&nbsp;— for example, a dark saturated yellow just doesn’t exist. The closer the visible gamut gets to black and white on a Lightness scale, the fewer colors can be distinguished by a human eye. In reality, not even all of these visible colors can be displayed on a screen&nbsp;— the sRGB gamut represents a typical screen and includes only about ⅓ of the LCh color space. That’s what we’re limited to in CSS as well, <a target="_blank" href="https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">at least for now</a>.</p>

      <p>Let’s go back to our HSL color scale with Saturation of 100 and Lightness of 50 and see what its Lightness is in LCh:</p>

    
  
    
                              
            
        
                                
          
        
                                    
      

      
              <figure>
          <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-assets.wildbit.com/blog-images/2021/09/_normal/hsl-gradient-with-lch-lightness.png" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-assets.wildbit.com/blog-images/2021/09/hsl-gradient-with-lch-lightness.png 2x" width="610" height="199" itemprop="image" alt="HSL gradient with LCh Lightness levels" title="HSL gradient with LCh Lightness levels"></p>

          
        </figure>
      
    
  
    
      <p>Now, these numbers make more sense&nbsp;— yellow is the lightest color, blue is the darkest, greens are almost three times lighter than blue or twice than reds. Let’s rebuild this scale in LCh with a consistent level of Lightness:</p>

    
  
    
                              
            
        
                                
          
        
                                    
      

      
              <figure>

        </figure>
      
    
  
    
      <p>Because of the varied Chroma component, some of these colors are more saturated than others, but their lightness is visually consistent. This doesn’t look good as a gradient but may be desirable in a color system&nbsp;— I want my colors for notifications and warnings more saturated than shades of the base text. Just for curiosity sake, let’s see how these scales look with more consistency in Chroma:</p>

    
  
    
                              
            
        
                                
          
        
                                    
      

      
              <figure>

        </figure>
      
    
  
    
      <p>Smooth as butter, even while we’re dealing with a limited sRGB color space. This is a great foundation for building a color system.</p>
<p>At this point, you may wonder why the design community does not widely use this powerful color space. As of today, neither Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD support CIELAB or LCh. There is an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/969496279507778512/LCH" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">LCH color picker</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/759433498184507623/Chromatic-Figma" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Chromatic</a> plugins for Figma, but I didn’t find them sufficient to construct a flexible color system. <strong>The ideal tool for the job would generate color variants with persistent lightness, let me control the contrast ratio between them, and be flexible enough to accommodate existing brand colors.</strong> That’s when I discovered a <a target="_blank" href="https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Chroma.js library</a> with great LCh support and decided to write a simple tool to generate a new palette from code. After using this tool internally and sharing it with a few friends, we decided to turn it into an app and share it publicly as a project from our <a target="_blank" href="https://postmarkapp.com/labs" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Labs</a>.</p>
<h2>Introducing Accessible Palette</h2>
<p><mark><strong><a href="https://accessiblepalette.com/" target="_blank">Accessible Palette</a> is an app for building color systems with consistent lightness and predictable contrast ratios across color levels.</strong></mark> It’s flexible enough to accommodate existing brand colors and lighter or darker palettes. Let’s see how it works:</p>

      <ul><li>You begin by tweaking one of the <strong>starting colors</strong> or pasting the existing color from your design. The tool will use color’s Chroma and Hue to calculate a scale with multiple lightness levels.</li><li><strong>Lightness</strong> is completely customizable and can work both with light and dark palettes. It also provides granular control over a palette to include existing brand colors. In our case, I wanted to preserve the three most used colors from the original Postmark palette&nbsp;— yellow <code>#FFDE00</code>, blue <code>#007DCC</code>, and green <code>#4FC47F</code>. After taking them as starting colors, I used their Lightness values (88.6, 75.2, and 50.6, respectively) as lightness for levels 200, 400, and 600.</li><li><strong>Contrast ratio</strong> depends on Lightness and is calculated for every level using both current WCAG 2.1 Recommendations and a new algorithm in an upcoming 3.0 Working Draft. (The current way of measuring contrast is flawed, but we’ll talk about this later.) By default, the contrast of every color is measured against a white background, but you can select any color swatch to measure the contrast ratio against it.</li><li>Levels can be generated using <strong>RGB or CIELAB</strong> color space. In some cases, the results can be different, so it’s worth experimenting. In the Postmark color scheme, using CIELAB reduced purplish tint in lighter reds (good) but increased in blues (bad).</li></ul>

<h2>Bonus: How are contrast ratios calculated?</h2>
<p>So why does Accessible Palette show <em>two</em> different contrast ratios? WCAG 2.1 calculates the contrast ratio by dividing the luminance of the foreground color by the luminance of the background. The problem is this formula provides a linear response, while humans perceive the contrast between lighter colors as higher than between darker colors. Consider these examples:</p>

    
  
    
                              
            
        
                                
          
        
                                    
      

      
              <figure>
          <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-assets.wildbit.com/blog-images/2021/09/_normal/wcag-2-cr-issues.png" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-assets.wildbit.com/blog-images/2021/09/wcag-2-cr-issues.png 2x" width="610" height="411" itemprop="image" alt="Problems with contrast ratio algorithm in WCAG 2.1" title="Problems with contrast ratio algorithm in WCAG 2.1"></p>

          
        </figure>
      
    
  
    
      <p>In practice, samples meeting the WCAG 2.1 recommendations are harder to read than those with an “insufficient” contrast ratio. Luckily, W3C is aware of this problem, as <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/695" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Andrew Somers started an open discussion</a> back in 2019. (It’s a fascinating and deep reading if you have a spare evening or two.) He proposed a better working algorithm that is now a part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#visual-contrast-of-text" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">WCAG 3 Working Draft</a> and built an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.myndex.com/APCA/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">APCA Contrast Calculator</a> that is perceptually accurate and also takes font size and weight into account. Accessible Palette uses his Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) and considers score 60 as the minimum level recommended for readable text, similar to the old 4.5:1 contrast ratio recommendation in WCAG 2.1.</p>
<p>Let’s see how our examples will hold up with the new algorithm:</p>

    
  
    
                              
            
        
                                
          
        
                                    
      

      
              <figure>
          <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-assets.wildbit.com/blog-images/2021/09/_normal/wcag-3-cr.png" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-assets.wildbit.com/blog-images/2021/09/wcag-3-cr.png 2x" width="610" height="461" itemprop="image" alt="Improved contrast ratio algorithm in WCAG 3 Working Draft" title="Improved contrast ratio algorithm in WCAG 3 Working Draft"></p>

          
        </figure>
      
    
  
    
      <p>Does it mean that WCAG 2.1 contrast ratio is useless? No, it’s still fairly accurate for mid-range colors, but overall the new algorithm is a massive improvement. Keep in mind that it’s still a Working Draft and may change over time. For maximum future-proofness and compliance with current guidelines, try building your color system with both guidelines in mind.<br></p>
<p>As I started working on Postmark’s new color system, I didn’t expect to give up on the most commonly used color model or question WCAG’s current guidelines. This project led me down the rabbit hole of color theory and resulted in a tool that can help build consistent and accessible color palettes with very little effort. This is a rare situation when both designers and users win in the end.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/duplication-cheaper-wrong-abstraction/">https://www.codewithjason.com/duplication-cheaper-wrong-abstraction/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37306769">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p><i>Note: If you disagree with what’s expressed in this post, I encourage you to also take a look at my <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/duplication/">more nuanced and comprehensive post</a> on the topic of code duplication, which gives a more thorough refutation of some of the popular ideas around duplication.</i></p>
<p>“Duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction” is a saying I often hear repeated in the Rails community. I don’t really feel like the expression makes complete sense. I fear that it may lead developers to make poor decisions. Here’s what I take the expression to mean, why I can’t completely get on board with it, and what I would advise instead.</p>
<h2>The idea (as I understand it)</h2>
<p>My understanding of the “duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction” idea, based on <a href="https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">Sandi Metz’s post about it</a>, is as follows. When a programmer refactors a piece of code to be less duplicative, that programmer replaces the duplicative code with a new, non-duplicative abstraction. So far so good, perhaps. But, by creating this new abstraction, the programmer signals to posterity that this new abstraction is “the way things should be” and that this new abstraction ought not to be messed with. As a result, this abstraction gets bastardized over time as maintainers of the code need to change it yet simultaneously feel compelled to preserve it. The abstraction gets littered with conditional logic to behave different ways in different scenarios, and eventually becomes an unreadable mess.</p>
<p>I hope this is a fair and reasonably faithful paraphrasing of Sandi’s idea. Here are the parts of the idea that I agree with, followed by the parts of the idea that I take issue with.</p>
<h2>The parts I agree with</h2>
<p>In my experience it’s absolutely true that existing code has a certain inertia to it. Whether it’s out of caution or laziness or some other motive, it seems that a common approach to existing code is “don’t mess with it too much”. This is often a pretty reasonable approach, especially in codebases with poor <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/test-coverage/">test coverage</a> where broad refactorings aren’t very safe. Unfortunately the “don’t mess with it too much” approach (as Sandi correctly points out) often makes bad code even worse.</p>
<p>I also of course agree that it’s bad when an abstraction gets cluttered up with a bunch of conditional logic to behave differently in different scenarios. Once that happens, the abstraction can hardly be called an abstraction anymore. It’s like two people trying to live in one body.</p>
<p>I also agree with Sandi’s approach to cleaning up poorly-deduplicated code. First, back out the “improvements” and return to the duplicated state. Then begin the de-duplication work anew. Good approach.</p>
<h2>The parts I take issue with</h2>
<h3>What exactly is meant by “the wrong abstraction”?</h3>
<p>I think “the wrong abstraction” is a confused way of referring to poorly-de-duplicated code. Here’s why.</p>
<p>It seems to me that what’s meant by “the wrong abstraction” is “a confusing piece of code littered with conditional logic”. I don’t really see how it makes sense to call that an abstraction at all, let alone the wrong abstraction.</p>
<p>Not every piece of code is an abstraction of course. To me, an <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/abstraction-in-rails/">abstraction</a> is a piece of code that’s expressed in high-level language so that the distracting details are abstracted away. If I were to see a confusing piece of code littered with conditional logic, I wouldn’t see it and think “oh, there’s an incorrect abstraction”, I would just think, “oh, there’s a piece of crappy code”. It’s neither an abstraction nor wrong, it’s just bad code.</p>
<p>So instead of “duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction”, I would say “duplication is cheaper than confusing code littered with conditional logic”. But I actually wouldn’t say that, because I don’t believe duplication is cheaper. I think it’s usually much more expensive.</p>
<h3>When duplication is dearer</h3>
<p>I don’t see how it can be said, without qualification, that duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction. Some certain things must be considered. How bad is the duplication? How bad is the de-duplicated code? Sometimes the duplication is cheaper but sometimes it’s more expensive. How do you know unless you know how good or bad each alternative is? It depends on the scenario.</p>
<p>If the duplication is very small and obvious, and the alternative is to create a puzzling mess, then that duplication is absolutely cheaper than the bad code. But if the duplication is horrendous (for example, the same several lines of code duplicated across distant parts of the codebase dozens of times, and with inconsistent names which make the duplication hard to notice or track down) and the alternative is a piece of code that’s merely imperfect, then I would say that the duplication is more expensive.</p>
<p>In general, I find duplication to typically be more much expensive than the de-duplicated alternative. Duplication can bite you, hard. The worst is when there’s a piece of code that’s duplicated but you don’t know it’s duplicated. In that case you risk changing the code in one place without realizing you’re creating an inconsistency. It’s hard for a poor abstraction to have consequences worse than that.</p>
<h3>Programmers’ reluctance to refactor isn’t a good justification for not DRYing up code</h3>
<p>If a programmer “feels honor-bound to retain the existing abstraction” (to quote Sandi’s post), then to me that sounds like a symptom of a problem that’s distinct from duplication or bad abstractions. If developers are afraid to clean up poor code, then I don’t think the answer is to hold off on fixing duplication problems. I think the answer is to address the reasons why developers are reluctant to clean up existing code. Maybe that reason is a lack of automated tests and code review, or a lack of a culture of <a href="https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/code-review/">collective ownership</a>. Whatever the underlying problem is, fixing that problem surely must be a better response than allowing duplication to live in your codebase.</p>
<h2>My alternative take, summarized</h2>
<p>Instead of “duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction”, I would say the following.</p>
<p>Duplication is bad. In fact, duplication is one of the most dangerous mistakes in coding. Except in very minor cases, duplication is virtually always worth fixing. But not all possible ways of addressing duplication are equally good. Don’t replace a piece of duplicative code with a confusing piece of code that’s made out of if statements.</p>
<p>When you find yourself adding if statements to a piece of code in order to get it to behave differently under different scenarios, you’re creating a confusion. Don’t try to make one thing act like two things. Instead, separate it into two things.</p>
<p>If you feel reluctant to modify someone else’s code, ask why that is. Is it because you feel like you’ll get in trouble if you do? Is it because you don’t understand the code, and there’s little test coverage, and you’re afraid you’ll break something if you make changes that are too drastic? Whatever the underlying reason for your reluctance is, it’s a problem, because it’s holding your organization back from improving its code. Instead of adding more bad code on top of the existing bad code, see if there’s anything you can do to try to address these underlying issues.</p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>As Sandi Metz says (but in my words), confusing code littered with conditionals is not a good way to address duplicative code.</li>
<li>A piece of code filled with conditionals isn’t really an abstraction or even “wrong”, it’s just a confusing piece of code.</li>
<li>Duplication is one of the most dangerous mistakes in coding, and almost always worth fixing. Unless someone really botches the job when de-duplicating a piece of code, the duplicated version is almost always more expensive to maintain than the de-duplicated version.</li>
<li>Try to foster a culture of collective ownership in your organization so that developers aren’t afraid to question or change existing code when the existing code gets out of sync with current needs.</li>
<li>Try to use risk-mitigating practices like automated testing, small changes, and continuous deployment so that when refactorings are needed, you’re not afraid to do them.</li>
</ul>

With over 3 billion users and more than 10 million paying customers who rely on it every day to get things done, Google Workspace is the world’s most popular productivity tool. Our pioneering technology makes collaborating with people easy, fun, and ubiquitously available. With the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/duet-ai">introduction of Duet AI</a>, we added AI as a real-time collaborator. Since its launch, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI as a powerful collaboration partner that can act as a coach, source of inspiration, and productivity booster — all while ensuring every user and organization has <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/protecting-your-data-era-generative-ai">control over their data</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Introducing the next wave of AI innovation in Workspace</h3><p>Sometimes it feels like there isn’t enough time in the day — with so much email, so many meetings, and countless action items to follow up on, work can feel daunting. What if you had an intelligent, real-time collaboration partner that dramatically reduced that burden? With Duet AI, you get to focus on what really matters while it can take care of the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s see how Duet AI can help you in your daily life. Imagine you’re a financial analyst and you get an email at 5 PM from your boss asking for a presentation on Q3 performance by 8 AM tomorrow — we’ve all been there. Instead of scrambling through forecasts in Sheets, P&amp;L Docs, Monthly Business Review Slides, and reading emails from the regional sales leads, you’ll soon be able to simply ask Duet AI to do the heavy lifting with a prompt like “create a summary of Q3 performance.” Duet AI can create a whole new presentation, complete with text, charts, and images, based on your relevant content in Drive and Gmail. A last-minute request that once called for an all-nighter, can now be completed before dinner time. <br></p></span></section><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/20623_DuetAI_WS_Blog_SIDEPANEL_v3.gif" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/20623_DuetAI_WS_Blog_SIDEPANEL_v3.gif" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95">Duet AI can reduce the burden of work by generating a summary from your relevant source documents and automatically building a presentation in Slides.</span></p></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><h3>Meetings you’ll love — even the ones you miss</h3><div><p>For many of us, our days are filled with meetings and it can be exhausting to attend so many, or worse, try to catch up on the ones we miss.

We’re putting <b>Duet AI in Google Meet</b> to help ensure you look and sound your best with <b>studio look</b>, <b>studio lighting</b>, and <b>studio sound</b>. And because sometimes it’s hard for remote participants to see everyone in the conference room, or their colleagues appear far away and out of focus, we’re rolling out <b>dynamic tiles</b> and <b>face detection</b> that give attendees in a meeting room their own video tile with their name. We’re also launching <b>automatic translated captions</b> for 18 languages; Meet will automatically detect when another language is spoken and display the translation in real time.&nbsp;</p></div><p>And to help you better engage during meetings, we’re removing the burden of note-taking and sending out recaps. <b>Duet AI can capture notes, action items, and video snippets in real time with the new “take notes for me” feature and it will send a summary to attendees after the meeting</b>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" data-block-plugin-id="entity_field:node:field_paragraphs">
<p>A news study conducted by University of Rhode Island Professor Jaime Ross investigating the infiltration of microplastics in mammals has revealed that this is far more widespread than initially thought. In fact, the plastic particles were found to bioaccumulate in every organ, including, startlingly enough, the brain.</p>

<p>Microplastics are among the most pervasive pollutants on the planet. They have been <a href="https://www.sustainableplastics.com/news/its-raining-plastic-say-researchers" data-omnilocation="articlebody" data-omnilink="editorial-link">discovered in the air</a>, in <a href="https://www.sustainableplastics.com/news/microplastics-pollution-levels-thames-are-devastating-aquatic-life" data-omnilocation="articlebody" data-omnilink="editorial-link">water systems </a>and food chains around the world. While their negative impacts on marine organisms have been established, few studies have examined the potential health impacts on mammals.</p>

<p>“Research on the health effects of microplastics, especially in mammals, is still very limited,” said Ross, an assistant professor of biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences at the Ryan Institute for Neuroscience and the College of Pharmacy.</p>

<p>The study noted that humans are exposed to microplastics&nbsp; through the consumption of ‘water, seafood, consumer products (clothes, toothpaste, salt, sugar, honey, beer, anything stored in plastic bottles, plastic wrap, or cans/cartons lined with plastic), and via inhalation from textiles, synthetic rubber tires, and plastic covers’. They have been detected, among others, in <a href="https://www.sustainableplastics.com/news/dutch-study-finds-microplastics-human-blood-first-time" data-omnilocation="articlebody" data-omnilink="editorial-link">blood</a> and even breast milk - findings that warrant more investigation into the health outcomes of such exposure in mammals. Currently, there are limited studies that address the potential adverse effects of exposure to MPs on brain health in mammals and even fewer studies that consider age as an additional factor that may impact the outcome of exposure to microplastics - the reason Ross and her team chose to focus on neurobehavioral effects and inflammatory response to exposure to microplastics, as well as the accumulation of microplastics in tissues. Together with graduate students Lauren Gaspar and Sydney Bartman, she examined the biological and cognitive consequences of exposure to microplastics in mice.</p>

<p>The drinking water of a diverse group of older and younger mice was spiked with microplastics over a period of three weeks - with ‘striking’ results, said Ross. The researchers found that exposure to microplastics - in this case, fluorescent polystyrene particles -&nbsp; induced both behavioural changes and alterations in immune markers in liver and brain tissues. The mice in the study began to move peculiarly, and to exhibit behaviours reminiscent of dementia in humans. The results were even more profound in older animals.</p>

<p>“These were not high doses of microplastics, but in only a short period of time, we saw these changes,” Ross said. “Nobody really understands the life cycle of these microplastics in the body, so part of what we want to address is the question of what happens as you get older. Are you more susceptible to systemic inflammation from these microplastics as you age? Can your body get rid of them as easily? Do your cells respond differently to these toxins?”</p>

<p>After three weeks, dissection of the mice revealed that the ingested PS micro-particles had infiltrated every every tissue sample - liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, lung, spleen, heart, and brain tissues from both young and old exposed mice&nbsp; - tested. The particles were also observed in the mice’s bodily wastes.</p>

<p>“The detection of MPs in tissues such as the heart and lungs … suggests that the PS-MPs (polystyrene microplastics) are going beyond the digestive system and likely undergoing systemic circulation,” the authors write. An observation they note that is further supported by the detection of microplastics in urine and the brain, indicating they can pass the blood–brain barrier.</p>

<p>That brain infiltration also may cause a decrease in glial fibrillary acidic protein, called “GFAP”, a protein that supports many cell processes in the brain, results have shown. Previous studies have suggested that GFAP expression might decrease in early stages of some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, or in younger patients with depression disorders.</p>

<p>What is especially concerning is the fact that these changes were seen after just three weeks of exposure to microplastics. As human exposure today is inevitable it is therefore essential to better understand their toxicity to limit their impact on human health. The present study, showed that in just three weeks, polystyrene particles measuring 0.1 and 2 μm can reduce cell viability, translocate throughout the body, accumulate in tissues including brain tissue, markedly modify behaviour in mice, and significantly alter immune markers in both the liver and the brain. Additionally, the effects of exposure seem to be age-dependent.</p>

<p>Future work is needed to examine these factors in order to understand the mechanisms behind these effects and the changes seen with age, said Ross.</p>

<p>“We want to understand how plastics may change the ability for the brain to maintain its homeostasis or how exposure may lead to neurological disorders and diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease,” she said.</p>

<p>The study was published in the International Journal of Molecular Science. It was supported by the Rhode Island Medical Research Foundation, Roddy Foundation, Plastics Initiative, URI College of Pharmacy, George and Anne Ryan Institute for Neuroscience, and the Rhode Island Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network of Biomedical Research Excellence from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.</p>

                    <p><span><span>Inside the failed sockets, the zinc casting that held the cable wires in place experienced significant material flow, or creep, allowing some of the wires to slip. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The neutron imaging revealed that the zinc flowed slowly under stress when the splayed-out cable wires alone could no longer resist the tension on the cables. The sockets failed because the zinc continued to flow until the cables entirely pulled out of the sockets. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“Our analysis detected significant slippage of wires in the region of interest, on the order of multiple wire diameters,” Brügger said. “This indicates that the wires slipped at some point, but it cannot be surmised whether this slipping occurred during the structural failure event or before.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Although the final report by the forensic engineers concluded that other natural forces had only a negligible effect on the collapse, the earthquakes and hurricanes that impacted Puerto Rico over the years do generally add dynamic loading on such structures. “I suppose you could say the telescope at Arecibo had been shaken <em>and</em> stirred by those events,” Brügger quipped, alluding to James Bond’s favorite drink. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The <a href="https://www.thorntontomasetti.com/news/arecibo-collapse-forensic-report-released">Thornton Tomasetti report</a>, which includes the neutron analyses, states the two cable failures that occurred before the collapse and the third cable failure that triggered the collapse all happened near or inside zinc-filled sockets at cable ends. Each failure involved both the rupture of some of the cable’s wires and a deformation of the socket’s zinc, and was therefore a failure of the cable/socket assemblies.</span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h3>Aug 29 2023</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/ipvnQ92fc1" alt="A broken fuse"></p>
<p>Border Gateway Protocol is the de facto protocol that directs routing decisions between different ISP networks, and is generally known as the “glue” that holds the internet together. It’s safe to say that the internet we currently know would not function without working BGP implementations.</p>
<p>However, the software on those networks’ routers (I will refer to these as edge devices from now on) that implements BGP has not had a flawless track record. Flaws and problems do exist in commercial and open source implementations of the world’s most critical routing protocol.</p>
<p>Most of these flaws are of course benign in the grand scheme of things; they will be issues around things like route filtering, or insertion, or <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/bgp-stuck-routes-tcp-zero-window">handling withdraws</a>. However a much more scary issue is a BGP bug that can propagate after causing bad behaviour, akin to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm">computer worm</a>.</p>
<p>While debugging support for a future feature for my business (bgp.tools) I took a brief diversion to investigate something, and what I came out with might be one of the most concerning things I’ve discovered for the reliability of the internet. To understand the problems, though, we will need a bit more context.</p>
<h2>A mistaken attribute</h2>
<p>On 2 June 2023, a <a href="https://bgp.tools/as/264366">small Brazilian network</a> (re)announced one of their internet routes with a small bit of information called an attribute that was corrupted. The information on this route was for a feature that had not finished standardisation, but was set up in such a way that if an intermediate router did not understand it, then the intermediate router would pass it on unchanged.</p>
<p>As many routers did not understand this attribute, this was no problem for them. They just took the information and propagated it along. However it turned out that Juniper routers running even slightly modern software did understand this attribute, and since the attribute was corrupted the software in its default configuration would respond by raising an error that would shut down the whole BGP session. Since a BGP session is often a critical part of being “connected” to the wider internet, this resulted in the small Brazilian network disrupting other networks’ ability to communicate with the rest of the internet, despite being 1000’s of miles away.</p>
<p>The packet that causes session shutdowns was really quite benign at first glance:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/7CcFultij0" alt="A screenshot of wireshark"></p>
<p>When a BGP session shuts down due to errors, customer network traffic generally stops flowing down that cable until the BGP connection is automatically restarted (typically within seconds to minutes).</p>
<p>This appears to be what happened to a number of different carriers, for example <a href="https://bgp.tools/as/8220">COLT</a> was heavily impacted by this. Their outage is what originally drew some of my attention to this subject area.</p>
<p>To understand why this sort of thing can happen, we’ll need to take a deeper look at what BGP route attributes are, and what they’re used for.</p>
<h2>What is a BGP Route Attribute?</h2>
<p>At their core a BGP UPDATEs purpose is to tell another router about some traffic that it can (or can no longer) send to it. However just knowing directly what you can send to another router is not very useful without <em>context</em>.</p>
<p>For this reason a BGP packet is split up into two sections: the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) data (aka, the IP address ranges), and the attributes that help describe extra context about that reachability data.</p>
<p>Arguably the most used attribute is the AS_PATH (or actually, the AS4_PATH), an attribute that tells you which networks a route has travelled through to get to you. Routers use this list of networks to pick paths for their traffic that are either the fastest, economically viable, or least congested, playing a critical role in ensuring that things run smoothly.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there are over 32 different route attribute types, 14 deprecated ones, and 209 officially unassigned ones. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is in charge of <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-parameters/bgp-parameters.xhtml#bgp-parameters-2">assigning codes to each BGP attribute type codes</a>, normally off the back of IETF Internet-Drafts. The IANA list doesn’t always give the full story, though, as not all internet-drafts make their way into more official documents (like RFC’s), so code numbers are assigned (or sometimes even “squatted”) to attribute types that did not get wide deployment.</p>
<h2>Unknown attribute propagation</h2>
<p>At the start of every route attribute is a set of flags, conveying information about the attribute. One important flag is called the “transitive bit”:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/BSaiOklQh0" alt="A wireshark decoding of the BGP Path Attribuites Flags"></p>
<p>If a BGP implementation does not understand an attribute, and the transitive bit is set, it will copy it to another router. If the router does understand the attribute then it may apply its own policy.</p>
<p>At a glance this “feature” seems like an incredibly bad idea, as it allows possibly unknown information to propagate blindly through systems that do not understand the impact of what they are forwarding. However this feature has also allowed widespread deployment of things like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8195">Large Communities</a> to happen faster, and has arguably made deployment of new BGP features possible at all.</p>
<h2>When attribute decoding goes wrong</h2>
<p>What happens when an attribute fails to decode? The answer depends strongly on if the BGP implementation has been updated to use <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7606">RFC 7606</a> logic or not; If the session is <em>not</em> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7606">RFC 7606</a> compliant, then typically an error is raised and the session is shut down. If it is, the session can usually continue as normal (except the routes impacted by the decoding error are treated as unreachable).</p>
<p>BGP session shutdowns are particularly undesirable, as they will impact traffic flow along a path. However in the case of a “Transitive” error they can become worm-like. Since not all BGP implementations support the same attributes, an attribute that is unknown to one implementation (and subsequently forwarded along) can cause another implementation to shut down the session it received it from.</p>
<p>With some reasonably educated crafting of a payload, someone could design a BGP UPDATE that “travels” along the internet unharmed, until it reaches a targeted vendor and results in that vendor resetting sessions. If that data comes down the BGP connections that are providing wider internet access for the network, this could result in a network being pulled offline from the internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/vQvI0ZQC9V" alt=""></p>
<p>This attack is not even a one-off “hit-and-run”, as the “bad” route is still stored in the peer router; when the session restarts the victim router will reset again the moment the route with the crafted payload is transmitted again. This has the potential to cause prolonged internet or peering outages.</p>
<p>This is a large part of why the RFC mentioned earlier, RFC 7606, exists; looking at its security considerations section, we can see a description of this exact problem::</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Security Considerations
This specification addresses the vulnerability of a BGP speaker to a
potential attack whereby a distant attacker can generate a malformed
optional transitive attribute that is not recognized by intervening
routers. Since the intervening routers do not recognize the
attribute, they propagate it without checking it. When the malformed
attribute arrives at a router that does recognize the given attribute
type, that router resets the session over which it arrived. Since
significant fan-out can occur between the attacker and the routers
that do recognize the attribute type, this attack could potentially
be particularly harmful.</p>

<p>In a basic BGP setup this is bad, but with extra engineering it could be used to partition large sections of the internet. If BGP sessions between carriers are forced to reset in this way, causing traffic flow to stop, some routes on the internet would not have alternatives to use, making this a family of bugs that is a grave threat to the overall reliability of the internet.</p>
<h2>Building a basic fuzzer</h2>
<div>
<p><b>Important Commitment:</b> I run a business that involves being peered to many IXP route servers and other peoples routers. I have not and will not ever test for BGP bugs/exploits on customer/partner sessions (unless they give consent).</p>
<p>All testing here has been done either on <a href="https://www.gns3.com/">GNS3</a> VMs, or physical hardware I have hanging around and in isolated VLANs.</p>
</div>
<p>To figure out if this would be a practically exploitable attack, I decided to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">fuzzer</a> that would try to stuff random data in random attribute codes to see if I could get sessions to reset on different vendors BGP implementations.</p>
<p>Because I am looking for problems that are “wormable”, I added a <a href="https://bird.network.cz/">Bird 2</a> router in between my fuzzer and the router being tested. This way Bird will filter out all of the obvious non-exploitable issues, and leave me with the packets that are of concern.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/ppvsN8rslG" alt=""></p>
<p>All good fuzzers should be able to run unattended, so how do we teach the fuzzer to tell if the session has reset itself? The solution I came to was that the Victim router would always announce a keepalive prefix, 192.0.2.0/24 (aka <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5735"><code>TEST-NET-1</code></a>) and the fuzzer would treat a withdraw of that prefix (from the intermediate bird router) as a sign the session went down, and report back the parameters that caused that to happen!</p>
<p>Testing the fuzzer, I can see that the bird output shows unknown attributes as their type code, and a hex encoding of their contents. In addition it puts a <code>[t]</code> to indicate that it is transitive.</p>
<pre><code>198.51.100.0/24      unicast [fuzzer 21:31:24.378] * (100) [AS65001?]
	via 192.168.5.1 on ens5
	Type: BGP univ
	BGP.origin: Incomplete
	BGP.as_path: 65001
	BGP.next_hop: 192.168.5.1
	BGP.local_pref: 100
	BGP.community: (123,2345)
	BGP.ec [t]: 7d cc c7 30
</code></pre>
<p>Now that the fuzzer was able to run itself, all that was left was to test all of the vendors one by one…</p>
<h2>Fuzzer findings / Impacted Vendors</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that the described issues are applicable if you are running an edge device with full BGP tables. If you are not running a “full routing table” or a partial peering table, then you are less likely to be impacted by these discoveries.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind, the issues below are different to the ones that <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#route-to-bugs-analyzing-the-security-of-bgp-message-parsing-32162">the team at Forescout recently presented at BlackHat</a>.</p>
<p>Unimpacted Vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>MikroTik RouterOS 7+</li>
<li>Ubiquiti EdgeOS</li>
<li>Arista EOS</li>
<li>Huawei NE40</li>
<li>Cisco IOS-XE / “Classic” / XR</li>
<li>Bird 1.6, All versions of Bird 2.0</li>
</ul>
<h2>Juniper JunOS Impact</h2>
<p>Similar to the problem that caused this research to be done, another exploitable Attribute was found in the form of Attribute 29 (BGP-LS). Due to the nature of the attribute it is unlikely that an exploit attempt will propagate too far over the internet, however peering sessions and route servers are still at risk.</p>
<p>All Juniper users are <strong>urged</strong> to enable <code>bgp-error-tolerance</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[edit protocols bgp]
root# show 
group TRANSIT {
    import import-pol;
    export send-direct;
    peer-as 4200000001;
    local-as 4200000002;
    neighbor 192.0.2.2;
}
bgp-error-tolerance;
</code></pre>
<p>In all tested cases, enabling bgp-error-tolerance does not reset sessions, and applies the improved behaviour without restarting sessions.</p>
<p>A JunOS software release is expected in the future to correct this. One member of staff at Juniper has also <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haas-idr-bgp-attribute-escape-00">authored an Internet-Draft at the IETF</a> around handling these issues. Juniper is tracking this issue as CVE-2023-4481.</p>
<h2>Nokia SR-OS Impact</h2>
<p>Fuzzing SR-OS (Version 22.10) revealed many, likely highly propagatable and thus exploitable attributes.</p>
<p>All Nokia SR-OS and SR-Linux users are <strong>urged</strong> to enable <code>error-handling update-fault-tolerance</code> on their devices.</p>
<pre><code> bgp
     group "TRANSIT"              
         export "yes"
         error-handling
             update-fault-tolerance
         exit
         neighbor 192.0.2.2
             peer-as 2
         exit
     exit
     no shutdown
 exit
</code></pre>
<p>In all tested cases, enabling update-fault-tolerance does not reset sessions, and applies the improved behaviour without restarting sessions.</p>
<p>To the best of my understanding, Nokia has no plans to correct these issues, instead suggesting customers apply <code>error-handling update-fault-tolerance</code> to their BGP groups.</p>
<h2>FRR Impact (and other downstream vendors)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/FRRouting/frr">FRR</a> attempts to handle bad attributes using RFC 7606 behaviour. However the fuzzer discovered that a corrupted attribute 23 (Tunnel Encapsulation) will cause a session to go down regardless.</p>
<p>After reporting this bug to FRR maintainers I received an acknowledgement of the issue and understanding that the issue is a DoS risk to FRR users, but I have not managed to get anything out of FRR since.</p>
<p>This bug is being tracked as CVE-2023-38802 and at the time of writing has no patch or fix.</p>
<p>FRR is packaged inside many other products, to name a few: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SONiC_(operating_system)">SONIC</a>, <a href="https://www.pica8.com/">PICA8</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/networking/ethernet-switching/cumulus-linux/">Cumulus</a>, and <a href="https://www.danosproject.org/">DANOS</a>.</p>
<h2>OpenBSD OpenBGPd Impact</h2>
<p>OpenBGPd also supports the improved RFC 7606 behaviour, however it was found that the recently added <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9234.html">Only To Customer</a> implementation could cause session resets. This issue was very rapidly fixed after being reported to them, and is tracked as CVE-2023-38283.</p>
<p>OpenBSD users can install <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/errata73.html">Eratta 006</a> to mitigate this issue.</p>
<h2>Extreme Networks EXOS Impact</h2>
<p>As a result of fuzzing EXOS, the program revealed 2 highly propagatable and thus exploitable attributes in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attribute 21: AS_PATHLIMIT</li>
<li>Attribute 25: IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community</li>
</ul>
<p>There is currently no known patch or mitigating config for this issue.</p>
<p>I made Extreme aware of this problem, however after a back and forth with them waiting for what I understood was an implied release of a patch or fix, they communicated that they will not be fixing it in the near future.</p>
<p>A quote from the security email thread (I’ve added emphasis to the critical parts of their response):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After review of all the material, <strong>we are not considering this a vulnerability due to the presence of RFC 7606</strong>, as well as a history of documentation expressing these concerns all the way back to early 2000s, if not earlier. Malformed attributes are not a novel concept as an attack vector to BGP networks, as evidenced by RFC 7606, which is almost a decade old.
As such, customers that have chosen to not require or implement RFC 7606 have done so willingly and with knowledge of what is needed to defend against these types of attacks. Thus, the expectation that we’ll reset our BGP sessions based on RFC 4271 attribute handling is proper. We do abide by other RFCs, in which we claim support, that update RFC 4271.
Other vendors do claim RFC 7606 support and have been sharing these controls as a mitigation to malformed attribute response. They don’t appear to be producing new work product to account for these behaviors.
<strong>We are evaluating support for RFC 7606 as a future feature.</strong> Obviously, if customers desire a different response, we’ll work through our normal feature request pipelines to address. This is no different than any other RFC support request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot overstate how much I disagree with Extreme’s response to this, and in the interests of full transparency (and to avoid any allegations of editorialising this, in my view, extremely poor response), I have made the full email exchange available here: <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/JgH8G5duO1">(PDF)</a>.</p>
<h2>The Vendor Security Response</h2>
<p>I’ve been through my fair share of security issue discoveries, and over time I’ve taken a stronger leaning into “simply do not report” or “full disclosure without warning”, rather than the now commonly accepted 90 day “responsible disclosure” methodology. This is mostly because I’ve had really poor experiences when disclosing issues to security teams.</p>
<p>The bugs discussed in this post cover many vendors and implementations. Full disclosure was originally my plan, however due to the clear risk of harm to the general internet routing system from these findings, I felt it was likely inexcusable to do full-disclosure. (Plus, a malicious deployment of these findings could have a small but I believe very real chance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action">“kinetic response”</a> from a misunderstanding.)</p>
<p>Overall the response from vendors has been mostly disappointing. One vendor was extremely hard to find contacts for, and I feel that they were stringing me along for some time, only to reply back that they were not going to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Other vendors notably were not immediately interested in notifying customers of mitigating config to the problems, however when I personally started extending notices to my peers at larger carriers about the problems (since if they were not going to, I was going to try and reduce the exploit surface) a vendor notice was issued.</p>
<p>No vendor that I reported to has any form of bug bounty, and this entire adventure has consumed huge volumes of my time and mental capacity. In a normal situation this “cost” would have simply been eaten by an employer whose interest is name recognition or altruistic actions. However I am self-employed with my own company (that admittedly does have an interest in a functioning BGP ecosystem), and so this entire adventure has simply delayed product development that I (and customers) really would have liked to have done.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, my “good faith” advice to people reporting security bugs in network vendor software is that contacting vendors is not an effective solution.</p>
<p>The people on the other side are either already overloaded, or generally don’t care about receiving issues. Since there is no motivation to report bugs (either in the form of bug bounties, or being treated well), I see no reason to do responsible disclosure (apart from cases where it would clearly protect their innocent customers from misery, while accounting for the risk of a vendor simply doing nothing).</p>
<p>The two options, as far as I see it, are either being strung along by a vendor over email for 90 days and then likely finding out nothing is done, or full disclosure.</p>
<p>I worry about the state of networking vendors.</p>
<p>With that being said, I would like to thank the OpenBSD security team, who very rapidly acknowledged my report, and prepared a patch. My only regret with dealing with the OpenBSD team was reporting the issue to them too quickly, as they are uninterested in waiting for any kind of coordination in disclosure.</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, with a few of the vendors (Nokia, Extreme, Juniper) I found myself contacting their own customers myself to warn them to enable mitigating config, as that proved to be a much more effective way at preventing risk than trying to push the vendor itself into action.</p>
<p>As a result at least several incumbent ISPs, 1 large CDN, and 2 “Tier 1” networks have applied configuration to help prevent these issues from impacting them.</p>
<p>If the goal of reporting security flaws is to reduce harm to their customers, I’m not convinced that reporting problems to vendors has enough of an effective impact to be worth doing, vs the loss of personal time and sanity.</p>
<p>Several people I spoke to have been incredibly helpful (some who could not be listed here). I would like to thank the following people for having some role in helping me either discover/disclose these problems, editing this post, or general support for when vendors were being very frustrating.</p>

There are other characteristics, such as fluency and relevance that are also important, but LLMs are actually pretty good at both of those. Factuality (or its evil twin: hallucination) on the other hand is a known issue with LLMs. And it’s no use being fluent if you’re wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Simultaneously, one question that is on everyone’s mind is: how do open-use LLMs like Llama 2 compare with established closed products like OpenAI <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> and <code>gpt-4</code>?</p><h2>The Literature</h2><p>Recent literature on summaries and summary evaluation has shown one consistent pattern: LLMs are really good at summarization based on human evaluation, and leave the previous generation of carefully engineered summarization systems behind. Primarily, however, these evals have focused on <code>gpt-3</code> or <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> and this has not been applied to open source LLMs; nor were they done with <code>gpt-4</code>.&nbsp;</p><div><p>One of the most challenging aspects of summarizing well turns out to be factuality: is the summary that is given faithful and consistent with the article it was based on? There’s been a lot of research on factuality. In particular, this </p><a href="https://aclanthology.org/P19-1213/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>paper</u></a><p> discussed an interesting methodology for evaluating factuality: What if you asked an LLM to rank which answer was more factually consistent. They also included an interesting data set with </p><a href="https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/handle/tudatalib/2002" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>373 news sentences</u></a><p> sentences and two summary sentences, an incorrect one and a correct one. For example, it would have a situation like this one.</p><p><code>insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair -- both rivals for miliband's ear -- to a head.</code></p></div><p>And now consider A and B</p><p>A: <code>insiders say the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair.</code><br>B: <code>insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear.</code></p><p>Clearly the second one is inconsistent – the tension is between the two contenders, not within Miliband’s ear.&nbsp;</p><h2>A practical experiment</h2><p>Clearly these type of factual errors being present in a summary would be detrimental. So, how do we decide which LLMs are better at deciding which statements are factual and which are not? It is not too much of a stretch to conclude that a system that is better at telling factual from non-factual sentences is better at not making them up in the first place – or alternatively could decide through a two stage process if it was being inconsistent.&nbsp;</p><p>So, how can we evaluate these options? Let’s say we have 5 LLMs we want to test: Llama 2’s 3 different sizes, <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> and <code>gpt-4</code>. How can we run this eval? In total we have almost 2000 queries to make.&nbsp;</p><p>Answer: Ray to the rescue. Ray makes it very easy to parallelize queries like this. In practice, the biggest problem running this experiment was the stringent rate limiting on OpenAI’s <code>gpt-4</code> (and even <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>). Anyscale Endpoints was far more accommodating in this regard. </p><p>We can write two nested ray tasks as follows:&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code><code><span>1

While <code>gpt-3.5</code>, <code>gpt-4</code> and <code>Llama-2-70b</code> followed instructions, Llama 2 7b and 13b did not. We did try variants of the prompt to get Llama 2 7b/13b to improve instruction compliance, but none of our efforts panned out. </p><h2>Two Practical Problems on the way</h2><p>As with any research activity, it’s the surprises along the way that are sometimes the most interesting. We share these to help others also avoid the issues and not sweep them under the rug. </p><h3>Following instructions</h3><p>We discovered that LLMs do not always follow instructions. The LLMs were given very specific instructions to produce only an A or a B. This was not adhered to as a general rule. <code>Llama-2-70b</code> and <code>gpt-4</code> were the best at this, with <code>gpt-3.5</code> being close enough that you could get away with writing a few regular expressions (‘Answer: A’, ‘Option: A’, ‘A’, ‘Answer (A)’, ‘The answer is A’). We tried tweaking the prompt numerous ways but it did not change the results significantly. </p><p>This could be remedied in a few ways: </p><ul><li><p>Using fine-tuned variants of Llama 2 for instruction following vs chat. Meta did not make such models available and we wanted to stick to the official releases.</p></li><li><p>Using OpenAI’s function templates. This would be an alternative approach.</p></li><li><p>Tweaking the prompts. We spent a lot of time messing around with this but it didn’t seem to make a material difference for <code>Llama-2-7b</code> and <code>Llama-2-13b</code>.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>In the end we chose to craft a simple prompt and use Llama-2-70b with a simple prompt.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code><code><span>1

We eyeballed the first 100 instances and didn’t find a single error.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ordering bias</h3><p>On the first run of these numbers, <code>gpt-3.5</code> seemed to show <i>amazing </i>results – it got 360 of the 373 correct (96%). If it’s too good to be true, it probably is. Given that humans perform at 84% accuracy, that seemed unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p>For this run, we had made it so that the correct answer was always the first (option A).&nbsp;</p><p>Diving in, we discovered that <code>gpt-3.5</code> had an <i>ordering bias</i> – it strongly preferred the first option presented to it. We reversed the ordering so the <i>second </i>answer was the correct one. Then it suddenly goes from returning the correct answer 360 times to 206. This is therefore a huge bias.&nbsp;</p><p>We still want to continue with our experiments. What should we do? We run the vote both ways, once with A being the correct answer, and one with B being the correct answer. We only consider an answer correct if it gives the correct answer both times (A the first time, B the second time).&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, this allows us to compute bias in an interesting way. Consider if when we swap the input ordering it <i>still </i>votes A on both or B on both. Similarly if it said BB on both, that would indicate a bias towards B. </p><p>We can then simply define ordering bias as</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/xjan103pcp94/2AYi6McoXny8GOHjzIsHJx/ab751a55cd1b968fcf828f38adfb7c86/orderbias_equation.png" alt="orderbias equatio"></p></div><p>Generally we found one of the two was much greater than the other.

On this task <code>gpt-4</code> and <code>Llama-2-70b</code> are almost on par.<b> </b>This shows that the gap in quality between open source and closed LLMs is now smaller than ever. <code>Llama-2-70b</code> handily outpaces <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>.</p><p>So the answer to the question: can you trust Llama 2 to be factual, at least based on this experiment? Yes. It’s close to human performance. </p><h3>Ordering bias</h3><p><code>Llama-2-7b</code> and <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> and to some extent <code>Llama-2-13b</code> had severe <i>ordering bias </i>issues. The larger models did not seem to have this. This means they are probably <i>not </i>suitable for summaries where factuality at or near human level is required.&nbsp;</p><p>For future work, we will investigate mechanisms to reduce ordering bias through careful crafting of prompts. </p><h3><br>Cost</h3><p>We can use the data in this experiment to also estimate the cost of summarization generally. We used current <a href="https://openai.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>OpenAI pricing</u></a> as of Aug 22, 2023 and current <a href="https://docs.endpoints.anyscale.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Anyscale Endpoints pricing</u></a> as of Aug 22, 2023 to build the table below. If we assume we can prompt the LLMs to produce summaries of equal length (which should be possible) and we target a summarization factor of 0.2 (1 word of summary for each word of input), we get the following table:&nbsp;</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/xjan103pcp94/3E3aI1K6fiOD7pbIqLgpGJ/2de2b0edacbb420bcda189247872343e/image__6_.png" alt="Model Summary 1"></p></div><p>Note that:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><code>gpt-4</code> and <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> use the same tokenization and the Llama models also use the same tokenization. This is why the input tokens are the same.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>However, Llama’s tokenization is not as efficient and uses roughly 19% more tokens for the same English passage.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>We use price per million tokens as our standard unit. This required multiplying the prices on OpenAI’s page by 1000. This makes no difference to the final output.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Based on these results, the cost for summarization with <code>gpt-4</code> is still 30 times more than the cost of <code>Llama-2-70b</code>, even though both are about the same level of factuality. The numbers do not significantly change for a summary ratio anywhere in the 0.1(28x) to 0.3 (31x)&nbsp; range since the dominant factor is clearly the input token price.</p><p>We also wanted to estimate how much this experiment cost. While this is not necessarily indicative of real world performance on summarization tasks, we felt it revealed some interesting patterns and nuances in the cost of different models.&nbsp;</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/xjan103pcp94/5oI9IViJrZ0hecpPAlWrLp/90b94423083e053048c9eb1423052cb4/image__7_.png" alt="Model Summary 2"></p></div><p>A few notes before we get to observations:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The output tokens are vastly different. This is not a mistake. <code>gpt-4</code>’s output would typically be a single character like ‘A’. <code>Llama-2-70b</code>’s was far more verbose, e.g. ‘The correct answer is A: those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year. Explanation: Summary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning that those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year. It maintains the same meaning and information as the original sentence. On the other hand, Summary B is inconsistent with the article sentence. It suggests that the ABC's report only mentioned that those who receive centrelink payments made up radio rental's income last year, which is not entirely accurate. The article sentence explicitly states that the ABC reported that those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year. Therefore, Summary A is the better choice’.</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<code>Llama-2-70b</code> is still the most concise of the Llama 2 models.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Now, moving on to observations:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><code>gpt-4</code> cost 18x times as much as <code>Llama-2-70b</code> even though on this task they have similar performance.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Surprisingly, the combination of these two factors means that <code>Llama-2-70b</code>’s cost is about 10 per cent higher than gpt-3.5’s. Nonetheless, the difference in performance may mean this extra 10% is worth it.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>The “how”</h2><p>You can see the code for the eval <a href="https://github.com/anyscale/factuality-eval" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>here</u></a>. As you can see it’s not very complicated. In particular we found that: </p><ul><li><p>Using Ray allows us to massively accelerate speed of evaluations. Without Ray, the evaluations would have taken hours, with Ray, it came down to minutes. When you think about live, production AI applications, that can translate to enormous cloud cost savings.</p></li><li><p>Pandas, though traditionally designed for numerical data, is also <i>very </i>useful for processing text. The ability to quickly and easily add columns and apply map functions to columns is powerful. Combining the power of Ray to do lots of computation with the ability of Pandas to pull that data together and simplify analysis is a very powerful combination.</p></li><li><p>We used <a href="https://app.endpoints.anyscale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Anyscale Endpoints</u></a> for the llama models, and OpenAI for the <code>gpt-3.5</code>/<code>gpt-4</code> models. The exact same code could be used for both cases because Anyscale Endpoints has an OpenAI compatible API. Anyscale Endpoints proved to be very stable and the higher rate limit made processing much faster. This is another example of where efficient infrastructure can deliver significant cloud cost savings.</p></li></ul><h2>Final Conclusions</h2><div><p>In this document we showed a comparison of Open Source and Private LLMs for their factuality. <code>Llama-2-70b</code> handily beat <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>, and was approaching human/<code>gpt-4</code> levels of performance. This means <code>Llama-2-70b</code> is well and truly viable as an alternative to closed LLMs like those of OpenAI. We now know there’s a high probability that if we use either <code>Llama-2-70b</code> or <code>gpt-4</code>, there is a good chance it will be on par with humans for factuality.</p><p>A second lesson is to spend time with your data to discover issues like the ordering bias we saw in <code>gpt-3.5</code>. If “it’s too good to be true it probably is” applies equally well for LLMs.Llama 2 is about as factually accurate as GPT-4 for summaries and is 30X cheaper</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The 110V issue is simply that once Tesla and Westinghouse proved long distance AC transmission feasible, the #1 issue driving the proliferation of electrification was lighting in houses, replacing the gas and oil lighting that was a major fire hazard of the day. Edison's lamps were 100V, but a lamp does not care if it gets AC or DC. So our AC distribution system, AT THE RESIDENTIAL LEVEL, was designed to take advantage of the existing installed base and inventory availability of Edison's lamps. Then as personal appliances began proliferating, they were designed to take advantage of the 110VAC lighting circuits already used in houses and the concept cemented itself into our culture to where there was no going back.</p>

<p>The 50/60Hz issue is different and is not "metric" at all (what's metric about the number 50?). Despite Westinghouse/Tesla having championed it, AC only really took off here once Edison gave in to the inevitability. Edison, despite having investing in AEG as Europe began electrifying, was reluctant to allow a system in which Europeans could enter our market by selling electrical products here. So after also experimenting with different frequencies (40Hz was the first major industrial installation, at the Folsom Power House in California), Edison and Steinmetz settled on 60Hz, partly because of the flicker issue, then also because it would make European equipment incompatible. He wanted it all to himself... which is the same motivation behind his initial push to discredit AC distribution in the first place. He wanted DC because he owned the US patent rights to his DC dynamo (even though he actually bought his first one, for proof of concept, from Werner von Siemens. Yes, THAT Siemens... Siemens had not patented it in the US). So if DC had won, we would have had Edison DC dynamos every 5 miles or so. Only the rich would be able to afford it, and they would all be paying Edison for the privilege. Tesla's egalitarianism ruined his vision.</p>

  <article>
    <p>There is a machine learning bubble, but the technology is here to stay. Once the
bubble pops, the world <em>will</em> be changed by machine learning. But it will
probably be crappier, not better.</p>
<p>Contrary to the AI doomer’s expectations, the world isn’t going to go down in
flames any faster thanks to AI. Contemporary advances in machine learning aren’t
really getting us any closer to AGI, and as Randall Monroe pointed out back in
2018:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/robot_future_2x.png" alt="A panel from the webcomic “xkcd” showing a timeline from now into the distantfuture, dividing the timeline into the periods between “AI becomes advancedenough to control unstoppable swarms of robots” and “AI becomes self-aware andrebels against human control”. The period from self-awareness to the indefinitefuture is labelled “the part lots of people seem to worry about”; Randall isinstead worried about the part between these two epochs."></p>
<p>What will happen to AI is boring old capitalism. Its staying power will come in
the form of replacing competent, expensive humans with crappy, cheap robots.
LLMs are a pretty good advance over Markov chains, and stable diffusion can
generate images which are only somewhat uncanny with sufficient manipulation of
the prompt. Mediocre programmers will use GitHub Copilot to write trivial code
and boilerplate for them (trivial code is tautologically uninteresting), and ML
will probably remain useful for writing cover letters for you. Self-driving cars
might show up Any Day Now™, which is going to be great for sci-fi
enthusiasts and technocrats, but much worse in every respect than, say,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dKrUE_O0VE">building more trains</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest lasting changes from machine learning will be more like the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reduction in the labor force for skilled creative work</li>
<li>The complete elimination of humans in customer-support roles</li>
<li>More convincing spam and phishing content, more scalable scams</li>
<li>SEO hacking content farms dominating search results</li>
<li>Book farms (both eBooks and paper) flooding the market</li>
<li>AI-generated content overwhelming social media</li>
<li>Widespread propaganda and astroturfing, both in politics and advertising</li>
</ul>
<p>AI companies will continue to generate waste and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at a
huge scale as they aggressively scrape all internet content they can find,
externalizing costs onto the world’s digital infrastructure, and feed their
hoard into GPU farms to generate their models. They might keep humans in the
loop to help with tagging content, seeking out the cheapest markets with the
weakest labor laws to build human sweatshops to feed the AI data monster.</p>
<p>You will never trust another product review. You will never speak to a human
being at your ISP again. Vapid, pithy media will fill the digital world around
you. Technology built for engagement farms – those AI-edited videos with the
grating machine voice you’ve seen on your feeds lately – will be white-labeled
and used to push products and ideologies at a massive scale with a minimum cost
from social media accounts which are populated with AI content, cultivate an
audience, and sold in bulk and in good standing with the Algorithm.</p>
<p>All of these things are already happening and will continue to get worse. The
future of media is a soulless, vapid regurgitation of all media that came before
the AI epoch, and the fate of all new creative media is to be subsumed into the
roiling pile of math.</p>
<p>This will be incredibly profitable for the AI barons, and to secure their
investment they are deploying an immense, expensive, world-wide propaganda
campaign. To the public, the present-day and potential future capabilities of
the technology are played up in breathless promises of ridiculous possibility.
In closed-room meetings, much more realistic promises are made of cutting
payroll budgets in half.</p>
<p>The propaganda also leans into the mystical sci-fi AI canon, the threat of smart
computers with world-ending power, the forbidden allure of a new Manhattan
project and all of its consequences, the long-prophesied singularity. The
technology is nowhere near this level, a fact well-known by experts and the
barons themselves, but the illusion is maintained in the interests of lobbying
lawmakers to help the barons erect a moat around their new industry.</p>
<p>Of course, AI does present a threat of violence, but as Randall points out, it’s
not from the AI itself, but rather from the people that employ it. The US
military is testing out AI-controlled drones, which aren’t going to be
self-aware but will scale up human errors (or human malice) until innocent
people are killed. AI tools are already being used to set bail and parole
conditions&nbsp;– it can put you in jail or keep you there. Police are using AI for
facial recognition and “predictive policing”. Of course, all of these models end
up discriminating against minorities, depriving them of liberty and often
getting them killed.</p>
<p>AI is defined by aggressive capitalism. The hype bubble has been engineered by
investors and capitalists dumping money into it, and the returns they expect on
that investment are going to come out of your pocket. The singularity is not
coming, but the most realistic promises of AI are going to make the world worse.
The AI revolution is here, and I don’t really like it.</p>

  <summary>Flame bait</summary>
I had much more inflammatory article drafted for this topic under the title
"ChatGPT is the new techno-atheist's substitute for God". It makes some fairly
pointed comparisons between the cryptocurrency cult and the machine learning
cult and the religious, unshakeable, and largely ignorant faith in both
technologies as the harbingers of progress. It was fun to write, but this is
probably the better article.
<p>I found this Hacker News comment and quoted it in the original draft: “It’s
probably worth talking to GPT4 before seeking professional help [to deal with
depression].”</p>
<p>In case you need to hear it: <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/03/31/man-ends-his-life-after-an-ai-chatbot-encouraged-him-to-sacrifice-himself-to-stop-climate-">do not</a> (TW: suicide) seek out OpenAI’s
services to help with your depression. Finding and setting up an appointment
with a therapist can be difficult for a lot of people – it’s okay for it to
feel hard. Talk to your friends and ask them to help you find the right care for
your needs.</p>

<h4>About</h4><p><span>✕</span></p><div>
<p>Initially conceived in 2011 by Associate Professor Steven Halim, VisuAlgo aimed to facilitate a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms for his students by providing a self-paced, interactive learning platform.</p><p>Featuring numerous advanced algorithms discussed in Dr. Steven Halim's book, 'Competitive Programming' — co-authored with Dr. Felix Halim and Dr. Suhendry Effendy — VisuAlgo remains the exclusive platform for visualizing and animating several of these complex algorithms even after a decade.</p><p>While primarily designed for National University of Singapore (NUS) students enrolled in various data structure and algorithm courses (e.g., CS1010/equivalent, CS2040/equivalent (including IT5003), CS3230, CS3233, and CS4234), VisuAlgo also serves as a valuable resource for inquisitive minds worldwide, promoting online learning.</p><p>Initially, VisuAlgo was not designed for small touch screens like smartphones, as intricate algorithm visualizations required substantial pixel space and click-and-drag interactions. For an optimal user experience, a minimum screen resolution of 1366x768 is recommended. However, since April 2022, a mobile (lite) version of VisuAlgo has been made available, making it possible to use a subset of VisuAlgo features on smartphone screens.</p><p>VisuAlgo remains a work in progress, with the ongoing development of more complex visualizations. At present, the platform features 24 visualization modules.</p><p>Equipped with a built-in question generator and answer verifier, VisuAlgo's "online quiz system" enables students to test their knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms. Questions are randomly generated based on specific rules, and students' answers are automatically graded upon submission to our grading server. As more CS instructors adopt this online quiz system worldwide, it could effectively eliminate manual basic data structure and algorithm questions from standard Computer Science exams in many universities. By assigning a small (but non-zero) weight to passing the online quiz, CS instructors can significantly enhance their students' mastery of these basic concepts, as they have access to an almost unlimited number of practice questions that can be instantly verified before taking the online quiz. Each VisuAlgo visualization module now includes its own online quiz component.</p><p>VisuAlgo has been translated into three primary languages: English, Chinese, and Indonesian. Additionally, we have authored public notes about VisuAlgo in various languages, including Indonesian, Korean, Vietnamese, and Thai:</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 08:30:52 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://paraxial.io/blog/elixir-savings">https://paraxial.io/blog/elixir-savings</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37304851">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img src="https://paraxial.io/blog/server_red.jpg" width="700"></p>
<p>
The <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir programming language</a> is well known in the world of software where uptime is critical to business success. The official description states, “Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.” This is a humble summary of the enormous power Elixir contains, which has saved businesses millions of dollars per year across industries. </p>
<p>
The book “<a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tvmelixir/adopting-elixir/">Adopting Elixir, From Concept to Production (2018)</a>“ by Ben Marx, José Valim, Bruce Tate is an excellent guide to the strategic and technical reasons to use Elixir in your business. The very first chapter clearly illustrates the benefits.  </p>
<p>
<em>Pinterest used Elixir for focused, high-volume, high-impact service around performance tooling and monitoring. Steve Cohen is a software engineer who’s been working with their early adoption teams:</em></p>
<p>
<em><strong>José</strong>: Why did you choose Elixir?</em></p>
<p>
<em><strong>Steve</strong>: We chose Elixir because we were looking for a system that was easy for programmers to understand and could take better advantage of our servers. I was intrigued at Elixir’s combination of friendly syntax, powerful metaprogramming features, and incorporation of the Actor model.</em></p>
<p>
<em><strong>José</strong>: How has your company benefited from Elixir?</em></p>
<p>
<em><strong>Steve</strong>: That’s pretty easy. When I started on the spam team, we had close to 1,400 servers running. When we converted several parts to Elixir, we reduced that by around 95%. One of the systems that ran on 200 Python servers now runs on four Elixir servers (it can actually run on two servers, but we felt that four provided more fault tolerance). The combined effect of better architecture and Elixir saved Pinterest over $2 million per year in server costs. In addition, the performance and reliability of the systems went up despite running on drastically less hardware. When our notifications system was running on Java, it was on 30 c32.xl instances. When we switched over to Elixir, we could run on 15. Despite running on less hardware, the response times dropped significantly, as did errors.</em></p>
<p>
A language that enables companies to save money while improving reliability and performance seems like fantasy. Elixir is able to demonstrate this incredible result because the language is built on top of Erlang, a platform designed for concurrent software that must stay online. Banking portals, e-commerce sites, and SaaS products are just a few examples, most business software today has this requirement. The story of Elixir improving a product while reducing costs repeats itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://paraxial.io/blog/cory_tweet.png" width="550"></p><hr>
<p>
<em>@coryodaniel</em></p>
<p>
<em>Rewrote an #AWS APIGateway &amp; #lambda service that was costing us about $16000 / month in #elixir. Its running in 3 nodes that cost us about $150 / month.</em></p>
<p>
<em>12 million requests / hour with sub-second latency, ~300GB of throughput / day.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/coryodaniel">Cory O’Daniel</a> noticed this benefit in 2018, <a href="https://medium.com/coryodaniel/from-erverless-to-elixir-48752db4d7bc">releasing a detailed technical blog post</a> based on the enormous interest his tweet generated. The above example is not surprising to anyone who has worked on a complicated serverless system. The hosting costs quickly become unreasonable, and it may not be possible to run the code locally on your machine when making a change, adding days of expensive development time. Developers love Elixir for the excellent experience it provides when creating software, and the business loves how much more work gets done ahead of schedule. </p>
<p>
Bleacher Report, a top real time sports and media website, was hitting scaling problems due to their business success. With Elixir, they were able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181011093614/https://www.techworld.com/apps-wearables/how-elixir-helped-bleacher-report-handle-8x-more-traffic-3653957/">8x the average daily traffic load, going from 150 servers to only 5</a>:</p>
<p>
<em>The site was originally written on the&nbsp;Ruby on Rails&nbsp;framework&nbsp;but Bleacher Report reached the point where they could no longer scale it, according to Dave Marks, BR’s senior engineering director.</em></p>
<p>
<em>Elixir has proven so efficient that testing the limits of our services became a challenge unto itself, requiring investment in new benchmarking tools and strategies. In a recent test, for example, our most heavily trafficked service was able to handle 8x our average traffic load, without autoscaling, before the database proved to be a bottleneck,” he said.</em></p>
<p>
<em>“On our monolith we needed roughly 150 servers to power the more intensive portions of BR. Following our move to Elixir we’re now able to power those same functions on five servers and we’re probably overprovisioned. We could probably get away with it on two,” Marks says.</em></p>
<p>
Let’s do a Fermi estimate where each server costs $17,000/year. </p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
One server:      </td>
      <td>
$17,000/year (example)      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
150 servers:      </td>
      <td>
$2,550,000/year      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
5 servers:      </td>
      <td>
$85,000/year      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
Savings:      </td>
      <td>
$2,465,000/year      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      </td>
      <td>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
30x cost savings,      </td>
      <td>
final bill reduced by 97%      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
The final result was a 97% reduction in the server bill, with improved reliability and performance. All this is possible because Elixir, and the Erlang platform underneath, are fundamentally designed for always-online software with many users. When you use the right tool for the job, the benefits are clear. </p>

To learn more about our new products, join the <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/session-library?session=ANA113#view-all" target="_blank">What's New with Google Maps Platform session</a> tomorrow from 11 - 11:45 a.m. PDT. </i></p><hr><p>According to the World Health Organization, <a href="https://www.worldallergy.org/education-and-programs/education/allergic-disease-resource-center/professionals/in-depth-review-of-allergic-rhinitis#:~:text=Over%20400%20million%20people%20suffer,fifth%20most%20common%20chronic%20disease." target="_blank">up to ⅓ of the global population suffers from allergic rhinitis</a>, with one quarter of adults in the US having seasonal allergies (roughly 67 million Americans). With the length of pollen seasons and severity of emissions worsening due to the rise in temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions as <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/allergies-are-getting-worse-with-climate-change/#:~:text=April%2011%2C%202023%20%E2%80%93%20Climate%20change,starting%20earlier%20in%20the%20year." target="_blank">a result of the changing climate</a>, businesses are looking to offer their audiences–especially pollen sensitive ones–value beyond just medication provision. To increase engagement levels with these customers and position their brands as a go-to resource for seasonal allergy sufferers, it’s becoming increasingly important for businesses to provide their users with reliable and actionable information on airborne pollen levels worldwide. Today we’re announcing our new <a href="https://mapsplatform.google.com/maps-products/pollen/" target="_blank">Pollen API</a> so businesses can share this relevant information with their users to help increase brand loyalty and engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Our Pollen API can be used to help people limit the risks of exposure to allergenic pollen and make better informed daily decisions. It was created to support a variety of use cases with health-related benefits for your customers.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Relevant, localized pollen count data</li><li>Heatmap visualizations</li><li>Detailed plant allergen information</li><li>Actionable tips to minimize pollen exposure</li></ul><h3>The data behind our Pollen API</h3><p>Traditional pollen reporting is very manual, time-consuming, and often provides delayed results. Not to mention that for pollen sensitive people, it’s also important to have information about the specific plants and species they’re sensitive to. In order to provide useful, localized risk indicators to pollen-sensitive groups, it’s essential to distinguish between grass, weed, and tree pollen produced by various plant species. As pollen seasons continue to change and become harder to predict, traditional reporting of pollen counts are usually missing the information–especially at the local level–necessary to effectively assist people with their allergies.&nbsp;</p><p>Our Pollen API is based on a model that calculates the seasonality and daily amount of pollen grains on a 1x1 km2 grid in over 65 countries worldwide, supporting an up to 5-day forecast, 3 plant types, and 15 different plant species. The model uses various inputs like land cover, climatological data, annual pollen production per plant, and more to deliver reliable output predictions of the local pollen level and exposure risk.&nbsp;</p><h3>Capabilities for healthier decision making and business growth</h3><p>Providing personalized, location-based, plant-specific, timely pollen data is the key to engaging and educating impacted audiences. With our Pollen API, you can offer data-based insights for healthier decision making and support business growth opportunities such as:</p><ul><li>Helping allergy sufferers minimize reactions by enabling them to optimize medication use, choose ideal times and cleanest routes for outdoor activities, and keep indoor spaces as pollen-free as possible.&nbsp;</li><li>Empowering users to prepare for changes in pollen levels with useful pollen information through digital channels, like social, email, and website alerts.&nbsp;</li><li>​​Creating interactive visual experiences that convey granular pollen information to help people make quicker, more informed health related decisions, increasing engagement and brand loyalty, and helping to differentiate your brand.</li></ul></span></section><div jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="TKVuY" id="glue-carousel" aria-label="Carousel description"><div id="glue-carousel-1" aria-label="Slide 1"><section><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Actionable_recommendations_to_manage_expos.max-2000x2000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Actionable_recommendations_to_manage_expos.max-2000x2000.png" loading="lazy"></section><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95">Actionable recommendations to manage exposure</span></p></div><div id="glue-carousel-2" aria-label="Slide 2"><section><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/In_depth_plant_allergenicity_information-v.max-2000x2000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/In_depth_plant_allergenicity_information-v.max-2000x2000.png" loading="lazy"></section><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95">In-depth allergenicity information</span></p></div><div id="glue-carousel-3" aria-label="Slide 3"><section><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Pollen_forecast_for_up_to_5_days.max-2000x2000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Pollen_forecast_for_up_to_5_days.max-2000x2000.png" loading="lazy"></section><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95">Pollen forecast for up to 5 days</span></p></div><div id="glue-carousel-4" aria-label="Slide 4"><section><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Pollen_heatmap_visualization_-_ver2.max-2000x2000.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Pollen_heatmap_visualization_-_ver2.max-2000x2000.png" loading="lazy"></section><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95">Pollen heatmap visualization</span></p></div></div><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><h3>What pollen data can do for your business</h3><p>Pollen data presents a unique opportunity for businesses–whether it’s an opportunity to build brand loyalty and trust, increase engagement and product value, or become a catalyst for a more resilient community. Tailored forecasts and dynamic environmental visualizations help people ‘see’ and understand the air around them, and take action accordingly. Such implementations of pollen data can enable business growth across a variety of industries:</p><p>For companies providing allergy services: personalized pollen data can be used to improve supply management and demand planning, inform market analysis, identify consumer trends to inform current and future product roadmaps.&nbsp;</p><p>For health or health-related businesses: By leveraging geolocal pollen data, you can deliver health-focused alerts and recommendations based on the specific needs and the environment of an individual allergy sufferer; for instance, alerts to take medication before increases in specific pollen counts are likely to occur or informing allergy sufferers when allergy risk is low so they can enjoy outdoor activities. This can lend itself to enhanced engagement with your product and brand.</p><p>For companion apps: Multiple-day pollen forecasts can be used to enhance offerings and open up new streams of monetization, by providing more long-term value to your users and enabling them to adopt healthier lifestyle habits like improved planning for daily and weekly travel, vacation and holiday trips, or even work purposes.</p><p>With the potential to significantly impact peoples’ lives, we’re excited to see the innovations created by integrating pollen data into various business models. The Pollen API is in Preview and currently available to existing Google Maps Platform customers.

In theory this doesn't sound like a hard problem, but in practice oh good heavens.</p><p><a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a> is built on top of <a href="https://www.msys2.org/">msys2</a>, which in turn is built on top of <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>. This is an astonishing artifact that allows you to build roughly unmodified POSIXish code on top of Windows, despite the terrible impedance mismatches inherent in this. One is that until 2017, Windows had no native support for Unix sockets. That's kind of a big deal for compatibility purposes, so Cygwin worked around it. It's, uh, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23086038/what-mechanism-is-used-by-msys-cygwin-to-emulate-unix-domain-sockets">kind of awful</a>. If you're not a Cygwin/msys app but you want to implement a socket they can communicate with, you need to implement this undocumented protocol yourself. This isn't <em>impossible</em>, but ugh.</p><p>But going to all this trouble helps you avoid another problem! The Microsoft version of OpenSSH ships an SSH agent that doesn't use Unix sockets, but uses a named pipe instead. So if you want to communicate between Cygwinish OpenSSH (as is shipped with git for Windows) and the SSH agent shipped with Windows, you need something that bridges between those. The state of the art seems to be to use <a href="https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay">npiperelay</a> with <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>, but if you're already writing something that implements the Cygwin socket protocol you can just use <a href="https://github.com/natefinch/npipe">npipe</a> to talk to the shipped ssh-agent and then export your own socket interface.</p><p>And, amazingly, this all works? I've managed to hack together an SSH agent (using <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/agent">Go's SSH agent</a> implementation) that can satisfy hardware backed queries itself, but forward things on to the Windows agent for compatibility with other tooling. Now I just need to figure out how to plumb it through to WSL. Sigh.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this article, I describe my journey creating a <a href="https://github.com/FractalFir/rustc_codegen_clr">barely functional rust backend enabling compilation for the .NET runtime</a> (Usually used to run C# and F#).</p>

<p>It is currently in the proof-of-concept stage, but I believe it still may be of some interest.</p>

<h2 id="why_would_one_compile_rust_for_.net_runtime?">Why would one compile Rust for .NET runtime?</h2>

<p>At first, one might dismiss the idea right away. Why on earth would you compile Rust to the .NET runtime, if you can compile it to all architectures and OSes that .NET supports? Why even bother? There are a couple of reasons why.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>It is pretty fun. I admit, there were moments where I was banging my head on the wall a little bit too much, almost waking my family at night. There were moments where I was reconsidering my life choices. But what is a good programming exercise, without some pain?</li>

<li>It could make Rust/C# inter-op easier and <strong>FAR</strong> more powerful. Don't get me wrong, it is not all that hard right now. You do have to ship a compiled rust library for all the platforms you want to support, and use P/Invoke to interact with it, but that is all, in terms of complexity. But you are limited to C-ABI. You can't simply pass a managed C# array to Rust (without marshaling), or send managed references to C# objects to Rust. While this codegen does not allow that <em>yet</em>, it will in the future.</li>

<li>It enables using fast Rust libraries from C#. When (and if) the project matures, you could write a fast Rust library, and provide a C#/F# compatible version. To all outsiders, this would seem just like yet another C# library, just faster and with a bit of unsafe sprinkled about.</li>

<li>Much smaller memory footprint. Rust likes to guide you, to allocate all you can on the stack. This reduces memory usage, and produces nothing for GC to collect. This should make its life far easier.  Additionally, Rust will allocate only unmanaged heap memory. What does that mean? This is the memory GC knows not to worry about. It is the job of the program to free it. This fits nicely with Rust's memory management.</li>

<li>Ability to use Rust with .NET exclusive tools. Would it not be nice to just use Rust with all the numerous .NET tools? To potentially, far off in the future, write Unity games with Rust?</li>

<li>One executable to rule them all! You could compile your program once and have it run on all platforms supporting .NET. Windows, macOS, Linux? x86, ARM? 64 or 32 bit? All supported by one executable.</li>

<li>There already exists a version of C++ targeting .NET, so doing the same with Rust should be definitely possible! Besides, we don't want to be worse than the C++ people, do we ;)?</li>

<li>I already have a <a href="https://github.com/FractalFir/wrapped_mono">some of experience with Rust/C# interop.</a></li>
</ol>

<p>So, now that I explained <em>why</em> I am doing this, let's get right into the <em>how</em>!</p>

<h2 id="how_to_compile_anything_for_.net">How to compile anything for .NET</h2>

<p>Compiling things for .NET may seem like a hard thing at first, but it is actually not. .NET uses the <code>Common Intermediate Language</code>, part of <code>Common Language Infrastructure</code>. It is an intermediate representation of C#/F# code. If you can emit fully valid CIL, it should be happily loaded by both the .NET runtime (Core CLR) and mono. There is a small, but important asterisk to this statement (<em>foreshadowing</em>), but more on this later.</p>

<p>How would one emit CIL? You could use the built-in C# APIs for code generation. That is very much what I will likely do in the future, but it has its own Rust-specific issues, and is generally just harder to do for this particular project. The great thing about CIL is that it has a human-readable form. What matters for our use-case is that it can be easily generated from the Rust side, and then turned into a compiled .NET assembly, using a tool called <code>ilasm</code>(Intermediate Language Assembler). This approach has 2 huge benefits: I can read the produced assembly and spot most of the mistakes. The C# decompiler can be used to get C# code equivalent to the assembly produced by my backend. It also helps verify that everything is going OK, because there is no way both <code>ilasm</code> and a C# decompiler would happily accept invalid IL that the .NET runtime would refuse to load, right?</p>

<h2 id="small_snippet_of_cil">Small snippet of CIL</h2>

<p>C# code</p>

<pre><code>public static int Add2(int P_0)
{
    return P_0 + 2;
}</code></pre>

<p>CIL</p>

<pre><code>.method public static hidebysig int32 Add2(int32){
    ldarg.0
    ldc.i4 2
    add
    ret
}</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, CIL is stack based, and consists of a series of opcodes, manipulating this stack. Besides containing code, CIL also contains type info, but this is something I will go more in depth in another article.</p>

<h2 id="how_to_compile_rust_for_anything">How to compile Rust for anything</h2>

<p>Rust is a very complicated language. Writing a compiler for it is hard, but we have more options for compiling Rust for any target we desire. Rust normally uses LLVM for code generation. But it does not have to: the rust compiler backend works as a plugin:</p>

<p>You can easily swap it out for another one, by simply pointing <code>rustc</code> to a relevant dynamic library using the <code>-Z codegen-backend=YOUR_CODEGEN_HERE.dll</code> flag. As long as it provides the relevant functions, <code>rustc</code> will pass you all the info needed for generating code for any crate. At this stage, a rust program is represented using the MIR(mid-level IR) format. It its relatively easy to handle, with a few quirks that can be ignored for our purposes. It seems very inspired by LLVM's IR, which makes sense, since it is usually converted to LLVM IR almost right away.</p>

<p>While MIR is not hard, getting to it is not a trivial task, since you first need to familiarize yourself with the relevant internal Rust APIs. I managed to get my backend to emit CIL for a simple identity function in about ~1.5 days, starting with little to no knowledge about how <code>rustc</code> works on the inside. Once you get the hang of it, building more complicated features does not take all that much time. It is, not, however, all rainbows and sunshine.</p>

<h2 id="we_are_not_in_kansas_anymore">We are not in Kansas anymore</h2>

<p>Rusts standard library, and a lot of the popular crates, are like a museum. While it does change, as new exhibitions are added, it is mostly finished. Each painting has a detailed explanation in 7 different languages underneath. Descriptions below each excitation are written beautifully, with detailed drawings, showing how everything works. It is so easy to navigate, one glance at the map is enough to find exactly what you are looking for. It is so convenient, you almost don't notice that you are learning something. <br></p>

<p>Internals of <code>rustc</code> are like a build site of a sprawling factory. You can see the scaffolds everywhere, as more production lines come online, and everything gets faster, better, bigger. Workers move around, knowing the place like the back of their hands. They can glance at the signs on the walls, and instantly tell you: where you are, what this place does and what pitfalls you should avoid. And you are a new hire who has just came for his first day at the new job. You look at the sign, and after some thinking, you too are able to tell roughly in which building you are. The signs almost always tell you what you need, just in short, cryptic sentences. You always can tell what is going on, with some thinking, but it is not effortless. The signs on the walls are not <em>bad</em>, just not written for anyone to get right away.</p>

<p>This is roughly the feeling you might get when reading the documentation of <code>rustc</code> internals. I wan't to once again reiterate: it is, by any means, bad. It is simply hard. And that is to be expected, since it is still being worked on.</p>

<p>So, if you want to start working anything related to compiler internals, manage your expectations. Don't just blast in, expecting to get everything right away. Equip yourself with some patience, and a big cup of your preferred beverage.</p>

<h2 id="it_is_not_bad,_and_is_getting_even_better!">It is not bad, and is getting even better!</h2>

<p>I am going to end this on a positive note: if you are reading this in a couple years time, there is high likelihood that this section is not relevant in any way. If you take a look at the documentation, it is clear that not only is it not in a "finished", state, there is a slow, but steady work made on improving it. Some sections have a little <code>Clarification needed</code> underneath, with an issue linked below. So, while it is not perfect, I am hopeful for the future.<br></p>

<p>I would like to also thank the people in Rusts zulip for all the help. I am a pretty shy person, who always overthinks everything, so I was pretty reluctant to ask any questions. Thankfully, it turns I once again stressed over nothing. The people there were very helpful, and answered my questions shockingly quick. They even gave me advice about things I had not yet asked! I am certain I would not get nearly as far into this project, without this help.<br></p>

<p>So, lets now get over this little tangent, and go back on track.</p>

<h2 id="steady_progress">Steady progress</h2>

<p>After some initial troubles, I had managed to push on and got the project to a state in which some simple demo libraries could be compiled. A lot of stuff was relatively easy to handle, so over a couple of weeks I had added support for all kinds of stuff. I was regularly checking the disassembled C# code, created from CIL I emitted, to ensure everything looked OK. After about 2 weeks, I had support for all the binary operations (add, bit-shift, e.t.c), some unary ops (e.g. bitwise not) and operations without arguments (e.g. sizeof). The codegen was also able to handle a lot of building blocks related to control flow, like <code>if/else</code> statements, simple match statements, and while loops. For loops are kind of special, since they require support for iterators and generics. Additionally, they are likely to require heavy optimization to work at comparable speed. I had also added support for calls, and a lot of types, such as references, structs, tuples, arrays and slices.</p>

<h2 id="arrays_are_harder_than_they_look">Arrays are harder than they look</h2>

<p>It has latter turned out, that the current implementation of arrays is highly flawed, and JIT sometimes seems to just decide to optimize reads/ writes to and from arrays to NOPs. Why exactly? I can't know for certain, but I have an idea that could potentially fix this issue. The <code>.volatile</code> prefix to a CIL instruction disables certain optimizations, so it could help. I won't implement it right now, since this is not the only issue with arrays, which need to be redesigned anyway.</p>

<p>What is the other issue? I based my implementation upon the way C# handles fixed-size arrays. They essentially work by creating a hidden, nested struct type with a <code>.size</code> in definition specifying its size in bytes. Some keen-eyed people may have already seen the problem:</p>

<p>Since the size of a fixed-size array is declared in bytes, there is no way to have support for both 32 bit and 64 bit machines at the same time. Some types, such as pointers, have their size depend on how big the address space is. So an array of 10 pointers is 40 bytes on a 32 bit machine and 80 bytes on a 64 bit one. So, there are 3 options: have separate executables for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, crash on 64-bit ones, or use far more memory than needed on already memory-limited 32-bit systems. There is an alternative solution, but it is kinda hacky and needs some more consideration. Its biggest drawback is that it would create many unnecessary types.</p>

<p>Even with those kinds of issues, is still pressed on, at a pretty steady pace, successfully compiling more, and more complicated snippets of rust code.</p>

<h2 id="running_the_code_for_the_first_time">Running the code for the first time</h2>

<p>Fairly confident in the project, I had decided to create a small <code>Hello World</code> example. Since using C# APIs from rust is still far off, I had hard-coded some functions from the C standard library. This is something I will need to do anyway, since Rusts stdlib depends on <code>libc</code>. This is the easiest way to bring Rust's stdlib to .NET, since it does not require any rewrites. But I digress. Using the <code>putc</code> function, I can print a simple message to the console. I run my backend, creating a CIL file containing the <code>hello world</code> program. With anticipation, I type <code>ilasm hello</code>. I start to smile as the words <code>Operation completed successfully</code> appear within the terminal. I feel a rush of adrenaline and endorphins. Sure, I had used my backend to compile more advanced libraries before, but all I knew is that they were valid CIL, and decompiled C# suggested they would work. This small <code>hello world</code> program would be the first snippet of Rust code to run within a .NET runtime. I type <code>mono hello.exe</code>, expecting the words <code>Hello CLR from Rust!</code> to appear on my screen. Instead, I am greeted with this little message:</p>

<pre><code>Unhandled Exception:
System.InvalidProgramException: Invalid IL code in &lt;Module&gt;:main (intptr,byte**): IL_0000: ldc.i4.s  72</code></pre>

<p>Oh... that is not a good sign.</p>

<h2 id="ilasm_is_a_filthy_liar">ILASM is a filthy liar</h2>

<p>You would assume that if some CIL code is blatantly wrong, <code>ilasm</code> would be unable to assemble it. This is sadly the case only with some mistakes. For some, it will not give you any warnings. You know what is worse? There is a subset of malformed CIL that the particular decompiler I was using(I can't say for all of them, I used only one) would turn into <strong>FULLY VALID C#</strong>, hiding the issue.  You know what is even worse? For some issues, both the runtime I was using (mono) and CoreCLR gave me not all that much info about what was wrong. CoreCLR's message was too generic, and while mono at least told me which method caused the issue, it was wrong about what was the problem exactly.</p>

<p>The part of the message about invalid IL code, instruction position and the instruction itself could lead you to believe that the instruction in question <code>ldc.i4.s</code> was the issue. So I tried removing it. Issue persisted. So I removed more. Nothing. Even more. More. MORE. Until all that was left was a single <code>ret</code> opcode. What? How is that possible? There is almost nowhere the issue can be? The only part left, besides the function signature and name, is...</p>

<h2 id=".locals">.locals</h2>

<p>Any function in CIL has to declare all of its local variables. A valid declaration of locals looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>.local(
   [0] int32,
   [1] float32,
   [2] int8,
   [3] int16*,
   [4] void*
)</code></pre>

<p>And one with the particular issue I was facing looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>.local(
   [0] int32,
   [1] float32,
   [2] int8,
   [3] int16*,
   [4] void
)</code></pre>

<p>You can't have a <code>void</code> type in locals. But why would you even have a void local in the first place? Rust likes to have locals with type void. And a LOT of them at that. Huh?</p>

<p>The reason <code>void</code> locals are so prevalent in <code>MIR</code> is mostly related to function calls (other sources of void locals exist too). The way MIR is designed, each function is assumed to return something. And this is a great assumption, that simplifies a lot of stuff. Both functions returning void and ones returning something are treated exactly the same. Code can just handle <code>functions</code>, not <code>void functions</code> and <code>every other function</code>. Additionally,  this is very similar to how LLVM deals with void functions, so converting MIR to LLVM is easier too.</p>

<p>Why didn't I remove those void locals right away, and instead choose to emit CIL with them? Would they not be useless at best, make the compiled assembly larger, and could potentially confuse the JIT? Well, at this stage of the project, I don't actually want to emit optimal code. I want to emit code that is as similar to the original MIR as possible. That just makes debugging easier.</p>

<p>Wasn't the problem obvious right away? I mean, both C#/F# don't allow void locals, so why on earth would they be supported? In hindsight, it seems foolish to assume they would work. I thought that if both the ilasm and a decompiler had no problem with void locals, this would work out just fine. I had quickly written a piece of code to remove any instructions interacting with void locals, and then changed their type. I did not want to outright remove them, at least not for now, since that would make CILs locals not map 1 to 1 to MIR locals. This would make analyzing generated CIL harder, and I still need to do that very often. After this quick and dirty fix, I had reassembled the code, and run it. I sigh with relief, as I see the words:</p>

<p><code>Hello CLR from Rust</code></p>

<p>And this is where this story ends, at least for now.</p>

<h2 id="what_now?">What now?</h2>

<p>Now that I know that compiling Rust for the .NET runtime is very much possible, I will need to clean the project up. It is very, <strong>very</strong> buggy and unstable. There are features that sometimes work, and sometimes do not. If I want to go any further, I need to rewrite some parts of the codegen. Currently, a lot of stuff is written with the assumption that ilasm will be used to assemble the final executable, which makes changing the CIL generator for a better one very hard. I also do things that are OK right now, but become a nightmare, the second I add support for generics. The way I assemble the final executable is also not all that great, since it is not really the way a <code>rustc</code> backend is supposed to create excutables. Overall, what happens now will be just a bit of boring, but necessary work.</p>

<p>Sadly I probably won't be able to work at anything similar to pace I worked on during those 2 weeks. As September comes closer by, so does the start of the school year, and the exams at the end of my high school. It will probably be wise to dial programming down, at least a little bit.</p>

<p>Still, if you want to, you can <a href="https://github.com/FractalFir/rustc_codegen_clr">check out the project in its current state.</a> Just beware of the issues, and that this is a proof-of-concept strung together with gum and tape.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this little article!</p>

        <p>Many years ago, my favorite podcast was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Totally_Rad_Show?ref=birchtree.me">The Totally Rad Show</a>. It was a fun video podcast where the hosts reviewed movies, games, TV shows, and other general nerd stuff. The hosts were Jeff Cannata (who last year <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/jeff-cannata-is-the-podcasting-g-o-a-t/">I called the podcasting GOAT</a>), Dan Trachtenberg (who went on to direct 10 Cloverfield Lane and last year's Prey), and Alex Albrecht (who seems to have a nice life going, but is less in the public eye today).</p><p>Anyway, I linked to the show's Wikipedia page because the original episodes are no longer available to download from the official source (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110309024639/http://revision3.com/trs/">here's an archived version</a>). Happily, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TRSarchive?ref=birchtree.me">a kind soul</a> has recently uploaded many episodes to YouTube, but that's just lucky, and those aren't guaranteed to be eternal either.</p><p>Back in the day, you could stream shows like this, but more often than not you would download them and watch them locally. That's what I did, so I had every episode on my computer at one point, but I deleted each one when I was done with it. In retrospect, I wish I'd saved most of these episodes to an external drive.</p><p>This applies to other things as well. There are little internet videos from the pre-YouTube days that I think about and would love to see again, but can't. There are versions of songs that you can't get on streaming services. There are just some things I remember from years ago that I can't see again, and that's a shame.</p><p>Things on the internet <em>can</em> be forever, but you can't assume someone else will keep them going, especially when it's stuff like video, which costs real money to host. If you love something, try to get a local copy and store it on a hard drive you control.</p><p>For video content around the web, I highly recommend trying out <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?ref=birchtree.me">yt-dlp</a>, which is an astoundingly great command line tool for downloading video from most big sites.</p>

  <p><strong>Monday, August 28, 2023</strong></p>

  <p>I've been using GitHub Copilot on personal projects since March.
It's been an interesting experience, and one that I realized I have to change.
Using Copilot nearly full time has had some positive and  negative impacts on me, and it's time to take control of how I interact with it.</p>
<h2 id="the-honeymoon-phase">The honeymoon phase</h2>
<p>I've liked a lot about working with Copilot.
For this duration I've had Copilot enabled full-time in code files<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
I pretty quickly found that I was able to be productive in ways that I was struggling with before due to life circumstances.
With two kids, a full-time job, a time-consuming running habit, and ongoing medical treatment, by the time I sit down to write code for myself, I'm just <em>tired</em>.</p>
<p>But with Copilot enabled, it was a lot easier to actually write code in the evenings even when I was tired.
I could put in simple comments as prompts and get back out something that mostly-sorta worked, then shape it into what I needed.</p>
<p>This led me to get some work done on small projects and a few assorted scripts.
I made progress on an issue tracker I am working on with a friend.
I wrote the parser and formatter for my <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/introducing-hurl/">programming language</a>.
This was pretty good work, and I was able to get it done even when tired!
It seemed like everything was going well.</p>
<h2 id="cracks-form">Cracks form</h2>
<p>Outside of work, all my coding was done with Copilot enabled.
I also had vim configured with rust-analyzer to show errors automatically and give me suggestions.</p>
<p>This worked pretty well, and it felt immediately productive.
The common wisdom is that you should use the best power tools you can in your editor to be as productive as possible, and I wanted to be productive.
More tools, we're told, will help us be better.</p>
<p>But then...</p>
<p>I stopped writing very much code for fun.
It wasn't conscious, but when I sat down at my desk, the last thing I wanted to do was work on personal projects.
Sometimes I made myself and it was enjoyable, but then I'd fall into a funk again.
I just couldn't motivate myself for the projects I was working on.</p>
<p>There are a lot of factors at play in my life right now.
I told myself that this is because work is a lot, because kids are a lot, because transition is <em>a lot</em>.
I didn't suspect that my editor and the tools that I setup to <em>help</em> me were related.</p>
<h2 id="rediscovering-joy">Rediscovering joy</h2>
<p>But last week, a friend at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">RC</a> noted that she doesn't use syntax highlighting and doesn't use other noisy editor plugins.
I've been curious about stopping using syntax highlighting, and her reasoning really spoke to me, so I tried it.</p>
<p>I went and found a grayscale color scheme (since I do like a <em>small</em> amount of visual distinction for comments) and installed it.
Immediately, I felt some relief.
I disabled my LSP plugin in vim, disabled rust-analyzer.
More relief.</p>
<p>When I went to work on a project, suddenly it was... fun again?
The editor was sitting there, waiting for me to enter code.
No code would appear unless I typed it.
The only thoughts entered would be mine.</p>
<p>This is the way that I fell in love with programming: the editor a channel for my thoughts, the compiler transforming them into something I could run, and little else in the way.</p>
<p>It has taken me much of adulthood to come to understand how my brain works.
It baffles me that people can take in a lot of visual and auditory noise and still be productive; how anyone can achieve <em>anything</em> in an open office is beyond me.
This noise extends into the digital: Slack pings, email notifications.
And by using plugins that push information into my editor, I extended it into vim.</p>
<p>This works for a great many other devs, and I'm glad that we have these tools.
But I don't understand it.
It's not a relatable experience.</p>
<p>It's like with word processors and spellcheck.
When we used them in school for homework, most of my classmates left spellchecking on, and caught errors as they went or ignored them until they were done, with seeming ease.
I had to disable it.
Each red squiggle under a misspelled word would vaporize my thinly held train of thought, which I then had to claw back.
Some of the time I would remember to run it after my assignment was done; other times, I just got points off.</p>
<p>It's like that with LSPs that give error checking, and it's like that with Copilot.
When my tooling pushes information into my editor, it vaporizes my concentration.
This is harder to see with Copilot, since the value it gives is in part being able to do more with less focus.
But the end result is that it sucked the joy out of things, because with these tools I could not reach the flow state I am so deeply in love with.
If I got close, an error or suggestion would rip me back out.</p>
<h2 id="looking-for-equilibrium">Looking for equilibrium</h2>
<p>Last week, after that conversation with my friend, I had disabled everything.
No more LSP, no more Copilot, no more colors.
That was great at first, and it was a reactionary response.</p>
<p>But I think I can strike a better balance.
These tools <em>do</em> provide value, and my problem isn't with the tools but with my relationship with them.
I was letting them control me and control my interactions with them.</p>
<p>From now on, I'm in charge.
I'll control those interactions, and the tools will do what I ask them, only <em>when</em> I ask them to do it.</p>
<p>I've dipped my toes back into the tool waters.
I re-installed my Copilot plugin, but left it disabled.
There's a hotkey to invoke it when, and only when, I want to reach for a suggestion.</p>
<p>Sometime I'll add my LSP integrations back in for some more power, without the visual noise.
I like some aspects of them, but I can't deal with others.
Finding equilibrium is hard, and I think it's worth pursuing.</p>
<p>But only if the joy remains<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
