            <p>Amazon is famously frugal. One of its origin stories recounts how the company bought cheap doors from Home Depot and hacked them together as office desks. This became guiding symbol of Amazon's cautious spending, with founder Jeff Bezos <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaire-jeff-bezos-amazon-uses-door-desk-from-early-days-2024-1" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">still using door desks today</a>.</p><p>This penny-pinching culture has smashed straight into an AI hiring battle that's being fueled by unprecedented spending, putting Amazon in a tricky situation.</p><p>The internal document described compensation as one of the "hotly debated topics" among Amazon recruiters, citing the company's strict use of fixed salary bands for each role. Amazon's "egalitarian philosophy" on pay leaves its offers "below par" compared with top rivals, it added.</p><p>"The lack of salary range increases for several key job families over the past few years does not position Amazon as an employer of choice for top tech talent," the document warned.</p><p>For Amazon, missing out on top AI talent is a potential risk. ​​The pool of top-tier AI researchers and engineers is <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/in-silicon-valley-it-is-the-summer-of-fomo-2025-6" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">limited</a>, and without experts with deep knowhow, it's hard to compete at the frontier of the field.

            <p>In addition to highlighting Amazon's "perceived lag in the AI space," the internal document said generative AI has further intensified the competition for specialized talent, particularly individuals with expertise in large language models.</p><p>An August report from venture capital firm SignalFire shows Amazon is on the lower end of engineering retention, far below Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Jarod Reyes, SignalFire's head of developer community, told Business Insider that Amazon rivals are making bigger strides in AI, across open models, foundational research, and developer tooling.</p><p>"Amazon hasn't clearly positioned itself as a leader in the generative AI wave," Reyes said. "Engineers are paying attention and they're voting with their feet."</p>

Jassy's response fell flat, sending Amazon's stock lower during the call.</p><p>Amazon intends to tackle these concerns.

Arnd Bergmann started his <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open
Source Summit Europe</a> 2025 talk with a clear statement of position: 32-bit
systems are obsolete when it comes to use in any sort of new products.  The
only reason to work with them at this point is when there is existing
hardware and software to support.  Since Bergmann is the overall maintainer
for architecture support in the kernel, he is frequently asked whether
32-bit support can be removed.  So, he concluded, the time has come to talk
more about that possibility.
</p><p>
<!-- middle-ad -->
People naturally think about desktop machines first, he continued.  If you
were running Linux in the 1990s, you had a 32-bit, desktop system.  Unix
systems, though, moved to 64-bit platforms around 30&nbsp;years ago, and
the Linux desktop made that move about 20&nbsp;years ago.  Even phones and
related devices have been 64-bit for the last decade.  If those systems
were all that Linux had to support, 32-bit support would have long since
been removed from the kernel.  He summarized the situation with this slide,
showing how the non-embedded architectures have transitioned to either
64-bit or nonexistence over time:
</p><blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1035730/#nonembed"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/osseu/arnd-non-embedded-sm.png" alt="[History of
non-embedded 32-bit platforms]" width="600"></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
The world is not all desktops — or servers — though; embedded Linux exists
as well.  About 90% of those systems are running on Arm processors.  The
kernel has accumulated a lot of devicetree files describing those systems
over the years; only in this last year has the number of devicetrees for
armv8 (64-bit) systems exceeded the number for armv7 (32-bit) systems.
</p><p>
For Arm processors with pre-armv7 architectures, there are only three for
which it is still possible to buy hardware, but a number are still
supported by the kernel community:

</p><blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1035730/#prev7"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/osseu/arnd-pre-v7-sm.png" alt="[History of
pre-armv7 platforms]" width="600"></a>
</blockquote>
<p>

Many other pre-armv7 CPUs are out of production,
but the kernel still has support for them.  Of those, he said, there are
about ten that could be removed now.  It would be nice to be able to say
that support for the others will be removed after a fixed period, ten years
perhaps, but hardware support does not work that way.  Instead, one has to
think in terms of half lives; every so often, it becomes possible to remove
support for half of the platforms.  It all depends on whether there are
users for the processors in question.
</p><p>
The kernel is still adding support for some 32-bit boards, he said, but at
least ten new 64-bit boards gain support for each 32-bit one.
</p><p>
There are a number of non-Arm 32-bit architectures that still have support
in the kernel; these include arc, microblaze, nios2, openrisc, rv32,
sparc/leon, and xtensa.  All of them are being replaced by RISC-V
processors in new products.  RISC-V is what you use if you don't care about
Arm compatibility, he said.
</p><p>
Then, there is the dusty corner where nommu (processors without a
memory-management unit) live; these include armv7-m, m68k, superh, and
xtensa.  Nobody is building anything with this kind of hardware now, and
the only people who are working on them in any way are those who have to
support existing systems.  "<q>Or to prove that it can be done</q>."
</p><p>
There are still some people who need to run 32-bit applications that cannot
be updated; the solution he has been pushing people toward is to run a
32-bit user space on a 64-bit kernel.  This is a good solution for
memory-constrained systems; switching to 32-bit halves the memory usage of
the system.  Since, on most systems, almost all memory is used by user
space, running a 64-bit kernel has a relatively small cost.  Please, he
asked, do not run 32-bit kernels on 64-bit processors.
</p><p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1035730/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/osseu/ArndBergmann-sm.png" alt="[Arnd Bergmann]" title="Arnd Bergmann"></a>


There are some definite pain points that come with maintaining 32-bit
support; most of the complaints, he said, come from developers in the
memory-management subsystem.  The biggest problem there is the need to
support high memory; it is complex, and requires support throughout the
kernel.  High memory is needed when the kernel lacks the address space to
map all of the installed physical memory; that tends to be at about 800MB
on 32-bit systems. (See <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/813201/">this article</a> for
more information about high memory).
</p><p>
Currently the kernel is able to support 32-bit systems with up to 16GB of
installed memory.  Such systems are exceedingly rare, though, and support
for them will be going away soon.  There are a few 4GB systems out there,
including some Chromebooks.  Systems with 2GB are a bit more common.  Even
these systems, he said, are "<q>a bit silly</q>" since the memory costs
more than the CPU does.  There are some use cases for such systems, though.
Most 32-bit systems now have less than 1GB of installed memory.  The
kernel, soon, will not try to support systems with more than&nbsp;4GB.
</p><p>
There are some ideas out there for how to support the larger-memory 32-bit
systems without needing the high-memory abstraction.  Linus Walleij is
working on entirely separating the kernel and user-space address spaces,
giving each 4GB to work with; this is a variant on the "4G/4G" approach
that has occasionally been tried for many years.  It is difficult to make
such a system work efficiently, so this effort may never succeed, Bergmann
said.
</p><p>
Another approach is the proposed "densemem" memory model, which does some
fancy remapping to close holes in the physical address space.  Densemem can
support up to 2GB and is needed <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/974517/">to replace the
SPARSEMEM memory model</a>, the removal of which which will eventually be
necessary in any case.  This work has to be completed before high memory
can be removed; Bergmann said that he would be interested in hearing from
potential users of the densemem approach.
</p><p>
One other possibility is to drop high memory, but allow the extra physical
memory to be used as a <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/blockdev/zram.html">zram</a> swap
device.  That would not be as efficient as accessing the memory directly,
but it is relatively simple and would make it possible to drop the
complexity of high memory.
</p><p>
Then, there is <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/776435/">the year-2038 problem</a>, which
he spent several years working on.  The kernel-side work was finished in
2020; the musl C library was updated that same year, and the GNU C
Library followed the year after.  Some distributors have been faster than
others to incorporate this work; Debian and Ubuntu have only become
year-2038-safe this year.
</p><p>
The year-2038 problem is not yet completely solved, though; there are a lot
of packages that have unfixed bugs in this area.  Anything using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html"><tt>futex()</tt></a>,
he said, has about a 50% chance of getting time handling right.  The legacy
32-bit system calls, which are not year-2038 safe, are still enabled in the
kernel, but they will go away at some point, exposing more bugs.  There are
languages, including Python and Rust, that have a lot of broken language
bindings.  Overall, he said, he does not expect any 32-bit desktop system to
survive the year-2038 apocalypse.
</p><p>
A related problem is big-endian support, which is also 32-bit only, and
also obsolete.  Its removal is blocked because IBM is still supporting
big-endian mainframe and PowerPC systems; as long as that support
continues, big-endian support will stay in the kernel.
</p><p>
A number of other types of support are under discussion.  There were once
32-bit systems with more than eight CPUs, but nobody is using those
machines anymore, so support could be removed.  Support for armv4
processors, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StrongARM">DEC StrongARM CPU</a>,
should be removed.  Support for early armv6 CPUs, including the omap2 and
i.mx31, "<q>complicates everything</q>"; he would like to remove it, even
though there are still some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet">Nokia
770</a> systems in the wild.  The time is coming for the removal of all
non-devicetree board files.  Removal of support for Cortex&nbsp;M CPUs,
which are nommu systems, is coming in a couple of years.  Developers are
eyeing i486 CPU support, but that will not come out yet.  Bergmann has sent
patches to remove support for KVM on 32-bit CPUs, but there is still
"<q>one PowerPC user</q>", so that support will be kept for now.
</p><p>
To summarize, he said, the kernel will have to retain support for armv7
systems for at least another ten years.  Boards are still being produced
with these CPUs, so even ten years may be optimistic for removal.
Everything else, he said, will probably fade away sooner than that.  The
removal of high-memory support has been penciled in for sometime around
2027, and nommu support around 2028.  There will, naturally, need to be
more discussion before these removals can happen.
</p><p>
An audience member asked how developers know whether a processor is still
in use or not; Bergmann acknowledged that it can be a hard question.  For
x86 support, he looked at a lot of old web pages to make a list of which
systems existed, then showed that each of those systems was already broken
in current kernels for other reasons; the lack of complaints showed that
there were no users.  For others, it is necessary to dig through the Git
history, see what kinds of changes are being made, and ask the developers
who have worked on the code; they are the ones who will know who is using
that support.
</p><p>
Another person asked about whether the kernel would support big-endian
RISC-V systems.  Bergmann answered that those systems are not supported
now, and he hoped that it would stay that way.  "<q>With RISC-V, anybody
can do anything, so they do, but it is not always a good idea</q>".  The
final question was about support for nommu esp32 CPUs; he answered that
patches for those CPUs exist, but have not been sent upstream.  Those
processors are "<q>a cool toy</q>", but he does not see any practical
application for them.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this post, I’ll walk you through how to create a custom shader in Three.js that simulates the look of a foil sticker, complete with angle-dependent iridescence and sparkling metallic flakes. The goal is to capture that premium, holographic effect you see on collectible stickers, trading cards, and high-end packaging, but to render it in real time directly in the browser.</p><p><img src="https://www.4rknova.com/img/post/20250830/anim01.gif" alt="Foil sticker animation"></p><h2 id="iridescence">Iridescence</h2><p>If you’ve ever tilted a holographic sticker or watched sunlight catch on a soap bubble, you’ve seen iridescence in action. In the real world, this rainbow shimmer comes from thin-film interference. When light waves bounce between layers of a surface, some wavelengths are reinforced while others cancel out, causing colors to shift depending on your viewing angle.</p><p>In real-time computer graphics, we don’t need to simulate the exact physics. Instead, we can approximate this by mapping view angle to hue, as the surface tilts relative to the camera, its color smoothly shifts through a spectrum. This gives that dynamic, “alive” quality you expect from foil stickers.</p><h2 id="foil-flakes">Foil Flakes</h2><p>Alongside the shifting colors, there’s another key detail: foil flakes. Real metallic foils have tiny reflective particles embedded in them, creating hundreds of bright, sharp highlights that twinkle as you move. These aren’t smooth reflections but randomized sparkles, giving the surface its tactile, premium feel.</p><p>To replicate this in a shader, we’ll introduce procedural noise to generate small random patches of brightness across the surface. When combined with lighting, they look like metallic specks catching the light. Together, angular hue shifts and flake sparkles create a convincing illusion of printed holographic foil without expensive rendering tricks.</p><h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2><p>This implementation simulates a peeling, iridescent sticker with foil flakes using Three.js. While I will borrow concepts such as metalness, roughness, and Fresnel from Physically Based Rendering (PBR), this shader is not physically based. The goal is to create a visually plausible, artistic effect.</p><p>Below is a live demo of the shader, where you can modify its parameters and experiment with different configurations. Use your mouse to rotate the sticker around and see how the material reacts to the lighting.</p><h2 id="vertex-shader">Vertex Shader</h2><p>The vertex shader handles the peel geometry and passes useful information to the fragment shader.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Uniform / Varying</strong></th><th><strong>Type</strong></th><th><strong>Purpose</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>uPeelAmount</code></td><td>float</td><td>Overall peel strength (0 = flat, 1 = fully peeled).</td></tr><tr><td><code>uPeelAngle</code></td><td>float</td><td>Peel direction in degrees.</td></tr><tr><td><code>vUv</code></td><td>vec2</td><td>UV coordinates for texture mapping.</td></tr><tr><td><code>vWorldPos</code></td><td>vec3</td><td>Vertex position in world space.</td></tr><tr><td><code>vNormal</code></td><td>vec3</td><td>Transformed normal for lighting.</td></tr><tr><td><code>vAOIntensity</code></td><td>float</td><td>Distance moved by vertex, used to darken lifted areas.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The shader goes through the following simple steps:</p><ol><li>Compute vector from hinge to current vertex.</li><li>Calculate the peel factor and angle.</li><li>Define the rotation axis and apply Rodrigues’ rotation formula to rotate the vertex around that axis.</li><li>Apply the same rotation to the normal.</li><li>Calculate a fake ambient occlusion term.</li></ol><p>Here’s the full vertex shader code:</p><div><pre><code><span>uniform</span> <span>float</span> <span>uPeelAmount</span><span>;</span>  <span>// Strength of peel (0.0 → no peel, 1.0 → full peel)</span>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries (in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

It called on Israel to halt “deliberate attacks on civilians, including children; starvation; deprivation of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other essentials; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement”.</p><p data-start="2077" data-end="2374">Sergey Vasiliev, professor of international law at the Open University of the Netherlands, told Reuters the declaration reflected a consensus that has taken root in academia. “This legal assessment has become mainstream within academia, particularly in the field of genocide studies,” he said.</p><p data-start="2077" data-end="2374">Ismail al-Thawabta, head of Gaza’s Government Media Office, said the “prestigious scholarly stance reinforces the documented evidence and facts presented before international courts”. He added that the resolution “places a legal and moral obligation on the international community to take urgent action to stop the crime, protect civilians, and hold the leaders of the occupation accountable”.</p><h2 id="israel-s-growing-legal-woes" data-start="2376" data-end="2708">Israel’s growing legal woes</h2><p data-start="2376" data-end="2708">The resolution came as Israel faces a separate case at the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/2/28/israel-icj-and-the-movement-for-a-principled-and-just-world-order">International Court of Justice</a> at The Hague, where it is already accused of genocide.</p><p data-start="2376" data-end="2708">The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-israeli-pm-netanyahu-for-war-crimes-in-gaza">International Criminal Court</a> has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p data-start="2710" data-end="3146">Since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023, more than 63,000 Palestinians have been killed, nearly all residents have been displaced at least once, and most of Gaza’s buildings have been destroyed or damaged.</p><p data-start="2710" data-end="3146">A UN-backed global hunger monitor has confirmed the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/27/starvation-strategy-how-israel-created-famine-in-gaza">famine</a> in parts of Gaza, a direct result of Israel’s blockade and bombing campaign that has deliberately restricted food, water, and medicine.</p><p data-start="3546" data-end="3789">IAGS has previously recognised genocides in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Armenia, and Myanmar. The UN convention it cites defines genocide as crimes committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.</p><p data-start="3791" data-end="3952">The resolution also said Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023 constituted international crimes but emphasised that these acts do not justify genocide.</p><p data-start="3954" data-end="4132">Hundreds of UN human rights staff last week urged High Commissioner Volker Turk to explicitly label Israel’s campaign as genocide, underscoring growing international consensus.</p></div><div><p>Source: </p><!-- --><p>Al Jazeera and news agencies</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dr Piotr Wozniak, February, 1999 (updated)</p><p>This article will help you overcome one of the greatest difficulties you will face when trying to accelerate learning: formulating knowledge</p><p>The speed of learning will depend on the way you formulate the material. The same material can be learned many times faster if well formulated! The difference in speed can be stunning!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The rules are listed in the order of importance. Those listed first are most often violated or bring most benefit if complied with!</p><p>There is an underlying assumption that you will proceed with learning using spaced repetition, i.e. you will not just learn once but you will repeat the material optimally (as in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a>).</p><p><strong>The 20 rules of formulating knowledge in learning</strong></p><p><strong>1) Do not learn if you do not understand</strong></p><p>Trying to learn things you do not understand may seem like an utmost nonsense. Still, an amazing proportion of students commit the offence of learning without comprehension. Very often they have no other choice! The quality of many textbooks or lecture scripts is deplorable while examination deadlines are unmovable.If you are not a speaker of German, it is still possible to learn a history textbook in German. The book can be crammed word for word. However, the time needed for such “blind learning” is astronomical. Even more important: The value of such knowledge is negligible. If you cram a German book on history, you will still know nothing of history.The German history book example is an extreme. However, the materials you learn may often seem well structured and you may tend to blame yourself for lack of comprehension. Soon you may pollute your learning process with a great deal of useless material that treacherously makes you believe “it will be useful some day”. &nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>2) Learn before you memorize</strong></p><p>Before you proceed with memorizing individual facts and rules, you need to&nbsp;<strong>build an overall picture of the learned knowledge</strong>. Only when individual pieces fit to build a single coherent structure, will you be able to dramatically reduce the learning time. This is closely related to the problem comprehension mentioned in&nbsp;<strong>Rule 1: Do not learn if you do not understand</strong>. A single separated piece of your picture is like a single German word in the textbook of history.Do not start from memorizing loosely related facts! First read a chapter in your book that puts them together (e.g.&nbsp;<em>the principles of the internal combustion engine</em>). Only then proceed with learning using individual questions and answers (e.g.&nbsp;<em>What moves the pistons in the internal combustion engine?</em>), etc.<br></p><p><strong>3) Build upon the basics</strong></p><p>The picture of the learned whole (as discussed in&nbsp;<strong>Rule 2: Learn before you memorize</strong>) does not have to be complete to the last detail. Just the opposite, the simpler the picture the better. The shorter the initial chapter of your book the better. Simple models are easier to comprehend and encompass. You can always build upon them later on.Do not neglect the basics. Memorizing seemingly obvious things is not a waste of time! Basics may also appear volatile and the cost of memorizing easy things is little. Better err on the safe side. Remember that usually you spend 50% of your time repeating just 3-5% of the learned material! Basics are usually easy to retain and take a microscopic proportion of your time. However, each memory lapse on basics can cost you dearly!</p><p><strong>4) <strong>Stick to the&nbsp;minimum information principle</strong></strong></p><p>The material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is</p><ul id="block-3725bb47-719c-491b-836c-4248ad986283"><li><strong>Simple is easy</strong><br>By definition, simple material is easy to remember. This comes from the fact that its simplicity makes is easy for the brain to process it always in the same way. Imagine a labyrinth. When making a repetition of a piece of material, your brain is running through a labyrinth (you can view a neural network as a tangle of paths). While running through the labyrinth, the brain leaves a track on the walls. If it can run in only one unique way, the path is continuous and easy to follow. If there are many combinations, each run may leave a different trace that will interfere with other traces making it difficult to find the exit. The same happens on the cellular level with different synaptic connections being activated at each repetition of complex material</li><li><strong>Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule</strong><br>I assume you will make repetitions of the learned material using optimum inter-repetition intervals (as in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a>). If you consider an item that is composed of two sub-items, you will need to make repetitions that are frequent enough to keep the more difficult item in memory. If you split the complex item into sub-items, each can be repeated at its own pace saving your time. Very often, inexperienced students create items that could easily be split into&nbsp;<strong>ten or more</strong>&nbsp;simpler sub-items! Although the number of items increases, the number of repetitions of each item will usually be small enough to greatly outweigh the cost of (1) forgetting the complex item again and again, (2) repeating it in excessively short intervals or (3) actually remembering it only in part!</li></ul><p>Here is a striking example:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Ill-formulated knowledge – Complex and wordy</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: What are the characteristics of the Dead Sea?<br>A: Salt lake located on the border between Israel and Jordan. Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth’s surface, averaging 396 m below sea level. It is 74 km long. It is seven times as salty (30% by volume) as the ocean. Its density keeps swimmers afloat. Only simple organisms can live in its saline waters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Well-formulated knowledge – Simple and specific</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: Where is the Dead Sea located?<br>A:&nbsp;<strong>on the border between Israel and Jordan</strong><br>Q: What is the lowest point on the Earth’s surface?<br>A:&nbsp;<strong>The Dead Sea shoreline</strong><br>Q: What is the average level on which the Dead Sea is located?<br>A:&nbsp;<strong>400 meters</strong>&nbsp;(below sea level)<br>Q: How long is the Dead Sea?<br>A:&nbsp;<strong>70 km</strong><br>Q: How much saltier is the Dead Sea than the oceans?<br>A:&nbsp;<strong>7 times</strong><br>Q: What is the volume content of salt in the Dead Sea?<br>A:&nbsp;<strong>30%</strong><br>Q: Why can the Dead Sea keep swimmers afloat?<br>A:&nbsp;<strong>due to high salt content</strong><br>Q: Why is the Dead Sea called Dead?<br>A:&nbsp;<strong>because only simple organisms can live in it</strong><br>Q: Why only simple organisms can live in the Dead Sea?<br>A:&nbsp;<strong>because of high salt content</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>You might want to experiment and try to learn two subjects using the two above approaches and see for yourself what advantage is brought by minimum information principle. This is particularly visible in the long perspective, i.e.&nbsp;<strong>the longer the time you need to remember knowledge, the more you benefit from simplifying your items</strong>!</p><p>Note in the example above how short the questions are. Note also that the answers are even shorter! We want a minimum amount of information to be retrieved from memory in a single repetition!&nbsp;<strong>We want answer to be as short as imaginably possible</strong>!</p><p>You will notice that the knowledge learned in the ill-structured example is not entirely equivalent to the well-structured formulation. For example, although you will remember why the Dead Sea can keep swimmers afloat, you may forget that it at all has such a characteristic in the first place! Additionally, rounding 396 to 400 and 74 to 70 produces some loss of information. These can be remedied by adding more questions or making the present ones more precise.</p><p>You will also lose the ability to fluently recite the description of the Dead Sea when called up to the blackboard by your teachers. I bet, however, that shining in front of the class is not your ultimate goal in learning.

For example,&nbsp;<em>Bill …[name] was the second US president to go through impeachment.</em>If you are a beginner and if you find it difficult to stick to the minimum information principle, use cloze deletion! If you are an advanced user, you will also like cloze deletion. It is a quick and effective method of converting textbook knowledge into knowledge that can be subject to learning based on spaced repetition. Cloze deletion makes the core of the fast reading and learning technique called&nbsp;<em>incremental reading</em>.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Ill-formulated knowledge – Complex and wordy</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: What was the history of the Kaleida company?<br>A: Kaleida, funded to the tune of $40 million by Apple Computer and IBM in 1991.

It has been very well developed in the course of evolution and that is why we say&nbsp;<em>one picture is worth a thousand words</em>. Indeed if you look at the number of details kept in a picture and the easiness with which your memory can retain them, you will notice that our verbal processing power is greatly inferior as compared with the visual processing power. The same refers to memory. A graphic representation of information is usually far less volatile.Usually it takes much less time to formulate a simple question-and-answer pair than to find or produce a neat graphic image. This is why you will probably always have to weigh up cost and profits in using graphics in your learning material. Well-employed images will greatly reduce your learning time in areas such as anatomy, geography, geometry, chemistry, history, and many more.The power of imagery explains why the concept of Tony Buzan’s mind maps is so popular. A mind map is an abstract picture in which connections between its components reflect the logical connections between individual concepts.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong><strong>Less beneficial formulation</strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: What African country is located between Kenya, Zambia and Mozambique?A: Tanzania</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Well-formulated knowledge – Simple cloze deletion</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: What African country is marked white on the map?<p><img decoding="async" width="250" height="244" src="https://www.supermemo.com/wp-content/uploads/tanzania-1.gif" alt="afryka"><br>A: Tanzania</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>7) Use&nbsp;mnemonic techniques</strong></p><p>Mnemonic techniques are various techniques that make remembering easier. They are often amazingly effective. For most students, a picture of a 10-year-old memorizing a sequence of 50 playing cards verges on discovering a young genius. It is very surprising then to find out how easy it is to learn the techniques that make it possible with a dose of training. These techniques are available to everyone and do not require any special skills!Before you start believing that mastering such techniques will provide you with an eternal solution to the problem of forgetting, be warned that the true bottleneck towards long-lasting and useful memories is not in quickly memorizing knowledge! This is indeed the easier part. The bottleneck lies in retaining memories for months, years or for lifetime! To accomplish the latter you will need&nbsp;<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a>&nbsp;and the compliance with the 20 rules presented herein.There have been dozens of books written about mnemonic techniques. Probably those written by Tony Buzan are most popular and respected. You can search the web for keywords such as:&nbsp;<em>mind maps, peg lists</em>,&nbsp;<em>mnemonic techniques</em>, etc.Experience shows that with a dose of training you will need to consciously apply mnemonic techniques in only 1-5% of your items. With time, using mnemonic techniques will become automatic!<br>Exemplary mind map:</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="778" height="471" src="https://www.supermemo.com/wp-content/uploads/mindmap.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>(<em>Six Steps&nbsp;</em>mind map generated in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mindman.com/" rel="nofollow">Mind Manager 3.5</a>, imported to SuperMemo 2004, courtesy of John England,&nbsp;<small>TeamLink Australia)</small></figcaption></figure><ol start="8"></ol><p><strong>8) Graphic deletion&nbsp;is as good as cloze deletion</strong></p><p>Graphic deletion works like&nbsp;cloze deletion&nbsp;but instead of a missing phrase it uses a missing image component. For example, when learning anatomy, you might present a complex illustration. Only a small part of it would be missing. The student’s job is to name the missing area. The same illustration can be used to formulate 10-20 items! Each item can ask about a specific subcomponent of the image. Graphic deletion works great in learning geography!Exemplary graphic deletion:</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="822" height="500" src="https://www.supermemo.com/wp-content/uploads/element.jpg" alt=""></figure><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>SuperMemo 2000/2002</strong></td><td><strong>SuperMemo 99</strong></td></tr><tr><td>This is how you can quickly generate graphic deletion using a picture from the clipboard:<p>1.

For example, a set of fruits might be an apple, a pear and a peach. A classic example of an item that is difficult to learn is an item that asks for the list of the members of a set. For example:&nbsp;<em>What countries belong to the European Union?</em>&nbsp;You should avoid such items whenever possible due to the high cost of retaining memories based on sets. If sets are absolutely necessary, you should always try to convert them into&nbsp;enumerations. Enumerations are ordered lists of members (for example, the alphabetical list of the members of the EU). Enumerations are also hard to remember and should be avoided. However, the great advantage of enumerations over sets is that they are ordered and they force the brain to list them always in the same order. An ordered list of countries contains more information than the set of countries that can be listed in any order. Paradoxically, despite containing more information, enumerations are easier to remember. The reason for this has been discussed earlier in the context of the&nbsp;minimum information principle:&nbsp;<strong>you should always try to make sure your brain works in the exactly same way at each repetition</strong>. In the case of sets, listing members in varying order at each repetition has a disastrous effect on memory. It is nearly impossible to memorize sets containing more than five members without the use of mnemonic techniques, enumeration, grouping, etc. Despite this claim, you will often succeed due to subconsciously mastered techniques that help you go around this problem. Those techniques, however, will fail you all too often. For that reason:&nbsp;<strong>Avoid sets!&nbsp;</strong>If you need them badly, convert them into enumerations and use&nbsp;techniques for dealing with enumerations</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Ill-formulated knowledge – Sets are unacceptable!</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q:&nbsp;What countries belong to the European Union&nbsp;(2002)?<br>A: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.</td></tr><tr><td><strong><strong>Well-formulated knowledge – Converting a set into a meaningful listing</strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: Which country hosted a meeting to consider the creation of a European Community of Defence in 1951?<br>A: France<br>Q: Which countries apart from France joined the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952?<br>A: Germany, Italy and the Benelux<br>Q: What countries make up the Benelux?<br>A: Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands<br>Q: Whose membership did Charles de Gaulle oppose in the 1960s?<br>A: that of UK<br>Q: Which countries joined the EEC along the UK in 1973?<br>A: Ireland and Denmark<br>Q: Which country joined the EEC in 1981?<br>A: Greece<br>Q: Which countries joined the EEC in 1986?<br>A: Spain and Portugal<br>Q: Which countries joined the EU in 1995?<br>A: Austria, Sweden and Finland<br>Q: What was the historic course of expansion of the European Union membership?<br>A: (1) France and (2) Germany, Italy and the Benelux, (3) UK and (4) Ireland and Denmark, (5) Greece, (6) Spain and Portugal and (7) Austria, Sweden and Finland</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Note that in the example above, we converted a 15-member set into 9 items, five of which are 2-3 member sets, and one is a six member enumeration. Put it to your SuperMemo, and see how easy it is to generate the list of the European Union members using the historic timeline! Note the tricks used with France and the UK. They joined the union in the company of others but have been listed as separate items to simplify the learning process. Note also that the sum of information included in this well-formulated approach is far greater than that of the original set. Thus along simplicity, we gained some useful knowledge. All individual items effectively comply with the&nbsp;minimum information principle! You could go further by trying to split the Germany-Italy-Benelux set or using mnemonic techniques to memorize the final seven-member enumeration (i.e. the last of the questions above). However, you should take those steps only if you have any problems with retaining the proposed set in memory.<br></p><ol start="10"></ol><p><strong>10) Avoid enumerations</strong></p><p>Enumerations are also an example of classic items that are hard to learn. They are still far more acceptable than sets. Avoid enumerations wherever you can. If you cannot avoid them, deal with them using&nbsp;cloze deletions&nbsp;(overlapping cloze deletions if possible). Learning the alphabet can be a good example of an overlapping cloze deletion:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Hard to learn item</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet?<br>A: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Easy to learn items</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: What three letters does the alphabet begin with?<br>A: ABCQ: Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet A … … … E<br>A: B, C, D<br>Q: Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet B … … … F<br>A: C, D, E<br>Q: Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet C … … … G<br>A: D, E, F</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The above items will make learning the alphabet much faster. The greatest advantage of the above approach is that is it easier for psychological reasons: the student does not have to stop repetitions to recite the whole sequence and can only focus on a small part of the learned material. Still it is recommended that he recite the whole alphabet&nbsp;<strong>after</strong>&nbsp;making the repetition. However, once all individual pieces are well remembered, reciting the whole should be a pleasant and speedy action that produces little frustration.<br>The cloze deletion used above is an overlapping cloze deletion, i.e. the same parts of the enumeration are strengthened in memory using different items (for example, the sequence C-D will be needed to recall the second and the third item). This redundancy does not contradict the&nbsp;minimum information principle&nbsp;because&nbsp;<strong>the extra information is added in extra items</strong>.</p><p>You can also deal with enumerations by using grouping like in the case of sets (see the&nbsp;European Union example) but cloze deletions should be simpler and should suffice in most cases.<br>Learning poems is an example of learning enumerations (all words and sentences have to be uttered in a predefined sequence); however, due to strong semantic connections, the rhyme and the rhythm, it may often be possible to effectively remember poems without using cloze deletion and without the frustration of forgetting small subcomponents again and again. However, once you notice you stumble with your poem, you should dismember it using cloze deletion and thus make sure that the learning is fast, easy, effective and pleasurable<br></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>A poem that is hard to remember</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: The credit belongs … (<a href="http://www.dropbears.com/b/broughsbooks/qtroosevelt.htm" rel="nofollow">Teddy Roosevelt</a>)<br>A: The credit belongs to the man who’s actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat; a man who knows the great enthusiasm and the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who in the end knows the triumph of high achievement, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A poem split into easy items</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: The credit belongs … (<a href="http://www.dropbears.com/b/broughsbooks/qtroosevelt.htm" rel="nofollow">Teddy Roosevelt</a>)<br>A: to the man who’s actually in the arena<br>Q: The credit belongs to the man who’s actually in the arena …<br>A: whose face is marred by dust and sweat (a man who knows the great enthusiasm)<br>Q: whose face is marred by dust and sweat … (The credit belongs)<br>A: a man who knows the great enthusiasm and the great devotions (who spends himself in a worthy cause)<br>Q: a man who knows the great enthusiasm and the great devotions … (The credit belongs)<br>A: who spends himself in a worthy cause (who in the end knows the triumph of high achievement)<br>Q: who spends himself in a worthy cause … (The credit belongs)<br>A: who in the end knows the triumph of high achievement (so that his place shall never be), etc. etc.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Does it all sound artificial? It does! But you will never know how effective this approach is until you try it by yourself!</p><p><strong>11) <strong>Combat&nbsp;interference</strong></strong></p><p>When you learn about similar things you often confuse them. For example, you may have problems distinguishing between the meanings of the words&nbsp;<em>historic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>historical</em>. This will even be more visible if you memorize lots of numbers, e.g. optimum dosages of drugs in pharmacotherapy. If knowledge of one item makes it harder to remember another item, we have a case of&nbsp;<strong>memory interference</strong>. You can often remember an item for years with straight excellent grades until … you memorize another item that makes it nearly impossible to remember either! For example, if you learn geography and you memorize that the country located between Venezuela, Suriname and Brazil is Guyana, you are likely to easily recall this fact for years with just a couple of repetitions. However, once you add similar items asking about the location of all these countries, and French Guyana, and Colombia and more, you will suddenly notice strong memory interference and you may experience unexpected forgetting. In simple terms: you will get confused about what is what.<br>Interference is probably the single greatest cause of forgetting in collections of an experienced user of SuperMemo. You can never be sure when it strikes, and the only hermetic procedure against it is to&nbsp;<strong>detect and eliminate</strong>. In other words, in many cases it may be impossible to predict interference at the moment of formulating knowledge. Interference can also occur between remotely related items like Guyana, Guyard and Guyenne, as well as Guyana, kayman and … aspirin. It may work differently for you and for your colleague. It very hard to predict.Still you should do your best to prevent interference before it takes its toll. This will make your learning process less stressful and mentally bearable. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>make items as unambiguous as possible</li><li>stick to the&nbsp;minimum information principle&nbsp;(many of the remaining rules in this text are based on avoiding interference!)</li><li>eliminate interference as soon as you spot it, i.e. before it becomes your obsession (e.g. as soon as you see the word&nbsp;<strong><em>inept</em></strong>&nbsp;you think “<em>I know the meanings of&nbsp;<strong>inept</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>inapt</strong>&nbsp;but I will never know which is which!”</em>)</li><li>in SuperMemo use&nbsp;<strong>View&nbsp;:&nbsp;Other browsers :&nbsp;Leeches</strong><em>(Shift+F3</em>) to regularly review and&nbsp;<strong>eliminate&nbsp;</strong>most difficult items</li><li>read more:&nbsp;Memory interference</li></ul><p><strong>12) Optimize wording</strong></p><p>The wording of your items must be optimized to make sure that in minimum time the right bulb in your brain lights up. This will reduce error rates, increase specificity, reduce response time, and help your concentration.<strong>Less optimum item: cloze deletion that is too wordy</strong>Q: Aldus invented desktop publishing in 1985 with PageMaker.

During repetition you are only supposed to learn the name:&nbsp;<em>Quark</em>. You should not hope that the trailing messages on the ownership of PageMaker and the year of its development will somehow trickle to your memory as a side effect. You should decide if the other pieces of information are important to you and if so, store them in separate items (perhaps reusing the above text, employing cloze deletion again and optimizing the wording in a new way). Otherwise the redundant information will only slow down your learning process!</p><p><strong>13) Refer to other memories</strong></p><p>Referring to other memories can place your item in a better context, simplify wording, and reduce interference. In the example below, using the words&nbsp;<em>humble</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>supplicant</em>&nbsp;helps the student focus on the word&nbsp;<em>shamelessly</em>&nbsp;and thus strengthen the correct semantics. Better focus helps eliminating interference. Secondly, the use of the words&nbsp;<em>humble</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>supplicant</em>&nbsp;makes it possible to avoid interference of&nbsp;<em>cringing&nbsp;</em>with these words themselves. Finally, the proposed wording is shorter and more specific. Naturally, the rules&nbsp;basics-to-details&nbsp;and&nbsp;do not learn what you do not understand&nbsp;require that the words&nbsp;<em>humble</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>supplicant</em>&nbsp;be learned beforehand (or at least at the same time)</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Item subject to strong interference</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: derog: adj: shamelessly conscious of one’s failings and asking in a begging way<br>A: cringing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Item that uses interfering memories to amplify the correct meaning</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: derog: adj: shamelessly humble and supplicant<br>A: cringing</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>14) Personalize and provide examples</strong></p><p>One of the most effective ways of enhancing memories is to provide them with a link to your personal life. In the example below you will save time if you use a personal reference rather than trying to paint a picture that would aptly illustrate the question</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Item subject to strong interference</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: What is the name of a soft bed without arms or back?<br>A: divan</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Item that uses interfering memories to amplify the correct meaning</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: What is the name of a soft bed without arms or back? (like the one at Robert’s parents)<br>A: divan</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>If you remember exactly what kind of soft bed can be found in Robert’s parents’ apartment you will save time by not having to dig exactly into the semantics of the definition and/or looking for an appropriate graphic illustration for the piece of furniture in question. Personalized examples are very resistant to&nbsp;interference&nbsp;and can greatly reduce your learning time</p><p><strong>15) Rely on emotional states</strong></p><p>If you can illustrate your items with examples that are vivid or even shocking, you are likely to enhance retrieval (as long as you do not overuse same tools and fall victim of interference!). Your items may assume bizarre form; however, as long as they are produced for your private consumption, the end justifies the means. Use objects that evoke very specific and strong emotions: love, sex, war, your late relative, object of your infatuation, Linda Tripp, Nelson Mandela, etc. It is well known that emotional states can facilitate recall; however, you should make sure that you are not deprived of the said emotional clues at the moment when you need to retrieve a given memory in a real-life situation</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Harder item</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: a light and joking conversation<br>A: banter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Easier item</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: a light and joking conversation (e.g. Mandela and de Klerk in 1992)<br>A: banter</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>If you have vivid and positive memories related to the meetings between Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk, you are likely to quickly grasp the meaning of the definition of banter. Without the example you might struggle with interference from words such as&nbsp;<em>badinage&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<em>chat</em>. There is no risk of irrelevant emotional state in this example as the state helps to define the semantics of the learned concept! A well-thought example can often reduce your learning time several times! I have recorded examples in which an item without an example was forgotten 20 times within one year, while the same item with a subtle interference-busting example was not forgotten even once in ten repetitions spread over five years. This is roughly equivalent to&nbsp;<strong>25-fold saving in time in the period of 20 years</strong>! Such examples are not rare! They are most effectively handled with the all the preceding rules targeted on&nbsp;simplicity&nbsp;and against the&nbsp;interference</p><p><strong>16) Context cues&nbsp;simplify wording</strong></p><p>You can use&nbsp;categories&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en">SuperMemo 2000/2002</a>, provide different branches of knowledge with a different look (different&nbsp;template), use reference labels (<em>Title, Author, Date,</em>&nbsp;etc.) and clearly label subcategories (e.g. with strings such as&nbsp;<em>chem</em>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>chemistry</em>,&nbsp;<em>math</em>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>mathematics</em>, etc.). This will help you simplify the wording of your items as you will be relieved from the need to specify the context of your question. In the example below, the well-defined prefix&nbsp;<em>bioch:&nbsp;</em>saves you a lot of typing and a lot of reading while still making sure you do not confuse the abbreviation GRE with Graduate Record Examination. Note that in the recommended case, you process the item starting from the label&nbsp;<em>bioch</em>&nbsp;which puts your brain immediately in the right context. While processing the lesser optimum case, you will waste precious milliseconds on flashing the standard meaning of GRE and … what is worse … you will light up the wrong areas of your brain that will now perhaps be prone to interference!<br></p><ol start="16"></ol><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Wordy item can cause accidental lapses through interference</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: What does GRE stand for in biochemistry?<br>A: glucocorticoid response element</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Context-labeled items increase success rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q: bioch: GRE<br>A: glucocorticoid response element</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>17) Redundancy&nbsp;does not contradict minimum information principle</strong></p><p><strong>Redundancy</strong>&nbsp;in simple terms is more information than needed or duplicate information, etc. Redundancy does not have to contradict the&nbsp;minimum information principle&nbsp;and may even be welcome. The problem of redundancy is too wide for this short text. Here are some examples that are only to illustrate that&nbsp;<em>minimum information principle</em>&nbsp;cannot be understood as&nbsp;<em>minimum number of characters or bits in your collections or even items</em>:</p><ul id="block-7dea242e-6ce5-4331-8f91-6a847729a574"><li><strong>passive and active approach</strong>: if you learn a foreign language, e.g. Esperanto, you will often build word pairs such as&nbsp;<em>phone-telefono, language-lingvo, hope-esperanto,&nbsp;</em>etc. These pairs require active recall of the foreign word. Active recall does not, however, guarantee passive recognition and you may fail with&nbsp;<em>telefono-phone, lingvo-language,&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>esperanto-hope.&nbsp;</em>Adding new elements with swapped questions and answers may in some cases be redundant but it does not contradict the minimum information principle! Your items are still as simple as possible. You just get more of themIn&nbsp;<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en">SuperMemo 2000/2002</a>, you can quickly generate swapped word-pair items with&nbsp;<strong>Duplicate&nbsp;</strong>(<em>Ctrl+Alt+D</em>) and&nbsp;<strong>Swap&nbsp;</strong><em>(Ctrl+Shift+S)</em></li><li><strong>reasoning cues</strong>: you will often want to boost your reasoning ability by asking about a solution to the problem. Instead of just&nbsp;<em>memorizing</em>&nbsp;the answer you would like to quickly follow the reasoning steps (e.g. solve a simple mathematical equation) and&nbsp;<em>generate</em>&nbsp;the answer. In such a case, providing the hint on the reasoning steps in the answer will only serve helping you always follow the right path at repetitions</li><li><strong>derivation steps</strong>: in more complex problems to solve, memorizing individual derivation steps is always highly recommended (e.g. solving complex mathematical problems). It is not cramming! It is making sure that the brain can always follow the fastest path while solving the problem. For more on boosting creativity and intelligence read:&nbsp;Roots of genius and creativity, as well as more specific:&nbsp;Derivation, reasoning and intelligence</li><li><strong>multiple semantic representation</strong>: very often the same knowledge can be represented and viewed from different angles. Memorizing different representations of the same fact or rule is recommended in cases where a given memory is of high value. This will increase the expected recall rate (beyond that specified with the&nbsp;forgetting index)!</li><li><strong>flexible repetition</strong>: if there are many valid responses to the same question make sure that your representation makes it possible to identify the equivalence and reward you with good grades by providing just one of the equivalent choices. For example, if you learn a language, it rarely make sense to learn all synonyms that meet a definition of a concept. It is more adequate to consider a single synonym as the sufficient answer (e.g.&nbsp;<em>a mark made by ink spilt on sth</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>blot/blob/blotch</em>)</li><li>more</li></ul><p><strong>18) Provide&nbsp;sources</strong></p><p>Except for well-tested and proven knowledge (such as&nbsp;<em>2+2=4</em>), it is highly recommended that you include sources from which you have gathered your knowledge. In real-life situation you will often be confronted with challenges to your knowledge. Sources can come to your rescue. You will also find that facts and figures differ depending on the source. You can really be surprised how frivolously reputable information agencies publish figures that are drastically different from other equally reputable sources. Without SuperMemo, those discrepancies are often difficult to notice: before you encounter the new fact, the old one is often long forgotten. With sources provided, you will be able to make more educated choices on which pieces of information are more reliable. Adding reliability labels may also be helpful (e.g.&nbsp;<em>Watch out!, Other sources differ!</em>, etc.). Sources should accompany your items but should not be part of the learned knowledge (unless it is critical for you to be able to recall the source whenever asked).</p><p><strong>19) Provide&nbsp;date stamping</strong></p><p>Knowledge can be relatively stable (basic math, anatomy, taxonomy, physical geography, etc.) and highly volatile (economic indicators, high-tech knowledge, personal statistics, etc.). It is important that you provide your items with time stamping or other tags indicating the degree of obsolescence. In case of statistical figures, you might stamp them with the year they have been collected. When learning software applications, it is enough you stamp the item with the software version. Once you have newer figures you can update your items. Unfortunately, in most cases you will have to re-memorize knowledge that became outdated. Date stamping is useful in editing and verifying your knowledge; however, you will rarely want to memorize stamping itself. If you would like to remember the changes of a given figure in time (e.g. GNP figures over a number of years), the date stamping becomes the learned knowledge itself.</p><p><strong>20) Prioritize</strong></p><p>You will always face far more knowledge that you will be able to master. That is why prioritizing is critical for building quality knowledge in the long-term. The way you prioritize will affect the way your knowledge slots in. This will also affect the speed of learning (e.g. see:&nbsp;learn basics first). There are many stages at which prioritizing will take place; only few are relevant to knowledge representation, but all are important:</p><ol><li><strong>Prioritizing sources&nbsp;</strong>– there will always be a number of sources of your knowledge. If you are still at student years: these will most likely be books and notes pertaining to different subjects. Otherwise you will probably rely more on journals, Internet, TV, newspapers, encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc. It is always worth being aware what is the optimum proportion of time devoted to those varied sources. As you progress with learning, you will quickly develop a good sense of which learning slots bring better results and which might be extended at the cost of others</li><li><strong>Extracting knowledge&nbsp;</strong>– unless you are about to pass an important exam, it nearly never makes sense to memorize whole books or whole articles. You will need to extract those parts that are most likely to impact the quality of your knowledge. You can do it by (1) marking paragraphs in a book or journal, (2) pasting relevant web pages to SuperMemo, (3) pasting relevant passages to SuperMemo, (4) typing facts and figures directly to SuperMemo notes, etc. You will need some experience before you can accurately measure how much knowledge you can indeed transfer to your brain and what degree of detail you can feasibly master. Your best way to prioritize the flow of knowledge into your memory is to use&nbsp;incremental reading&nbsp;tools</li><li><strong>Transferring knowledge to SuperMemo&nbsp;</strong>– you may try to stick with the 20 rules of formulating knowledge at the moment of introducing your material to SuperMemo. However, you can also literally transfer your notes or import whole files and later use the mechanisms provided by SuperMemo to determine the order of processing the imported material. Probably the best criterion for choosing between formulating or just importing is the time needed for accurately formulating the item or items. If formulation requires more knowledge, more time, comparing with other sources, etc. you can just import. Otherwise, if you believe that formulating an accurate item is a matter of seconds, formulate it</li><li><strong>Formulating items&nbsp;</strong>– make sure that explanatory or optional components of the answer are placed in the parentheses so that your attention is focused on the most important part of the item. The parts in the parentheses can be read after the repetition to strengthen the memory in its context</li><li><strong>Using forgetting index&nbsp;</strong>– you can use the&nbsp;forgetting index&nbsp;to prioritize pending items. The sequence of repetitions will naturally be determined by SuperMemo; however, you can request higher retention level for items that are more important and lower retention level for items of lower priority</li><li><strong>Learning&nbsp;</strong>– the process of prioritizing does not end with the onset of repetitions. Here are the tools you can use to continue setting your priorities while the learning process is under way:<ul><li><strong>Remember&nbsp;</strong>(<em>Ctrl+M</em>) – re-memorize items of high priority that have changed or which are extremely important to your knowledge at a given moment. If you choose&nbsp;<em>Ctrl+M&nbsp;</em>you will be able to determine the next interval for the currently reviewed item (its repetition counter will be reset to zero). It is recommended that you always re-memorize items whose content has changed significantly</li><li><strong>Reschedule&nbsp;</strong>(<em>Ctrl+J</em>) – manually schedule the date of the next repetition</li><li><strong>Execute repetition</strong>&nbsp;(<em>Ctrl+Shift+R</em>) – manually execute a repetition even before the repetition’s due date (e.g. when reviewing particularly important material)</li><li><strong>Forget</strong>&nbsp;(<em>Ctrl+R</em>)- remove the current item from the learning process and place it at the end of the&nbsp;pending queue</li><li><strong>Dismiss&nbsp;</strong>(<em>Ctrl+D</em>)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>– ignore the current item in the learning process altogether</li><li><strong>Delete&nbsp;</strong>(<em>Ctrl+Shift+Del</em>) – remove the current item from your collection</li><li>Change the forgetting index of memorized items or change the ordinal of pending items (<em>Ctrl+Shift+P</em>)</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Here again are the twenty rules of formulating knowledge. You will notice that the first 16 rules revolve around making memories simple! Some of the rules strongly overlap. For example: do not learn if you do not understand is a form of applying the minimum information principle which again is a way of making things simple:</p><ol><li><strong>Do not learn if you do not understand</strong></li><li><strong>Learn before you memorize&nbsp;</strong>– build the picture of the whole before you dismember it into simple items in SuperMemo. If the whole shows holes, review it again!</li><li><strong>Build upon the basics&nbsp;</strong>– never jump both feet into a complex manual because you may never see the end. Well remembered basics will help the remaining knowledge easily fit in</li><li><strong>Stick to the minimum information principle</strong>&nbsp;– if you continue forgetting an item, try to make it as simple as possible. If it does not help, see the remaining rules (cloze deletion, graphics, mnemonic techniques, converting sets into enumerations, etc.)</li><li><strong>Cloze deletion is easy and effective&nbsp;</strong>– completing a deleted word or phrase is not only an effective way of learning. Most of all, it greatly speeds up formulating knowledge and is highly recommended for beginners</li><li><strong>Use imagery&nbsp;</strong>– a picture is worth a thousand words</li><li><strong>Use mnemonic techniques&nbsp;</strong>– read about peg lists and mind maps. Study the books by Tony Buzan. Learn how to convert memories into funny pictures. You won’t have problems with phone numbers and complex figures</li><li><strong>Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion&nbsp;</strong>– obstructing parts of a picture is great for learning anatomy, geography and more</li><li><strong>Avoid sets&nbsp;</strong>– larger sets are virtually un-memorizable unless you convert them into enumerations!</li><li><strong>Avoid enumerations&nbsp;</strong>– enumerations are also hard to remember but can be dealt with using cloze deletion</li><li><strong>Combat interference&nbsp;</strong>– even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life</li><li><strong>Optimize wording&nbsp;</strong>– like you reduce mathematical equations, you can reduce complex sentences into smart, compact and enjoyable maxims</li><li><strong>Refer to other memories&nbsp;</strong>– building memories on other memories generates a coherent and hermetic structure that forgetting is less likely to affect. Build upon the basics and use planned redundancy to fill in the gaps</li><li><strong>Personalize and provide examples&nbsp;</strong>– personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories</li><li><strong>Rely on emotional states&nbsp;</strong>– emotions are related to memories. If you learn a fact in the sate of sadness, you are more likely to recall it if when you are sad. Some memories can induce emotions and help you employ this property of the brain in remembering</li><li><strong>Context cues simplify wording&nbsp;</strong>– providing context is a way of simplifying memories, building upon earlier knowledge and avoiding interference</li><li><strong>Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle&nbsp;</strong>– some forms of redundancy are welcome. There is little harm in memorizing the same fact as viewed from different angles. Passive and active approach is particularly practicable in learning word-pairs. Memorizing derivation steps in problem solving is a way towards boosting your intellectual powers!</li><li><strong>Provide sources&nbsp;</strong>– sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance</li><li><strong>Provide date stamping&nbsp;</strong>– time stamping is useful for volatile knowledge that changes in time</li><li><strong>Prioritize</strong>&nbsp;– effective learning is all about prioritizing. In&nbsp;<em>incremental&nbsp;reading</em>&nbsp;you can start from badly formulated knowledge and improve its shape as you proceed with learning (in proportion to the cost of inappropriate formulation). If need be, you can review pieces of knowledge again, split it into parts, reformulate, reprioritize, or delete.

    <p>When I started building Bear I made the code available under an <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit" target="_blank">MIT license</a>. I didn't give it much thought at the time, but knew that I wanted the code to be available for people to learn from, and to make it easily auditable so users could validate claims I have made about the privacy and security of the platform.</p>
<p>Unfortunately over the years there have been cases of people forking the project in the attempt to set up a competing service. And it hurts. It hurts to see something you've worked so hard on for so long get copied and distributed with only a few hours of modification. It hurts to have poured so much love into a piece of software to see it turned against you and threaten your livelihood. It hurts to believe in open-source and then be bitten by it.</p>
<p>After the last instance of this I have come to the difficult decision to change Bear's license from MIT to a version of copyleft called the Elastic License—created by the Elastic Search people.</p>
<p>This license is almost identical to the MIT license but with the stipulation that the software cannot be provided as a hosted or managed service. You can view the specific wording <a href="https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/blob/master/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>After spending time researching how other projects are handling this, I realise I'm not alone. Many other open-source projects have updated their licenses to prevent "free-ride competition" in the past few years.<sup><a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-licenses" target="_blank">1</a><a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom" target="_blank">2</a><a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2021/04/20/grafana-loki-tempo-relicensing-to-agplv3/" target="_blank">3</a><a href="https://snowplow.io/blog/introducing-snowplow-limited-use-license" target="_blank">4</a><a href="https://www.scylladb.com/2024/12/18/why-were-moving-to-a-source-available-license/" target="_blank">5</a><a href="https://blog.sentry.io/introducing-the-functional-source-license-freedom-without-free-riding/" target="_blank">6</a></sup></p>
<p>We're entering a new age of AI powered coding, where creating a competing product only involves typing "Create a fork of this repo and change its name to something cool and deploy it on an EC2 instance".</p>
<p>While Bear's code is good, what makes the platform special is the <a href="https://bearblog.dev/discover/" target="_blank">people who use it</a>, and the <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/manifesto/" target="_blank">commitment to longevity</a>.</p>
<p>I will ensure the platform is taken care of, even if it means backtracking on what people can do with the code itself.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/">https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45091493">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><strong>TLDR: In two years we plan to turn CocoaPods trunk to be read-only. At that point, no new versions or pods will be added to trunk.</strong> - Note, this post has been updated in May 2025.</p>

<p>Last month I wrote about how CocoaPods is currently being maintained, I also noted that we were discussing converting the main CocoaPods spec repo "trunk" to be read-only:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are discussing that on a very long, multi-year, basis we can drastically simplify the security of CocoaPods trunk by converting the Specs Repo to be read-only. Infrastructure like the Specs repo and the CDN would still operate as long as GitHub and jsDelivr continue to exist, which is pretty likely to be a very long time. <strong>This will keep all existing builds working</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I plan to implement the read-only mode so that when someone submits a new Podspec to CocoaPods, it will always be denied at the server level. I would then convert the "CocoaPods/Specs" repo to be marked as "Archived" on GitHub which should cover all of our bases.</p>

<p>Making the switch will not break builds for people using CocoaPods in 2026 onwards, but at that point, you're not getting any more updates to dependencies which come though CocoaPods trunk. This shouldn't affect people who use CocoaPods with their own specs repos, or have all of their dependencies vendored (e.g. they all come from npm.)</p>

<p><em>May 2025</em> Update: Since this post was originally written, we've had enough security researchers abusing scripting capabilities in CocoaPods that we are now introducing a block on allowing new CocoaPods to use the <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#prepare_command"><code>prepare_command</code></a> field in a Podspec. Any existing Pods using <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#prepare_command"><code>prepare_command</code></a> are hard-coded to bypass this check.</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

<p>My goal is to send 2 very hard-to-miss notifications en-masse, and then do a test run a month before the final shutdown.</p>

<h3 id="may-2025">May 2025</h3>

<p>We are stopping new CocoaPods from being added which use the <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#prepare_command"><code>prepare_command</code></a> field</p>

<h3 id="mid-late-2025">Mid-late 2025</h3>

<p>I will email all email addresses for people who have contributed a Podspec, informing them of the impending switch to read-only, and linking them to this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="september-october-2026">September-October 2026</h3>

<p>I will, again, email all email addresses for people who have contributed a Podspec, informing them of the impending switch to read-only, and linking them to this blog post, noting that they have roughly a month before we do a test run of going read-only.</p>

<h3 id="november-1-7th-2026">November 1-7th 2026</h3>

<p>I will trigger a test run, giving automation a chance to break early</p>

<h3 id="december-2nd-2026">December 2nd 2026</h3>

<p>I will switch trunk to not accept new Podspecs permanently. This is a Wednesday after American Thanksgiving, so I think folks won't be in rush mode.</p>



<p>These dates are not set in stone, and maybe someone out there has a good reason for us to amend the timeline. I don't think I'm amenable to moving it forwards, but within reason there's space for backwards.</p>
